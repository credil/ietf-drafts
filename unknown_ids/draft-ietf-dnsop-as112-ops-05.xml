  <abstract>
    <t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses
      that are not globally-unique.  Examples are the addresses
      designated in RFC1918 for private use within individual
      sites.</t>

    <t>Devices in such environments may occasionally originate
      Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups")
      corresponding to those private-use addresses. Since the
      addresses concerned have only local significance, it is good
      practice for site administrators to ensure that such queries are
      answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries
      to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead
      of being answered within the site.</t>

    <t>It is not possible for public DNS servers to give
      useful answers to such queries. In addition, due to the
      wide deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing
      growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large
      and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed
      sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the
      root and IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.</t>

    <t>The AS112 project is named after the Autonomous System

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4
        addresses that are not globally unique.  Examples are the
        addresses designated in <xref target="RFC1918"/> for private
        use within individual sites.</t>
        
      <t>Devices in such environments may occasionally originate
	Domain Name System (DNS) <xref target="RFC1034"/>
        queries (so-called "reverse lookups") corresponding
	to those private-use addresses. Since the addresses concerned
	have only local significance, it is good practice for site
	administrators to ensure that such queries are answered locally
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones"/>.
	However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the
	normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being
	answered within the site.</t>

      <t>It is not possible for public DNS servers to give
	useful answers to such queries. In addition, due to the
	wide deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing
	growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large
	and growing. The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed
	sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the
	root and IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.</t>

      <t>The AS112 project encompasses a loosely-coordinated
	collection of independently-operated nameservers. Each
	nameserver functions as a single node in an AS112 <xref
	target="RFC4786">anycast cloud</xref>, and
	is configured to answer authoritatively for a particular
	set of nominated zones.</t>

      <t>The AS112 project is named after the Autonomous System
        Number (ASN) that was assigned to it.</t>

    <section title="AS112 DNS Service">
      <section title="Zones" anchor="zones">
        <t>AS112 nameservers answer authoritatively for the following
          zones, corresponding to <xref target="RFC1918"/> private-use
          netblocks:
  
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>10.IN-ADDR.ARPA</t>
            <t>16.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA, 17.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA, ...,

            <t>168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA</t>
          </list>

          and the following zone, corresponding to the "link local"
          netblock 169.254.0.0/16 listed in <xref target="RFC3330"/>:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>254.169.IN-ADDR.ARPA</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>To aid identification of AS112 anycast nodes, each
	  node also answers authoritatively for the zone
	  HOSTNAME.AS112.NET. See <xref target="dns"/> for the
          recommended contents of that zone.</t>

	<t>It is possible that other zones corresponding to private-use
	  infrastructure will be delegated to AS112 servers in the
	  future. A list of zones for which AS112 servers answer
	  authoritatively is maintained at <eref
	  target="http://www.as112.net/"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Nameservers" anchor="nameservers">
        <t>The zones listed in <xref target="zones"/> are delegated to
	  the two nameservers BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.6)
	  and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.42).</t>

        <t>Additionally, the server PRISONER.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.1)
	  is listed in MNAME field of the SOA records of zones
	  served by AS112 nameservers, and receives mainly dynamic
	  update queries.</t>

	<t>The addresses of all these nameservers are covered by
	  the single IPv4 prefix 192.175.48.0/24.</t>

    <section title="Installation of a New Node">
      <section title="Useful Background Knowledge">
	<t>Installation of an AS112 node is relatively straightforward.
	  However, experience in the following general areas may
	  prove useful:

          <list style="symbols">
	    <t>Inter-domain routing with <xref
	      target="RFC4271">BGP</xref>;</t>

            <t>DNS authoritative server operations;</t>

            <t>Anycast distribution of DNS services
              (<xref target="ISC-TN-2003-1"/>,
              <xref target="RFC4786"/>).</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Topological Location">
	<t>AS112 nodes may be located anywhere on the Internet. For
	  nodes which are intended to provide a public service to
	  the Internet community (as opposed to private use), it
	  may well be advantageous to choose a location that is
	  easily (and cheaply) reachable by multiple providers,
	  such as an Internet exchange point.</t>

        <t>AS112 nodes may advertise their service prefix to BGP
          peers for local use (analogous to a conventional peering
          relationship between two providers) or for global use
          (analogous to a customer relationship with one or more
          providers).</t>

        <t>It is good operational practice to notify the community
          of users which may fall within the reach of a new AS112 node
          before it is installed. At an Internet Exchange, local
          mailing lists usually exist to facilitate such announcements.
          For nodes which are intended to be globally reachable,
          coordination with other AS112 operators is highly recommended.
          See also <xref target="communications"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operating System and Host Considerations">
        <t>The use of a UNIX or UNIX-like operating system (e.g.
          FreeBSD, Linux) is recommended for the construction of
          AS112 nodes, primarily due to the cumulative experience of
          using such platforms for this purpose. Examples in this
          document will assume use of such an operating system.</t>

        <t>The chosen platform should include support for either
          cloned loopback interfaces, or the capability to bind
	  multiple addresses to a single loopback interface. The
	  addresses of the nameservers listed in <xref
	  target="nameservers"/> will be configured on these
	  interfaces in order that the DNS software can respond to
	  queries properly.</t>

        <t>A host which is configured to act as an AS112 anycast
          node should be dedicated to that purpose, and should not be
          used to simultaneously provide other services.</t>

        <t>System startup scripts should be arranged such that the
          various AS112-related components start automatically following
          a system reboot. The order in which interfaces are configured
          and software components started should be arranged such that
          routing software startup follows DNS software startup, and
          DNS software startup follows loopback interface configuration.</t>

        <t>Wrapper scripts or other arrangements should be employed to
          ensure that the anycast service prefix for AS112 is not advertised
          while either the anycast addresses are not configured, or while
          the DNS software is not running.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Software">
        <t>AS112 nodes signal the availability of AS112 nameservers to
          the Internet using <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref>: each
          AS112 node is a BGP speaker, and announces the prefix
          192.175.48.0/24 to the Internet with origin AS 112
          (see also <xref target="nameservers"/>).</t>

        <t>Suitable choices of free software to allow hosts to
          act as BGP speakers include, but are not limited to:

          <list style="symbols">

	</t>

        <t>The examples in this document are based on Quagga.</t>

	<t>The "bgpd.conf" file is used by Quagga's bgpd daemon, which
	  provides BGP protocol support. The router id in this example
	  is 203.0.113.1; the AS112 node peers with external
	  peers 192.0.2.1 and 192.0.2.2.  Note the local AS number
	  112, and the origination of the prefix 192.175.48.0/24.</t>

      <section title="DNS Software" anchor="dns">
        <t>Although the queries received by AS112 nodes are
          definitively misdirected, it is important that they be
	  answered in a manner which is accurate and consistent.
          For this reason AS112 nodes operate as <xref
          target="RFC1034">fully-functional
          and standards-compliant DNS authoritative servers</xref>,
          and hence require DNS software.</t>

        <t>Suitable choices of free DNS software for AS112 nodes
          include, but are not limited to:

        <t>If the response received indicates a different node is being
          used, then there is probably a routing problem to solve. If
          there is no response received at all, there might be host
          or nameserver problem. Judicious use of tools such as
          traceroute, and consultation of BGP looking glasses might
          be useful in troubleshooting.</t>

        <t>Note that an appropriate set of tests for a new server will
          include queries sent from many different places within the
          expected service area of the node, using both UDP and TCP
          transport, and exercising all three AS112 anycast nameserver
          addresses.</t>

      <section title="Monitoring">
        <t>AS112 nodes should be monitored to ensure they are functioning
          correctly, just as with any other production service. An AS112
          node which stops answering queries correctly can cause failures
          and timeouts in unexpected places, and can lead to failures in
          dependent systems which can be difficult to troubleshoot.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Downtime">
        <t>An AS112 node which needs to go off-line (e.g. for planned
          maintenance, or as part of the diagnosis of some problem)
          should stop advertising the AS112 service prefix to its BGP
          peers. This can be done by shutting down the routing software
          on the node altogether, or by causing the routing system to
          withdraw the route.</t>

        <t>Withdrawing the service prefix is important in order to avoid
          blackholing query traffic in the event that the DNS software on
          the node is not functioning normally.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Statistics and Measurement">
        <t>Use of the AS112 node should be measured in order to track
          long-term trends, identify anomalous conditions and to ensure
          that the configuration of the AS112 node is sufficient to handle
          the query load.</t>

        <t>Examples of free monitoring tools which might be useful to
          operators of AS112 nodes include, but are not limited to:

    <section title="Communications" anchor="communications">
      <t>It is good operational practice to notify the community
        of users which may fall within the reach of a new AS112 node
        before it is installed. At Internet Exchanges, local
        mailing lists usually exist to facilitate such announcements.</t>

      <t>For nodes which are intended to be globally reachable,
	coordination with other AS112 operators is especially
	recommended.  The mailing list <eref
	target="mailto:as112-ops@lists.dns-oarc.net"/> is operated
	for this purpose.</t>

      <t>Information pertinent to AS112 operations is maintained
        at <eref target="http://www.as112.net/"/>.</t>

      <t>Information about an AS112 node should also be published within
        the DNS, within the "HOSTNAME.AS112.NET" zone. See
        <xref target="dns"/> for more details.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="On the Future of AS112 Nodes">
      <t>It is recommended practice for the operators of recursive
	nameservers to answer queries for zones served by AS112
	nodes locally, such that queries never have an opportunity
	to reach AS112 servers <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones"/>. Operational
	experience with AS112 nodes does not currently indicate an
	observable trend towards compliance with those recommendations,
	however.</t>

      <t>It is expected that some DNS software vendors will include
	default configuration which will implement measures such
	as those described in <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones"/>.  If such
	software is widely deployed, it is reasonable to assume
	that the query load received by AS112 nodes will decrease;
	however, it is safe to assume that the query load will not
	decrease to zero, and consequently that AS112 nodes will
	continue to provide a useful service for the foreseeable
	future.</t>

      <t>There may be a requirement in the future for AS112 nodes to
        answer for their current set of zones over IPv6 transport.
        Such a requirement would necessitate the assignment of a
        corresponding IPv6 netblock for use as an anycast service
        prefix.</t>

      <t>There may be a requirement in the future for AS112 nodes
        to serve additional zones, or to stop serving particular
        zones that are currently served. Such changes would be
        widely announced in operational forums, and published
        at <eref target="http://www.as112.net/"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The AS112 nameservers are all named under the domain
        IANA.ORG (see <xref target="nameservers"/>). However,
        the anycast infrastructure itself is operated by a
        loosely-coordinated, diverse mix of organisations across
        the Internet, and is not an IANA function.</t>

      <t>The autonomous system number 112 and the IPv4 prefix
        192.175.48.0/24 were assigned by ARIN.</t>

      <t>This document makes no request of the IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Hosts should never normally send queries to AS112 servers;
	queries relating to private-use addresses should be answered
	locally within a site. Hosts which send queries to AS112
	servers may well leak information relating to private
	infrastructure to the public network, which could represent
	a security risk. This risk is orthogonal to the presence
	or absence of authoritative servers for these zones in the
	public DNS infrastructure, however.</t>

      <t>Queries which are answered by AS112 servers are usually
	unintentional; it follows that the responses from AS112
	servers are usually unexpected. Unexpected inbound traffic
	can trigger intrusion detection systems or alerts by
	firewalls. Operators of AS112 servers should be prepared
	to be contacted by operators of remote infrastructure who
        believe their security has been violated. Advice to those
	who mistakenly believe that responses from AS112 nodes
	constitutes an attack on their infrastructure can be found
	in <xref
	target="draft-ietf-dnsop-as112-under-attack-help-help"/>.</t>

      <t>The deployment of AS112 nodes is very loosely coordinated
	compared to other services distributed using anycast. The
	malicious compromise of an AS112 node and subversion of the
	data served by the node is hence more difficult to detect
	due to the lack of central management. Since it is conceivable
	that changing the responses to queries received by AS112
	nodes might influence the behaviour of the hosts sending
	the queries, such a compromise might be used as an attack
	vector against private infrastructure.</t>

      <t>Operators of AS112 should take appropriate measures to
        ensure that AS112 nodes are appropriately protected from
        compromise, such as would normally be employed for production
        nameserver or network infrastructure. The guidance provided
        for root nameservers in <xref target="RFC2870"/> may be
        instructive.</t>

      <t>The zones hosted by AS112 servers are not signed with
        DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/>. Given the distributed
        and loosely-coordinated structure of the AS112 service,
        the zones concerned could only be signed if the private
        key material used was effectively public, obviating any
        security benefit resulting from the use of those keys.</t>

    <t>Hosts should never normally send DNS reverse mapping queries
      for those addresses on the public Internet. However, such
      queries are frequently observed. Authoritative servers are
      deployed to provide authoritative answers to such queries as
      part of a loosely-coordinated effort known as the AS112
      project.</t>

    <t>Since queries sent to AS112 servers are usually not intentional,
      the replies received back from those servers are typically
      unexpected. Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger alarms on
      intrusion detection systems and firewalls, and operators of
      such systems often mistakenly believe that they are being
      attacked.</t>

    <t>This document provides background information and technical
      advice to those firewall operators.</t>

    <section title="History">
      <t>Widespread use of the private address blocks listed in
        <xref target="RFC1918"/> followed that document's publication
        in 1996.</t>

      <t>The idea of off-loading IN-ADDR.ARPA queries relating to
        <xref target="RFC1918"/> addresses from the root nameservers
        was first proposed by Bill Manning and John Brown.</t>

      <t>The use of anycast for distributing authority service for
        <xref target="RFC1918"/> IN-ADDR.ARPA zones was subsequently
        proposed at a private meeting of root server operators.</t>

      <t>ARIN provided an IPv4 prefix for the anycast service,
	and also the autonomous system number 112 for use in
	originating that prefix. This assignment gave the project
	its name.</t>

      <t>In 2002, the first AS112 anycast nodes were deployed.</t>

      <t>The use of anycast nameservers in the AS112 project contributed
        to the operational experience of anycast DNS services, and can be
        seen as a precursor to the anycast distribution of other authority
        servers in subsequent years (e.g. various root servers).</t>
