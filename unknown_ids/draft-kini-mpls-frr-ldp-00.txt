Internet Draft                FRR for LDP                    Mar 7, 2011


Abstract          

   LDP is widely deployed in MPLS networks to signal LSPs. Since LDP
   establishes LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is
   gated by IGP's re-convergence. Mechanisms such as IPFRR and RSVP-TE
   based FRR have been used to provide faster re-route for LDP LSPs.
   However these techniques have significant complexity and/or may not
   have full coverage. In this document we describe a method to perform
   fast re-route of LDP LSPs. The goal is to have recovery
   characteristics similar to the methods in [RSVP-TE-FRR] without
   depending on additional protocols but at the same time provide full
   coverage.

Internet Draft                FRR for LDP                    Mar 7, 2011


1.  Introduction

   LDP is a widely deployed signaling protocol in MPLS networks. It
   signals LSPs along IGP routed paths. In case of a failure in the
   network, the recovery of traffic on LDP LSPs is gated by re-
   convergence of IGPs. IGPs have relatively slower convergence since it
   is affected by factors such as link-state database flooding, re-
   computation etc. Approaches such as [IPFRR-LFA] can provide an
   alternate route that may be used by LDP. However this method does not
   provide full coverage. Other IPFRR methods such as [NOT-VIA] involve
   significant complexity. Another approach to protect LDP LSPs is to
   use RSVP-TE LSPs to the next-hop or next-next-hop and protect the LDP
   traffic by using the techniques specified in [RSVP-TE-FRR]. This has
   the complexity of deploying an additional protocol [RSVP-TE] in order
   to protect LDP LSPs.

   In this document we describe a local-repair mechanism that can
   provide fast-reroute for LDP LSPs without requiring additional
   mechanisms from other protocols. This mechanism is henceforth
   referred to as FRR-LDP. It aims to provide traffic recovery times
   similar to that provided by [RSVP-TE-FRR]. This mechanism works for a
   link-state IGP such as [OSPF] and [ISIS].

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   SPT: Shortest Path Tree

   PLR: Point of Local Repair. The head-end LSR of a backup-SP LSP.

   Backup-SP LSP (BSP LSP): An LDP LSP that provides a backup for a
   specific failure on the shortest path LDP LSP. The failed entity may
   be a link, a node or a SRLG. This LSP originates from the PLR(s).

   Backup-SP Merge Point (BSP-MP): The LSR where the Backup-SP LSP is
   label switched to a label allocated for the shortest path LDP LSP. It
   need not be downstream of the failed entity.

   Exclude-SPT: The shortest path tree from a PLR to a destination, when
   a particular failure point is excluded.

4.  LDP Local Repair Technique

Internet Draft                FRR for LDP                    Mar 7, 2011


   An LSR that can act as a BSP-MP for a given destination for a
   specific failure advertises a label so that the PLR can a priori
   select a BSP LSP to switch to when that failure occurs. Note that the
   PLR is also the BSP-MP for the trivial case when a LFA is present in
   which case this technique is reduced to the one in [IPFRR-LFA]. Also
   unlike [NOT-VIA], FRR-LDP does not require extra not-via addresses at
   each LSR along the repair path that are used to route around a
   failure.

   FRR-LDP tries to re-use the shortest-path LDP LSPs that are already
   present in the network before the failure as much as possible in
   order to provide a repair path. In combination with label stacking it
   requires a relatively smaller increase in forwarding state.

   For a given failure entity on a SPT towards a destination, LSRs
   upstream of the failure can act as a BSP-MP. If such an LSR is along
   the SPT from the PLR towards the destination in the topology after
   the failure, then the LSR acts as a BSP-MP and advertises a label so
   that the PLR can select the BSP LSP to switch to when the failure
   occurs. Note that at the time of failure the actions at the PLR are
   sufficient to protect the traffic. Other LSRs need not react at the
   instant the failure occurs in order to protect the traffic.

6.  Protocol Extensions

   The primary protocol extensions consist of

      1. Extensions to LDP Label mapping messages to indicate the
         failure entity for which the label is advertised and the PLR.
      2. Procedures to get the next-next-hop advertised label in order
         to do node protection.

   Detailed encodings will be provided in future versions of this draft.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not bring any new security considerations beyond
   those already described in [LDP].

8.  IANA Considerations

   These will be specified when the protocol extensions are defined.
