1.  Introduction

   This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4
   and DHCPv6) options that contain a list of IP addresses that can be
   used to locate network management services.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Network Management IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4

   This section describes the network management IPv4 Address Option for
   DHCPv4.  The network management IPv4 Address Option begins with an
   option code followed by a length and sub-options.  The value of the
   length octet does not include itself or the option code.  The option
   layout is depicted below:

   0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   |                     Sub-Option 1                              |
   .                                                               .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       ...                                     |
   .                                                               .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Sub-Option n                              |
   .                                                               .

      Option Code

         OPTION-IPv4_Address-NM (TBD) - 1 byte

      Length

         An 8-bit field indicating the length of the option excluding
         the 'Option Code' and the 'Length' fields

      Sub-options

         A series of DHCPv4 sub-options

   When the total length of a network management IPv4 Address Option
   exceeds 254 octets, the procedure outlined in [RFC3396] MUST be

   employed to split the option into multiple, smaller options.

   A sub-option begins with a sub-option code followed by a length and
   one or more IPv4 addresses.  The sub-option layout is depicted below:

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Sub-opt Code  |    Length     |    IP Address . . . . .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   .                                                               .
   .                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The sub-option codes are summarized in Table 1.

                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    | Sub-option code | Service Name |
                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    |        1        |   SNMP-TRAP  |
                    |        2        |    SYSLOG    |
                    +-----------------+--------------+

         Table 1: Sub-option codes or network management services

   The length is followed by a list of IPv4 addresses indicating
   appropriate network management servers available for a requested
   option.  Servers MUST be listed in order of preference and the client
   should process them in decreasing order of preference.  In the case
   that there is no network management server available, the length is
   set to 0; otherwise, it is a multiple of 4.


3.  Usage of Network Management Option for DHCPv4

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv4 option follow the
   rules for DHCP options in [RFC2131].

   In order to discover the IP address of a network management service,
   the node (DHCP client) MUST include a Network Management IPv4 Address
   Option in the Parameter Request List (PRL) in the respective DHCP
   messages as defined in [RFC2131].

   The client MAY include a Network Management IPv4 Address Option that
   includes one or more sub-option(s) with the Sub-opt Code or Codes
   that represent the service(s) the node is interested in.  However, a
   client SHOULD be prepared to accept a response from a server that
   includes other sub-option(s) or does not include the requested sub-
   option(s).

Internet-Draft     DHC Options for Network Management       October 2010


   When the DHCP server receives a Network Management IPv4 Address
   Option in the PRL, the DHCP server MUST include the option in its
   response message as defined in [RFC2131].

   A server MAY use the sub-options in the received Network Management
   IPv4 Address Option from the client's message to restrict its
   response to the client requested sub-options.  In the case when the
   server cannot find any servers satisfying a requested sub-option, the
   server SHOULD return the network management Option with that sub-
   option and the length of the sub-option set to 0.


4.  Network Management IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6

   This section describes the network management IPv6 Address Option for
   DHCPv6.  The network management Discovery Option begins with an
   option code followed by a length and sub-options.  The value of the
   length octet does not include itself or the option code.  The option
   layout is depicted below:

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   .                                                               .
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Sub-Option n                              |
   .                                                               .

   Code and Length is 2 octets, and the Length does not include itself
   or the Sub-opt Code field.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The sub-option codes are summarized in Table 2.

                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    | Sub-option code | Service Name |
                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    |        1        |   SNMP-TRAP  |
                    |        2        |    SYSLOG    |
                    +-----------------+--------------+

         Table 2: Sub-option codes or network management services

   The length is followed by a list of IPv6 addresses indicating
   appropriate network management servers available for a requested
   option.  Servers MUST be listed in order of preference and the client
   should process them in decreasing order of preference.  In the case
   that there is no network management server available, the length is
   set to 0; otherwise, it is a multiple of 16.


5.  Usage of Network Management Option for DHCPv6

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv6 option follows the
   rules for DHCP options in [RFC3315].

   In order to discover the IP address of a network management service,
   the node (DHCP client) MUST include a Network Management IPv6 Address
   Option in the Option Request Option (ORO) in the respective DHCP
   messages as defined in [RFC3315].

   The client MAY include a Network Management IPv6 Address Option that
   includes one or more sub-option(s) with the Sub-opt Code or Codes
   that represent the service(s) the node is interested in.  However, a
   client SHOULD be prepared to accept a response from a server that
   includes other sub-option(s) or does not include the requested sub-
   option(s).

   When the DHCP server receives a Network Management IPv6 Address



Schoenwaelder & B.D.     Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     DHC Options for Network Management       October 2010


   Option in the ORO, the DHCP server MUST include the option in its
   response message as defined in [RFC3315].

   A server MAY use the sub-options in the received Network Management
   IPv6 Address Option from the client's message to restrict its
   response to the client requested sub-options.  In the case when the
   server cannot find any servers satisfying a requested sub-option, the
   server SHOULD return the network management Option with that sub-
   option and the length of the sub-option set to 0.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131] apply.  If an adversary
   manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert its own
   response, an node could be led to contact a rogue network management
   server.

   It is recommended to use the DHCP authentication option described in
   [RFC3118] where available.  This will also protect against denial-of-
   service attacks to DHCP servers.  [RFC3118] provides mechanisms for
   both entity authentication and message authentication.

   In deployments where DHCP authentication is not available, lower-
   layer security services may be sufficient to protect DHCP messages.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new DHCPv4 options as described in Section 2.

     NM IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4 (OPTION-IPv4_Address-NM)  [TBD]

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 options as described in Section 4.

     NM IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6 (OPTION-IPv6_Address-NM)  [TBD]
