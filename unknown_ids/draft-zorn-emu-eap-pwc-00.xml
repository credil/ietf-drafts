				The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for
				multiple authentication methods.  One such method is Generic Token Card (EAP-GTC) which, despite its name, is 
				commonly used 
				to support authentication using cleartext passwords in tunneled EAP methods.  EAP-GTC does not provide the ability 
				to change a password
				(for example, an expired password), however.  
				This document defines the PassWord Change EAP method (EAP-PWC) in order to fill that void in functionality.

						<vspace blankLines="1"/>						
						If the EAP authenticator determines that the password should be changed as a result of the evaluation of the 
						EAP/Identity response, it SHOULD send an EAP-PWC/Request to the peer.
						The Request
						contains a pair of displayable messages separated by the NUL character (0x00) and the Response contains the 
						old and new passwords, also separated by a single NUL character.  A Response MUST be sent in reply to the
						Request.  The Response MUST be of Type &lt;TBD&gt; (PWC), Nak (Type 3), or
						Expanded Nak (Type 254) <xref target="RFC3748"/>.
						The Nak Response indicates the peer's desired authentication Type(s).  The EAP-PWC method
						MUST NOT be used to provide support for
						cleartext password change in the absence of a protected tunnel with server authentication
						(e.g., TEAM <xref target="I-D.zorn-emu-team"/>).

					</t>
					<t hangText="Type-Data">
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The Type-Data field in the Request
						contains a displayable message concatenated with a single NUL character concatenated with a displayable
						message.  Each of the messages MUST be individually processed according to the
						rules of the <xref target="RFC4013"/>
						profile of <xref target="RFC3454"/> before the concatenation is performed.						
						The messages SHALL be considered to be "stored strings" per 
						<xref target="RFC3454"/>, and unassigned code
						points are therefore prohibited.  The output SHALL be the binary
						representation of the processed UTF-8 character string.
						Prohibited output and unassigned codepoints encountered in
						SASLprep pre-processing SHALL cause a failure of pre-processing,
						and the output SHALL NOT be used with EAP-PWC.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The Type-Data field in the Response
