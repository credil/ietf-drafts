      This document revises the specification of the BGP MRAI timer, by
      deprecating the previously recommended values and by allowing for
      withdrawals to be exempted from the MRAI.

      <t>
 
      The Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI) timer is specified in
      <xref target="RFC4271"/>. This timer acts to rate-limit
      updates, on a per-destination basis. <xref target="RFC4271"/> suggests
      values of 30s and 5s for this interval for eBGP and iBGP respectively. 
      The MRAI must also be applied to withdrawals according to RFC4271, a
      change from the earlier <xref target="RFC1771"/>.
      
      </t><t>
      
      The MRAI timer has a significant effect on the convergence of BGP,
      in terms of convergence time, the number of messages, amongst other
      metrics. The optimum value for this timer is hard to estimate, never
      mind calculate and will differ between networks, and probably even
      different subsets of the same network.

    <section title="Revision"> 
    
    <t> 
    
    The suggested default values for the MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer
    given in <xref target="RFC4271"/> are deprecated.  The
    appropriate choice of default values is left to the discretion of
    implementors.  Implementations SHOULD provide a means to allow operators
    to choose values appropriate to their requirements, on a per-peer and
    per-AFI/SAFI basis.  Implementations MAY exempt withdrawals from the
    MRAI timer.
