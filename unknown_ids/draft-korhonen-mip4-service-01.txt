Internet-Draft         Service Selection for MIPv4         February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv4 [1] has a Network Access Identifier extension (MN-NAI)
   [6] that provides a flexible way to identify mobile nodes using other
   identifiers than IPv4 addresses.  An example of such an identifier is
   the Network Access Identifier (NAI) [2].  In some Mobile IPv4
   deployments, however, just identifying the mobile node or the
   mobility service subscriber via a proxy representative [7] is not
   enough to distinguish between multiple services possibly provisioned
   to the said mobile node and its mobility service subscription.

   The capability to specify different services in addition to the
   mobile node identity can be leveraged to provide flexibility for
   mobility service providers to provide multiple services within the
   same mobility service subscription.  For example:

   o  Provide an enterprise data access for which the mobility service
      provider hosts connectivity and mobility services on behalf of the
      enterprise.

   o  Provide access to service domains that are otherwise not
      accessible from public networks because of some mobility service
      provider's business reasons.

   o  Provide simultaneous access to different service domains that are
      separated based on policies of the mobility service provider.

   o  Enable easier policy assignment for mobility service providers
      based on the subscribed services.

   o  In absence of the Service Selection extension the home agent may
      provide, based on operator policies, a default service.  For
      example, a plain Internet access could be an operator's default
      mobility service.

   This document describes a Service Selection Extension for Mobile IPv4
   that is intended to assist home agents to make specific service
   selections for the mobility service subscription during the
   registration procedure.  The service selection may affect home agent
   routing decisions and Home Address assignment policies.  The Service
   Selection extension should be used in combination with the Mobile
   Node Identifier extension during the initial registration at the
   beginning of the mobility session.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].


3.  Service Selection Extension

   The Service Selection extension MAY be included in any Mobile IPv4
   Registration Request message.  The Service Selection extension MUST
   be placed in the Registration Request message as follows:

   o  When present the extension MUST appear after the MN-NAI extension

   o  If the extension was added by the mobile node to a Registration
      Request it MUST appear prior any authentication-enabling
      extensions [1][8]

   o  In the event the foreign agent adds the Service Selection
      extension to a Registration Request, the extension MUST appear
      prior to any authentication-enabling extensions added by the
      foreign agent [1]

   This extension SHOULD be included only in the initial Registration
   Request message when registering to a home agent at the beginning of
   the mobility session.  The MN-NAI extension SHOULD also be included
   in the Registration Request message when the Service Selection
   extension is used.  However, sending the Service Selection extension
   in any Registration Request message is not prohibited.

                        Service Selection Extension

   o  Type: 8-bit identifier set to TBD (to be defined by IANA) of the
      type of this skippable extension.

   o  Length: 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length of the
      Service Selection Identifier field.

   o  Identifier: A variable length service identifier string used to
      identify the requested service.  The Identifier string is encoded
      as a host name or a fully qualified domain name as defined in [4]
      and [5].

      'deadcoderssociety' and 'deadcoderssociety.example.com' are valid
      examples of Service Selection extension Identifier strings.


4.  Processing Considerations

4.1.  Mobile Node Considerations

   A mobile node or its proxy representative MAY include the Service
   Selection extension into any Registration Request message.  The
   extension is used to identify the service to be associated with the
   mobility session and SHOULD only be included into the initial
   Registration Request message sent to a home agent.  The provisioning
   of the service identifiers to the mobile node or its proxy
   representative is out of scope of this specification.

   The Service Selection extension is intended to be used with the MN-
   NAI extension, but it is also possible to use Home Address to
   identify the mobile node as defined in [1].

4.2.  Home Agent Considerations

   Upon receiving the Service Selection extension the home agent
   authenticates and authorizes the mobile node.  If the home agent
   supports the Service Selection it MUST also verify that the mobile
   node is authorized to the service identified by the Service Selection
   extension.  The services the mobile node is authorized to SHOULD be
   part of the general mobile node subscription data.  If the mobile
   node is not authorized to the service the home agent MUST deny the
   registration and send a Registration Reply with an error
   SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code TBD).

   The Service Selection extension is used to assist the mobile node
   authorization phase and identifies a specific service that is to be
   authorized.  The Service Selection extension MAY also affect the Home
   Address allocation when for example used with the MN-NAI extension.
   For the same NAI there MAY be different Home Addresses depending on
   the identified service.  Furthermore, the Service Selection extension
   MAY also affect the routing of the outbound IP packets in the home
   agent depending on the selected service.

4.3.  Foreign Agent Considerations

   A foreign agent MUST ignore the Service Selection extension if the
   Registration Request already contains the Service Selection
   extension.  If the Registration Request does not contain the Service
   Selection extension the foreign agent MAY add the Service Selection
   extension to the Registration Request message.  How the foreign agent

Internet-Draft         Service Selection for MIPv4         February 2007


   learns the service the mobile nodes needs to authorize is outside of
   scope of this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   The protection for the Service Selection extension depends on the
   service that is being identified and eventually selected.  If the
   service selection information should not be revealed on the wire it
   should be protected in a manner similar to Registration Requests and
   Registration Replies.  The Service Selection extension is protected
   by the same authentication enabling extension as the rest of the
   Registration Request message.

   The home agent MUST verify that the mobile node is authorized to the
   service included in the Service Selection extension.  The Service
   Selection extension authorization is part of the normal mobile node
   registration and authentication procedure.  Both registration
   authentication and service authorization MUST succeed before the
   mobile node is allowed to register to the home agent.


6.  IANA Considerations

   A new Mobile IPv4 skippable Extension type is required for the
   following new Extension described in Section 3.  The Extension type
   must be from the 'skippable Extension' range (128-255):

       Service Selection Extension       is set to TBD

   A new Mobile IPv4 registration denied by home agent error code is
   required.  The error code must be allocated from the 'Error Codes
   from the Home Agent' range (128-192):

       SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED      is set to TBD
