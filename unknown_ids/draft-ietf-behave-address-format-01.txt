Abstract

   This document discusses how an individual IPv6 address can be
   algorithmically translated to a corresponding IPv4 address, and vice
   versa, using only statically configured information.  This technique
   is used in IPv4/IPv6 translators, as well as other types of proxies
   and gateways (e.g., for DNS) used in IPv4/IPv6 scenarios.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document is part of a series of IPv4/IPv6 translation documents.
   A framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework], including a taxonomy of scenarios
   that will be used in this document.  Other documents specify the
   behavior of various types of translators and gateways, including
   mechanisms for translating between IP headers and other types of
   messages that include IP addresses.  This document specifies how an
   individual IPv6 address is translated to a corresponding IPv4
   address, and vice versa, in cases where an algorithmic mapping is
   used.  While specific types of devices are used herein as examples,
   it is the responsibility of the specification of such devices to
   reference this document for algorithmic mapping of the addresses
   themselves.

   Section 2 of this document describes the format of "IPv4 Embedded
   IPv6 addresses", i.e.  IPv6 addresses in which 32 bits contains an
   IPv4 address.  These addresses can be used to represent IPv4 hosts to
   hosts in an IPv6 network.  IPv6 addresses assigned to IPv6 hosts for
   use with stateless translation are referred to as "IPv4-translatable"
   IPv6 addresses; they are a variant of embedded addresses, and follow
   the format described in Section 2.

   Section 3 discusses the choice of prefixes, the use of a well known
   prefix, and the use of embedded addresses with stateless and stateful
   translation.

1.1.  Applicability Scope

   This document is part of a series defining address translation
   services.  We understand that the address format could also be used
   by other interconnection methods between IPv6 and IPv4, e.g. methods
   based on encapsulation.  If the WG so decides, a future version of
   this document could also discuss the use of embedded addresses and
   prefixes for interconnection of IPv6 and IPv4 based on encapsulation.

1.2.  Notations

   In this document, an "IPv4/IPv6 translator" is an entity that
   translates IPv4 packets to IPv6 packets, and vice versa.  It may do
   "stateless" translation, meaning that there is no per-flow state
   required, or "stateful" translation where per-flow state is created
   when the first packet in a flow is received.

   In this document, an "address translator" is any entity that has to
   derive an IPv4 address from an IPv6 address or vice versa.  This
   applies not only to devices that do IPv4/IPv6 packet translation, but



Huitema, et al.          Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


   also to other entities that manipulate addresses, such as name
   resolution proxies (e.g., DNS64 [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64]) and
   possibly other types of Application Layer Gateways (ALGs).

   In this document, the "Well Known Prefix" is an IPv6 prefix assigned
   by IANA for use in an algorithmic mapping.  Options for the actual
   allocation of the Well Known Prefix are discussed in Section 3.6.

   In this document, a "Network Specific Prefix" is an IPv6 prefix
   assigned by an organization for use in algorithmic mapping.  Options
   for the Network Specific Prefix are discussed in Section 3.3 and 3.4.


2.  IPv4 Embedded IPv6 Address Format

   IPv4 Embedded IPv6 Addresses are composed of a variable length
   prefix, the embedded IPv4 address, and a variable length suffix, as
   presented in the following diagram:


    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |PLEN| 0-------------32--40--48--56--64--72--80--88--96--104-112-120-127-|
    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |/32 |     prefix    |v4(32)         | u | suffix                        |
    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |/40 |     prefix        |v4(24)     | u |(8)| suffix                    |
    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |/48 |     prefix            |v4(16) | u | (16)  | suffix                |
    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |/56 |     prefix                |(8)| u |  v4(24)   | suffix            |
    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |/64 |     prefix                    | u |   v4(32)      | suffix        |
    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |/96 |     prefix                                        |   v4(32)      |
    +----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


   In these addresses, the prefix shall be either the "Well Known
   Prefix" defined in the addressing architecture to represent IPv4
   mapped addresses, or a "Network Specific Prefix" unique to the
   organization deploying the address translators.  (Options for the
   well known prefix are discussed in Section 3.6.)

   Various deployments justify different prefix lengths.  The tradeoff
   between different prefix lengths are discussed in Sections 3.3 and
   3.4 of this document.

   Bits 64 to 71 of the address are reserved for compatibility with the



Huitema, et al.          Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


   host identifier format defined in the IPv6 addressing architecture.
   These bits MUST be set to zero.  The corresponding octet is noted "u"
   in the above diagram.  When using a 96 prefix, the administrators
   MUST ensure that the bits 64 to 71 are compatible with the IPv6
   addressing architecture.

   The IPv4 address is encoded following the prefix, most significant
   bits first.  Depending of the prefix length, the 4 octets of the
   address may be separated by the reserved octet "u".  In particular:
   o  When the prefix is 32 bit long, the IPv4 address is encoded in
      positions 32 to 63.
   o  When the prefix is 40 bit long, 24 bits of the IPv4 address are
      encoded in positions 40 to 63, with the remaining 8 bits in
      position 72 to 79.
   o  When the prefix is 48 bit long, 16 bits of the IPv4 address are
      encoded in positions 48 to 63, with the remaining 8 bits in
      position 72 to 87.
   o  When the prefix is 56 bit long, 8 bits of the IPv4 address are
      encoded in positions 56 to 63, with the remaining 8 bits in
      position 72 to 95.
   o  When the prefix is 64 bit long, the IPv4 address is encoded in
      positions 72 to 103.
   o  When the prefix is 96 bit long, the IPv4 address is encoded in
      positions 96 to 127.

   There are no remaining bits, and thus no suffix, if the prefix is 96
   bit long.  In the other cases, the remaining bits of the address
   constitute the suffix.  These bits are reserved for future
   extensions, and should be set to a null value.  (Different options
   for the suffix as discussed in Section 3.5.)


3.  Deployment Guidelines and Choices

3.1.  Deployment Using the Well Known Prefix

   The Well Known Prefix MAY be used by organizations deploying
   translation services.

   The Well Known Prefix SHOULD NOT be used to construct IPv4
   translatable addresses.  The host served by IPv4 translatable
   addresses should be able to receive IPv6 traffic bound to their IPv4
   translatable address without incurring intermediate protocol
   translation.  This is only possible if the specific prefix used to
   build the translatable addresses is advertized in inter-domain
   routing, and this kind of specific prefix advertisement is not
   supported with the Well Known Prefix, as explained in Section 3.2.




Huitema, et al.          Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


   The Well Known Prefix MUST NOT be used to represent non global IPv4
   addresses, such as those defined in RFC 1918.  Doing so would
   introduce ambiguous IPv6 address.

3.2.  Impact on Inter-Domain Routing

   The Well Known Prefix MAY appear in inter-domain routing tables, if
   service providers decide to provide IPv6-IPv4 interconnection
   services to peers.  Advertisement of the Well Known Prefix SHOULD be
   controlled either by upstream and/or downstream service providers
   owing to inter-domain routing policies, e.g., through configuration
   of BGP.  Organizations that advertize the Well Known Prefix in inter-
   domain routing MUST be able to provide address translation service.

   When the translation relies on the Well Known Prefix, IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 prefixes longer than the Well Known Prefix MUST NOT be
   advertised in BGP (especially e-BGP) [rfc4271] because this imports
   IPv4 routing table into IPv6 one and therefore induces scalability
   issues to the global IPv6 routing table.  Adjacent BGP speakers MUST
   ignore advertisements of IPv4-mapped IPv6 prefixes longer than the
   Well Known Prefix.  BGP speakers SHOULD be able to be configured with
   the default Well Known Prefix.

   When the translation service relies on Network Specific Prefixes, the
   global IPv6 routing policy guideline MUST be followed.  In
   particular, if stateless translation is used, the IPv4-translatable
   addresses MUST be advertised with proper aggregation to the IPv6
   Internet.  Similarly, if translators are configured with multiple
   Network Specific Prefixes, these prefixes MUST be advertised to the
   IPv6 Internet with proper aggregation.

3.3.  Choice of Prefix for Stateless Translation Deployments

   Organization may deploy translation services using stateless
   translation.  In these deployments, internal IPv6 hosts are addressed
   using "IPv4 translatable" IPv6 addresses, which enable them to be
   accessed by IPv4 hosts.  The addresses of these external hosts are
   represented in "IPv4 Embedded" IPv6 addresses.

   Organizations deploying stateless translation SHOULD assign a Network
   Specific Prefix to their translation service.  Both "IPv4
   translatable" and "IPv4 Embedded" MUST be constructed as specified in
   section 2.  "IPv4 translatable" addresses MUST use the selected
   Network Specific Prefix.  Both types of addresses SHOULD use the same
   prefix.  Using the same prefix ensures that internal IPv6 hosts will
   use the most efficient paths to reach the hosts served by "IPv4
   translatable" addresses.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


   The intra-domain routing protocol must be able to deliver packets to
   the hosts served by "IPv4 translatable" addresses.  This may require
   routing on some or all of the embedded IPv4 address bits.  Security
   considerations detailed in the security section requires that routers
   check the validity of the "IPv4 translatable" source addresses, using
   some form of reverse path check.

   Forwarding, and reverse path checks, should be performed on the
   combination of the "prefix" and the IPv4 address.  In theory, routers
   should be able to route on prefixes of any length.  However, there is
   some suspicion that routing on prefixes larger than 64 bit may be
   slower, or possibly not supported by some router.  But routing
   efficiency is not the only consideration in the choice of a prefix
   length.  Organization also need to consider the availability of
   prefixes, and the potential impact of null identifiers.

   If a /32 prefix is used, all the routing bits are contained in the
   top 64 bits of the IPv6 address, leading to excellent routing
   properties.  These prefixes may however be hard to obtain, and
   allocation of a /32 to a small set of IPv4 translatable addresses may
   be seen as wasteful.  In addition, the /32 prefix and a null suffix
   leads to a null identifier, an issue that we discuss in section 3.5.

   Intermediate prefixes like /40, /48 or /56 appear as compromise.
   Only some of the IPv4 bits are part of the /64 addresses.  Reverse
   checks, in particular, may have a limited efficiency.  Reverse checks
   limited the most significant bits of the IPv4 address will reduce the
   possibility of spoofing external address, but would allow internal
   hosts to spoof internal addresses.

   We propose here a compromise, based on using no more than 1/256th of
   an organization's allocation of IPv6 addresses for the translation
   service.  For example, if the organization is an ISP, with an
   allocated prefix /32 or shorter, the ISP could dedicate a /40 prefix
   to the translation service.  An end site with a /48 allocation could
   dedicate a /56 prefix to the translation service.

   The recommended prefix length is also a function of the deployment
   scenario.  The stateless translation can be used for Scenario 1,
   Scenario 2, Scenario 5 and Scenario 6 defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  For different scenarios, the
   prefix length recommendations are:
   o  For scenario 1 (an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet) and scenario
      2 (the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network), we recommend using a /40
      prefix for an ISP holding a /32 allocation, and a /56 prefix for a
      site holding a /40 allocation.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


   o  For scenario 5 (an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network) and scenario 6
      (an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network), we recommend using a /64
      prefix.

3.4.  Choice of Prefix for Stateful Translation Deployments

   Organizations MAY deploy translation services based on stateful
   translation technology.  The organizations may decide to use either a
   Network Specific Prefix or the Well Known Prefix.  The Well Known
   Prefix SHOULD be used when no Network Specific Prefix is available.

   When these services are used, internal hosts are addressed through
   standard IPv6 addresses, while IPv4 hosts are represented by IPv4
   embedded addresses, as specified in section 2.

   The stateful nature of the translation creates potential stability
   issue when the organization deploys multiple translators.  If several
   translators use the same prefix, there is a risk that packet
   belonging to the same connection may be routed to different
   translators as the internal routing state changes.  This issue can be
   mitigated either by assigning different prefixes to different
   translators, or by ensuring that all translators using same prefix
   coordinate their state.

   The stateful translation can be used in the scenarios defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  The general recommendation is to
   use the Well Known Prefix, with two exceptions:
   o  In all scenarios, the translation MAY use a Network Specific
      Prefix, if deemed appropriate for management reasons.
   o  The Well Known Prefix MUST NOT be used for scenario 3 (the IPv6
      Internet to an IPv4 network), as this would lead to using the Well
      Known Prefix with non global IPv4 addresses.  That means a Network
      Specific Prefix MUST be used in that scenario.

3.5.  Choice of Suffix

   The address format described in Section 2 recommends a null suffix.
   Before making this recommendation, we considered different options:
   checksum neutrality; the encoding of a port range; and a value
   different than 0.

   The "neutrality checksum" option would give a chosen value to 16 of
   the suffix bits to ensure that the "IPv4 embedded" IPv6 address has
   the same 16 bit complement to 1 checksum as the embedded IPv4
   address.  There have been discussion of this checksum in the working
   group mailing list, and some push to standardize a checksum format.
   However, we observed that the neutrality checksum alone does
   eliminate checksums computation during stateful translation, as only



Huitema, et al.          Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


   one of the two addresses would be checksum neutral.  In the case of
   stateless translation, translators may want to recomputed the
   checksum anyhow, to verify the validity of the translated datagrams.
   In doubt, we picked the simplest alternative, to not specify a
   neutrality checksum.

   There have been proposals to complement stateless translation with a
   port-range feature.  Instead of mapping an IPv4 address to exactly
   one IPv6 prefix, the options would allow several IPv6 hosts to share
   an IPv4 address, with each host managing a different range of ports.
   But these schemes are not yet specified in work group documents.  If
   a port range extension is needed, it could be defined later, using
   bits currently reserved as null in the suffix.

   When a /32 prefix is used, the null suffix results in a null
   identifier.  We understand the conflict with Section 2.6.1 of
   RFC4291, which specifies that all zeroes are used for the subnet-
   router anycast address.  However, in our specification, there would
   be only one IPv4 translatable host in the /64 subnet, and the anycast
   semantic would not create confusion.  We thus decided to keep the
   null suffix for now.  (Different authors of this document have
   different opinions.)

3.6.  Choice of the Well Known Prefix

   We are faced with three choices for the Well Known Prefix:
   o  reuse the IPv4-mapped prefix, ::FFFF:0:0/96, as specified in RFC
      2765 Section 2.1;
   o  request allocation of a new /96 prefix;
   o  or request IANA to allocate a /32 prefix.

   Each of these choices has pros and cons.  We expect this issue to be
   debated and resolved by the BEHAVE working group, and present here
   our analysis of the options.

   The main advantage of the existing IPv4-mapped prefix is that it is
   already defined.  Reusing that prefix will require minimal
   standardization efforts.  However, being already defined is not just
   and advantage, as there may be side effects of current
   implementations.  When presented with the IPv4-mapped prefix, several
   versions of Windows and MAcOS may generate IPv4 packets, but will not
   send IPv6 packets.  If we used the IPv4-mapped prefix, these hosts
   would not be able to support translation without modification.  This
   will defeat the main purpose of the translation techniques.

   Allocating a new prefix would diminish the risk of undesirable side
   effects in current implementations.  The main cost will be the
   registration cost with IANA.  We will also need to update the



Huitema, et al.          Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2009


   recommendation for textual representations of IPv6 addresses, if we
   want to ensure the dotted decimal representation of the IPv4
   component in the IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses.

   If we allocate a new prefix, choosing a /32 prefix would allow the
   embedded IPv4 address to fit within the top 64 bits of the IPv6
   address.  This would facilitate routing and load balancing when an
   organization deploys several translators.  However, such destination-
   address based load balancing may not be desirable, as it is not
   compatible with STUN in the deployments involving multiple stateful
   translators, each one having a different pool of IPv4 addresses.
   STUN compatibility would only be achieved if the translators managed
   the same pool of IPv4 addresses and were able to coordinate their
   translation state.

   We should also note that according to Section 2.2 of RFC 4291, in the
   legal textual representations of IPv6 addresses, dotted decimal can
   only appear at the end.  We could simply forego the dotted decimal
   notation, but that would make the address format harder to use, and
   log files harder to read.  We could also update RFC4291 to allow
   textual representation of addresses using the assigned WKP and having
   the interface identifier set to all zeros.  We could also embed the
   IPv4 address both in the last 32 bits of the interface identifier and
   the last 32 bits of the 64 bit prefix, allowing to use the textual
   representation as defined in RFC4291 and also have the possibility of
   including the IPv4 address in the prefix part.  Moreover, we could
   request for IANA to assign a /32 for the WKP and then operators could
   simply decide whether to use it as a /32 or pad it with zeros and use
   it as a /96.

   Allocating a new /96 prefix would not enable the same routing and
   load balancing options as a /32 prefix, but would allow for decimal
   notation of IPv4 addresses without requiring an update to RFC 4291.


4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Protection Against Spoofing

   By and large, address translators can be modeled as special routers,
   are subject to the same risks, and can implement the same mitigation.
   There is however a particular risk that directly derived from the
   practice of embedding IPv4 addresses in IPv6: address spoofing.

   An attacker could use an IPv4 embedded address as the source address
   of malicious packets.  After translation, the packets will appear as
   IPv4 packets from the specified source, and the attacker may be hard
   to track.  If left without mitigation, the attack would allow

   malicious IPv6 nodes to spoof arbitrary IPv4 addresses.

   The mitigation is to implement reverse path checks, and to verify
   throughout the network that packets are coming from an authorized
   location.

4.2.  Secure Configuration

   The prefix and format need to be the same among multiple devices in
   the same network (e.g., hosts that need to prefer native over
   translated addresses, DNS gateways, and IPv4/IPv6 translators).  As
   such, the means by which they are learned/configured must be secure.
   Specifying a default prefix and/or format in implementations provides
   one way to configure them securely.  Any alternative means of
   configuration is responsible for specifying how to do so securely.


5.  IANA Considerations

   A future version of this memo will request an IPv6 prefix assignment
   as a Well-Known Mapped Prefix, that is used to represent IPv4 hosts,
   and which must start with binary 000.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: 0/8 is reserved by the IETF (and not allocated by
   IANA), so all that is needed is to specify the prefix herein since it
   is an allocation from IETF not from IANA.]

   OPEN ISSUE: The prefix length of this block has not yet been
   determined.  Some possibilities are /16, /32, /48 or /96.
