Internet-Draft                P2PSIP RELAY                  October 2008


1.  Introduction

   RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive routing for routing messages
   and describes the extensions that would be required to support
   additional routing algorithms.This document proposes an extension to
   RELOAD to support two additional routing options: direct response and
   relay peer which are also discussed in section 3.3.1.3 and 3.3.1.4
   respectively in [I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload].Symmetric recursive routing
   will not work well in some cases.  For example, overlay churn will
   make the reverse path of the request unstable, therefore fail the
   transaction.  In these cases, direct response or relay peer would be
   helpful to improve the reliability and efficiency of the P2PSIP
   transaction.  So it is useful to make these three modes work together
   to provide better service to the upper layer applications on top of
   the P2PSIP overlay.  We analyze the problem statement first and try
   to address the concerns in RELOAD[I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload] about these
   two routing options.  Then, some methods are presented to show that
   it is feasible to discover NAT behavior in RELOAD architecture.  In
   section 7 the document discusses the methods to make direct response
   and relay peer routing mode work together with symmetric routing
   mode.  In the end, an extension to current RELOAD is proposed to make
   them work.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   We use the terminology and definitions from the Concepts and
   Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] draft
   extensively in this document.  We also use terms defined in NAT
   behavior discovery [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery].  Other
   terms used in this document are defined inline when used and are also
   defined below for reference.

   o  Direct Response Routing (DRR): refers to a routing mode in which
      responses to P2PSIP requests are returned to the sending peer
      directly from the destination peer based on the sending peer's own
      local transport addresses.  For simplicity, the abbreviation DRR
      is used instead in the following text.
   o  Relay Peer Routing (RPR): refers to a routing mode in which
      responses to P2PSIP requests are sent by the destination peer to a
      relay peer first who will further forward responses towards the
      sending peer.  For simplicity, the abbreviation RPR is used
      instead in the following text.

Internet-Draft                P2PSIP RELAY                  October 2008


   o  Symmetric Recursive Routing(SRR): refers to a routing mode in
      which responses follow the same request path in the reverse order
      to get back to the sending peer.  For simplicity, the SRR is used
      instead in the following text.
   o  publicly reachable: A node is publicly reachable if it can receive
      unsolicited messages from any other node in the same overlay.
      Note: "publicly" does not mean that the nodes MUST be on the
      public Internet, because RELOAD protocol may be used in a closed
      system.
   o  relay peer: a type of publicly reachable peers that can receive
      unsolicited messages from all other nodes in the overlay and
      forward the responses from destination peers towards the request
      sender.  For example, if peer A is behind a p2p-unfriendly NAT, he
      can use relay peers to traverse the NAT and get the response from
      the destination peer.


3.  Problem Statement

   P2PSIP WG intends to make RELOAD work under a number of application
   scenarios.  In reality, the situations where RELOAD is to be deployed
   differ greatly.  For instance, some systems will run in an overlay
   composed of only ten to hundred stable nodes.  On the other hand,
   overlays may experience heavy churn or comprise of nodes over 1
   million.  It is obvious that SRR currently adopted in RELOAD works
   well in the former case.  But for the latter case, SRR may not work
   well.

3.1.  Symmetric Route Stability

   As discussed in section 3.3.1.5 in RELAOD [I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload],
   one concern for the motivation to add DRR and RPR is, if there is a
   heavy churn in overlay, requests fail first.  That is, transactions
   failed before the requests reach the destination peer.  In this case,
   DRR and RPR won't bring any benefit for the transactions in that
   these two routing modes are used to avoid the churn influence on the
   response path.  RELOAD mentions that retries of the failed requests
   will reduce the influence of churn.  By using optional DRR and RPR
   the probability of failure due to churn is also reduced.

   In some literatures, for example [ChurnDHT], one way to handle churn
   in DHT is to get a more accurate timeout value between neighbors.
   When the timeout fires, the preferred way for the upstream peer to
   handle the failure is to try the request through another downstream
   peer, for there may be a large number of paths between a sending peer
   and a destination peer.  Therefore, the request success rate will be
   improved greatly.  This still leave open the issue of the response
   failure due to churn.

Internet-Draft                P2PSIP RELAY                  October 2008


   Through the above analysis, we can see that churn in request path
   could be solved to great extent by using existing mechanisms.  The
   DRR and RPR routing mode are still helpful for the responses to be
   resilient to the churn.

3.2.  Application Scenarios

   Overlay churn causes nodes or connections between neighbor nodes to
   be unstable.  If SRR is used for routing response, any failure of
   nodes or connections in the reverse path will fail the whole P2PSIP
   transaction.  So a transaction with longer response latency will be
   vulnerable to churn.  Below are two examples of overlays which
   produce slow response.

   o  P2P technology has been applied successfully in some global public
      VoIP services, such as Skype.  The number of the simultaneous
      online users for this type of system is often over 1 million.  For
      a typical overlay network, the lookup operation in P2P systems
      will end up with the hop counts within [0, log(N)].  Here, N is
      the number of nodes in the system.  For a system where N is over 1
      million, the maximum hop counts would be about 20.  For such a
      long path, the churn of the overlay will break the reverse path
      with high probability, for the failure of any node in the path
      would mean the failure of the reverse path, hence the failure of
      the transaction.
   o  If links of the overlay network are wireless link or some low
      speed links, the latency between links would be significantly
      long.  So messages will take longer to traverse the path back and
      forth and the nodes in the path are more easily subject to failure
      during the message transportation duration because of churn.

3.3.  Advantages from DRR and RPR

   DRR and RPR try to shorten the response path to a fixed number of
   hops and thus reducing the response time.  If DRR is used, the
   response path will be only 1 hop; if RPR is used, the response path
   will be 2 hops.  According to the suggestions in this draft, before
   the peer start to use the DRR or RPR, a test that decides whether the
   DRR or RPR could work should be performed.  In this way, it could
   mitigate the concerns about influence from the failure of the DRR and
   RPR.  The main benefit from adding the option to use DRR and RPR with
   SRR fall-back is that it will improve the success rate and
   reliability of the P2PSIP transaction, especially for the scenarios
   described in section 3.2.

4.  Concerns From RELOAD

   For the DRR and RPR routing modes, the RELOAD authors expressed
   several concerns in section 3.3.1.3 and section 3.3.1.4 in
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload] respectively.  This section attempts to
   address these concerns.

4.1.  Concerns About DRR

   o  Concern1: Due to NAT existence, DRR is subject to failure.  So it
      requires the destination peer to detect the failure and then
      fallback to SRR.
      *  Answer: The concern is on how the DRR works together with SRR.
         In this draft we suggest tests based on the NAT behavior
         discovery [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery] that will
         have good probability to find a publicly reachable address or a
         relay peer.  We can also offer flexibility in which routing
         mode will be the main one and which will be the fallback (SRR
         first or DRR/RPR first) .
   o  Concern2: Due to NAT filtering behavior, the NAT would drop the
      response if it is not a p2p-friendly NAT.
      *  Answer: This draft will introduce tests based on
         [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery] that the peer needs to
         do before the DRR is offered in order to discover NAT filtering
         behavior, so that the DRR will succeed with high probability.
   o  Concern3: The response happens to be received by another peer who
      is not the sending peer and hence it adds to the transaction
      latency.
      *  Answer: We think this is a rare case since this draft
         recommends a method to identify the NAT behavior
         [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery].  Even if it would
         happen, the method proposed in this draft allows the sending
         peer to decide which routing mode will be used first.  On the
         other hand, as we mentioned before in section 3.3, the main
         benefit from DRR is improving the transactions success rate in
         some cases, not only the transaction latency.

4.2.  Concerns About RPR

   o  Concern1: RPR requires the help from relay peers for the sending
      peer.  It is not easy to identify which category a peer is in.
      *  Answer: RPR does not intend to replace the SRR.  This draft
         propose RPR and DRR as an enhancement to the SRR.  As for the
         difficulty in identifying a peer's role, the draft suggests
         tests for NAT behavior discovery techniques based on
         [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery] under RELOAD
         architecture to achieve the goal.  So it is possible for a node
         in the overlay to detect its location relative to NAT.  Using

         peer as relays is also common in p2p network where peers can
         declare themselves as supernodes if they have a publicly
         reachable address.


5.  How To Identify The Role Of A Peer

   For DRR and RPR to function correctly, a peer should be able to
   determine whether it is publicly reachable or not.  If it is not, RPR
   may be used to route the response with the help from relay peers,
   otherwise, DRR may be offered.  NATs and firewalls are two major
   contributors preventing DRR and RPR from functioning properly.

   Draft [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery] proposed a STUN usage
   to discover NAT behavior.  The STUN usage needs a dedicated STUN
   server with multiple IP address or it must duplicate the behavior of
   such a dedicated STUN server with two nodes that share the role of
   providing the address-changing operations required by this usage.
   For DRR and RPR in P2P system, NAT address and port mapping and NAT
   filtering behaviors are the most important characteristics to be
   discovered.  So, in order to make DRR and RPR work, the peer needs to
   determine if the NAT with respect to the peer has a endpoint-
   independent mapping property and a endpoint-independent filtering
   property.

   At the same time, some conditions are unique in P2PSIP architecture
   which could be exploited to make the discovery easier.  For example,
   there are some public servers, such as enrollment servers, bootstrap
   servers, who could be used as an anchor to perform NAT behavior
   discovery tests when the node joins the overlay.  P2PSIP overlay has
   enough nodes which could provide help with the test when there is a
   need for receiving an unsolicited message from another address and
   port.

   The following text, details suggestions on how to discover NAT
   behavior in P2PSIP architecture.

5.1.  Discovery Of NAT Mapping Behavior

   In RELOAD architecture there are a couple of servers that may have a
   publicly reachable address that can be used for discovering the NAT
   mapping behavior.  The peer should look for endpoint independent
   mapping as a prerequisite to allow DDR or to be a relay peer.

   To do that we can use the enrollment server used to get the required
   information, such as node-id, overlay specific configuration, etc.
   Usually, the enrollment server is publicly reachable and could be
   contacted directly by any nodes in the system.  So it can act as an



Jiang & Even             Expires April 18, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                P2PSIP RELAY                  October 2008


   anchor to help nodes to learn whether it is on the same network as
   the enrollment server.  Besides enrollment server, there are other
   infrastructure servers in the system, depending on the real
   deployment.  For example, bootstrap servers or diagnostic servers may
   exist in some P2P system for management purpose.

   The methods a node uses to determine its location are various and
   depend on specific deployments.  One way is a node can use a variant
   of STUN during exchanges with one of the servers.  For example, when
   the node contacts with the enrollment server, the enrollment server
   could reflect the source transport address of the messages from the
   node, and convey it to the node in the response.  The node compares
   its local transport address with the reflexive address in the
   response, and then makes the final determination.  Another way is to
   use the STUN protocol as described in the NAT behavior discovery
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery].  All nodes and server in
   the P2P system need to support STUN.  In either way, the peer could
   learn through the above procedure whether the NAT has a endpoint-
   independent mapping behavior or not.  Another method to get a
   reachable address can be based on NAT assisted methods like UPnP as
   suggested in [I-D.lowekamp-mmusic-ice-tcp-framework]

5.2.  Discovery Of NAT Filtering Behavior

   After discovering NAT mapping behavior is endpoint-independent, a
   node needs to continue with discovery of the NAT filtering behavior.
   The proposed test in [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery]requires
   the STUN server has multiple addresses or if a few STUN servers with
   single address are involved, require coordination among them to
   complete the test.  The test described in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery] is applicable to UDP while
   for RELAOD we need to use TCP address.  In P2PSIP system, we can take
   advantage of the fact that a peer has a built-in mechanism to talk
   with other nodes with whom he has not contacted before, the routing
   function in the P2P algorithm can route the request to any peer in
   the overlay who is responsible for a key in a request.  We can use
   this functionality to define a test for the NAT filtering behavior.

   If a node could receive messages from other nodes with whom it does
   not have a connection, then the remote node could help the testing if
   the NAT has an endpoint-independent filtering behavior.  In current
   P2PSIP architecture, a node can easily know whether it has existing
   connections with the unsolicited message sender, for any node
   maintains a connection table.  The peer that wants to learn its NAT
   filtering behavior can send a request for a key in order to learn
   from the responder the filtering behavior of the NAT.

   In the above description, we assume the destination peer has no



Jiang & Even             Expires April 18, 2009                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                P2PSIP RELAY                  October 2008


   direct connections with the node in question before sending the
   response.  But there are a few rare cases where the assumption does
   not hold.  One case is the request only traverses one hop so that the
   destination peer is the direct neighbor with the node; another case
   is the destination peer happens to be the neighbor of the node even
   if the request traverses several hops.  It often depends on the key
   set in the request.  Two methods can address the above problem.

   The first one is to have the sending node make the judgment because
   every node has a connection table.  For example, when the sending
   node receives the response from a peer, it should check whether the
   response came over an existing connection or not.  If yes, then the
   sending peer should try another key and perform another test.

   The second one is to make a little modification to the way the test
   message is routed.  In conventional P2P algorithms, the next hop is
   often determined by looking up the key in the routing table and the
   closest node will be chosen accordingly.  But for the test purpose,
   the request is not really for STORE or FETCH values to/from the
   overlay.  Its real purpose is to find a peer in the overlay with whom
   the peer has no connection.  In a sense, intermediate peers need not
   route the message according to the conventional routing algorithm.
   Instead, they could do the random routing which is irrelevant to the
   key in a request.  So the peer who has no direct connection with the
   sending peer would be considered as the destination peer and then
   sends the response directly to the sending peer.  In the second
   method, the test message is resilient to overlay churn, for the
   routing is based on the random choice.  Moreover it also means that
   we need to define a new message to perform the test and that all
   intermediate peers should know how to process the request.


6.  Discovery Of Relay Peer

   In order to support RPR, a node who is behind p2p-unfriendly NAT must
   have one or more relay peers to help him receive response from
   destination peers.  The major requirement for relay peers is that
   they should be publicly reachable.  By using the methods proposed in
   section 5, a peer could determine whether it is publicly reachable,
   i,e, with an endpoint-independent mapping and filtering behavior.

   Generally, P2PSIP overlay needs a service discovery mechanism by
   means of which the node in the overlay could find which peers can
   provide which kind of service.  The capability of the relay peers
   could be defined as a service and discovering relay peers means that
   peers use the general service mechanism to find which peer can
   provide relay peer capability.

7.  Relationship Between SRR And DRR/RPR

   DRR/RPR and SRR have their advantages and disadvantages.  A major
   issue should be addressed before we design ways to combine these two
   kinds of routing modes.  It is in which order the DRR/RPR or SRR is
   attempted.  In order to make full use of advantages of every routing
   mode, the peer should decide which one is tried first.  There are
   several strategies.  If a peer wants to get quick response, it can
   try DRR/RPR first; if failed, then fallback to SRR.  In this draft,
   DRR/RPR test SHOULD be passed before DRR/RPR is used for message
   routing so that DRR/RPR would work with high success rate.  On the
   other hand, a peer can also try SRR first and then DRR/RPR would be
   used as a fallback.  This draft does not mandate which order will be
   used.  It depends on specific scenarios.  This draft just provides
   available tools to give the peers different choices to deal with
   different situations.  The decision if to use DRR/RPR first can also
   be based on past success percentage of this mode. .


8.  Extensions To RELOAD

   Adding the support of DRR and RPR requires extensions to the current
   RELOAD.  In this section, first we show the steps taken by a node in
   order to use DRR and RPR.  Then based on the results, we could point
   out the difference from the current RELOAD and define the required
   extensions.

8.1.  Steps For Running DRR/RPR

   DRR and RPR may fail in the presence of NAT.  So in order to improve
   the success rate of DRR and RPR, we need to do some necessary tests
   before a node can use it.  Below are the required steps to make DRR
   and RPR work.

   1.  When a peer X joins the overlay, it uses proposed mechanism in
       section 5.1 to determine its NAT mapping behavior.
   2.  After X becomes a full-functional peer in the overlay, If the
       previous test shows that his NAT has a endpoint-independent
       mapping behavior, he will continue with the proposed mechanism in
       section 5.2 to determine its NAT filtering behavior.
   3.  Based on the above two tests, if peer X learns that it is behind
       a p2p-friendly NAT or non-NATed, i,e, endpoint-independent
       mapping and filtering behavior, the peer could try DRR in the
       future message.  Moreover, he is also a candidate to be a relay
       peer.  In order to adapt to the change of NAT mapping and
       filtering, peer X SHOULD periodically perform the tests.

Internet-Draft                P2PSIP RELAY                  October 2008


   4.  If peer X is behind a p2p-unfirendly NAT, peer X tries to get
       relay peers with service discovery mechanism.  Peer X should try
       to attach to one of the relay peers to verify that it can use it
       as a relay.
   5.  Peer X can offer DRR or RPR respectively depending on peer X
       location with regard to NAT.  This offer is done by adding
       extensive_routing_mode structure in the forawdingHeader to each
       request and using the preference flag in the
       extensive_routing_mode structure to specify if SRR or DRR/RPR are
       to be used first.  If the preference flag equals to 0 then DRR/
       RPR should be tried first otherwise SRR should be used first.

8.2.  Needed Modifications To RELOAD

   In order to support the DRR/RPR, we need to make the following
   modifications to RELOAD.

   1.  Define a forwarding option in the forward header to indicate
       which routing mode can be used.  Depending on different routing
       mode, the information in the option value field is different.
       For example, if DRR is used, the information about sending nodes
       MUST be included; If RPR is used, the information about the send
       node's relay peers MUST be included.
   2.  Define a new message to perform tests that will be used to detect
       NAT filtering behavior and to test whether DRR or RPR works.  In
       this draft, the new message is named RM_TEST( Routing Mode Test
       ).
   3.  Add a new flag bit (hop-by-hop flag: 0x04) in the flags field in
       the forward header.  This flag is used to indicate to the
       intermediate peers that they need to know the semantics of the
       message and take some actions accordingly.  As mentioned in
       section 5.2, in order to make sure the destination peer has no
       direct connection with the sending peer, every intermediate peer
       determines whether it has existing connections with the sending
       peer.  So it requires the intermediate peers involvement to
       achieve the test.  Of course, it could use other methods from
       section 5.2 to avoid define a new flag.  At this stage, we think
       the flag is useful, but it is subject to change depending on
       working group's consensus.

8.3.  New Message RM_TEST

   RM_TEST serves two purposes: detecting NAT filtering behavior and
   checking whether DRR or RPR works.  The following is the normative
   procedure for processing the RM_TEST.

Internet-Draft                P2PSIP RELAY                  October 2008


8.3.1.  Detecting NAT Filtering Behavior

   In order to detect NAT filtering behavior, the sending peer MUST
   determine whether his NAT has a endpoint-independent mapping behavior
   first as specified in [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-behavior-discovery].  Then
   sending peer sets the routing mode as DRR in the forwarding header,
   in which one of the sending peer's reflexive transport address is
   also carried.  It is REQUIRED that in each test message, only one
   reflexive transport address is included.  At the same time, set the
   hop-by-hop flag 0x04 in the forwarding header.  The key in the
   destination list SHOULD be a random one.

   [ Open issue: because the RM_TEST message is not for real data or
   management operations, just for a test, do we need a specialized ID
   which indicates to the intermediate peers that the destination peer
   for the message depends on the semantics of the message type? ]

   When an intermediate peer receives the message, it checks the hop-by-
   hop flags first.  If the flag is set, then get the message type.  If
   the message type is RM_TEST, get the routing mode and its associated
   information, i,e, transport address information.  If the intermediate
   peer has no existing connections with the sending peer after checking
   its connection table based on the node-id, then he can act as the
   destination peer for the RM_TEST message, constructs a response and
   sends directly to the sending peer.  If the intermediate peer has
   existing connections, it forwards the request further.

   The sending peer waits for the RM_TEST response by setting a
   retransmission timer.  If the response succeeds in returning to the
   sending peer, the sending peer can determine that his NAT has
   endpoint-independent filtering behavior.  To avoid the unreliability
   of the underlying network, the sending peer will try the RM_TEST
   several times before he gives up the test.

8.3.2.  RPR Procedure

   If a peer is behind a p2p-unfriendly NAT after doing the NAT behavior
   tests, and would like to offer RPR it MUST get relay peers first.  A
   peer that declared itself as a relay peer have already done the NAT
   behavior tests and have at least a publicly reachable address.
   Furthermore a peer may learn about more than one available relay
   peers.

   After getting the information of relay peers, the peer uses Attach
   method to establish direct connections with one of the possible relay
   peers.  A relay peer may reject the Attach request if it is currently
   loaded, in this case the peer may try another relay peer.  When a
   peer attached to a relay peer it can now offer RPR.

8.4.  Modification To RELOAD Message Structure

   Some necessary modifications to RELOAD message structure are
   explained in the following text.

   This draft defines a new forwarding option in the ForwardingHeader
   structure.  The new forwarding option must conform to the structure
   defined in section 6.2.2.3 in [I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload].

   type : 0x1 extensive_routing_mode

   flag: 0x02 DESTINATION_CRITICAL

   The option value will be illustrated in the following figure.
        enum { 0x0, 0x01 (DRR), 0x02(RPR), 255} RouteMode;


        struct {
           RouteMode               routemode;

           uint8                   preference;

           Transport               transport;

           Destination             destination<1..2>;

           IpAddreessPort          ipaddressport;

         } Extensive_Routing_Mode;

   The above structure reuses: Transport, Destination and IpAddressPort
   structure defined in section 6.2.1.1 and 6.2.2.1 in
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload] respectively.  The node-id in Destination
   structure is useful to match the existing connections.

   routemode: refers to which kind of routing mode is preferred to be
   used among extensive routing modes.  Currently, only DRR and RPR are
   defined.

   preference: refers to which kind of routing mode the destination peer
   will try first. 0x1 means SRR first, 0x0 means the extensive routing
   mode will be tried first;

   Transport: refers to the transport type which will be used to deliver
   the response from the destination peer to the sending peer or the
   relay peer;

   Destination: refers to the relay peer or the sending peer itself.  If

   routing type is DRR, then the destination will contains the sending
   peer's node-id; If routing type is RPR, then the destination will
   contains two destinations, which are the relay peer's node-id and the
   sending peer's node-id;

   IpAddressPort: refers to the transport address the destination has to
   use to send the response to.

8.5.  Request And Response Processing

   This section gives normative text on the normal message processing
   after DRR and RPR are introduced.  Here, we only describe the
   additional procedures for supporting DRR and RPR and please refer to
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload] for RELOAD base procedures.

8.5.1.  Sending Reqeust And Receiving Response

   If a peer can offer DRR, it MUST fill the extensive_routing_mode
   option first defined in section 8.4 before sending the request out.
   The routing mode MUST be set to 0x1(DRR); the preference MUST be 0 or
   1 which depends on the choice of the sending peer.  If the peer wants
   to try DRR first, then the field MUST be set to 0; otherwise 1.  The
   destination carries the sending peer node-id and the ipaddressport
   MUST carry only one transport address which has been tested.

   If a peer can offer RPR, it MUST fill extensive_routing_mode option
   too.  Routing mode MUST be set to 0x2(RPR).  The preference MUST be
   set to 0 or 1 depending on the choice of the sending peer.  The
   destination MUST hold one relay peer's node-id and the sending peer's
   node-id in a sequential order.  The ipaddressport MUST carry one of
   the relay peer's transport address which has been tested.

   For receving response, the peer follows the rule in
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-reload].

8.5.2.  Receiving Request And Sending Response

   When the destination peer receives a request, it will check the
   options in the forwarding header.  If the destination peer can
   understand extensive_routing_mode option, it will check the
   preference first, if the preference shows SRR first, then the peer
   will use the SRR to return the response.

   If the preference shows DRR/RPR first, then the peer check the
   routing mode. if the routing mode is DRR, then the peer constructs
   the Destination lists with only one entry, i,e, the sending peer
   node-id in the option; if the routing mode is RPR, then the peer
   construct Destination list with two entries, one is the relay peer

   node-id got from the option, the other one is the sending peer
   node-id which is also carried in the option in RPR case.

   After the peer construct the destination list, if the peer will use
   DRR or RPR, then they will send the response to the transport address
   which is indicated in the ipaddressport field in the option using the
   specific transport mode in the option.


9.  An Example

   In this section, we will illustrate how a peer uses the DRR or RPR to
   route messages.  In the following illustration, we use SP for sending
   peer, IP for intermediate peer, DP for destination peer, RP for relay
   peer; The letter H in the figure refers to hop-by-hop flag in the
   forwarding header.

   1.  Detect the NAT filtering behavior

      SP                     IP                     DP

       |   RM_TEST(DRR | H)   |                      |
       |--------------------->|                      |
       |                      |     RM_TEST(DRR | H) |
       |                      |--------------------->|
       |                      |                      |
       |                      |                      |
       |     RM_TEST Resp     |                      |
       |<--------------------------------------------|
       |                      |                      |
   SP sends a RM_TEST request and set the DRR routing mode and hop-by-
   hop flag in the request.  IP will forward the request until the
   intermediate peer checks that it has no existing connections with SP,
   then it changes its role to DP.  Finally, DP sends a RM_TEST response
   back to the SP.

   2.  Sending other messages than RM_TEST with DRR or RPR

        |             |                |              |
   The above figures show how DRR and RPR are used to route normal
   message.  The major difference from RM_TEST is that hop-by-hop flag
   is not required.  It may depend on the message in use.
