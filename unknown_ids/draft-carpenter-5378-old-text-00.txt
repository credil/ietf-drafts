1.  Procedure

   RFC 5378 [RFC5378] overlooked one case.  This is when a contribution
   submitted under RFC 5378 contains material derived from one or more
   contributions submitted prior to RFC 5378, and it has proved
   impossible, after reasonable efforts, to obtain the agreement of the
   original contributors to the specific additional rights required to
   be granted to the IETF under RFC 5378 compared with those granted
   under previous IETF rules.  In this case the document cannot be
   published consistently with RFC 5378.

   This can arise when the original contributors, or their assigns, are
   unwilling, unresponsive, unfindable, deceased, or no longer in
   business.

   Prior to approving such a document, the IESG must be satisfied that
   its authors or editors have made reasonable efforts to obtain the
   necessary agreements.  If such is the case, the resulting document,
   and any IETF Last Call message concerning the document, must contain
   a special disclaimer.  The current text of the disclaimer will be
   specified by the IETF Trust's "Legal Provisions Relating to IETF
   Documents", originally located at
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html>.  The initial text
   is in the Appendix below.

   This same disclaimer must be included in Internet-Drafts as soon as
   the authors or editors become reasonably and personally aware that it
   applies, even if efforts to obtain the rights are in progress.

   The IETF Trust is requested to ensure that its policies and licenses
   allow for documents including this disclaimer.

   Additionally, such documents and Internet-Drafts should contain an
   acknowledgement of the predecessor documents from which such material
   was extracted.


2.  Security Considerations

   This document does not affect the security of the Internet.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no action by the IANA.

5.1.  Normative References

   [RFC5378]  Bradner, S. and J. Contreras, "Rights Contributors Provide
              to the IETF Trust", BCP 78, RFC 5378, November 2008.

5.2.  Informative References

Appendix A.  Initial version of disclaimer

   The current valid version should be taken from the IETF Trust's
   "Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents", originally located at
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html>.  The initial
   version was:

   "This document contains material from IETF Documents or IETF
   Contributions published before November 10, 2008 and, to the
   Contributor's knowledge, the person(s) controlling the copyright in
   such material have not granted the IETF Trust the right to allow
   modifications of such material outside the IETF Standards Process.
   Without obtaining an adequate license from the person(s) controlling
   the copyright, this document may not be modified outside the IETF
   Standards Process, and derivative works of it may not be created
   outside the IETF Standards Process, except to format it for
   publication as an RFC and to translate it into languages other than
   English."
