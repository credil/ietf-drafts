    <abstract> <t>The emerging and growing deployment of IPv6 networks will 
    introduce cases where connectivity with IPv4 networks crossing IPv6 transit 
    backbones is desired. This document describes a mechanism for automatic 
    discovery and creation of IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels via extensions to multi-
    protocol BGP. It is targeted at connecting islands of IPv4 networks across 
    an IPv6-only backbone without the need for a manually configured overlay of 
    tunnels. The mechanisms described in this document have been implemented, 
    tested and deployed on the large research IPv6 network in China. </t> 
    </abstract> </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Due to the lack of IPv4 address space, more and more IPv6 networks
      have been deployed not only on edge networks, but also on backbone networks. 
      However, there are still a large number of legacy IPv4 hosts and applications. 
      As a result, IPv6 networks and IPv4 applications/hosts will have to coexist 
      for a long period of time.</t>
      
      <t>The emerging and growing deployment of IPv6 networks will introduce 
      cases where connectivity with IPv4 networks is desired. Some IPv6 
      backbones will need to offer transit services to attached IPv4 access 
      networks. The method to achieve this would be to encapsulate and then 
      transport the IPv4 payloads inside IPv6 tunnels spanning the backbone. 
      There are some IPv6/IPv4-related tunneling protocols and mechanisms 
      defined in the literature. But at the time that the mechanism described in 
      this document was introduced, most of these existing techniques focus on 
      the problem of IPv6 over IPv4, rather than the case of IPv4 over IPv6. 
      Encapsulation methods alone, such as that defined in <xref 
      target="RFC2473"></xref>, require manual configuration in order to 
      operate. When a large number of tunnels are necessary, manual 
      configuration can become burdensome. To the above problem, this document 
      describes an approach, referred to as "4over6".</t>

      <t>The 4over6 mechanism concerns two aspects: the control plane and the
      data plane. The control plane needs to address the problem of how to
      setup an IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel in an automatic and scalable fashion
      between a large number of edge routers. This document defines extensions
      to MP-BGP employed to communicate tunnel end-point information and
      establish 4over6 tunnels between dual-stack Provider Edge (PE) routers
      positioned at the edge of the IPv6 backbone network. Once the 4over6
      tunnel is in place, the data plane focuses on the packet forwarding
      processes of encapsulation and decapsulation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="4over6 Framework Overview">
      <t>In the topology shown in figure 1, a number of IPv6-only P routers
      compose a native IPv6 backbone. The PE routers are dual-stack and
      referred to as 4over6 PE routers. The IPv6 backbone acts as a transit
      core to transport IPv4 packets across the IPv6 backbone. This enables
      each of IPv4 access islands to communicate with each other via 4over6
      tunnels spanning the IPv6 transit core.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>As shown in figure 1, there are multiple dual-stack PE routers 
      connected to the IPv6 transit core. In order for the ingress 4over6 PE 
      router to forward an IPv4 packet across the IPv6 backbone to the correct 
      egress 4over6 PE router, the ingress 4over6 PE router must learn which 
      IPv4 destination prefixes are reachable through each egress 4over6 PE 
      router. MP-BGP will be extended to distribute the destination IPv4 prefix 
      information between peering dual-stack PE routers. Section 4 of this 
      document presents the definition of the 4over6 protocol field in MP-BGP 
      and section 5 describes MP-BGP's extended behavior in support of this 
      capability.</t>

      <t>After the ingress 4over6 PE router learns the correct egress 4over6 PE 
      router via MP-BGP, it will forward the packet across the IPv6 backbone 
      using IP encapsulation. The egress 4over6 PE router will receive the 
      encapsulated packet, remove the IPv6 header and then forward the original 
      IPv4 packet to its final IPv4 destination. Section 6 describes the 
      procedure of packet forwarding.</t> </section>

    <section title="Prototype Implementation">
      <t>An implementatoin of the 4over6 mechanisms described in this document
      was developed, tested and deployed on Linux with kernel version 2.4. The
      prototype system is composed of three components: packet forwarding, the
      encapsulation table and MP-BGP extensions. The packet forwarding and
      encapsulation table are Linux kernel modules and the MP-BGP extension
      was developed by extending Zebra routing software.</t>

      <t>The following sections will discuss these parts in detail.</t>

      <section title="4over6 Packet Forwarding">
      
        <t>Forwarding an IPv4 packet through the IPv6 transit core includes 3 
        parts: encapsulation of the incoming IPv4 packet with the IPv6 tunnel 
        header; transmission of the encapsulated packet over the IPv6 transit 
        backbone; and decapsulation of the IPv6 header and forwarding of the 
        original IPv4 packet. Native IPv6 routing and forwarding are employed in 
        the backbone network since the P routers take the 4over6 tunneled 
        packets as just native IPv6 packets. Therefore, 4over6 packet forwarding 
        involves only the encapsulation process and the decapsulation process, 
        both of which are peformed on the 4over6 PE routers.</t>

      <section title="Encapsulation table">
        <t>Each 4over6 PE router maintains an encapsulation table as depicted
        in Figure 4. Each entry in the encapsulation table consists of an IPv4
        prefix and its corresponding IPv6 address. The IPv4 prefix is a particular network
        located in an IPv4 access island network. The IPv6 address is the
        4over6 virtual interface (VIF) address of the 4over6 PE router that
        the IPv4 prefix is reachable through. The encapsulation table is built
        and maintained using local configuration information and MP-BGP
        advertisements received from remote 4over6 PE routers.</t>

        <t>The 4over6 VIF is an IPv6 /128 address that is locally configured
        on each 4over6 router. This address, as an ordinary global IPv6 address,
        must also be injected into the
        IPv6 IGP so that it is reachable across the IPv6 backbone.</t>

        <t></t>

        <t>When an IPv4 packet arrives at the ingress 4over6 PE router, a
        lookup in the local IPv4 routing table will result in a pointer to the
        local encapsulation table entry with the matching destination IPv4
        prefix. There is a corresponding IPv6 address in the encapsulation table.
        The IPv4 packet is encapsulated in an IPv6 header. The source
        address in the IPv6 header is the IPv6 VIF address of the local 4over6 PE
        router and the destination address is the IPv6 VIF address of the remote
        4over6 PE router contained in the local encapsulation table. The
        packet is then subjected to normal IPv6 forwarding for transport
        across the IPv6 backbone.</t>

        <t>When the encapsulated packet arrives at the egress 4over6 PE
        router, the IPv6 header is removed and the original IPv4 packet is forwarded to
        the destination IPv4 network based on the outcome of the lookup in the
        IPv4 routing table contained in the egress 4over6 PE router.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MP-BGP 4over6 Protocol Extensions">
        <t>Each 4over6 PE router possesses an IPv4 interface connected to an
        IPv4 access network(s). It can peer with other IPv4 routers using IGP
        or BGP routing protocols to exchange local IPv4 routing information.
        Routing information can also be installed on the 4over6 PE router
        using static configuration methods.</t>

        <t>Each 4over6 PE also possesses at least one IPv6 interface to
        connect it into the IPv6 transit backbone. The 4over6 PE typically
        uses IGP routing protocols to exchange IPv6 backbone routing
        information with other IPv6 P routers. The 4over6 PE router will also
        form an MP-iBGP peering relationship with other 4over6 PE routers
        connected to the IPv6 backbone network.</t>

        <t>The use of MP-iBGP suggests that the participating 4over6 PE
        routers that share a route reflector or form a full mesh of TCP
        connections are contained in the same autonomous system (AS). This
        implementation is in fact only deployed over a single AS. This was not
        an intentional design constraint but rather reflected the single AS
        topology of the CNGI-CERNET2 national IPv6 backbone used in the
        testing and deployment of this solution.</t>

        <section title="Receiving Routing Information from Local CE">
          <t>When a 4over6 PE router learns routing information from the
          locally attached IPv4 access networks, the 4over6 MP-iBGP entity
          should process the information as follows:</t>

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Install and maintain local IPv4 routing information in the
            IPv4 routing database.</t>

            <t>Install and maintain new entries in encapsulation table. Each
            entry should consist of the IPv4 prefix and the local IPv6 VIF

            <t>Advertise the new contents of the local encapsulation table in the form of
            MP_REACH_NLRI update information to remote 4over6 PE routers. The

              <list style="symbols">

                <t>Network Address of Next Hop = IPv6 address of its 4over6 VIF</t>
              </list>
            
            <t>A new SAFI for this solution was obtained as SAFI_4OVER6 (67) from IANA.
            We call BGP update with SAFI being 67 as 4over6 routing information.</t>

        <section title="Receiving 4over6 Routing Information from a remote 4over6 PE">
          <t>A local 4over6 PE router will receive MP_REACH_NLRI updates from

          correctness of the received attribute, the following procedures are
          used to update the local encapsulation table and redistribute to local
          IPv4 routing table:</t>

          <list style="numbers">
	    <t>Validate the received BGP update packet as 4over6 routing information
	    by AFI = 1 (IPv4) and SAFI = 67 (4OVER6)</t>

	    <t>Extract the IPv4 network address from the NLRI field and
	    install as the IPv4 network prefix</t>
	
	    <t>Extract the IPv6 address from the Network Address of the Next
	    Hop field and place that as an associated entry next to the IPv4
	    network index. (Note this describes the update of local encap
	    table.)</t>
	      
            <t>Install and maintain a new entry in encapsulation table with the 
            extracted IPv4 prefix and its corresponding IPv6 address.</t>
            
            <t>Redistribute the new 4over6 routing information to local IPv4 
            routing table. Set the destination network prefix as the extracted 
            IPv4 prefix, set the Next Hop as Null, and Set the OUTPUT Interface
            as the 4over6 VIF on the local 4over6 PE router.</t>
          </list>
          
          <t>Therefore, when an ingress 4over6 PE router receives an IPv4 packet,
          the lookup in its IPv4 routing table will have a result of the output
          interface as the local 4over6 VIF, where the incoming IPv4 packet will 
          be encapsulated with a new IPv6 header as indicated in the 
          encapsulation table.</t>

        <t>A prototype of the 4over6 solution is implemented and deployed on
        CNGI-CERNET2. CNGI-CERNET2 is one of the China Next Generation
        Internet (CNGI) backbones, operated by the China Education and
        Research Network (CERNET). CNGI-CERNET2 connects approximately 25 core
        nodes distributed in 20 cities in China at speeds of 2.5-10 Gb/s. The
        CNGI-CERNET2 backbone is IPv6-only with some attached customer premise
        networks (CPN) being dual-stack. The CNGI-CERNET2 backbone, attached
        CNGI-CERNET2 CPNs, and CNGI-6IX Exchange all have globally unique AS
        numbers. This IPv6 backbone is used to provide transit IPv4 services
        for customer IPv4 networks connected via 4over6 PE routers to the
        backbone.</t>

        <t>The IPv4-only access networks are equipped with servers and clients
        running different applications. The 4over6 PE routers are deployed at
        8 x IPv6 nodes of CNGI-CERNET2, located in 7 universities and 5 cities
        across China. As suggested in figure 5 some of the IPv4 access
        networks are connected to both IPv6 and IPv4 networks and others are
        only connected to the IPv6 backbone. In the deployment, users in
        different IPv4 networks can communicate with each other through 4over6
        tunnels.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deployment Experiences">
        <t>A number of 4over6 PE routers were deployed and configured to
        support the 4over6 transit solution. MP-BGP peerings were established,
        and successful distribution of 4over6 SAFI information occured.
        Inspection of the BGP routing and encapsulation tables confirmed that
        the correct entries were sent and received. ICMP ping traffic
        indicated that IPv4 packets were successfully transiting the IPv6
        backbone.</t>

        <t>In addition other application protocols were successfully tested
        per the following: </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>HTTP. A client running Internet Explorer in one IPv4
            client network was able to access and download multiple objects
            from an HTTP server located in another IPv4 client network. </t>

            <t>P2P. BitComet software running on several PCs placed in
            different IPv4 client networks were able to find each other and
            share files. </t>
          </list>Other protocols, including FTP, SSH, IM(MSN, GTalk) and
        Multimedia Streaming, all functioned correctly. </t>

        <t> </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Relationship to Softwires Mesh Effort">
    
      <t>The 4over6 solution was presented at the IETF Softwires Working Group 
      Interim meeting in Hong Kong in January 2006. The existence of this large-
      scale implementation and deployment clearly showed that MP-BGP could be 
      employed to support tunnel setup in a scalable fashion across an IPv6 
      backbone. Perhaps most important was the use-case presented, that being an 
      IPv6 backbone offering transit to attached client IPv4 networks.</t>

      <t>The 4over6 solution can be viewed as a precursor to softwires mesh 
      framework. However there are several differences with this solution and 
      the effort that emerged from the softwires working group called softwires 
      mesh framework <xref target="RFC5565"></xref>.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
      
          <t>MP-BGP Extensions. 4over6 employs a new SAFI (4OVER6) to convey 
          client IPv4 prefixes between 4over6 PE routers. Softwires Mesh retains 
          original AFI-SAFI designations but uses a modified MP_REACH_NLRI 
          format to convey IPv4 NLRI prefix information with an IPv6 next_hop 
          address <xref target="RFC5549"></xref>. </t>

          <t>Encapsulation. 4over6 assumes IP-in-IP or it is possible to 
          configure GRE. Softwires uses those two scenarios configured locally 
          or for IP headers that require dynamic updating. As a result, the BGP 
          encap safi is introduced in Softwires 
          <xref target="RFC5512"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Multicast. The basic 4over6 solution only implemented unicast
          communications. The multicast communications is specified in the 
          Softwire Mesh Framework, and also supported by the multicast 
          extension of 4over6.</t>

          <t>Use-Cases. The 4over6 solution in this document specifies the 
          4over6 use-case, which is also pretty easy to extend for the use-case 
          of 6over4. The softwires mesh framework supports both 4over6 and 
          6over4. </t>
          
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>A new SAFI value (67) was assigned by IANA for 4over6 BGP extension:
      SAFI_4OVER6.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    
      <t>Tunneling mechanisms, especially automatic ones, often have potential 
      problems of DDoS attacks on the tunnel-entry point or tunnel-end point. As 
      the advantage, 4over6 BGP extension don't allocate resources to a single 
      flow or maintain the state for a flow. However, since the IPv6 tunnel 
      endpoints are globally reachable IPv6 addresses, it would be trivial to 
      spoof IPv4 packets by encapsulating and sending them over IPv6 to the 
      tunnel interface. This could bypass IPv4 RPF or other antispoofing 
      techniques. Also, any IPv4 filters may be bypassed.</t>
      
      <t>I-BGP peering relationship may be maintained over IPSec or other secure 
      communications.</t>
      
      <t></t>

      
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusion">
      <t>The emerging and growing deployment of IPv6 networks, in particular
      IPv6 backbone networks, will introduce cases where connectivity with
      IPv4 networks is desired. Some IPv6 backbones will need to offer transit
      services to attached IPv4 access networks. The 4over6 solution outlined
      in this document supports such a capability through an extension to
      MP-BGP to convey IPv4 routing information along with an associated IPv6
      address. Basic IP encapsulation is used in the dataplane as IPv4 packets
      are tunneled through the IPv6 backbone. </t>

      <t>An actual implemention has been developed and deployed on the
      CNGI-CERNET2 IPv6 backbone. </t>
