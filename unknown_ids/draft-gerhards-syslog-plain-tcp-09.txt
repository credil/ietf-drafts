                Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP
                 draft-gerhards-syslog-plain-tcp-09.txt

Abstract

   There have been many implementations and deployments of legacy syslog
   over TCP for many years.  That protocol has evolved without being
   standardized and has proven to be quite interoperable in practice.
   The aim of this specification is to explain how TCP has been used as
   a transport for syslog messages.

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP       July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Historically, the syslog protocol [RFC3164] has been run over UDP.
   This has been replaced with the standardized syslog protocol
   [RFC5424] in which the TLS transport [RFC5425] is required.  Even so,
   there are many instances of syslog running atop TCP [RFC0793].

   Two primary format options have been observed with legacy syslog
   being transported over TCP.  These have been called octet-stuffing
   and octet-counting.  The octet-stuffing mechanism has some inherent
   problems.

   Diagram 1 shows how all of these syslog transports relate to each
   other.  In this diagram three originators are seen, labeled A, B, and
   C, along with one collector.  Originator A is using the TCP transport
   which is described in this document.  Originator B is using the UDP
   transport which is described in [RFC5426].  Originator C is using the
   TLS transport which is described in [RFC5425].  The collector is
   shown with the capability to accept all three transports.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The terminology defined in Section 3 of [RFC5424] is used throughout
   this specification.  The reader should be familiar with that to
   follow this discussion.

   This document also references devices that use the syslog message
   format as described in [RFC3164].  Devices that continue to use that
   message format (regardless of transport) will be described as "legacy
   syslog devices".  Similarly, devices that use the message format as
   described in [RFC5424] will be described as "standardized syslog
   devices".


3.  Message Transmission

   Syslog is simplex in nature.  It has been observed that
   implementations of syslog over TCP also do not use any backchannel
   mechanism to convey information to the transport sender, and
   consequently do not use any application-level acknowledgement for
   syslog receiver to sender signaling.  Message receipt
   acknowledgement, reliability, and flow control are provided by the
   capabilities of TCP.

3.1.  Session

   A syslog over TCP session is a TCP connection between a syslog
   transport sender and a syslog transport receiver.  The syslog
   transport sender is the TCP host that initiates the TCP session.
   After initiation, messages are sent from the transport sender to the
   transport receiver.  No application-level data is transmitted from
   the transport receiver to the transport sender.  The roles of
   transport sender and receiver seem to be fixed once the session is
   established.

   If an error occurs that cannot be corrected by TCP, the host
   detecting the error gracefully closes the TCP session.  There have
   been no application level messages seen that were sent to notify the
   other host about the state of the host syslog application.

3.2.  Session Initiation

   The TCP host that intends to act as a syslog transport receiver
   listens to TCP port <TBD>.  The TCP host that intends to act as the
   transport sender initiates a TCP session to the syslog transport
   receiver as specified in [RFC0793].

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP       July 2011


3.3.  Message Transfer

   Syslog over TCP has been around for a number of years.  Just like
   legacy syslog over UDP, different implementations exist.  The older
   method of octet-stuffing has problems.  The newer method of octet-
   counting is reliable and is usually preferred.

   In both of these methods, during the message transfer phase, the
   syslog transport sender sends a stream of messages to the transport
   receiver.  These are sent in sequence and one message is encapsulated
   inside each TCP frame.  Either of the TCP hosts may initiate session
   closure at any time as specified in Section 3.5 of [RFC0793].  In
   practice, this is often seen after a prolonged period of inactivity.

3.3.1.  Octet Counting

   This framing allows for the transmission of all characters inside a
   syslog message and is similar to the method used in [RFC5425].  A
   transport receiver uses the defined message length to delimit a
   syslog message.  As noted in [RFC3164] the upper limit for a legacy
   syslog message length is 1024 octets.  That length has been expanded
   for standardized syslog.

   It can be assume that octet-counting framing is used if a syslog
   frame starts with a digit.

   All syslog messages can be considered to be TCP "data" as per
   Transmission Control Protocol [RFC0793].  The syslog message stream
   has the following ABNF [RFC5234] definition:

       TCP-DATA = *SYSLOG-FRAME

       SYSLOG-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP SYSLOG-MSG   ; Octet-counting method

       MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

       SP = %d32

       NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

       DIGIT = %d48 / NONZERO-DIGIT

       SYSLOG-MSG is defined in the syslog protocol [RFC5424] and may
                  also be considered to be the payload in [RFC3164]


   MSG-LEN is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the SYSLOG-FRAME.

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP       July 2011


3.3.2.  Octet Stuffing

   The octet stuffing method inserts a syslog message into a frame and
   terminates it with a TRAILER character.  The TRAILER has usually been
   a single character and most often is USASCII LF (%d10).  However,
   other characters have also been seen, with USASCII NUL (%d00) being a
   prominent example.  Some devices have also been seen to emit a two-
   character TRAILER, which is usually CR and LF.

   The problem with octet-stuffing framing comes from the use of a
   TRAILER character.  In that, the traditional trailer character is not
   escaped within the message which causes problems for the receiver.
   For example, a message in the style of [RFC3164] containing one or
   more LF characters may be misinterpreted as multiple messages by the
   receiving syslog application.

   The ABNF for this is shown here:

       TCP-DATA = *SYSLOG-FRAME

       SYSLOG-FRAME = SYSLOG-MSG TRAILER     ; Octet-stuffing method

       TRAILER = LF | APP-DEFINED

       LF = %d10

       APP-DEFINED = 1*2OCTET

       SYSLOG-MSG is defined in the syslog protocol [RFC5424] and may
                  also be considered to be the payload in [RFC3164]


   A transport receiver can assume that octet-stuffing framing is used
   if a syslog frame starts with the USASCII character "<" (%d60).

3.3.3.  Method Change

   It has been observed in legacy implementations that the framing may
   change on a frame-by-frame basis.  This is probably not a good idea,
   but it's been seen.

3.4.  Session Closure

   The SYSLOG session is closed when one of the TCP hosts decides to do
   so.  It then initiates a local TCP session closure.  Following TCP
   [RFC0793] it doesn't need to notify the remote TCP host of its
   intention to close the session, nor does it accept any messages that
   are still in transit.

4.  Applicability Statement

   As per the standards track documents in the syslog series, it is
   recommended to use the TLS transport [RFC5425] to transport syslog
   messages.  This document is provided to document what has been seen
   in hopes that interoperability for transporting syslog over TCP may
   be achieved.

   There are several advantages to using TCP: flow control, error
   recovery, and reliability, to name a few.  These reasons and the ease
   of programming have lead people to use this transmission protocol to
   transmit syslog.

   One potential disadvantage is the buffering mechanism used by TCP.
   Ordinarily, TCP decides when enough data has been received from the
   application to form a segment for transmission.  This may be adjusted
   through timers but still, some application data may wait in a buffer
   for a relatively long time.  Syslog data is not normally time-
   sensitive but if this delay is a concern, the syslog transport sender
   may utilize the PUSH Flag as described in [RFC0793] to have the
   sending TCP immediately send all buffered data.


5.  Security Considerations

   Even though it is recommended to use the TLS transport [RFC5425] to
   convey syslog messages, it is expected that people will still use the
   TCP transport.

   Several syslog security considerations are discussed in [RFC5424].
   This section focuses on security considerations specific to the
   syslog transport over TCP.  Some of the security issues raised in
   this section can be mitigated through the use of TLS as defined in
   [RFC5425]

   It should be noted that the syslog transport specified in this
   document does not use application-layer acknowledgments.  TCP uses
   retransmissions to provide protection against some forms of data
   loss.  However, if the TCP connection is broken for some reason (or
   closed by the transport receiver), the syslog transport sender cannot
   always know what messages were successfully delivered to the syslog
   application at the other end.

   Implementors should be aware of vulnerabilities in the transport
   layer that they choose.  In some cases, these vulnerabilities will be
   in the implementation, such as in the case of the UDP checksum error
   [RFC1122].  In other cases, the vulnerability will be in the
   specification, such as in the case of the SSL/TLS renegotiation as

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP       July 2011


   described in [RFC5746].  Specific to this transport, implementers may
   wish to review any known vulnerabilities of TCP prior to writing
   code.  A good start to this investigation may be found in an article
   by Steve Bellovin in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
   publication [Bellovin].


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to provide a TCP port for this protocol.

   After that port has been assigned, this section will be revised to
   list that port.

   The authors wish to thank David Harrington, Tom Petch, Richard
   Graveman, and all other people who commented on various versions of
   this proposal.


8.  Notes to the RFC Editor and Change Log

   These are notes to the RFC editor.  Please delete this section after
   the notes have been followed.

   Please replace the instances of <TBD> with the port number assigned
   by IANA.

   Version -09 was put together based on IESG member feedback.  The
   appendixes were removed and things were consolidated to be more
   appropriate for an informational document.  It was submitted in
   August of 2011.  Dan Romascanu is actually the IESG member who will
   watch this document.

   Version -08 included a reference to vulnerabilities of TCP.  It was
   submitted in February of 2011.

   Version -07 was submitted in January, 2011.  This clarified what was
   really expected from what was optional.  Appendix B was added for
   further clarification.  Additionally, the security Considerations
   section was edited to include a discussion about transport layer
   issues.

   Version -06 was submitted in October, 2010.  The 2119 language was
   removed.  Also, we compared notes and couldn't find any
   implementations that stacked multiple messages in a frame in the
