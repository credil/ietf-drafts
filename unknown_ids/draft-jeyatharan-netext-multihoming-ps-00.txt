Internet-Draft          Multihoming PS in NetLMM            January 2009


1.  Introduction

   The multihoming support that is covered in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6
   (PMIPv6) protocol [1] is simply simultaneous attachment support for
   multiple interfaced mobile nodes (MuIF MNs) such that a mobile node
   (MN) can use all its interfaces for data communication.  Although
   using multiple interfaces for data communication is one aspect of
   multihoming, multihoming has many deeper motivations and scenarios
   attached to it as outlined in [2] and the base PMIPv6 protocol [1]
   does not have support for such advanced multihoming scenarios.

   There are many advanced multihoming scenarios associated with
   multiple interface attachment in PMIPv6 domain.  One such scenario
   can be simultaneous "usage" of multiple interfaces for flows
   associated with a prefix given to the MN to achieve load sharing and
   load balancing benefits.  Another scenario is preference or policy
   setting at the local mobility anchor (LMA) to enable a certain flow
   to traverse via an interface that is not allocated the prefix
   associated with the flow, so as to achieve the benefits of cost,
   preference, better quality of service (QoS) and/or security.  Such
   transferring of flows via a preferred access type is generally
   referred as flow mobility.  Another such advanced multihoming
   scenario can be transferring of certain flows associated with a group
   of prefixes from one interface to a newly powered on interface to
   satisfy user preference.  Finally, one more scenario can be usage of
   simultaneous attachment in order to improve handoff performance.  To
   implement such advanced multihoming scenarios that provides numerous
   benefits to data traffic of MN and the network operation and
   maintenance, there needs to be modification done to the PMIPv6 base
   protocol.

   In this memo, the advanced multihoming issues stated above are
   highlighted when the MuIF MN is connected to a domain in which only
   PMIPv6 is operated.  In some network deployments the MuIF MN's
   mobility may be managed by different mechanisms such that the
   mobility of a certain interface will be managed by PMIPv6 mechanism
   and the mobility of another interface will be managed by CMIPv6
   mechanism.  Thus it is essential that PMIPv6 protocol has adequate
   support in such an environment to enable a Multiple Interfaced Mobile
   Node to be simultaneously attached to the network via its interfaces.
   In this memo, the lack of simultaneous attachment support in this
   mixed PMIPv6 and client MIPv6 (CMIPv6) environment is also
   highlighted.


2.  Advanced Multihoming Issues in PMIPv6

   In this section, three classes of issues will be looked into.  They

   are the simultaneous usage related issues, flow based routing related
   issues and issues related to transferring a sub-group of prefixes
   associated with an existing interface to a newly powered on
   interface.  In addition to these, the issue associated with handoff
   performance when there is no advanced multihoming support is also
   briefly highlighted.

   o  Issues Related to Simultaneous Usage of Interfaces

      The issues related to simultaneous usage of interfaces will be
      further split into three sub issues for deeper understanding of
      the problem.  The first sub-issue occurs when the MuIF MN wants
      flows associated with an application to traverse via all its
      interfaces, the second sub-issue occurs when the MuIF MN wants
      flows associated with a given prefix of MN to traverse via all its
      interfaces and the third sub-issue occurs when the MuIF MN wants
      flows associated with a given group of prefixes of MN to traverse
      via all its interfaces.

                Figure 1: Simultaneous Usage in PMIPv6 Domain

      In Figure 1, it is assumed that the MN with two interfaces such as
      interface 1 (IF1) and interface 2 (IF2) are attached to Mobile
      Access Gateway 1 (MAG1) and MAG2 respectively.  These MAGs and the
      LMA shown in Figure 1 are all attached to the same Proxy Mobile
      IPv6 domain.  According to PMIPv6 operation, it is considered that
      the IF1 will be assigned prefix P1 and IF2 will be assigned prefix
      P2.  Thus, all flows addressed to P1 prefix of MN will traverse
      via the IF1 irrespective of which application that the flows
      belong to or to which CN the flows are associated with.  However,
      if MN is having video conference with CN1 for example, then, MN
      may want the voice flows associated with the application to
      traverse via 3G interface for better Quality of Service (QoS) and
      want the video flows associated with the application to traverse
      via the wireless local area network (WLAN) interface to get a
      higher bandwidth.  The media flows associated with an application
      can be uniquely identified by a combination of parameters such as
      flow label, transport protocol numbers and port numbers as
      outlined in [3].

      If the above mentioned voice and video flows have source or
      destination addresses associated with a certain interface such as
      interface 1 of MN, then according to standard PMIPv6 operation,
      the MN cannot enjoy its flows associated with video conference
      application to traverse via both its interfaces.  This is because
      the standard PMIPv6 operation is such that routing is done only
      based on P1 prefix and nothing else.  To fully enjoy the benefit
      of simultaneous usage, some rules needs to be set at LMA such that
      it is given instructions to route voice flows associated with P1
      prefix via interface 2 and furthermore, the MAG2 should have
      additional support where such traversal of voice flow is possible.
      New functionality is essential in LMA, MAG and perhaps even in the
      MN to achieve simultaneous usage of its interfaces for traversal
      of the multimedia application flows.

      In an alternate scenario associated with Figure 1 it is considered
      that MN is downloading some data files and also performing some
      web browsing and the CNs from which the MN is getting such data
      are CN1 and CN2 respectively.  It is further considered that the
      prefix associated with MN to communicate with CN1 and CN2 is P1
      and all the data packets associated with file transfer and web
      browsing will traverse via IF1.  However, when the 3G interface is
      not used much by the MN for other flows, the MN may want all the
      data flows sent to P1 prefix from CN1 and CN2 to be sent to both
      interfaces of MN to achieve higher bandwidth for web browsing and
      file transfer applications.  The MN can inform the LMA via the MAG
      that it needs P1 flows via both its interfaces and want

      simultaneous usage service.  As explained previously, base PMIPv6
      protocol does not support this simultaneous usage scenario where
      simultaneous usage is preferred for a given prefix.  For such
      simultaneous usage to happen, in case of downlink packets for
      example, MAG2 needs to be able to route packets sent to P1 prefix
      and LMA needs to be able to route packets sent to P1 prefix via
      MAG2 as well as MAG1.

      In another scenario associated with Figure 1 , MN may have started
      communication with CN1 using P1 and communication with say CN3
      using P2.  However, due to load balancing feature or function
      being implemented in the network, the LMA may send certain P2
      flows via IF1 and certain P1 flows via IF2.  Such network
      initiated load balancing is essential in order to take some
      measures to prevent the network segments from being overloaded.
      In some cases, the MN may give its preference such as inform the
      network which P1 flows it does not mind being sent via interface 2
      and which P2 flows it does not mind being sent via interface 1.
      Thus in such a scenario, both MAG1 and MAG2 need to know MN other
      interface prefixes and flow parameters and also the LMA need to
      send some P1 flows via MAG2 and some P2 flows via MAG1.  Again,
      such simultaneous usage support where simultaneous usage of MN
      interfaces for flows associated with multiple prefixes of MN is
      not supported by the base PMIPv6 protocol.

   o  Issues Related to Flow based Routing

      The MN in Figure 1 may want flows associated with P1 to be always
      routed via interface 2 and flows associated with P2 to be routed
      via interface 1.  Such a scenario can happen when the MN decides
      to swap interfaces for flows based on dynamic state and user
      preference.  In such a case, simultaneous usage is not activated
      but flow based routing needs to be implemented.  Again, the
      current PMIPv6 protocol does not provide the required support.  In
      such an environment, again, some modifications have to be done to
      the MAG, LMA and MN in order to provide flow based routing.

   o  Issues Related to Handoff performance When all Interfaces are
      connected

      If the MN in Figure 1 is simultaneously attached to the PMIPv6
      domain, one of the interface undergo handoff while the other
      interface remains attached to the same access router.  For
      example, due to the coverage area differences, the MN may change
      its access router for the WLAN interface while the access router
      of its 3G interface remains unchanged.  In such a case, until the
      WLAN interface's routing path is set up, packet loss and delay
      will be experience for P1 flows (P1 being assigned to WLAN



Jeyatharan & Ng           Expires July 27, 2009                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Multihoming PS in NetLMM            January 2009


      interface).  To minimize such degradation during handoff, there
      needs to be mechanism allowing flows using the P1 prefix to be
      temporarily routed via the 3G interface.  The base PMIPv6 protocol
      does not support this scenario of simultaneous usage during
      handoff.  To enable such handoff enhancement, the MAG and the LMA
      needs to be able to route P1 flows via interface 2 while interface
      1 is handing off.

   o  Issues Related to Flow Mobility during Sudden Disconnection

      In Figure 1, it is considered that MN is attached to the PMIPv6
      domain via both its interfaces.  If suddenly, MN looses connection
      to the network via IF1, according to standard PMIPv6 operation,
      the MN needs to trigger vertical handoff at the 3G MAG to see P1
      flows via IF2 and maintain session continuity.  However, this
      cannot happen during disconnection, where the MN may not
      immediately know a disconnected state to correctly trigger
      vertical handoff at 3G MAG.  Thus, there needs to be an
      appropriate mechanism available to handle this disconnection
      scenario as well.

   o  Issues Related to transfering a sub-group of prefixes during
      Simultaneous Attachment

      Consider the case where the MN in Figure 1 initially has only its
      3G interface active and assigned with multiple prefixes (eg.  P1
      and P2).  When the MN subsequently discovers the WLAN access, it
      may want to use the WLAN interface simultaneously to achieve
      multihoming benefits.  Later, when WLAN interface attaches to the
      PMIPv6 domain, according to standard PMIPv6 operation, a new
      prefix (say P3) will be assigned.  However, MN already has two
      prefixes and may want to transfer flows using the prefix P2 to the
      WLAN interface due to preference, cost and/or bandwidth etc.
      Thus, some mechanisms need to be available such that the MN when
      attaching the WLAN interface can select a subset of prefixes
      assigned to 3G interface and request it to be assigned via the
      WLAN interface.  Currently, the base PMIPv6 protocol does not
      support this.  It only supports the vertical handoff case where
      all prefixes assigned to an old interface is transferred to a new
      interface when the old interface is shut down and the new
      interface turned on.


3.  Multihoming Issues in PMIPv6/CMIPv6 mixed Scenario

   In this section, PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 interaction scenarios are analyzed
   for MuIF MN that has MONAMI6 type of functionality.  The MONAMI6 type
   of functionality is given in [4].  For the MuIF MN, the main issue in



Jeyatharan & Ng           Expires July 27, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Multihoming PS in NetLMM            January 2009


   a PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 mixed scenario arises when the network is not
   aware of the simultaneous attachment related parameters used by MN
   (i.e.  CMIPv6 multihoming parameters) and MN is not aware of the
   network parameters (i.e.  PMIPv6 multihoming parameters) used for
   simultaneous attachment.  Such synchronization mismatch between
   network entities and terminal entities leads to lack of multihoming
   or simultaneous attachment support for the MN.

   In third generation partnership project service architecture
   evolution (3GPP SAE) framework as outlined in [5], the MN can select
   PMIPv6 or CMIPv6 (i.e.  Dual stack MIPv6) when attaching via an
   interface or the network presets the allowed mobility management
   mechanism for certain interface of MN.  There are many scenarios
   involved with such simultaneous attachments using different mobility
   management mechanisms.  Some of the possible scenarios are next
   outlined.  One possible scenario could be that MN (that has two
   active interfaces) is connected to home domain (in 3GPP terms, home
   public land mobile network, or HPLMN) via both its interfaces.  One
   interface may be using CMIPv6 for mobility management, while the
   other uses PMIPv6 for mobility management.  Another scenario could be
   that MN is simultaneously attached to home (HPLMN) and foreign
   domains (in 3GPP terms, visited public land mobile network, or
   VPLMN).  Again, MN could be using PMIPv6 for mobility management in
   its home domain, while using CMIPv6 for mobility management in the
   foreign domain.  Although the problem is highlighted in a scenario
   that is used in 3GPP standard organization (SDO), this is applicable
   in similar scenarios that arises in other SDOs.

                           Management Mechanisms

   This scenario as shown in Figure 2 is a 3GPP specific scenario, where
   MN chooses CMIPv6 mobility management to be used via the WiMAX
   interface (MN.IF1) and PMIPv6 mobility management via the WLAN
   interface.  MN will use the on-link prefix that is available in the
   WiMAX access network advertised by Access Gateway (AGW), to configure
   a care-of address for interface 1 of MN (MN.IF1).  MN will perform
   the CMIPv6 binding update (BU) at LMA/HA binding the home address to
   the care-of address configured using the on-link prefix.  When MN
   performs such CMIPv6 BU at the LMA/HA (implemented in 3GPP as a
   packet data network gateway, P-GW), the binding created is shown by
   the first entry in the cache.  As mentioned, since this MN is MONAMI6
   capable and it is performing simultaneous attachment, it will use a
   binding identifier (BID) option with value BID1 in its BU.  It is
   further considered that the home address is obtained from a prefix
   that is topologically rooted at the home P-GW.  It is also assumed
   that MN is attaching to WLAN access via its second interface and
   chooses PMIPv6 mobility management mechanism to manage mobility for
   this interface.  It is further assumed that MN sees the home prefix
   (CMIPv6 home prefix) when MAG2 performs the PMIPv6 binding at the
   LMA/HA.  When the home prefix is advertised via MAG2 (which may be an
   evolved packet data network gateway, ePDG, in 3GPP) there are
   definite advantages that the MN can enjoy.  It can enjoy PMIPv6
   mobility management benefits for home prefix flows.

   In order to attain simultaneous attachment in such a scenario, the
   proxy binding update (PBU) sent by MAG2 needs to have some If-ID or
   BID2 that is different from BID1.  Since such a support is not
   available in standard PMIPv6 mechanism, simultaneous attachment in
   such a mixed PMIPv6/CMIPv6 scenario is not possible.  If MAG2 does
   not have any knowledge about MN's other interface CMIPv6 binding, it
   will send a normal PBU without BID value.  When such a PBU is sent,
   it will invalidate the CMIPv6 binding that has already been
   registered at LMA/HA (i.e. entry 1 in BC).  Such overwriting without
   proper binding specific parameter in the BU is already described in
   [4] for the multiple interface scenario.  If the PMIPv6 binding and
   CMIPv6 binding are different mobility bindings arriving from
   different interfaces as in Figure 2, then they need to separated by
   BID.

   From the detail explanation, a mechanism by which MAG2 gets to know
   the correct value for BID2 needs to be supported by the system.  For
   example, MAG2 may be informed by MN that it is performing
   simultaneous attachment so that the MAG2 may query the LMA/HA about
   interface 1 (BID1) and then perform the PBU at LMA/HA with a BID that
   is different from BID1.  Alternatively, MAG2 may request the LMA/HA
   to generate the BID that is different from BID1.  Another possible

   solution can be that MN gives BID2 to MAG2, where BID2 is different
   from BID1, so that MAG2 can create the correct PMIPv6 binding for
   interface 2.

   In case the MN in Figure 2 attaches to the network first via IF2 and
   the LMA/HA generates the BID2 for IF2's PMIPv6 binding, it is
   essential that BID1 needs to be different from BID2 to achieve
   simultaneous attachment.  In such a scenario, the LMA/HA can provide
   a BID1 for IF1 during Internet Key Exchange Signaling with MN.  Then,
   the MN will use this given BID1 for IF1 during the CMIPv6 signaling
   and achieve simultaneous connection.  Alternatively, MN can inform
   LMA/HA via IF1 that it is simultaneously at home and away, so that
   LMA/HA can generate BID1 for the IF1's CMIPv6 binding.


4.  Conclusion

   In this memo, we looked into two main cases of advanced multihoming
   scenario.  One in pure PMIPv6 domain, and the other in a mixed PMIPv6
   and CMIPv6 enviroment.  In both cases, the base PMIPv6 protocol was
   found to be inadequate to support advanced multihoming so as to
   provide the full benefits of multihoming to a multiple interfaced
   mobile node.  To summarize, base PMIPv6 protocol needs to be extended
   to support the following advanced multihoming scenarios:

   o  Usage of MN Interfaces, to achieve "simultaneous usage" for flows
      associated with single or multiple prefixes given to MN.

   o  Achieving flow based routing for particluar flows associated with
      a prefix given to a multiple interfaced MN.

   o  Achieving improved handoff performance for multiple interfaced MN
      using simultaneous usage support.

   o  Achieving vertical handoff and session continuity during to
      disconnection of one of the interfaces.

   o  Achieving vertical handoff when a specific subset of prefixes
      needs to be transferred to the newly powered on interface.

   o  Achieving simultaneous attachment for multiple interfaced MN in a
      PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 mixed mobility management scenario.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document explores the problem of providing advanced multihoming
   for mobile nodes with multiple interfaces connecting to a single
   PMIPv6 domain.  No additional security threat is identified as of the
   writing of this memo that is specific to multiple interfaces support.
