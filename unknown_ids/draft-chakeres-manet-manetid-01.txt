   This document defines a packet and a message TLV named MANET_ID.  The
   MANET_ID TLV is used by DYMO routers to identify information that
   should be processed.

Internet-Draft                  MANET-ID                    January 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a TLV structure named MANET_ID for the
   generalize packet/message format [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].  This TLV
   is used by DYMO routers to identify information that should be
   processed and/or forwarded.  This TLV type can be attached to a
   packet or a message.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].


3.  MANET_ID TLV Structure

   A MANET_ID TLV may be a packet or a message TLV.  If the MANET_ID TLV
   is attached a packet or message, then it must be a single value TLV
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].

   The <value> of the MANET_ID TLV is a integer value.  The maximum
   length is 64-bits (8-bytes).


4.  DYMO Protocol Operation

   This document recommends specific DYMO protocol instance behavior
   based on the MANET_ID TLV value.

4.1.  DYMO Router Configuration

   A DYMO router must be administratively configured to only process
   packets/messages with a specific certain MANET_ID value.  For
   simplicity, we will refer the configured MANET_ID value as
   MY_MANET_ID.

4.2.  Packet Processing

   When a packet is received without a MANET_ID TLV, the packet's
   MANET_ID value is assumed to be zero (0).

   When a packet is received containing a MANET_ID TLV, its MANET_ID
   value is contained.

Internet-Draft                  MANET-ID                    January 2008


   If the packet's MANET_ID value matches MY_MANET_ID, then the packet
   is processed normally.  Otherwise, the packet is discarded and
   ignored.

   When a packet is received containing a MANET_ID TLV, the MANET_ID
   value is attributed to all messages contained within the packet.

4.3.  Message Processing

   When a message is received without a MANET_ID TLV and its containing
   packet does not contain a MANET_ID TLV value, the message's MANET_ID
   value is assumed to be zero (0).

   When a message is received containing a MANET_ID TLV, its MANET_ID
   value is contained.

   If the message's MANET_ID value matches MY_MANET_ID, then the message
   is processed normally.  Otherwise, the message is discarded and
   ignored.

4.4.  Sending Packets/Messages

   When issuing DYMO routing protocol packets/messages, the information
   should be identified by tagging it with a MANET_ID TLV containing
   this DYMO router's MY_MANET_ID value.


5.  IANA Considerations

                              TLV Assignments

               +----------+----------+---------------------+
               | Mnemonic | TLV Type | Assigned Type Value |
               +----------+----------+---------------------+
               | MANET_ID |  Packet  |         TBD1        |
               | MANET_ID |  Message |         TBD2        |
               +----------+----------+---------------------+
