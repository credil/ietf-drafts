Abstract

   Distribution of high precision time and frequency over the Internet
   and special purpose IP networks is becoming more and more needed as
   IP networks replace legacy networks and as new applications with need
   for frequency and time are developed on the Internet.  The IETF
   formed the TICTOC workinggroup to address the problem and perform an
   analysis on existing solutions and the needs.  This document
   summarises application needs, as described and agreed on at an TICTOC
   interim meeting held in Paris from June 16 to 18, 2008.

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                    November 2008


1.  Introduction

   There is an emerging need to distribute highly accurate time and
   frequency information over IP and over MPLS packet switched networks
   (PSNs).  In this draft, the requirements for transporting accurate
   time and/or frequency are addressed.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


3.  Applications Requirements

   There are many applications that need synchronization.  Some
   applications only need frequency; for others a combination of
   frequency and time of day or phase may be required.  At the TICTOC
   interim meeting, it was agreed that these applications be grouped
   based on what was believed to be common requirements, and where the
   requirements where distinct from each other.  This section describes
   these applications (or groups of applications) that was agreed on at
   the TICTOC interim meeting.

3.1.  Cellular Backhauling

   Within Cellular backhauling, there are several applications that need
   to be considered.  Some of these applications only require frequency
   information, others require time-of-day, and others require phase.
   The cellular backhauling applications to be considered are:

   o  GSM

   o  Mobile Wimax

   o  LTE

   o  UMTS FDD

   o  UMTS TDD

   o  CDMA2000

   o  TD-SCDMA

   Conventionally GSM and UMTS FDD base stations obtain this reference

   frequency by locking on to the E1/T1 that links them to the base
   station controller.  With the replacement of TDM links with Packet
   Switched Networks (PSNs) such as Ethernet, IP or MPLS, this simple
   method of providing a frequency reference is lost, and frequency
   information must be made available in some other way.

   The synchronization requirement is derived from the need for the
   radio frequencies to be accurate.  Radio spectrum is a limited and
   valuable commodity that needs to be used as efficiently as possible.
   In GSM, transmission frequencies are allocated to a given cellular
   base station and its neighbors in such fashion as to ensure that they
   do not interfere with each other.  If the radio network designer
   cannot rely on the accuracy of these frequencies, the spacing between
   the frequencies used by neighboring sites must be increased, with
   significant economic consequences.

   There is an additional requirement derived from the need for smooth
   handover when a mobile station crosses from one cell to another.  If
   the radio system designer can not guarantee that the preparations
   required for handover occur in a few milliseconds, then they must
   allow the mobile station to consume frequency resources
   simultaneously in both cells in order to avoid service disruption.
   The preparations required involve agreement between the mobile and
   base stations on the new frequencies and time offsets; these
   agreements can be accomplished quickly when the two base stations'
   frequency references are the same to a high degree of accuracy.

3.1.1.  Cellular Backaul Requirements

   The requirements for the Cellular Backhauling is summarized in the
   table 1.

   Editor's note: This table was discussed at the Dublin meeting; need
   input from the group to fill in the blanks.

   Note (3) : In general LTE TDD systems may be defined to operate with
   10-50 microseconds phase accuracy by making some limitations on the
   deployment (e.g. cell range), and radio frame configuration, however
   further investigation are required.  When no assumption possible,
   microsecond or sub-microsecond requirement would apply.

3.2.  Circuit Emulation

   The PWE3 WG has produced three techniques for emulating traditional
   low-rate (E1, T1, E3, T3) TDM services over PSNs, namely SAToP
   [RFC4553], CESoPSN [RFC5086], and TDMoIP [RFC5087].  The Network
   Synchronization reference model and deployment scenarios for
   emulation of TDM services have been described in [RFC4197], Section
   4.3.  The major technical challenge for TDM pseudowires is the
   accuracy of its clock recovery.

   TDM network standards for timing accuracy and stability are extremely
   demanding.  These requirements are not capriciously dictated by
   standards bodies, rather they are critical to the proper functioning
   of a high-speed TDM network.  Consider a TDM receiver utilizing its
   own clock when converting the physical signal back into a bit-stream.
   If the receive clock runs at precisely the same rate as the source
   clock, then the receiver need only determine the optimal sampling
   phase.  However, with any mismatch of clock rates, no matter how
   small, bit slips will eventually occur.  For example, if the receive
   clock is slower than the source clock by one part per million (ppm),
   then the receiver will output 999,999 bits for every 1,000,000 bits
   sent, thus deleting one bit.  Similarly, if the receive clock is
   faster than the source clock by one part per billion (ppb), the
   receiver will insert a spurious bit every billion bits.  One bit slip
   every million bits may seem acceptable at first glance, but
   translates to a catastrophic two errors per second for a 2 Mb/s E1
   signal.  ITU-T recommendations permit a few bit slips per day for a
   low-rate 64 kb/s channel, but strive to prohibit bit slips entirely
   for higher-rate TDM signals.

3.2.1.  Circuit Emulation requirements

   The requirements for the Circuit Emulation is summarized in the table
   2.

3.4.  Instrumentation and Measurement, Industrial Automation, and Power

   In the test and measurement and industrial sector there is a desire
   to move from special purpose communications infrastructure with
   calibrated wiring run back to a centralize controller, to a
   distributed system, in which instructions are distributed in advance
   to be executed at a predetermined time, and in which measurements are
   taken remotely and communicated back to a common point for later
   correlation and analysis.  Two examples of this tendency are
   described below.

   In the printing industry there is a need to control operations in
   multi-stand printing machines.  The paper travels through these
   machines at a speed of nearly 100 km/h.  At these speeds, co-
   ordination error of 1 microsecond between operations taking place at
   different positions in the machine produces a 0.03mm color offset,
   which is visible to the naked eye and results in an unacceptable
   degradation in quality.

   In the electrical power industry there is a need to improve the
   measurement of power flows in order to monitor and predict usage
   patterns.  One proposal is to extensively deploy synchro-phasors in
   the power network and to correlate their output to determine demand.
   These devices need to be able to determine the time of measurement
   with an accuracy of 1 microsecond.

3.4.1.  Instrumentation and Measurement, Industrial Automation, and
        Power Requirements

   The requirements for the Instrumentation and Measurement, Industrial
   Automation, and Power Requirements are summarized in the table 4.

   Editor's note: This table was discussed at the Dublin meeting; need
   input from the group to fill in the blanks.

3.7.  Legal Time

   With legal time is meant the cases where high precision wall-clock is
   needed, just as in the ToD case, but with where the time source is
   traceable to UTC in a secure manner, i.e. through a certificate
   chain.  It's also important for the legal-time case that the
   certificate chain is set-up so that it provides for an audit trail,
   where the ToD provided at any given moment can be traced to a known
   source or standard (i.e. a national timescale or time labratory).
   One typical application that would benefift from high accuracy legal
   time is event correlation in computer systems logs, and similar
   applications.

3.7.1.  Legal Time requirements

   The requirements for the Legal Time is summarized in the table 7.

3.8.  Metrology

   Metrology for time and frequency is today mostly using taylored
   equipment and cabling for time/frequency transfer when doing
   labratory work.  However, in the future, using IP over existing
   networks in the labratories would allow for greater flexibility and
   reuse of existing infrastructure rather than building out more
   special purpose infrastructure.

3.8.1.  Metrology requirements

   The requirements for the Metrology is summarized in the table 8.

   Editor's note: This table was discussed at the Dublin meeting; need

3.9.  Sensor

   More generally, there is growing interest in clock synchronization in
   massively parallel sensor networks.  Advances in wireless
   communications have enabled the development of low power miniature
   sensors that collect and disseminate data from their immediate
   environment.  Although each sensor has limited processing power,
   through distributed processing the network becomes capable of
   performing various tasks of data fusion, but only assuming a common
   time base can be established.

3.9.1.  Sensors requirements

   The requirements for the Sensor is summarized in the table 9.

4.  Network Dependencies

   When using packet networks to transfer timing, packet delay
   variation, propagation asymmetry, and maximum permissible packet rate
   all have a significant bearing on the accuracy with which the client
   is able to determine absolute time.  Thus the network environment has
   a large bearing on the quality of time that can be delivered.

   Timing distribution is highly sensitive to packet delay variation,
   and can thus can deteriorate under congestion conditions.
   Furthermore the disciplining of the client's oscillator (the sole
   component of frequency transfer, and a critical component of time
   transfer) is a function that should not be disrupted.  When the
   service is disrupted the client needs to go into "holdover" mode, and
   its accuracy will consequently be degraded.  Depending on the
   relative quality of the client's clock and the required quality after
   disciplining, a relatively high packet rate may be required.

   Packet delay variation can to some extent be addressed by traffic
   engineering, thus time transfer within a constrained network
   environment might reasonably be expected to deliver a higher quality
   time service than can be achieved between two arbitrary hosts
   connected to the Internet.  Greater gains can probably be obtained by
   deploying equipment that incorporates IEEE 1588 style on-the-fly
   packet timestamp correction (or any other form of on-path support),
   or follow-up message mechanisms that report the packet storage and
   forward delays to the client.  However one can only be sure that such
   techniques are available along the entire path in a well-controlled
   environment.  Therefore, time transfer protocols should not assume
   the avavilability of on path support, but utilizes it where
   avavilable.

   The packet rate between the time-server and its client also has a
   bearing on the quality of the time transfer, because at a higher rate
   the smart filter has a better chance of extracting the "good"
   packets.  How the packet rate relates to the accuracy is dependent on
   the filter algorithm in use.  In a controlled environment it is
   possible to ensure that there is adequate bandwidth, and that the
   server is not overloaded.  In such an environment the onus moves from
   protecting the server from overload, to ensuring that the server can
   satisfy the needs of all of the clients.

   Congested and overloaded paths might influence the quality of timing
   transfer.  In a constrained network environment, it's assumed that a
   service provider will ensure that packet delivery is done in
   according to the timing transfer needs of the network operator.


5.  Network Topology

   Editor's note: This section needs to be discussed.


6.  Security Considerations

   Time and frequency services are a significant element of network
   infrastructure, and are critical for certain emerging applications.
   Hence time and frequency transfer services MUST be protected from
   being compromised, and for some of the applications described above
   such as legal time, the ability to provide and audit trail to the
   timing source.  One possible threat is a false time or frequency
   server being accepted instead of a true one, thus enabling an
   attacker to alter the time and frequency service provided.  Other
   possible scenarios are to be able to distinguish between trusted
   clients and non-trusted clients when providing service.

   Any protection mechanism must be designed in such a way that it does
   not degrade the quality of the time transfer.  Such a mechanism
   SHOULD also be relatively lightweight, as client restrictions often
   dictate a low processing and memory footprint, and because the server
   may have extensive fan-out.

   The following authentication mechanism need to be considered:

   1.  of server by client (depending on the application)

   2.  of client by server (depending on the application)

   3.  transactions (depending on the application)


7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required as a result of the publication of this
   document.

   derive an accurate frequency transfer.  Indeed, this is exactly what
   happens in a GPS disciplined frequency standard.  On the other hand,
   an accurate frequency transfer service, while itself unable to
   transfer absolute time, is usually used to support and improve the
   performance of the time transfer service.  Indeed, implementations of
   NTP or IEEE 1588 clients can be considered to consist of two phases.
   First, a local oscillator is locked to the server's frequency using
   incoming information from the incoming packets, and then the local
   time set based on the server's time and the propagation latency.  By
   maintaining a local frequency source, the client requires relatively
   infrequent updates, and can continue functioning during short periods
   of network outage.  Moreover, it can be shown that this method
   results in significantly better time transfer accuracy than methods
   that do not discipline a local clock.

   Time transfer mechanisms can be divided into three classes.  The
   first class consists of mechanisms that use radio frequency
   transport, while the second mechanism uses dedicated "wires" (which
   for our purposes include optical fibers).  The third, which will be
   our main focus, exploits a Packet Switched Network for transfer of
   timing information.  Advantages and disadvantages of these three
   methods are discussed in the following subsections.

A.1.  Radio-based Timing Transfer Methods

   The transfer of time by radio transmission is one of the oldest
   methods available, and is still the most accurate wide area method.
   In particular, there are two navigation in wide use that can be used
   for time transfer, The LOng RAnge Navigation (LORAN) terrestrial
   radio system, and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).  In
   both cases the user needs to be able to receive the transmitted
   signal, requiring access to a suitable antenna.  In certain
   situations, e.g. basement communications rooms and urban canyons, the
   required signal may not be receivable.

   Radio systems have high accuracy, far better than what we will later
   see can be achieved by existing PSN technologies.  However coverage
   is limited; eLORAN for example only covers North America, and GPS
   does not have good coverage near the poles.

   Although civilian use is sanctioned, the GPS was developed and is
   operated by the U.S. Department of Defense as a military system.  For
   this reason there are political concerns that rules out its use in
   certain countries.  The European Union is working on an alternative
   system called Galileo, which will be run as a commercial enterprise.
   In addition, GPS has some well-documented multi-hour outages, and is
   considered vulnerable to jamming.  One major PTT also reports that
   they see a 2% per year failure rate for the antenna/receiver/

   clock-out chain.

   While a radio-based timing service may be acceptable for some sites,
   it is frequently impractical to use on a per equipment basis.  Hence,
   some form of local timing distribution is usually also required.

A.2.  Dedicated Wire-based Timing Transfer Methods

   The use of dedicated networks in the wide area does not scale well.
   Such services were available in the past, but for reasons of cost and
   accuracy have been superseded by GPS based solutions.

   In the local area, one new technique is emerging as a mechanism for
   time transport, namely DOCSIS Timing Interface(DTI).  DTI was
   designed by DOCSIS for the distribution of time in a cable head-end
   in support of media access control.  Time transfer is packet-based
   over a multi-stage hub and spoke dedicated network.  It uses a single
   twisted-pair in half-duplex to eliminate inaccuracies due to the
   length differences between the pairs in a multi-pair cable.

   The DTI approach is applicable for special applications, but the need
   for a dedicated network imposes significant drawbacks for the general
   time transfer case.

   Synchronous Ethernet is a technique that has recently been approved
   by ITU-T, it provides frequency distribution over Ethernet links.
   Modern dedicated-media full-duplex Ethernet, in both copper and
   optical physical layer variants, transmits continuously.  One can
   thus elect to derive the physical layer transmitter clock from a high
   quality frequency reference, instead of the conventional 100 ppm
   crystal-derived transmitter rate.  The receiver at the other end of
   the link automatically locks onto the physical layer clock of the
   received signal, and thus itself gain access to a highly accurate and
   stable frequency reference.  Then, in TDM fashion, this receiver
   could lock the transmission clock of its other ports to this
   frequency reference.  Apart from some necessary higher layer packet
   based configuration and OAM operations to transport synchronization
   status messaging, the solution is entirely physical layer, and has no
   impact on higher layers.

   At first sight it would seem that the only application of Synchronous
   Ethernet was in frequency transfer (it has no intrinsic time transfer
   mechanism).  However, the quality of packet-based time transfer
   mechanism can be considerably enhanced if used in conjunction with
   Synchronous Ethernet as a frequency reference.

A.3.  Transfer Using Packet Networks

   When using a PSN to transfer timing, a server sends timing
   information in the form of packets to one or multiple clients.  When
   there are multiple clients, the timing packets may be multicast.
   Software/hardware in the client recovers the frequency and/or time of
   the server based on the packet arrival time and the packet contents.

   There are two well-known protocols capable of running over a general-
   purpose packet network, NTP [RFC1305], and IEEE 1588 [1588].  NTP is
   the product of the IETF, and is currently undergoing revision to
   version 4.  PTP (a product of the IEEE Test and Measurement
   community) is specified in a limited first version (1588-2002), and
   the second version (1588-2008)was approved recently.

   It is important that NTP, IEEE-1588 or any other future packet based
   time transfer mechanism do not break each other if they run in the
   same network.

A.3.1.  NTP summary description

   NTP is widely deployed, but existing implementations deliver accuracy
   on the order of 10 milliseconds.  This accuracy is not adequate for
   the applications described above.  Current NTP suffers from the fact
   that it was designed to operate over the Internet, and the routers
   and switches make no special concessions to NTP for preservation of
   time transfer accuracy.  Furthermore, typical update rates are low
   and can not be significantly increased due to scalability issues in
   the server.  In addition most NTP time servers and time receivers
   have a relatively unsophisticated implementation that further
   degrades the final time quality.  However, proprietary NTP
   implementations that use other algorithms and update-rates have
   proved that NTP packet formats can be used for higher accuracy.

A.3.2.  IEEE1588 summary description

   The information exchange component of IEEE 1588 is a protocol known
   as Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  PTP version 1 (1588-2002) was a
   time transfer protocol that exclusively used multicast technique and
   it was primarily developed for Industtrial Automation and Test and
   Measurement applications.  It is widely anticipated that wide scale
   deployment of PTP will be based on PTP version 2 (1588-2008).

   IEEE Std 1588-2008 can be considered to consist of several
   components:

   1.  A configuration and control protocol

Internet-Draft                   TICTOC                    November 2008


   2.  A time transfer protocol

   3.  A time correction protocol

   4.  Physical mapping

   The configuration and control protocol is based on the multicast
   approach of IEEE Std 1588-2002 (multicast IP with recommended TTL=1,
   UDP, PTP payload with equipment identifier in the payload).  The
   rationale for this approach was that the equipment needed to be "plug
   and play" (no configuration), was required to map to physical media
   other than Ethernet, and had to have a very low memory and processor
   footprint.  IEEE Std 1588-2008 includes Unicast messages.

   The time transfer protocol is a standard two-way time transfer
   approach used in other packet-based approaches.  Like all such
   approaches it is subject to inaccuracies due to variable store and
   forward delays in the packet switches, and due to the assumption of
   symmetric propagation delays.  For IEEE Std 1588-2008, the time
   transfer packets (in both directions) may be operated in a multicast
   or unicast mode.

   The time correction protocol is used to correct for propagation,
   store and forward delays in the packet switches.  This again may be
   operated multicast or unicast.  This mechanism requires some level of
   hop-by-hop hardware support.  This mechanism may also be considered a
   concept in its own right and may be adapted to enhance other packet
   time transfer protocols such as NTP.

   The IEEE Std 1588-2008 specification describes how the PTP operates
   over the Ethernet/IP/UDP protocol stack.  It includes annexes that
   describe PTP operation over pure layer 2 Ethernet, and over a number
   of specialist media.

   The mappings of interest for telecommunications are PTP over UDP/IP,
   PTP over MPLS , and perhaps PTP over Ethernet.  They may operate in
   unicast or multicast.  Issues of a suitable control management and
   OAM environment for these applications are largely in abeyance, as
   are considerations about the exact nature of the network environment.

   It is also worth noting the existence of a second IEEE effort, IEEE
   802.1AS.  This group is specifying the protocol and procedures to
   ensure synchronization across Bridged and Virtual Bridged Local Area
   Networks for time sensitive applications such as audio and video.
   For these LAN media the transmission delays are assumed to be fixed
   and symmetrical.  IEEE 802.1AS specifies the use of IEEE 1588
   specifications where applicable in the context of IEEE Standards
   802.1D and 802.1Q. Synchronization to an externally provided timing

   signal (e.g., a recognized timing standard such as UTC or TAI) is not
   part of this standard but is not precluded.  IEEE 802.1AS will
   specify how stations attached to bridged LANs to meet the respective
   jitter, wander, and time synchronization requirements for time-
   sensitive applications.


Appendix B.  Other Forums Working in this Problem Space

   The NTP WG is the IETF group working on time distribution, but is
   presently only documenting NTPv4 and is not working on new algorithms
   or protocols.  It is expected that many participants of the NTP WG
   will participate in the TICTOC effort.

   The PWE3 WG has discussed frequency distribution for the TDM PW
   application, however it is not chartered to develop protocols for
   this purpose.  It is expected that participants of the PWE3 WG who
   were active in the TDM PW discussions will participate in the TICTOC
   effort.

   The IEEE approved the version 2 of the IEEE 1588 protocol (IEEE Std
   1588- 2008) that will run over more types of PSNs.  The protocol to
   be specified contains elements that will be of use in an IETF
   environment, but is unlikely to be regarded as being a complete,
   robust solution in such an environment.  If the IEEE 1588 structure
   is deemed to be a suitable platform, then the IETF could contribute
   an Internet profile, including a complete distributed systems
   environment suitable for our purposes.  Alternatively, the IETF could
   perhaps borrow some of the delay correction mechanisms and
   incorporate them into a development of a new version of NTP.

   In addition, IEEE 802.1AS is working on Timing and Synchronization
   for Time-Sensitive Applications in Bridged Local Area Networks,
   basing itself on the IEEE 1588 standard.

   ITU-T SG15 Question 13 has produced Recommendation G.8261 "Timing and
   synchronization aspects in packet networks" [G8261].  This
   Recommendation defines requirements for various scenarios, outlines
   the functionality of frequency distribution elements, and provides
   measurement guidelines.  It does not specify algorithms to be used
   for attaining the performance needed.  ITU-T has also consented
   G.8262 "Timing Characteristics of Synchronous Ethernet Equipment
   Slave Clock (EEC)" [G8262], and G.8264 "Distribution of timing
   through packet networks" [G8264].  G.8262 specifies the requirements
   for Synchronous Ethernet clocks and G.8264 defines the protocol for
   Synchronization Status Message (SSM) for Synchronous Ethernet.  To
   date the ITU-T has focused on Ethernet infrastructure, but this is
   likely to extend to an MPLS environment.  Two new work items,

   G.paclock.bis and G.pacmod.bis extend the work, and in particular,
   G.pacmod.bis intends to introduce time transfer.  The scope for
   G.paclock.bis is to define the requirements for packet-based clocks.
   This is an area where the IETF, with its expertise in IP and MPLS
   networks, may co-operate with the ITU.
