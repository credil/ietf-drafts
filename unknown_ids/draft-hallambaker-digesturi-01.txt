                       The di (DIGEST) URI Scheme
                     draft-hallambaker-digesturi-01

Abstract

   A URI scheme for referencing static data abjects by means of a
   cryptographic digest mechanism is specified.  The format is designed
   to resist content type substitution attacks and supports a choice of
   digest algorithms.

Internet-Draft            The DIGEST URI Scheme             October 2011


1.  Definitions

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Defined Terms

   The following terms are used in this document:

   URI


2.  Requirements

   Provides a strong reference to a static data object.

   Does not provide a means of resolution.

   Allows an authenticated data source to provide an authenticated
   reference to a static data object.

   Intended applications include creating references from

      Web pages delivered over HTTP/TLS

      DNS resource records signed using DNSSEC

      Data values embedded in certificates, CRLs, OCSP tokens and other
      signed data objects.

2.1.  Examples of Use

2.1.1.  Simple Digest

   For example, the following digest URI specifies a reference to the
   text "Hello World !" using the SHA-2 algorithm with 256 bit output:

   di:sha-256:B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc

2.1.2.  Digest with Meta-Data

   The semantics of a digest being used to establish a secure reference
   from an authenticated source to an external source may be a function
   of associated meta data such as the content type.  This data MAY be
   specified by means of a parameter:

Internet-Draft            The DIGEST URI Scheme             October 2011


   di:sha-256:B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc?ct=text/plain

2.1.3.  Digest with Locator

   A digest identifier MAY provide a location from which the referenced
   content MAY be available.  Note however that since it is
   statistically unlikely that a given identifier will correspond to
   more than one content sequence, the actual location from which the
   data is retrieved is immaterial.

   di:sha-
   256:B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc?http=di.example.com

   The corresponding content MAY be retrieved from the URL:

   http://di.example.com/.well-known/
   B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc

   A digest identifier MAY specify multiple locations from which the
   content MAY be obtained:

   di:sha-256:B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc?
   http=one.example.com&http=two.example.com

   Asserts that the content may be retrieved from either of the
   following URIs:

   http://one.example.com/.well-known/
   B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc http://two.example.com/
   .well-known/B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc

2.1.4.  Digest with Decryption Key

   A digest identifier MAY provide a key for decrypting the referenced
   data.

   di:sha-256:B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc? enc=aes-
   cbc:Fw3x20nEKfq6FDGzq7ttIQ

   If the mechanism outlined on the list but not here is used, the
   digest portion of the URI may be truncated at 128 bits and a value
   generated from the key portion used to defeat birthday attack:

   di:sha-128:B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Q?enc=aes-cbc:Fw3x20nEKfq6FDGzq7ttIQ

Internet-Draft            The DIGEST URI Scheme             October 2011


3.  The di (DIGEST) URI TYPE

3.1.  Syntax

   The DIGEST URI Type has the following format:

   "di:" algorithm ":" digest [ "?" tag "=" value [ "&" tag "=" value ]
   * ]

3.1.1.  Encoding Considerations

3.1.1.1.  Use of base64url Encoding

   Section 2.2 of [RFC4395] states [URI schemes that are not intended
   for use with relative URIs SHOULD avoid use of the forward slash "/"
   character, which is used for hierarchical delimiters, and the
   complete path segments "." and ".." (dot-segments).]

   Consequently the encoding of the digest value is effected using the
   base64url encoding specified in Section 5 of [RFC4648] which avoids
   the use of the forward slash '/' character.

3.1.1.2.  Query Parameter Encoding

   The query segment of a URI is NOT hierarchical.  Thus escape encoding
   of slash '/' characters is NOT required.

   Section 3.4 of [RFC3986] states [The characters slash ("/") and
   question mark ("?") may represent data within the query component.]

   Consequently no special escaping mechanism is required for the query
   parameter portion of the URI.  URI escaping is however frequently
   imposed automatically by scripting environments.  Thus to ensure
   interoperability, implementations SHOULD NOT generate URIs that
   employ URI character escaping and implementations MUST accept and
   URIs that employ URI character escaping.

3.2.  Semantics

3.2.1.  Digest Algorithms

   Implementations MUST support the sha-256 algorithm as specified in
   [RFC4055].

   Implementations MAY support other algorithms specified in the Data
   Structure for the Security Suitability of Cryptographic Algorithms
   registry 'Cryptographic Algorithms' [RFC5698].

Internet-Draft            The DIGEST URI Scheme             October 2011


3.2.2.  Parameters

3.2.2.1.  Content Type (ct)

   The Content Type "ct" parameter specifies the MIME Content Type of
   the associated data as defined in [RFC4288]

3.2.2.2.  HTTP Locator (http & https)

   The http and https parameters are used to specify a possible means of
   resolving the referenced content.  Mulltiple locator parameters MAY
   be used to specify alternative sources for accessing the content.

   The http and https parameters take a single argument, the domain name
   to be used for resolution.  To permit the use of digest URIs in
   ASCII-only environments, the ASCII encoding (aka punycode) of the
   domain name MUST be used.

   To resolve such a location reference, a client first transforms the
   digest URI to obtain a http or https url as follows:

   URL = prefix + domain + "/.well-known/" + digest

   Where:

   prefix  Is the string "http://" for the http parameter type and is
      the string "https://" for the https parameter type.

   domain  Is the value associated with the parameter.

   digest  Is the digest portion of the digest URI.

   Implementations MUST NOT disclose any other data.  In particular
   implementations MUST NOT disclose the query parameter portion of the
   URI.

3.2.2.3.  Encryption and MIME Encryption Specifiers (enc & menc)

   The encryption and MIME encryption specifiers are used to provide a
   means of obtaining the plaintext of a reference to encrypted content.

   The enc specifier is used when the encrypted object consists of the
   encrypted content alone.  The menc spcifier is used when the
   encrypted object consists of a MIME header containing metadata
   followed by the binary object encoding.

   The encryption specifiers both take an agrument of the form:

Internet-Draft            The DIGEST URI Scheme             October 2011


   algorithm ":" base64url (key) [":" base64url (iv)]

   Where

   algorithm  Is the algorithm used to encrypt the associated content

   key  Is the value of the cryptographic key

   iv (optional)  Is the value of the cryptographic Initialization
      Vector.

      If the IV is not spcified for a block cipher mode that requires
      one, the IV MUST be prepended to the encrypted content.

      [Actually the IV does not provide any additional security for this
      application but explaining the reason would be more effort than it
      is worth and what I really care about is saving bytes in the
      identifier, not the resulting data package.]


4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Integrity

   No secret information is required to generate a DIGEST URI.
   Therefore a DIGEST URI only provides a proof of integrity for the
   referenced object and the proof of integrity provided is only as good
   as the proof of integrity for the DIGEST URI value.

4.2.  Confidentiality

   Disclosure of a DIGEST URI value does not necessarily entail
   disclosure of the referenced object but may enable an attacker to
   determine the contents of the referenced object by reference to a
   search engine or other data repository.

4.3.  Weak Digest Algorithm

   [The digest algorithm MUST be strong]

   [For most use cases collision resistance is a requirement]


5.  IANA Considerations

A.1.  Example: Hello World !

   The Digest URI of the text file "Hello World !" is computed as
   follows:

      Scheme "di"

      Algorithm Identifier: "sha-256"

      sha-256 ("Hello World !") " 07 f2 bd ef 34 ed 16 e3 a1 ba 0d bb 7e

      Content Type Parameter 'text/plain' "ct=text/plain"

   Depending on the context, the digest URI MAY be specified using the
   digest value alone or the digest valur plus content type parameter:

   di:sha-256:B_K97zTtFuOhug27fke4_Zgc4Myz4b_lZNgsQjy6fkc
