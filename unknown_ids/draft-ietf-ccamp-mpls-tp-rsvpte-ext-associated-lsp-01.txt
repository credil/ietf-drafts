Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP         June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document [RFC5654]
   describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-
   to-point LSPs.  Furthermore, an associated bidirectional LSP is
   useful for protection switching, for Operations, Administrations and
   Maintenance (OAM) messages that require a reply path.

   The requirements described in [RFC5654] are specifically mentioned in
   Section 2.1.  (General Requirements), and are repeated below:

   7.  MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-to-point
   LSPs.

   11.  The end points of an associated bidirectional LSP MUST be aware
   of the pairing relationship of the forward and reverse LSPs used to
   support the bidirectional service.

   12.  Nodes on the LSP of an associated bidirectional LSP where both
   the forward and backward directions transit the same node in the same
   (sub)layer as the LSP SHOULD be aware of the pairing relationship of
   the forward and the backward directions of the LSP.

   14.  MPLS-TP MUST support bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric
   bandwidth requirements, i.e., the amount of reserved bandwidth
   differs between the forward and backward directions.

   50.  The MPLS-TP control plane MUST support establishing associated
   bidirectional P2P LSP including configuration of protection functions
   and any associated maintenance functions.

   The above requirements are also repeated in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework].

   The notion of association, as well as the corresponding Resource
   reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) ASSOCIATION object, is defined in
   [RFC4872], [RFC4873] and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info] .  In that
   context, the object is used to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP
   they are protecting.  This object also has broader applicability as a
   mechanism to associate RSVP state, and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext]
   defines the Extended ASSOCIATION object that can be more generally
   applied.

   This document provides a method to bind two unidirectional Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) into an associated bidirectional LSP.  The
   association is achieved by using a new Association Type in the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Association of Two Reverse Unidirectional LSPs

3.1.  Provisioning Model

   The associated bidirectional LSP's forward and backward directions
   are set up, monitored, and protected independently as required by
   [RFC5654].  Configuration information regarding the LSPs can be sent
   to one end or both ends of the LSP.  Depending on the method chosen,
   there are two models of signaling associated bidirectional LSP.  The
   first model is the single sided provisioning, the second model is the
   double sided provisioning.

   For the single sided provisioning, the configurations are sent to one
   end.  Firstly, a unidirectional tunnel is configured on this end,
   then a LSP under this tunnel is initiated with the Extended
   ASSOCIATION object carried in the Path message to trigger the peer
   end to set up the corresponding reverse TE tunnel and LSP.

   For the double sided provisioning, the two unidirectional TE tunnels
   are configured independently, then the LSPs under the tunnels are
   signaled with the Extended ASSOCIATION objects carried in the Path
   message to indicate each other to associate the two LSPs together to
   be an associated bidirectional LSP.

   A number of scenarios exist for binding LSPs together to be an
   associated bidirectional LSP.  These include: (1) both of them do not
   exist; (2) both of them exist; (3) one LSP exists, but the other one
   need to be established.  In all scenarios described, the provisioning
   models discussed above are applicable.

3.2.  Signaling Procedure

   This section describes the signaling procedures for associating
   bidirectional LSPs.

   Consider the topology described in Figure 1.  (An example of
   associated bidirectional LSP).  The LSP1 [via nodes A,D,B] (from west
   to east) and LSP2 [via nodes B,D,C,A] (from east to west) are being
   established or have been established.  These LSPs can be bound
   together to form an associated bidirectional LSP.

   LSP1 is uniquely identified [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] by: West-
   Global_ID::West-Node_ID::West-Tunnel_Num::West-LSP_Num.

   LSP2 is uniquely identified [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] by: East-
   Global_ID::East-Node_ID::East-Tunnel_Num::East-LSP_Num.

3.2.1.  Single Sided Provisioning Model

   For the single sided provisioning model, LSP1 is triggered by LSP2 or
   LSP2 is triggered by LSP1.  When LSP2 is triggered by LSP1, according
   to the scenarios described above, the following cases may occur:

      1.  Both LSPs do not exist.
      LSP1 is initialized at node A with the Extended ASSOCIATION object
      inserted in the Path message, Association Type is set to
      "Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs", Association ID
      set to West-LSP_Num, Association Source set to West-Node_ID,
      Global Association Source set to West-Global_ID, and Extended
      Association ID set to West-Tunnel_Num. Terminating node B is
      triggered to set up LSP2 by the received Extended ASSOCIATION
      object with the Association Type set to the value "Association of
      two reverse unidirectional LSPs", the Association Object inserted
      in LSP2's Path message is the same as in LSP1's Path message.

      2.  LSP1 exists, LSP2 needs to be established.
      LSP1 is refreshed with the Extended ASSOCIATION object inserted in
      the Path message, Association Type is set to "Association of two
      reverse unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to West-LSP_Num,
      Association Source set to West-Node_ID, Global Association Source
      set to West-Global_ID, and Extended Association ID set to West-
      Tunnel_Num. Terminating node B is triggered to set up LSP2 by the
      received Extended ASSOCIATION object with the Association Type set
      to the value "Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs", the
      Association Object inserted in LSP2's Path message is the same as
      in LSP1's Path message.

      3.  LSP1 does not exist, LSP2 has been established.
      LSP1 is initialized with the Extended ASSOCIATION object inserted
      in the Path message, Association Type is set to "Association of
      two reverse unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to East-
      LSP_Num, Association Source set to East-Node_ID, Global
      Association Source set to East-Global_ID, and Extended Association
      ID set to East-Tunnel_Num. Terminating node B is triggered to
      refresh LSP2's Path message, with the received Extended
      ASSOCIATION object inserted.

      4.  Both LSP1 and LSP2 exist.
      LSP1 is refreshed with the Extended ASSOCIATION object inserted in
      the Path message, Association Type is set to "Association of two
      reverse unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to East-LSP_Num,
      Association Source set to East-Node_ID, Global Association Source
      set to East-Global_ID, and Extended Association ID set to East-
      Tunnel_Num. Terminating node B is triggered to refresh LSP2's Path
      message, with the received Extended ASSOCIATION object inserted.

   When LSP1 is triggered by LSP2, the same rules are applicable.  Based
   on the same values of the Association objects in the two LSPs' Path
   message, the two LSPs can be bound together to be an associated
   bidirectional LSP.

3.2.2.  Double Sided Provisioning Model

   For the double sided provisioning model, Similarly, according to the
   scenarios described above, the following cases may occur:

      1.  LSP1 and LSP2 do not exist.
      LSP1 and LSP2 are concurrently initialized with the Extended
      ASSOCIATION object inserted in the their Path messages, For LSP1,
      Association Type is set to "Association of two reverse
      unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to West-LSP_Num,
      Association Source set to West-Node_ID, Global Association Source
      set to West-Global_ID, and Extended Association ID set to West-
      Tunnel_Num. For LSP2, Association Type is set to "Association of
      two reverse unidirectional LSPs", Association ID is set to East-
      LSP_Num, Association Source set to East-Node_ID, Global
      Association Source set to East-Global_ID, and Extended Association
      ID set to East-Tunnel_Num. According to the general rules defined
      in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext], the two LSPs cannot be bound
      together to be an associated bidirectional LSP because of the
      different values.  In this case, the two edge nodes firstly MUST
      compare their Global-Node_ID, then the bigger one sends Path
      refresh message, replacing the old Extended ASSOCIATION object
      with the new Extended ASSOCIATION object carried in the reverse
      LSP.  Based on this Path refresh message, the two LSPs can be

      bounded together to be an associated bidirectional LSP also.

      2.  LSP1 exists, LSP2 needs to be established.
      For LSP1, Association Type is set to "Association of two reverse
      unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to West-LSP_Num,
      Association Source set to West-Node_ID, Global Association Source
      set to West-Global_ID, and Extended Association ID set to West-
      Tunnel_Num. For LSP2, Node B has known the existence of LSP1, so
      the Association Type is set to "Association of two reverse
      unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to West-LSP_Num,
      Association Source set to West-Node_ID, Global Association Source
      set to West-Global_ID, and Extended Association ID set to West-
      Tunnel_Num.

      3.LSP1 does not exist, LSP2 has been established.
      For LSP1, Node A has known the existenc of LSP2.  So the
      Association Type is set to "Association of two reverse
      unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to East-LSP_Num,
      Association Source set to East-Node_ID, Global Association Source
      set to East-Global_ID, and Extended Association ID set to East-
      Tunnel_Num. For LSP2, Node B does not know the existence of LSP1,
      so Association Type is set to "Association of two reverse
      unidirectional LSPs", Association ID set to East-LSP_Num,
      Association Source set to East-Node_ID, Global Association Source
      set to East-Global_ID, and Extended Association ID set to East-
      Tunnel_Num.

      4.  Both LSP1 and LSP2 exist.
      In this case, Both node A and Node B know the existence of the
      reverse LSPs.  The two edge nodes firstly MUST compare their
      Global-Node_ID, then the bigger one sends Path refresh message,
      with the reverse LSP's identifier inserted in the Extended
      ASSOCIATION object, and the smaller one sends Path refresh
      message, with its own LSP's identifier inserted in the Extended
      ASSOCIATION object.  For example, assuming that the node A has the
      bigger Global-Node_ID.  For LSP1, the Association Type is set to
      "Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs", Association ID
      set to East-LSP_Num, Association Source set to East-Node_ID,
      Global Association Source set to East-Global_ID, and Extended
      Association ID set to East-Tunnel_Num. For LSP2, the Association
      Type is set to "Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs",
      Association ID set to West-LSP_Num, Association Source set to
      East-Node_ID, Global Association Source set to East-Global_ID, and
      Extended Association ID set to East-Tunnel_Num.

   Based on the same values of the Association objects in the two LSPs'
   Path message, the two LSPs can be bound together to be an associated
   bidirectional LSP.

3.2.3.  Asymmetric Bandwidth LSPs

   A variety of applications, such as internet services and the return
   paths of OAM messages, exist and which MAY have different bandwidth
   requirements for each direction.  Additional [RFC5654] also specifies
   an asymmetric bandwidth requirement.  This requirement is
   specifically mentioned in Section 2.1.  (General Requirements), and
   is repeated below:

   14.  MPLS-TP MUST support bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric
   bandwidth requirements, i.e., the amount of reserved bandwidth
   differs between the forward and backward directions.

   The approach for supporting asymmetric bandwidth co-routed
   bidirectional LSPs is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-asymm-bw-bidir-lsps-bis], which introduces three new
   objects named UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object, UPSTREAM_TSPEC object and
   UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object to represent the asymmetric upstream traffic
   flow.  For the asymmetric bandwidth associated bidirectional LSPs,
   the existing SENDER_TSPEC, ADSPEC, and FLOWSPEC are complemented with
   the addition of a new REVERSE_TSPEC object, which is used exactly in
   the same fashion as the old SENDER_TSPEC object.

   Consider the topology descirbed in Figure 1 in the context of
   asymmetric associated bidirectional LSP, the following cases may
   occur:

      1.  LSP1 and LSP2 do not exist.
      For the single sided provisioning, taking LSP2 triggered by LSP1
      as an example.  The REVERSE_TSPEC object MUST be carried in the
      LSP1's Path message together with the Extended ASSOCIATION object
      whose Association Type is "Association of two reverse
      unidirectional LSPs".  The terminating node B is triggered to set
      up the reverse LSP2 with the corresponding asymmetric bandwidth,
      and the REVERSE_TSPEC object is converted to the SENDER_TSPEC
      object in the Path message.
      For the double sided provisioning, the REVERSE_TSPEC object MUST
      be carried in the two LSPs' Path message together with the
      Extended ASSOCIATION object whose Association Type is "Association
      of two reverse unidirectional LSPs".  Then the two terminating
      ends MUST compare the values of the SENDER_TSPEC and REVERSE_TSPEC
      objects in the two Path messages.  If the values match, the end
      with the bigger Global-Node_ID sends Path refresh message,
      carrying the Extended ASSOCIATION object of the reverse LSP.

      2.  LSP1 exists, LSP2 needs to be established.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP         June 2011


      For the single sided provisioning, taking LSP2 triggered by LSP1
      as an example.  The REVERSE_TSPEC object MUST be carried in the
      LSP1's Path refresh message together with the Extended ASSOCIATION
      object whose Association Type is "Association of two reverse
      unidirectional LSPs".  The terminating node B is triggered to set
      up the reverse LSP2 with the corresponding asymmetric bandwidth,
      and the REVERSE_TSPEC object is converted to the SENDER_TSPEC
      object in the Path message.
      For the double sided provisioning, the REVERSE_TSPEC object MUST
      be carried in the LSP1's Path refresh message with the Extended
      ASSOCIATION object whose Association Type is "Association of two
      reverse unidirectional LSPs".  There is no need to put the
      REVERSE_TSPEC object in LSP2's Path message, for the Extended
      ASSOCIATION object has indicated that LSP2 needs to be bound with
      LSP1.

      3.  LSP1 does not exist, LSP2 has been established.
      For the single sided provisioning, taking LSP2 triggered by LSP1
      as an example.  There is no need to put the REVERSE_TSPEC object
      in LSP1's Path message, for the Extended ASSOCIATION object has
      indicates that LSP1 needs to be bound with LSP2.
      For the double sided provisioning, just the same reason, the
      REVERSE_TSPEC object only needs to be carried in the LSP2's Path
      refresh message.

      4.  Both LSP1 and LSP2 exist.
      For the single sided provisioning, taking LSP2 triggered by LSP1
      as an example.  There is no need to put the REVERSE_TSPEC object
      in LSP1's Path message also for the Extended ASSOCIATION object
      has indicates that LSP1 needs to be bound with LSP2.
      As to the double sided provisioning, just the same reason, the
      REVERSE_TSPEC object does not need to be carried in the two LSPs'
      Path messages.

   Based on the same values of the Association objects in the two LSPs'
   Path message, and the match of the REVERSE_TSPEC and SENDER_TSPEC
   objects in the two LSPs' Path message (if the REVERSE_TSPEC object
   exists), the two LSPs can be bound together to be an associated
   bidirectional LSP.

3.2.3.1.  Error Handling

   Nodes not supporting the new class number of the REVERSE_TSPEC object
   SHOULD respond with an "Unknown Object Class".

3.3.  Recovery Considerations

   Consider the topology described in Figure 1, LSP1 and LSP2 form the
   associated bidirectional LSP.  Under the scenario of recovery, a
   third LSP (LSP3) MAY be used to protect LSP1.  LSP3 can be
   established before or after the failure occurs, it can share the same
   TE tunnel with LSP1 or not.

   In the case that LSP3 is established after the failure occurs, the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object with LSP2's identifier SHOULD be inserted
   in LSP3's Path message since LSP2 has already existed.  If LSP1 and
   LSP2 are associated together by the LSP1's identifier, LSP2's Path
   message is refreshed, an additional Extended ASSOCIAION object with
   LSP2's identifier are inserted.  If LSP1 and LSP2 are bound together
   by the LSP2's identifier, there is no need to insert an additional
   Extended ASSOCIATION object in LSP2's Path message.

   In the case that LSP3 is established before the failure occurs.  For
   single sided provisioning, LSP3 is refreshed with the Extended
   ASSOCIATION object, its values are filled by LSP2's identifier.  Then
   LSP2 is refreshed with this Extended ASSOCIATION object or not, see
   the description in the above paragraph.  For double sided
   provisioning, if node A has the bigger Global-Node_ID than node B,
   LSP3 is refreshed with the Extended ASSOCIATION object whose values
   are filled by LSP2's identifier, and LSP2 is refreshed with this
   Extended ASSOCIATION object or not, see the description in the above
   paragraph.  If node A has the smaller Global-Node_ID than node B,
   LSP3 is refreshed with the Extended ASSOCIATION object whose values
   are filled by LSP3's identifier, and LSP2 is refreshed with this
   Extended ASSOCIATION object.


4.  Extensions to the Extended ASSOCIATION object

   The Extended ASSOCIATION object is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext], which enables MPLS-TP required
   identification.

   The Extended IPv4 ASSOCIATION object (Class-Num of the form 11bbbbbb
   with value = 199, C-Type = TBA) has the format:

                     Extended IPv6 ASSOCIATION object

   o  Association Type:

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP         June 2011


      In order to bind two reverse unidirectional LSPs to be an
      associated bidirectional LSP, this document defines a new
      Association Type:



       Value      Type
       -----      -----
       4 (TBD)    Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs (A)


      If the downstream nodes are not aware of the Association Type,
      they MUST return a PathErr message with error code/sub-code "LSP
      Admission Failure/Bad Association Type".
      Under the context of this Association Type, any node associating
      an associated bidirectional LSP MUST insert an ASSOCIATION object
      with the following setting:

   o  Association ID:

      The Association ID MUST be set to its own signaled LSP ID
      (default); if known, it MAY be set to the LSP ID of the associated
      reverse LSP.

   o  Association Source:

      The Association source MUST be set to the tunnel sender address of
      this LSP (default); if known, it May be set to the tunnel sender
      address of the peer node.

   o  Global Association Source:

      The format is described in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext].

   o  Extended Association ID:

      Because the two LSPs (one is from west to east, and the other is
      from east to west) are in different tunnels, the Association ID is
      insufficient to uniquely identify association for associated
      bidirectional LSP.  Hence, this document adds specific rules: the
      first 16-bits MUST be set to its own tunnel ID (default); if
      known, it May be set to the tunnel ID of the the associated
      reverse tunnel.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext], association is always
   done based on matching Path state or Resv state.  Upstream
   initializted association is represented in Extended ASSOCIATION
   objects carried in Path message and downstream initializted

   association is represented in Extended ASSOCIATION objects carried in
   Resv messages.  The new defined association type in this document is
   only defined for use in upstream initialized association.  Thus it
   can only appear in Extended ASSOCIATION objects signaled in Path
   message.

   The rules associated with the processing of the Extended ASSOCIATION
   objects in RSVP message are discussed in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext].
   It said that in the absence of Association Type-specific rules for
   identifying association, the included Extended ASSOCIATION objects
   MUST be identical.  This document adds no specific rules, the
   association will always operate based on the same Extended
   ASSOCIATION objects.


5.  REVERSE_TSPEC Object

   The REVERSE_TSPEC object is used in Path, PathTear, PathErr, and
   Notify message (via sender descriptor).  This includes the definition
   of class type and format.  It's class number is TBD (of the form
   0bbbbbbb), and class type and format is the same as the SENDER_TSPEC
   object.

   This object modifies the RSVP message-related formats defined in
   [RFC2205], [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  See [RFC5511] for the syntax
   used by RSVP.  The format of the sender description for asymmetric
   associated bidirectional LSPs is:


   <sender descriptor>::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                           [<ADSPEC>]
                           [<RCEORD_ROUTE>]
                           [<SUGGESTED_LABEL>]
                           [<RECOVERY_LABEL>]
                           <REVERSE_TSPEC>




6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespace defined in this document and summarized in this section.

6.1.  Association Type

   Within the current document, a new Association Type is defined in the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP         June 2011


   Value      Type
   -----      -----
   4 (TBD)    Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs (A)


6.2.  REVERSE_TSPEC Object

   A new class named REVERSE_TSPEC has been created in the 0bbbbbbb rang
   (123,TBD) with the following definition:

   Class Types or C-types:

   Same values as SENDER_TPSCE object (C-Num 12)

   There are no other IANA considerations introduced by this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces a new association type, and except this,
   there are no security issues about the Extended ASSOCIATION object
   are introduced here.

   Furthermore, this document introduces the REVERSE_TSPEC object for
   use in GMPLS signaling [RFC3473], which is parallel the existing
   SENDER_TSPEC object.  As such, any vulnerabilities that are due to
   the use of the old SENDER_TSPEC object now apply here also.

   Otherwise, this document introduces no additional security
   considerations.  For a general discussion on MPLS and GMPLS related
   security issues, see the MPLS/GMPLS security framework [RFC5920].


8.  Acknowledgement

   The authors would like to thank Lou Berger for his great guidance in
   this work, George Swallow and Jie Dong for the discussion of
   recovery, Lamberto Sterling for his valuable comments on the section
   of asymmetric bandwidths, Daniel King for the review of the document,
