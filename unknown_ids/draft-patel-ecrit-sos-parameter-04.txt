Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency        March 2009


1.  Introduction

   One way to differentiate a SIP-based emergency call from an ordinary
   call is by the presence of the Service URN as defined in RFC 5031
   [RFC5031] (and used in the IETF emergency services architecture
   described in PhoneBCP[I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]).  The 3GPP IP
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) emergency services architecture,
   illustrated in 3GPP TS 23.167 [3GPP.23.167], specifies that the User
   Equipment (UE) performs emergency registration prior to or during the
   initiation of an emergency call.  The circumstances where such an
   emergency registration is required are listed below:

   - the UE is not registered with its home network;

   - the UE is currently registered but roaming (to ensure that the
   emergency call is handled in the visited network, as required by some
   jurisdictions).

   Emergency registration is possible only when the UE has sufficient
   credentials to register with its home network and can detect that an
   emergency session is initiated.  Unfortunately, marking of the
   emergency registration can not be fulfilled by the use of the Service
   URN.

   In some countries, it is a regulatory requirement that devices be
   able to place emegency calls in circumstances where other calls may
   not be permitted.  When a UE issues an emergency marked REGISTER
   request it informs the registrar that the contact address and the
   address-of-record being registered are to be used for emergency
   calls, and roaming and barring restrictions should not be applied for
   the registered address-of-record.  A call back from a PSAP would be
   routed to the registered contact address.

   This document proposes a way to mark a REGISTER message as an
   emergency registration.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119]

   non-emergency registration.


4.  The "sos" URI Parameter

   This section provides an overview of the proposed new URI parameter
   to be used for marking REGISTER requests related to emergency
   services.

   A new URI parameter "sos" is defined in this document.  The "sos"
   parameter is appended to a URI consistent with RFC 3261 [RFC3261].
   It is proposed that use of this URI parameter is restricted to the
   Contact header included in the REGISTER request (and the 2xx response
   to the REGISTER request) related to an emergency call only.  The
   "sos" URI parameter MUST NOT be considered as a replacement for the
   Service URN for emergency calls originated by a UA.

4.1.  REGISTER Request

   When the UA sends a REGISTER request for emergency registration, the
   "sos" URI parameter MUST be appended to the URI in the Contact
   header.  This serves as an indication to the registrar that the
   request is for emergency registration.

   Example:

   Contact: "Alice" <sip:alice@example.com;sos> ;q=0.7; expires=3600

   In the event that more than one Contact header field is included in
   the REGISTER request, only the contact addresses that include the
   "sos" URI parameter shall be considered as emergency registered
   contact addresses.

4.2.  2xx Reponse to REGISTER Request

   The "sos" URI parameter MUST be present in the Contact header in the
   200 (OK) response sent by the registrar upon successful registration.
   The "sos" URI parameter is appended to the URI included in the
   Contact header, thus indicating to the UA that this contact address
   will be included in the Contact header of an INVITE for emergency
   call initiation.

4.3.  Backwards compatibility issues

   The backwards compatibility scenario considered in this document is
   where a legacy registrar does not support the "sos" URI parameter.
   In this case, if the registrar receives a REGISTER request that
   includes the "sos" URI parameter in the Contact header, the registrar

Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency        March 2009


   proceeds with registration procedures and silently ignores the URI-
   parameter in accordance with RFC 3261[RFC3261].  This ensures the
   user is registered and thus can successfully initiate an emergency
   call.

   The drawback of proceeding with registration is if the address-of-
   record is for example barred or has roaming restrictions applied,
   then these restrictions will not be lifted and thus registration will
   be unsuccessful.  This can limit the UAC's ability to successfully
   place an emergency call.

   If registration is successful, the 200 (OK) response from a legacy
   registrar is unlikely to include the "sos" URI parameter in the
   Contact header.  The UAC is aware of its registered contact address
   and address-of-record, however, is unable to distinguish between this
   registration and a non-emergency registration.


5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

   The "sos" URI parameter is a "uri-parameter", as defined by RFC
   3261[RFC3261].

   uri-parameter =/ sos-param

   sos-param = "sos"


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new SIP URI parameter, as per the
   registry created by RFC 3969 [RFC3969]

   Parameter Name: sos

   Predefined Values: none

   Reference: [RFCXXXX]

   [NOTE TO IANA: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number of this
   specification.]

7.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the "sos" parameter itself does not raise any
   particular security issues.  The semantic described by the "sos"
   parameter are meant to be well-known so privacy considerations do not
   apply to the URI parameter.  The main possibility of attack involves
   use of the "sos" parameter to bypass the normal procedures in order
   to achieve fraudulent use of services or to bypass security
   procedures.  The usage of this parameter as described in this
   document is purely for the purpose of the REGISTER message and hence
   in presence of user authentication it is ensured that the respective
   user can be held accountable.

   It is RECOMMENDED to log events of misuse of the "sos" URI parameter,
   for example by including it in a request or response not related to
   an emergency calls.
