Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks           October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on multimedia quality using
   one of several standard metrics.

   The metrics belong to the class of application level metrics defined
   in [MONARCH] (work in progress).


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology used is
      Numeric formats S X:Y
         where S indicates a two's complement signed representation, X
         the number of bits prior to the decimal place and Y the number
         of bits after the decimal place.
         Hence 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to
         255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039.  S7:8 would represent the
         range -127.996 to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper binary
         fraction with range
         0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847
         though note that use of flag values at the top of the numeric
         range slightly reduces this upper limit.  For example, if the
         16- bit values 0xfffe and 0xffff are used as flags for "over-
         range" and "unavailable" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has range
         0.0 to 1 - 3/65536 = 0.9999542


3.  Applicability

   The Multimedia Quality Metrics Report Block can be used in any real-
   time AV application.

   The factors that affect real-time AV application quality can be split
   into two categories.  The first category consists of transport-
   dependent factors such as packet loss, delay and jitter (which also
   translates into losses in the playback buffer).  The factors in the
   second category are application-specific factors that affect real
   time application (e.g., video) quality and are sensitivity to network



Wu, et al.                 Expires May 1, 2012                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks           October 2011


   errors.  These factors can be but not limited to video codec and loss
   recovery technique, coding bit rate, packetization scheme, and
   content characteristics.

   Compared with application-specific factors, the transport-dependent
   factors sometimes are not sufficient to measure real time data
   quality, since the ability to analyze the real time data in the
   application layer provides quantifiable measurements for subscriber
   Quality of Experience (QoE) that may not be captured in the
   transmission layers or from the RTP layer down.  In a typical
   scenario, monitoring of the transmission layers can produce
   statistics suggesting that quality is not an issue, such as the fact
   that network jitter is not excessive.  However, problems may occur in
   the service layers leading to poor subscriber QoE.  Therefore
   monitoring using only network-level measurements may be insufficient
   when application layer content quality is required.

   In order to provide accurate measures of real time application
   quality when transporting real time contents across a network, the
   synthentical multimedia quality Metrics is highly required which can
   be conveyed in the RTCP XR packets[RFC3611] and may have the
   following three benefits:

   o  Tuning the content encoder algorithm to satisfy real time data
      quality requirements
   o  Determining which system techniques to use in a given situation
      and when to switch from one technique to another as system
      parameters change
   o  Verifying the continued correct operation of an existing system


4.  Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Block

   This block reports the multimedia application performance or quality
   beyond the information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.
   Information is recorded about multimedia application QoE metric which
   provides a measure that is indicative of the user's view of a
   service.  Multimedia application QoE metric is commonly expressed as
   a MOS ("Mean Opinion Score"), MOS is on a scale from 1 to 5, in which
   5 represents excellent and 1 represents unacceptable.  MOS scores are
   usually obtained using subjective testing or using objective
   algorithm.  However Subjective testing to estimate the multimedia
   quality may be not suitable for measuring the multimedia quality
   since the results may vary from test to test.  Therefore using
   objective algorithm to calculate MOS scores is recommended.  ITU-T
   recommendations define the methodologies for assessment of the
   performance of multimedia stream
   [G.107][P.564][G.1082][P.NAMS][P.NBAMS] and provides a method to

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks           October 2011


   evaluate QoE estimation algorithms and objective model for video and
   audio.  Hence this document recommends vendors and implementers to
   use these International Telecommunication Union (ITU)-specified
   methodologies to measure parameters when possible.


4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
   carried in the first part of the header.  Not all parameters need to
   be reported in each block.  Flags indicate which are and which are
   not reported.  The fields corresponding to unreported parameters MUST
   be present, but are set to zero.  The receiver MUST ignore any
   Perceptual Quality Metrics Block with a non-zero value in any field
   flagged as unreported.

   The Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Block has the following
   format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     BT=TBD    |I|  MC   | Rsd.|        block length           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                        SSRC of source                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          Rsv.           |        MOS Value                    |

4.2.  Definition of Fields in Multimedia Quality Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Block is identified by
      the constant <SMQM>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Basic Loss/Discard
      metrics are Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks           October 2011


   MoS Type (MT): 4 bits

      This field is used to indicate the MOS type to be reported.  The
      MOS type is defined as follows:

         0000 MOS-LQ - Listening Quality MoS.
         0001 MOS-CQ - Conversation Quality MoS.
         0010 MOS-V - Video Quality MOS.
         0011 MOS-AV - Audio-Video Quality MOS.
         0100~1111 - Reserved for future definitions.

      MoS-LQ measures the quality of audio for listening purposes only
      while MoS-CQ measures the quality of audio for conversation
      purpose only.  MoS-V and MoS-AV measures the quality of video
      application or Audio-Video application.Both MoS-LQ and MoS-CQ are
      commonly used in VoIP applications.  MOS-LQ uses either wideband
      audio codec or narrowband audio codec, or both and does not take
      into account any of bidirectional effects, such as delay and echo.
      MOS-CQ uses narrowband codec and takes into account listening
      quality in each direction, as well as the bidirectional effects.
      If MoS type is MoS-LQ and MoS-CQ, the MoS value can be calculated
      based on ITU-T G.107[G.107], ITU-T P.564 [P.564]or ETSI TS 101
      329-5 [ETSI], if the Mos type is MoS-V or MoS-AV, the Mos value
      can be calculated based on ITU-T P.NAMS [P.NAMS]or ITU-T P.NBAMS
      [P.NBAMS].  If new MOS types are defined, they can be added by an
      update to this document.  If the receiver does not understand the
      MOS type defined in this document it should discard this report.

   Rsd.:3 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Packet Delay Variation Metrics block, the block length is
      equal to 2.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks           October 2011


   Rsd.:16 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   MOS Value: 16 bits

      The estimated mean opinion score for multimedia application
      quality is defined as including the effects of delay,loss,
      discard,jitter and other effects that would affect multimedia
      quality .  It is expressed in numeric format 8:8 with the value in
      the range 0.0 to 255.996.  The valid the measured value ranges
      from 0.0 to 50.0, corresponding to MoS x 10 as for MoS.  If the
      measured value is over ranged, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be reported
      to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.  Values other
      than 0xFFFE,0xFFFF and the valid range defined above MUST NOT be
      sent and MUST be ignored by the receiving system.



5.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameter is defined for the report block defined in this
   document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  It has the
   following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute [RFC3611]:

   rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                     [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
         xr-format = multimedia-quality-metrics
            multimedia-quality-metrics = "multimedia-quality-metrics"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns one new block type value in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:
