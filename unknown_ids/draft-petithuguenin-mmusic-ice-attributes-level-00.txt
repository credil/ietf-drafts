Internet-Draft         Media level ICE attributes          February 2011


1.  Introduction

   ICE [RFC5245] defines the ice-options SDP attribute as session-level
   only attribute, but when ICE is used with disaggregated media (see
   section 3 of [I-D.loreto-splices-disaggregated-media]), there is a
   possibility that different media uses different ICE implementations
   and/or different networks, and so that differents media in the same
   SDP require different values for this attribute.

   As an example, the ice-options attribute value "rtp+ecn" (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-ecn-for-rtp]) signals ECN capability.  Two
   aggregated media using two different RTP implementations may want to
   use different values for this attribute.

   Note that there is a similar problem for the ice-lite attribute but
   unfortunately it does not seem possible to design a way to use the
   ice-lite attribute at the media level that is compatible with legacy
   implementations that recognize only the session-level attribute.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  ice-options Attribute

   The ice-options attribute is a session-level and media-level
   attribute.

   All future new ICE options must also defines how media-level ICE
   options using this new value are aggregated to eventually generate
   the value of the session-level ICE option, so legacy implementations
   that only recognize session-level ICE options can interoperate with
   implementations that recognize ICE options at both levels.


4.  rtp+ecn ICE option

   If all aggregated media contains the "rtp+ecn" ICE option defined by
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-ecn-for-rtp], then an "rtp+ecn" ICE option MUST be
   inserted at the session-level.
