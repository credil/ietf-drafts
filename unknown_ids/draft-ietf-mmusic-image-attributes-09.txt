             Negotiation of Generic Image Attributes in SDP
                 draft-ietf-mmusic-image-attributes-09

Abstract

   This document proposes a new generic session set up attribute to make
   it possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image
   size.  A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end hand-
   held terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
   something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing
   power.  The draft also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for video
   as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is
   transmitted.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a new attribute to make it possible to
   negotiate different image attributes such as image size.  The term
   image size is defined here as it may differ from the physical screen
   size of for instance a hand-held terminal.  As an example it may be
   beneficial to display a video image on a part of the physical screen
   and leave space on the screen for other features such as menus and
   other info.

   There are a number of benefits with a possibility to negotiate the
   image size:

   o  Less image distortion: Rescaling of images introduces additional
      distortion, something that can be avoided (at least on the
      receiver side) if the image size can be negotiated.

   o  Reduced receiver complexity: Image rescaling can be quite
      computation intensive.  For low end devices this can be a problem.

   o  Optimal quality for the given bitrate: The sender does not need to
      encode an entire CIF (352x288) image if only an image size of
      288x256 is displayed on the receiver screen.  This alternatively
      gives a saving in bitrate.

   o  Memory requirement: The receiver device will know the size of the
      image and can then allocate memory accordingly.

   o  Optimal aspect ratio: The indication of the supported image sizes
      and aspect ratio allows the receiver to select the most
      appropriate combination based on its rescaling capabilities and
      the desired rendering.  For example, if a sender proposes three
      resolutions in its SDP offer, 100x200, 200x100 and 100x100 with
      sar=1.0 (1:1) etc. then the receiver can select the option that
      fits the receiver screen best.

   In cases where rescaling is not implemented (for example, rescaling
   is not mandatory to implement in H.264 [H.264]), the indication of
   the image attributes may still provide an optimal use of bandwidth
   because the attribute will anyway give the encoder a better
   indication about what image size is preferred and will thus help to
   avoid wasting bandwidth by encoding with an unnecessarily large
   resolution.

   For implementers that are considering rescaling issues, it is worth
   notice that there are several benefits to do it on the sender side:

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


   o  Rescaling on the sender/encoder side is likely to be easier to do
      as the camera related software/hardware already contains the
      necessary functionality for zooming/cropping/trimming/sharpening
      the video signal.  Moreover, rescaling is generally done in RGB or
      YUV domain and should not depend on the codecs used.

   o  The encoder may be able to encode in a number of formats but may
      not know which format to choose as, without the image attribute,
      it does not know the receiver's performance or preference.

   o  The quality drop due to digital domain rescaling using
      interpolation is likely to be lower if it is done before the video
      encoding rather than after the decoding especially when low
      bitrate video coding is used.

   o  If low-complexity rescaling operations such as simple cropping
      must be performed, the benefit with having this functionality on
      the sender side is that it is then possible to present a miniature
      "what you send" image on the display to help the user to target
      the camera correctly.

   Several of the existing standards ([H.263], [H.264] and [MPEG-4])
   have support for different resolutions at different framerates.  The
   purpose of this document is to provide for a generic mechanism and is
   targeted mainly at the negotiation of the image size but to make it
   more general the attribute is named 'imageattr'.

   This document is limited to point-to-point unicast communication
   scenarios.  The attribute may be used in centralized conferencing
   scenarios as well but due to the abundance of configuration options
   it may then be difficult to come up with a configuration that fits
   all parties.

1.1.  Requirements

   The design of the image attribute is based on the following
   requirements which are listed only for informational purposes:

   REQ-1:  Support the indication of one or more set(s) of image
      attributes that the SDP endpoint wish to receive or send.  Each
      image attribute set must include a specific image size.

   REQ-2:  Support set up/negotiation of image attributes, meaning that
      each side in the Offer/Answer should be able to negotiate the
      image attributes it prefers to send and receive.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


   REQ-3:  Interoperate with codec specific parameters such as sprop-
      parameter-sets in [H.264] or config in [MPEG-4].

   REQ-4:  Make the attribute generic with as few codec specific
      details/tricks as possible in order to be codec agnostic.

   Besides the above mentioned requirements, the requirement below may
   be applicable.

   OPT-1:  The image attribute should support the description of image-
      related attributes for various types of media, including video,
      pictures, images, etc.


2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Specification of the 'imageattr' SDP Attribute

   This section defines the SDP image attribute 'imageattr', which can
   be used in an SDP Offer/Answer exchange to indicate various image
   attribute parameters.  In this document, we define the following
   image attribute parameters: image resolution, sample aspect ratio
   (sar), allowed range in picture aspect ratio (par) and the preference
   of a given parameter set over another (q).  The attribute is
   extensible and guidelines for defining additional parameters are
   provided in Section 3.2.9.

3.1.  Attribute syntax

   In this section the syntax of the 'imageattr' attribute is described.
   The 'imageattr' attribute is a media-level attribute.  The section is
   split up in two parts, the first gives an overall view of the syntax
   while the second describes how the syntax is used.

3.1.1.  Overall view of syntax

   The syntax for the image attribute is in ABNF [RFC5234]:

   o  The attribute typically contains a "send" and a "recv" keyword.
      These specify the preferences for the media once the session is
      set up, in the send and receive direction respectively from the
      point of view of the sender of the session description.

   o  The "send" keyword and corresponding attribute list (attr-list)
      MUST NOT occur more than once per image attribute.

   o  The "recv" keyword and corresponding attribute list (attr-list)
      MUST NOT occur more than once per image attribute.

   o  PT is the payload type number, it MAY be set to * to indicate that
      the attribute applies to all payload types in the media
      description.

   o  For sendrecv streams both of the send and recv directions SHOULD
      BE present.

   o  For inactive streams it is RECOMMENDED that both of the send and
      recv directions are present.

   o  For sendonly or recvonly streams one of the directions MAY be
      omitted.  See Section 3.2.3.

3.1.1.1.  Parameter rules

   For the parameters the following rules apply.

   Payload type number (PT):  The image attribute is bound to a specific
      codec by means of the payload type number.  A wild card (*) can be
      specified for the payload type number to indicate that it applies
      to all payload types in the media description.  Several image
      attributes can be defined for instance for different video codec
      alternatives conditioned that the payload type number differs.
      Note that the attribute is associated to the codec(s), for
      instance an SDP offer may specify payload type number 101 while
      the answer may specify 102, this may make it troublesome to
      specify a payload type number with the 'imageattr' attribute.  The
      only solution that works in this case is to use a wild card (*)
      and thus specify that the image attribute applies to all codecs in
      a media description.

   Preference (q):  The preference for each set is 0.5 by default,
      setting the optional q parameter to another value makes it
      possible to set different preferences for the sets.  A higher
      value gives a higher preference for the given set.

   sar:  The sar parameter specifies the sample aspect ratio associated
      to the given range of x and y values.  The sar parameter is
      defined as dx/dy where dx and dy is the physical size of the
      pixels.  Square pixels gives a sar=1.0.  The parameter sar MAY be
      expressed as a range or as a single value.
      If this parameter is not present a default sar value of 1.0 is
      assumed.
      The interpretation of sar differs between the send and the receive
      directions.

      *  In the send direction it defines a specific sample aspect ratio
         associated to a given x and y image size (range).

      *  In the recv direction sar expresses that the receiver of the
         given medium prefers to receive a given x and y resolution with
         a given sample aspect ratio.

      See Section 3.2.4 for a more detailed discussion.
      The sar parameter will likely not solve all the issues that are
      related to different sample aspect ratios but it can help to solve
      them and reduce aspect ratio distortion.
      The response MUST NOT include a sar parameter if there is no
      acceptable value given.  The reason to this is that if the
      response includes a sar parameter it is interpreted as "sar
      parameter accepted" while removal of the sar parameter is treated
      as "sar parameter not accepted", for this reason it is safer to
      remove an unacceptable sar parameter altogether.

   par:  The par (width/height = x/y ratio) parameter indicates a range
      of allowed ratios between x and y physical size (picture aspect
      ratio).  This is used to limit the number of x and y image size
      combinations, par is given as
       ----
       par=[ratio_min-ratio_max]
       ----
      Where ratio_min and ratio_max are the min and max allowed picture
      aspect ratios.
      If sar and the sample aspect ratio that the receiver actually uses
      in the display are the same (or close), the relation between the x
      and y pixel resolution and the physical size of the image is
      straightforward.  If however sar differs from the sample aspect
      ratio of the receiver display this must be taken into
      consideration when the x and y pixel resolution alternatives are
      sorted out.

3.1.1.2.  Offer/answer rules

   In accordance with [RFC3264], offer answer exchange of the image
   attribute is as follows.

   o  Offerer sending the offer:

      *  The offerer must be able to support the image attributes that
         it offers.  The exception is if the offerer has expressed a
         wild card (*) in the attribute list.

      *  It is recommended that a device which sees no reason to use the
         image attribute, anyway includes the attribute with wild cards

         (*) in the attribute lists for the send and recv directions.
         An example of this looks like:
          ----
          a=imageattr:97 send * recv *
          ----
         This gives the answerer the possibility to express its
         preferences.  The use of wild cards introduces a risk that the
         message size can increase in an uncontrolled way.  To reduce
         this risk these wild cards SHOULD only be replaced by an as
         small set as possible.

   o  Answerer receiving the offer and sending the answer:

      *  The answerer may choose to keep the image attribute but is not
         required to do so.

      *  The answerer may, for its receive and send direction, include
         one or more entries that it can support from the set of entries
         proposed in the offer.

      *  The answerer may also, for its receive and send direction,
         replace the entries with a complete new set of entries
         different from the original proposed by the offerer.  The
         implementor of this feature should however be aware that this
         may cause extra offer/answer exchanges.

      *  The answerer may also remove its send direction completely if
         it is deemed that it cannot support any of the proposed
         entries.

      *  The answerer should not include an image attribute in the
         answer if it was not present in the offer.

   o  Offerer receiving the answer:

      *  If the image attribute is not included in the SDP answer the
         offerer SHOULD continue to process the answer as if this
         mechanism had not been offered.

      *  If the image attribute is included in the SDP answer but none
         of the entries are usable or acceptable, the offerer MUST
         resort to other methods to determine the appropriate image
         size.  In this case the offerer must also issue a new offer/
         answer without the image attribute to avoid misunderstandings
         between offerer and answerer.  This will avoid the risk on
         infinite negotiations.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


3.2.  Considerations

3.2.1.  No imageattr in 1st offer

   When the initial offer does not contain the 'imageattr' attribute,
   the rules in Section 3.1.1.2 require the attribute to be absent in
   the answer.  The reasons for this are:

   o  The offerer of the initial SDP is not likely to understand the
      image attribute if it did not include it in the offer, bearing in
      mind that Section 3.1.1 recommends that the offerer provide the
      attribute with wildcarded parameters if it has no preference.

   o  Inclusion of the image attribute in the answer may come in
      conflict with the rules in Section 3.1.1.2 esp. the rules that
      apply to "offerer receiving the answer".

   For the above reasons it is RECOMMENDED that a device which sees no
   reason to use the image attribute, anyway includes the attribute with
   wild cards (*) in the attribute lists for the send and recv
   directions.

3.2.2.  Asymmetry

   While the image attribute supports asymmetry there are some
   limitations to this.  One important limitation is that the codec
   being used can only support up to a given maximum resolution for a
   given profile level.

   As an example H.264 [H.264] with profile level 1.2 does not support
   higher resolution than 352x288 (CIF).  The offer/answer rules imply
   that the same profile level must be used in both directions.  This
   means that in an asymmetric scenario where Alice wants an image size
   of 580x360 and Bob wants 150x120, profile level 2.2 is needed in both
   directions even though profile level 1 would have been sufficient in
   one direction.

   Currently, the only solution to this problem is to specify two
   unidirectional media descriptions.  Note however that the asymmetry
   issue for the H.264 codec is solved by means of the level-asymmetry-
   allowed parameter in [RFC3984bis].

3.2.3.  sendonly and recvonly

   If the directional attributes a=sendonly or a=recvonly are given for
   a medium, there is of course no need to specify the image attribute
   for both directions.  Therefore one of the directions in the
   attribute may be omitted.  However it may be good to do the image

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


   attribute negotiation in both directions in case the session is
   updated for media in both directions at a later stage.

3.2.4.  Sample aspect ratio

   The relationship between the sar parameter and the x and y pixel
   resolution deserves some extra discussion.  Consider the offer from
   Alice to Bob (we set the recv direction aside for the moment):
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=1.1]
       ----
   If the receiver display has square pixels the 720x576 image would
   need to be rescaled to for example 792x576 or 720x524 to ensure a
   correct image aspect ratio.  This in practice means that rescaling
   would need to be performed on the receiver side, something that is
   contrary to the spirit of this draft.
   To avoid this problem Alice may specify a range of values for the sar
   parameter like:
       ----
       a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
       ----
   Meaning that Alice can encode with any of the mentioned sample aspect
   ratios, leaving to Bob to decide which one he prefers.

3.2.5.  SDPCapNeg support

   The image attribute can be used within the SDP Capability Negotiation
   [RFC5939] framework and its use is then specified using the "a=acap"
   parameter.  An example is
       ----
       a=acap:1 imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
       ----

   For use with SDP Media Capability Negotiation extension
   [SDPMedCapNeg], where it is no longer possible to specify payload
   type numbers, it is possible to use the parameter substitution rule,
   an example of this is.
      ----
      ...
      a=mcap:1 video H264/90000
      a=acap:1 imageattr:%1% send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
      ...
      ----

   Where %1% maps to media capability number 1.

   It is also possible to use the a=mscap attribute like in the example
   below.

       ...
       ----

3.2.6.  Interaction with codec parameters

   As the SDP for most codecs already specifies some kind of indication
   of, for example, the image size, at session set up, measures must be
   taken to avoid conflicts between the image attribute and this already
   existing information.

   The following subsections describe the most well known codecs and how
   they define image-size related information.  Section 3.2.6.4 outlines
   a few possible solutions, but this document does not make any
   recommendation for any of them.

3.2.6.1.  H.263

   The payload format for H.263 [H.263] is described in [RFC4629].

   H.263 defines (on the fmtp line) a list of image sizes and their
   maximum frame rates (profiles) that the offerer can receive.  The
   answerer is not allowed to modify this list and must reject a payload
   type that contains an unsupported profile.  The CUSTOM profile may be
   used for image size negotiation but support for asymmetry requires
   the specification of two unidirectional media descriptions using the
   sendonly/recvonly attributes.

3.2.6.2.  H.264

   The payload format for H.264 [H.264] is described in [RFC3984] and
   updated in [RFC3984bis].

   H.264 defines image size related information in the fmtp line by
   means of sprop-parameter-sets.  According to the specification
   several sprop-parameter-sets may be defined for one payload type.
   The sprop-parameter-sets describe the image size (+ more) that the
   offerer sends in the stream and need not be complete.  This means
   that this does not represent any negotiation.  Moreover an answer is
   not allowed to change the sprop-parameter-sets.

   This configuration may be changed later inband if for instance image
   sizes need to be changed or added.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


3.2.6.3.  MPEG-4

   The payload format for MPEG-4 [MPEG-4] is described in [RFC3016].

   MPEG-4 defines a config parameter on the fmtp line which is a
   hexadecimal representation of the MPEG-4 visual configuration
   information.  This configuration does not represent any negotiation
   and the answer is not allowed to change the parameter.

   It is not possible to change the configuration using inband
   signaling.

3.2.6.4.  Possible solutions

   The subsections above clearly indicate that this kind of information
   must be aligned well with the image attribute to avoid conflicts.
   There are a number of possible solutions, listed below without any
   preference:

   o  Ignore payload format parameters: This may not work well in the
      presence of bad channel conditions especially in the beginning of
      a session.  Moreover this is not a good option for MPEG-4.

   o  2nd session-wide offer/answer round: In the 2nd offer/answer the
      codec payload format specific parameters are defined based on the
      outcome of the 'imageattr' negotiation.  The drawback with this is
      that set up of the entire session (including audio) may be delayed
      considerably, especially as the 'imageattr' negotiation can
      already itself cost up to two offer/answer rounds.  Also the
      conflict between the 'imageattr' negotiation and the payload
      format specific parameters is still present after the first offer/
      anser round and a fuzzy/buggy implementation may start media
      before the second offer/answer is completed with unwanted results.

   o  2nd session-wide offer/answer round only for video: This is
      similar to the alternative above with the exception that set up
      time for audio is not increased, moreover the port number for
      video is set to 0 during the 1st offer answer round to avoid that
      media flows.
      This has the effect that video will blend in some time after the
      audio is started (up to 2 seconds delay).  This alternative is
      likely the most clean-cut and failsafe alternative.  The drawback
      is, as the port number in the first offer is always zero, the
      media startup will always be delayed even though it would in fact
      have been possible to start media already after the first offer/
      answer round.
      Note that according to [RFC3264], a port number of zero means that
      the whole media line is rejected meaning that a new offer for the

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


      same port number should be treated as a completely new stream and
      not as an update.  The most safe way to solve this problem is to
      use preconditions, this is however outside the scope of this
      document.

3.2.7.  Change of display in middle of session

   A very likely scenario is that a user switches to another phone
   during a video telephony call or plugs a cellphone into an external
   monitor.  In both cases it is very likely that a renegotiation is
   initiated using the SIP-REFER or SIP-UPDATE methods.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to negotiate the image size during this renegotiation.

3.2.8.  Use with layered codecs

   As the image attribute is a media level attribute, its use with
   layered codecs cause some concern.  If the layers are transported in
   different RTP streams the layers are specified on different media
   descriptions and the relation is specified using the grouping
   framework [RFC5888] and the depend attribute [RFC5583].  As it is not
   possible to specify only one image attribute for several media
   descriptions the solution is either to specify the same image
   attribute for each media description, or to only specify the image
   attribute for the base layer.

3.2.9.  Addition of parameters

   The image attribute allows for the addition of parameters in the
   future.  To make backwards adaptation possible; an entity that
   processes the attribute MUST ignore any unknown parameters in the
   offer and MUST NOT include them in the answer it generates.  Addition
   of future parameters that are not understood by the receiving
   endpoint may lead to ambiguities if mutual dependencies between
   parameters exist, therefore addition of parameters must be done with
   great care.


4.  Examples

   This section gives some more information on how to use the attribute
   by means of a high-level example and a few detailed examples.

4.1.  A High-Level Example

   Assume that Alice wishes to set up a session with Bob and that Alice
   takes the first initiative.  The syntactical white-space delimiters
   (1*WSP) and double-quotes are removed to make reading easier.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP                Nov 2010


   In the offer Alice provides information for both the send and receive
   (recv) directions.  For the send direction Alice provides a list that
   the answerer can select from.  For the receive direction Alice may
   either specify a desired image size range right away or a * to
   instruct Bob to reply with a list of image sizes that Bob can support
   for sending.  Using the overall high level syntax the image attribute
   may then look like
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list
       ----
   or
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv *
       ----
   In the first alternative the recv direction may be a full list of
   desired image size formats.  It may however (and most likely) just be
   a list with one alternative for the preferred x and y resolution.

   If Bob supports an x and y resolution in at least one of the X and Y
   ranges given in the send attr-list and in the recv attr-list of the
   offer, the answer from Bob will look like:
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list
       ----
   And the offer answer negotiation is done.  Worth notice here is that
   the attr-list will likely be pruned in the answer.  While it may
   contain many different alternatives in the offer it may in the end
   contain just one or two alternatives.

   If Bob does not support any x and y resolution in one of the provided
   send or recv ranges given in the send attr-list or in the recv attr-
   list, the corresponding part is removed completely.  For instance, if
   Bob doesn't support any of the offered alternatives in the recv attr-
   list in the offer, the answer from Bob would look like:
       ----
       a=imageattr:PT recv attr-list
       ----

4.2.  Detailed Examples

   This section gives a few detailed examples, it is assumed where
   needed that Alice initiates a session with Bob

4.2.1.  Example 1

   Two image resolution alternatives are offered with 800x640 with
   sar=1.1 having the highest preference

   It is also indicated that Alice wish to display video with a
   resolution of 330x250 on her display
    ----
    a=imageattr:97 send [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1,q=0.6] [x=480,y=320] \
                   recv [x=330,y=250]
    ----

   In case Bob accepts the "recv [x=330,y=250]" the answer may look like
    ----
    a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                   send [x=330,y=250]
    ----

   Indicating that the receiver (Bob) wish the encoder (on Alice's side)
   to compensate for a sample aspect ratio of 1.1 (11:10) and desires an
   image size on its screen of 800x640.

   There is however a possibility that "recv [x=330,y=250]" is not
   supported.  If the case, Bob may completely remove this part or
   replace it with a list of supported image sizes.
    ----
    a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                   send [x=[320:16:640],y=[240:16:480],par=[1.2-1.3]]
    ----

   Alice can then select a valid image size which is closest to the one
   that was originally desired (336x256) and performs a second offer/
   answer
    ----
    a=imageattr:97 send [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                   recv [x=336,y=256]
    ----

   Bob replies with:
    ----
    a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                   send [x=336,y=256]
    ----

4.2.2.  Example 2

   Two image resolution sets are offered with the first having a higher
   preference (q=0.6).

           [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176],par=[1.2-1.3]] \
      recv *
    ----

   The x-axis resolution can take the values 480 to 800 in 16 pixels
   steps and 176 to 208 in 8 pixels steps.  The par parameter limits the
   set of possible x and y screen resolution combinations such that
   800x640 (ratio=1.25) is a valid combination while 720x608
   (ratio=1.18) or 800x608 (ratio=1.31) are invalid combinations.

   For the recv direction (Bob->Alice) Bob is requested to provide with
   a list of supported image sizes

4.2.3.  Example 3

   In this example a more of the SDP offer is shown.
    ----
    m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99
    a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
    a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42e011; \
      sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LgC5ZUCg/I,aM4BrFSAa
    a=imageattr:99 \
      send [x=176,y=144] [x=224,y=176] [x=272,y=224] [x=320,y=240] \
      recv [x=176,y=144] [x=224,y=176] [x=272,y=224,q=0.6] [x=320,y=240]
    ----

   In the send direction, sprop-parameter-sets is defined for a
   resolution of 320x240 which is the largest image size offered in the
   send direction.  This means that if 320x240 is selected, no
   additional offer/answer is necessary.  In the receive direction four
   alternative image sizes are offered with 272x224 being the preferred
   choice.

   The answer may look like:
    ----
    m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99
    a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
    a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42e011; \

    a=imageattr:99 send [x=320,y=240] recv [x=320,y=240]
    ----

   Indicating (in this example) that the image size is 320x240 in both
   directions.  Although the offerer preferred 272x224 for the receive
   direction, the answerer might not be able to offer 272x224 or not

   allow encoding and decoding of video of different image sizes
   simultaneously.  The answerer sets new sprop-parameter-sets,
   constructed for both send and receive directions at the restricted
   conditions and image size of 320x240.

4.2.4.  Example 4

   This example illustrates in more detail how compensation for
   different sample aspect ratios can be negotiated with the image
   attribute.

   We set up a session between Alice and Bob, Alice is the offerer of
   the session.  The offer (from Alice) contains the image attribute
   below:
     ----
     a=imageattr:97 \
       send [x=400:16:800],y=[320:16:640],sar=[1.0-1.3],par=[1.2-1.3]] \
       recv [x=800,y=600,sar=1.1]
     ----

   First we consider the recv direction: The offerer (Alice) explicitly
   states that she wish to receive the screen resolution 800x600,
   however she also indicates that the screen on her display does not
   use square pixels, the sar value=1.1 means that Bob must (preferably)
   compensate for this.
   So..  If Bob's video camera produces square pixels, and wish to
   satisfy Alice's sar requirement, the image processing algorithm must
   rescale a 880x600 pixel image (880=800*1.1) to 800x600 pixels (could
   be done other ways).

   ... and now the send direction: Alice indicates that she can (in the
   image processing algorithms) rescale the image for sample aspect
   ratios in the range 1.0 to 1.3.  She can also provide with a number
   of different image sizes (in pixels) ranging from 400x320 to 800x640.
   Bob inspects the offered sar and image sizes and responds with the
   modified image attribute
    ----
    a=imageattr:97 \
      recv [x=464,y=384,sar=1.15] \
      send [x=800,y=600,sar=1.1]
    ----

   Alice will, in order to satisfy Bob's request, need to rescale the
   image from her video camera from 534x384 (534=464*1.15) to 464x384.

   Neither part is required to rescale like this (sar may be ignored),
   the consequence will of course be a distorted image.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4566], the IANA is requested to
   register one new SDP attribute:

   Attribute name:     imageattr

   Long form name:     Image attribute

   Type of attribute:  Media-level

   Subject to charset: No

   Purpose:            This attribute defines the ability to negotiate
                       various image attributes such as image sizes.
                       The attribute contains a number of parameters
                       which can be modified in and offer/answer
                       exchange.
