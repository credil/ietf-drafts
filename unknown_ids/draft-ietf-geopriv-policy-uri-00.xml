    <abstract>
      <t>Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning
      an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's location.
      These protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to inspect or set
      the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they distribute. This
      document extends the current location configuration protocols to provide
      hosts with a reference to the rules that are applied to a URI, so that
      the host can view or set these rules.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro-sec" title="Introduction">
      <t>A critical step in enabling Internet hosts to access location-based
      services is to provision those hosts with information about their own
      location. This is accomplished via a Location Configuration Protocol
      (LCP) <xref target="RFC5687"></xref>, which allows a location provider
      (e.g., a local access network) to inform a host about its location.</t>

      <t>There are two basic patterns for location configuration, namely
      configuration "by value" and "by reference" <xref
      target="RFC5808"></xref>. Configuration by value provisions a host
      directly with its location, by providing it location information that is
      directly usable (e.g., coordinates or a civic address). Configuration by
      reference provides a host with a URI that references the host's
      location, i.e., one that can be dereferenced to obtain the location (by
      value) of the host.</t>

      <t>In some cases, location by reference offers a few benefits over
      location by value. From a privacy perspective, the required dereference
      transaction provides a policy enforcement point, so that the opaque URI
      itself can be safely conveyed over untrusted media (e.g., SIP through
      untrusted proxies <xref target="RFC5606"></xref>). If the target host is
      mobile, an application provider can use a single reference to obtain the
      location of the host multiple times, saving bandwidth to the host. For
      some configuration protocols, the location object referenced by a
      location URI provides a much more expressive syntax for location values
      than the configuration protocol itself (e.g., DHCP geodetic location
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-rfc3825bis"></xref> versus GML in a
      PIDF-LO <xref target="RFC4119"></xref>).</t>

      <t>From a privacy perspective, however, current LCPs are limited in
      their flexibility, in that they do not provide the Device (the client in
      an LCP) with a way to inform the Location Server with policy for how his
      location information should be handled. This document addresses this gap
      by defining a simple mechanism for referring to and manipulating policy,
      and by extending current LCPs to carry policy references. Using the
      mechanisms defined in this document, an LCP server (acting for the
      Location Server) can inform a client as to which policy document
      controls a given location resource, and the LCP client (in its Rule
      Maker role) can inspect this document and modify it as necessary.</t>

      <t>The remainder of this document is structured as follows: After
      introducing a few relevant terms, we define policy URIs as a channel for
      referencing, inspecting, and updating policy documents. We then define
      extensions to the HELD protocol and the DHCP option for location by
      reference to allow these protocols to carry policy URIs. Examples are
      given that demonstrate how policy URIs are carried in these protocols
      and how they can be used by clients.</t>

    <section anchor="policy-uri-sec" title="Policy URIs">
      <t>A policy URI is an <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref> URI that
      identifies a policy resource that contains the authorization policy for
      a linked location resource. Access to the location resource is governed
      by the contents of the authorization policy.</t>

      <t>A policy URI identifies an HTTP resource that a Rule Maker can use to
      inspect and install policy documents that tell a Location Server how it
      should protect the associated location resource. A policy URI always
      identifies a resource that can be represented as a <xref
      target="RFC4745">common-policy document</xref> (possibly including some
      extensions; e.g., for <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy">geolocation
      policy</xref>).</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Note:"><xref target="RFC3693">RFC 3693</xref>
          identified the Rule Holder role as the one that stores policy
          information. In this document, the Location Server is also a Rule
          Holder.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section anchor="policy-uri-usage-sec" title="Policy URI Usage">
        <t>A Location Server that is the authority for policy URIs MUST
        support GET, PUT, and DELETE requests to these URIs, in order to allow
        clients to inspect, replace, and delete policy documents. Clients
        support the three request methods as they desire to perform these
        operations.</t>

        <t>Knowledge of the policy URI can be considered adequate evidence of
        authorization. A Location Server SHOULD allow all requests, but it MAY
        deny certain requests based on local policy. For instance, a Location
        Server might allow clients to inspect policy (GET), but not to update
        it (PUT).</t>

        <t>A GET request to a policy URI is a request for the referenced
        policy information. If the request is authorized, then the Location
        Server sends an HTTP 200 response containing the complete policy
        identified by the URI.</t>

        <t>A PUT request to a policy URI is a request to replace the current
        policy. The entity-body of a PUT request includes a complete policy
        document. When a Location Server receives a PUT request, it MUST
        validate the policy document included in the body of the request. If
        the request is valid and authorized, then the Location Server replaces
        the current policy with the policy provided in the request.</t>

        <t>A DELETE request to a policy URI is a request to delete the
        referenced policy document and terminate access to the protected
        resource. If the request is authorized, then the Location Server
        deletes the policy referenced by the URI and disallows any further
        access to the location resource it governs.</t>

        <t>The Location Server MUST support policy documents in the <xref
        target="RFC4745">common-policy format</xref>, as identified by the
        MIME media type of <spanx style="verb">application/auth-policy+xml</spanx>.
        The common-policy format MUST be provided as the default format in
        response to GET requests that do not include specific <spanx
        style="verb">Accept</spanx> headers, but content negotiation MAY be
        used to allow for other formats.</t>

        <t>This usage of HTTP is generally compatible with the use of <xref
        target="RFC4825">XCAP</xref> or <xref target="RFC4918">WebDAV</xref>
        to manage policy documents, but this document does not define or
        require the use of these protocols.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="policy-uri-alloc-sec" title="Policy URI Allocation">
        <t>A Location Server creates a policy URI for a specific location
        resource at the time that the location resource is created; that is, a
        policy URI is created at the same time as the location URI that it
        controls. The URI of the policy resource MUST be different to the
        location URI.</t>

        <t>A policy URI is provided in response to location configuration
        requests. A policy URI MUST NOT be provided to an entity that is not
        authorized to view or set policy. This document does not describe how
        policy might be provided to entities other than for location
        configuration. in responses to <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-deref-protocol">dereferencing requests</xref>
        or <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-identity-extensions">requests
        from third parties</xref>.</t>

        <t>Each location URI has either one policy URI or no policy URI. The
        initial policy that is referenced by a policy URI MUST be identical to
        the policy that would be applied in the absence of a policy URI. A
        client that does not support policy URIs can continue to use the
        location URI as they would have if no policy URI were provided.</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>For DHCP and HELD, the client assumes that the default policy
            grants any requester access to location information, as long as
            the request possesses the location URI. To ensure that the
            authorization policy is less permissive, a client updates the
            policy prior to distributing the location URI.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A Location Server chooses whether or not to provide a policy URI
        based on local policy. A HELD-specific extension also allows a
        requester to specifically ask for a policy URI.</t>

        <t>A policy URI is a shared secret between Location Server and its
        clients. Knowledge of a policy URI is all that is required to perform
        any operations allowed on the policy. Thus, a policy URI is
        constructed so that it is hard to predict (see <xref
        target="sec-cons-sec"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Location configuration protocols can provision hosts with location

    <section anchor="sec-cons-sec" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>There are two main classes of risks associated with access control
      policy management: The risk of unauthorized disclosure of the protected
      resource via manipulation of the policy management process, and the risk
      of disclosure of policy information itself.</t>

      <t>Protecting the policy management process from manipulation entails
      two primary requirements: First, the policy URI has to be faithfully and
      confidentially transmitted to the client, and second, the policy
      document has to be faithfully and confidentially transmitted to the
      Location Server. The mechanism also needs to ensure that only authorized
      entities are able to acquire or alter policy.</t>

      <section title="Integrity and Confidentiality for Authorization Policy Data">
        <t>Each LCP ensures integrity and confidentiality through different
        means (see <xref
        target="RFC5985"></xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-lbyr-uri-option"></xref>). These
        measures ensure that a policy URI is conveyed to the client without
        modification or interception.</t>

        <t>To protect the integrity and confidentiality of policy data during
        management, the Location Server SHOULD provide policy URIs with the
        <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> scheme and require the use of <xref
        target="RFC2818">HTTP over TLS</xref>. The cipher suites required by
        <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> provide both integrity protection
        and confidentiality. If other means of protection are available, an
        <spanx style="verb">http:</spanx> URI MAY be used.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Access Control for Authorization Policy">
        <t>Access control for the policy resource is based on knowledge of its
        URI. The URI of a policy resource operates under the same constraints
        as a <xref target="RFC5808">possession model location URI</xref> and
        is subject to the same constraints: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Knowledge of a policy URI MUST be restricted to authorized Rule
            Makers. Confidentiality is required for its conveyance in the
            location configuration protocol, and in the requests that are used
            to inspect, change or delete the policy resource.</t>

            <t>The Location Server MUST ensure that the URI cannot be easily
            predicted. The policy URI MUST NOT be derived solely from
            information that might be public, including the Target identity or
            any location URI. The addition of random entropy increases the
            difficulty of guessing a policy URI.</t>
          </list></t>

        <!--      <t>Additional requestor authentication MAY be used for policy resources.  For instance, in the particular case where the Device is identified to the Location Server by its IP address, the Location Server could use IP return routability as an additional authentication mechanism.</t> -->
      </section>

      <section title="Location URI Allocation">
        <t>A policy URI enables the <xref target="RFC5808">authorization by
        access control lists model</xref> for associated location URIs. Under
        this model, it might be possible to more widely distribute a location
        URI, relying on the authorization policy to constrain access to
        location information.</t>

        <t>To allow for wider distribution, authorization by access control
        lists places additional constraints on the construction of location
        URIs.</t>

        <t>If multiple Targets share a location URI, an unauthorized location
        recipient that acquires location URIs for the Targets can determine
        that the Targets are at the same location by comparing location URIs.
        With shared policy URIs, Targets are able to see and modify
        authorization policy for other Targets.</t>

        <t>To allow for the creation of Target-specific authorization policies
        that are adequately privacy-protected, every location URI and policy
        URI that is issued to a different Target MUST be different. That is,
        no two client can receive the same location URI or policy URI.</t>

        <t>In some deployments it is not always apparent to a LCP server that
        two clients are different. In particular, where a <xref
        target="RFC3234">middlebox</xref> exists two or more clients might
        appear as a single client. An example of a deployment scenario of this
        nature is described in <xref target="RFC5687"></xref>. An LCP server
        MUST create a different location URI and policy URI for every request,
        unless the requests can be reliably identified as being from the same
        client.</t>
