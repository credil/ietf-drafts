Abstract

   IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support
   ASON routing requirements.  These extensions have been given EXP
   status rather than Standards Track and according to guidelines for
   OSPFv2 have not been allocated standard codepoints by IANA.

   This draft describes implementation and interoperability testing
   experiences with ASON routing extensions to OSPFv2 which provide
   equivalent routing functionality to the extensions defined in IETF
   CCAMP with some differences in formatting of the extensions.

   This summary of implementation and testing is provided to help move

1.  Introduction

   This draft presents results of interoperability testing on the part
   of the authors and others that have been involved in understanding
   and prototyping routing for ASON as part of the OIF (Optical
   Internetworking Forum).  Some of the authors have contributed to the
   work in IETF on ASON routing requirements and protocol evaluation.
   Many of the requirements and protocol functions discussed in
   [RFC4258] and [RFC4652] have been incorporated into prototyping work
   at OIF.  Experimental protocol extensions to OSPF were implemented to
   support the functions identified in [RFC4258] and [RFC4652].

   Note that these extensions have been tested in a transport-only
   instance of OSPF, i.e. routing implementations supported only optical
   routing and did not participate in any IP routing use of OSPF.

   Since then, the IETF has published a draft ( [OSPF-ASON]) addressing
   some of the features implemented by those prototypes.  However, the
   latest revision of [OSPF-ASON] (-09) no longer provides IETF-
   standardized code points for such sub-TLVs, due to its Experimental
   Status and the existing guidelines for allocation of codepoints for
   OSPF.

   This draft summarizes testing of ASON routing extensions done by the
   authors and others participating in OIF interop testing to assist in
   the process of moving ASON routing extensions to Standards Track.


2.  Reachability

2.1.  Review of ASON Routing draft

   In order to advertise blocks of reachable address prefixes a
   summarization mechanism was proposed in [OSPF-ASON].

   This extension consists of a network mask (a 32-bit number indicating
   the range of IP addresses residing on a single IP network/subnet).
   The set of local addresses is carried in an OSPFv2 TE LSA node
   attribute TLV (a specific sub-TLV is defined per address family,
   i.e., IPv4 and IPv6, used as network-unique identifiers).

   Similar functionality was implemented and tested by the authors and
   others.  At the time of initial prototyping, the OSPFv2 TE LSA node
   attribute TLV had not been defined, so somewhat different formatting
   was used to carry IP prefixes.

   The tested solution used a new sub-TLV to carry the same information,
   called the Reachable IPv4 Prefix sub-TLV.  This sub-TLV was carried

   in a new OSPFv2 Reachable Address TLV.  Details of the TLV are given
   in section 5.

2.2.  Tested IPv4 Reachability Advertisement

   The Reachable IPv4 Prefix sub-TLV used the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Addr length: specifies the length of the prefix as a number of Bits.

   IPv4 Reachable Address: For example, the address prefix 192.10.3.0/24
   can be advertised with an address of 193.10.3 and an addr_length =
   24.


3.  Link Attributes

3.1.  Review of ASON Routing draft

   [OSPF-ASON] defined additional terminology and scoping of link
   attributes advertised in a GMPLS LSA.  One attribute which was left
   open for possible technology-specific enhancements was the the
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD).

   For prototyping purposes for control of SONET/SDH networks, the
   following technology-specific enhancement was implemented.

3.2.  Bandwidth Accounting for ITU-T SONET/SDH Layers

   GMPLS Routing defines an Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
   (ISCD) that delivers, among other things, information about the
   (maximum/minimum) bandwidth per priority that an LSP can make use of.
   Per [RFC4202] and [RFC4203], one or more ISCD sub-TLVs can be
   associated with an interface.  This information, combined with the
   Unreserved Bandwidth (sub-TLV defined in [RFC3630], Section 2.5.8),
   provides the basis for bandwidth accounting.

   [OSPF-ASON] states that in the ASON context, additional information
   may be included when representation and information in the other

   advertised fields are not sufficient for a specific technology (e.g.,
   SDH).  The definition of technology-specific information elements was
   left beyond the scope of [OSPF-ASON], in the draft.

3.2.1.  SONET/SDH-specific connection availability

   For SONET/SDH networks with switches capable of handling multiple
   layer networks, a single link may be used for a number of TDM layers.
   For example, an OC192 link may be used for STS-1, STS-3c, STS-12c,
   STS-48c, STS-192c connections, switched by the same fabric.

   GMPLS appears to offer a number of possible options for advertising
   link characteristics where multiple layers are supported by the same
   physical link.

   One option is to advertise separate Link TLVs for each layer.  A
   second option is to advertise multiple ISCD sub-TLVs within a single
   Link TLV for the link.  A third option is to advertise a single Link
   TLV and ISCD sub-TLV and attempt to derive bandwidth availability for
   multiple TDM layers from this information.

   All three options were found to have some disadvantages and instead a
   technology-specific ISCD sub-TLV was defined containing information
   that applies to multiple TDM layers.

   This solution was implemented for the following reasons:

   o  If separate TLVs are advertised for each layer, then common
      information such as LSA header information, link type, link ID,
      link local and remote identifiers, protection type, administrative
      group and shared risk are repeated for each layer.

   o  If separate ISCD sub-TLVs are advertised for each layer, then
      common information such as the Switching Capability (TDM) and
      Encoding Type (SONET/SDH) are repeated for each layer.

   o  Deriving bandwidth availability from a single ISCD sub-TLV which
      contains the total available bandwidth and the minimum reservable
      bandwidth yields potentially inaccurate results, since support of
      standard concatenation requires sequential timeslots in a
      particular position, and this can be blocked by a smaller signal
      in that space.  Some available bandwidth may not be usable as a
      result.

   A technology-specific ISCD sub-TLV that carried a compact description
   of the number of unallocated timeslots at each supported SONET/SDH
   signal type was used instead of separate Link TLVs or ISCD sub-TLVs
   and carried exact availability information for each signal type.  The

   indication subfield was also removed as no longer necessary since
   Arbitrary SONET/SDH is not supported.

   The following technology-specific ISCD format was tested:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |  Signal Type  |        Number of Unallocated Timeslots        |

   |  Signal Type  |        Number of Unallocated Timeslots        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   //                            . . .                             //
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Signal Type  |        Number of Unallocated Timeslots        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Note: n defines the number of signal types supported on this link,
   and thus has a value greater than or equal to 1.  Inherited from
   [RFC4202], the Switching Capability field and the Encoding field MUST
   take the following values for Sonet/SDH interfaces: Switching
   Capability (8 bits): value 100 (TDM).  Encoding (8 bits): value 5 for
   Sonet/SDH.  Reserved (16 bits): must be set to zero when sent and
   ignored when received.

   Signal Type (8 bits):

      STS-1 SPE / VC-3 [RFC4606]

      STS-3c SPE / VC-4 [RFC4606]

      STS-12c SPE/VC-4-4c Exp

      STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c Exp

      STS-192c SPE/VC-4-64c Exp

   Number of Unallocated Timeslots (24 bits):

   Specifies the number of identical unallocated timeslots per Signal
   Type and per TE Link.  As such, the initial value(s) of this TLV
   indicates the total capacity in terms of number of timeslots per TE

   link.  The signal type included in the BW announcement is specific to
   the layer link being reported and is not derived from some other
   signal type (e.g.  STS-48c is not announced as 16 x STS-3c).

   For instance on an OC-192/STM-64 interface either the number of
   STS-3c SPE/VC-4 unallocated timeslots is initially equal to 64, or
   the number of STS-48c SPE/VC-4-16c unallocated timeslots is equal to
   4 or even a combination of both type of signals depending on the
   interface capabilities.  Once one of these components gets allocated
   for a given connection, the number of unallocated timeslots is
   decreased by the number of timeslots this connection implies.


4.  Routing Information Scope

4.1.  Review of ASON Routing Draft

   [OSPF-ASON] proposed extensions to allow the scope of routing
   Information to allow flexibility between the relationship of The
   advertising router and the TE router.  Similar extensions with
   slightly different format were implemented in testing.

4.2.  Link Advertisement (Local and Remote TE Router ID sub-TLVs)

   Implementations followed the concepts defined in [OSPF-ASON] to Allow
   flexible relationship between the Router-ID and the TE Router-ID.
   The following is given in [OSPF-ASON]:

   A Router-ID (Ri) advertising on behalf multiple TE Router_IDs (Lis)
   creates a 1:N relationship between the Router-ID and the TE
   Router-ID.  As the link local and link remote (unnumbered) ID
   association is not unique per node (per Li unicity), the
   advertisement needs to indicate the remote Lj value and rely on the
   initial discovery process to retrieve the [Li;Lj] relationship.  In
   brief, as unnumbered links have their ID defined on per Li bases, the
   remote Lj needs to be identified to scope the link remote ID to the
   local Li.  Therefore, the routing protocol MUST be able to
   disambiguate the advertised TE links so that they can be associated
   with the correct TE Router-ID.

   The tested extensions used two sub-TLVs of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top
   level Link TLV that define the local and the remote TE Router-ID.
   These are combined into a single sub-TLV in [OSPF-ASON] (the Local
   and Remote TE Router-ID sub-TLV), however implementation and testing
   began before [OSPF-ASON] was defined.

   The formats of the Local and Remote TE Router-ID sub-TLVs were:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   These sub-TLVs were always included as part of the top level Link TLV
   as it was assumed that the Router-ID could always advertise on behalf
   of multiple TE Router-IDs.

4.3.  Reachability Advertisement (Local TE Router ID sub-TLV)

   When the Router-ID is advertised on behalf of multiple TE Router-IDs
   (Lis), the routing protocol MUST be able to associate the advertised
   reachability information with the correct TE Router-ID.

   For this purpose, a new sub-TLV of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top level Node
   Attribute TLV was introduced in [OSPF-ASON].  Since this sub-TLV had
   not yet been defined at the time of initial implementation, a sub-TLV
   was defined independently for prototype testing.  In this case the
   format is the same.

   The tested solution used a new sub-TLV of the (OSPFv2 TE LSA) top
   level Reachable Address TLV (see section 5): the TE Router ID sub-
   TLV.

   The TE Router_ID sub-TLV used the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.4.  New Reachable Address top-level TLV

   When the OSPFv2 extensions for ASON routing were designed for the
   first OIF interoperability demonstrations,
   draft-ietf-ospf-te-node-addr draft was at a very early stage, and the
   Node Attribute top-level TLV was not available to carry reachable
   prefixes.  Instead a new experimental top-level TLV was defined: the
   Reachable Address top-level TLV.

   Contrary to [OSPF-ASON] where each Node Attribute top-level TLV
   carries reachable prefixes for a single TE Router ID (so that if a
   Router advertises reachable prefixes on behalf of multiple TE Router
   IDs, it will originate multiple OSPFv2 TE LSAs with a Node Attribute
   TLV), the Reachable Address top-level TLV may be used to advertise
   reachable prefixes attached to multiple TE Router IDs: in order to do
   so, a TE Router ID sub-TLV MUST appear before the Reachable Address
   sub-TLV(s).

   This tested format is functionally equivalent to the format defined
   in [OSPF-ASON] but is independent of the function of advertising
   local addresses of a router for MPLS TE LSPs as defined in
   [OSPF-NODE].


5.  Routing Information Dissemination

   Subdivision of ASON Routing Areas as discussed in this section of
   [OSPF-ASON] has not yet been implemented and tested.


6.  Implementation and Testing Results

   Testing of these protocol extensions was carried out at a number of
   testing events from 2003-2009, most recently occurring over a period
   of months during July-September 2007 and April-June 2009.  There were
   7 independent implementations tested at each event as listed below:

   2007 interop test implementations:

   Initial implementation and interop testing of ASON routing extensions
   began as early as 2003.

   Further information about the testing conducted can be found at
   http://www.oiforum.com/public/OIF_demos.html

   All implementations utilized the ASON routing extensions described in
   this draft.

   Results were:

   o  prototype implementations were interoperable

   o  aligned TE database was achieved by participating implementations

   o  path computation was successfully achieved for connections

   o  connections were successfully set up at different SONET/SDH rates
      using the TE database

6.1.  Standardization

   These testing results are provided in the interests of achieving
   standard OSPFv2 protocol extensions to support ASON routing.  The
   extensions tested are very similar in functionality to the extensions
   defined in [OSPF-ASON], with the exception of the technology-specific
   ISCD sub-TLV used.  The results of this implementation and testing
   show that these functions are useful and implementable, and that ASON
   routing extensions to OSPF should be Standards Track rather than
   Experimental.

   It is believed by the authors that the tested TLVs and sub-TLVs are
   equivalent in functionality to the extensions defined in [OSPF-ASON]
   and could be adopted by IETF as extensions to OSPF used in a
   transport instance.

   This would enhance the adoption of standard GMPLS routing extensions
   for ASON as a set of implementations for these routing extensions
   will have already been tested and these extensions would as a result
   be available sooner for use in the industry.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Propose IANA allocate codepoints for new TLV/sub-TLVs for ASON
   Routing.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes implementation and testing experience with
   ASON routing extensions similar to those defined in [OSPF-ASON].  No
   additional security issues are identified.
