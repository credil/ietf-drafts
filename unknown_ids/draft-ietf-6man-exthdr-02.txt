              An uniform format for IPv6 extension headers
                       draft-ietf-6man-exthdr-02

Abstract

   In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate
   headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the transport
   layer header.  There are a small number of such extension headers
   currently defined.  This document defines a format for defining new
   IPv6 extension headers.

Internet-Draft      Format for IPv6 extension headers         March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines extension headers as an
   expansion mechanism to carry optional internet layer information.
   Extension headers, with the exception of the hop-by-hop options
   header, are not usually processed on intermediate nodes.  However,
   some intermediate nodes such as firewalls, may need to look at the
   transport layer header fields in order to make a decision to allow or
   deny the packet.  If new extension headers are defined and the
   intermediate node is not aware of them, the intermediate node cannot
   proceed further in the header chain since it does not know where the
   unknown header ends and the next header begins.  The main issue is
   that the extension header format is not standardized and hence it is
   not possible to skip past the unknown header.  This document intends
   to define a standard format for IPv6 extension headers.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] allows the use of both extension
   headers and destination options in order to encode optional
   destination information in an IPv6 packet.  The use of destination
   options to encode this information, provides more flexible handling
   characteristics and better backward compatibility than using
   extension headers.  Because of this, implementations SHOULD use
   destination options as the preferred mechanism for encoding optional
   destination information, and use a new extension header only if
   destination options do not satisfy their needs.  The request for
   creation of a new IPv6 extension header MUST be accompanied by an
   specific explanation of why destination options could not be used to
   convey this information.

4.  Proposed IPv6 Extension Header format

   This document proposes that all IPv6 extension headers be encoded in
   a consistent TLV format so that it is possible for nodes to skip over
   unknown extension headers and continue to further process the header
   chain.

5.  Backward Compatibility

   The scheme proposed in this document is not intended to be backward
   compatible with all the currently defined IPv6 extension headers.  It
   applies only to newly defined extension headers.  Specifically, the
   fragment header predates this document and does not follow the format
   proposed in this document.


6.  Future work

   This document proposes one step in easing the inspection of extension
   headers by middleboxes.  There is further work required in this area.
   Some issues that are left unresolved beyond this document include

   o  There can be an arbitrary number of extension headers.
   o  Extension headers must be processed in the order they appear.
   o  Extension headers may alter the processing of the payload itself,
      and hence the packet may not be processed properly without
      knowledge of said header.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes a standard format for the IPv6 extension
   headers so that intermediate nodes that do not understand the
   contents of these headers can look past them.  Intermediate nodes,
   such as firewalls, skipping over unknown headers might end up
   allowing the setup of a covert channel from the outside of the
   firewall to the inside using the data field(s) of the unknown
   extension headers.
