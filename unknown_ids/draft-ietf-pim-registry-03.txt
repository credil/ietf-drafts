                    A Registry for PIM Message Types
                     draft-ietf-pim-registry-03.txt

Abstract

   This document provides instructions to IANA for the creation of a
   registry for PIM message types.  It specifies initial content of the
   registry based on existing RFCs specifying PIM message types.  It
   also specifies a procedure for registering new types.

   In addition to this, one message type is reserved, and may be used
   for a future extension of the message type space.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

Internet-Draft      A Registry for PIM Message Types        January 2011


1.  Introduction

   Apart from this document, there is no existing document specifying a
   registry for PIM message types.  PIM version 1 made use of IGMP
   [RFC1112] and there is an IGMP registry [IGMPREG] listing the message
   types used by PIM version 1.  PIM version 2 however is not based on
   IGMP, and a separate PIM message type registry is needed.  There are
   currently several RFCs specifying new PIM version 2 message types
   that should be in this new registry.  They are the RFCs for PIM Dense
   Mode [RFC3973], PIM Sparse Mode [RFC4601] and Bidirectional PIM
   [RFC5015].

   This document specifies the initial content of the new PIM message
   type registry based on those existing RFCs.  This document also
   specifies a procedure for registering new PIM message types.

   In addition to this, this document reserves one message type.  This
   type may be used for a future extension of the message type space.
   The current message type space is only 4 bits, so it is not unlikely
   that this will be needed.  How exactly the extension should be done
   is left to a future document.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document only creates an IANA registry.  There may be a security
   benefit in a well-known place for finding information on which PIM
   message types are valid and how they are used.  Apart from that there
   are no security considerations.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to create a PIM message type registry.
   This should be placed in the "Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)"
   branch of the tree.  Each entry in the registry consists of message
   type, message name and references to the documents defining the type.

3.1.  Initial registry

   The initial content of the registry should be as follows.

   Type   Name                                      Reference
   ----  ----------------------------------------  ---------------------
     0    Hello                                     [RFC3973] [RFC4601]
     1    Register                                  [RFC4601]
     2    Register Stop                             [RFC4601]
     3    Join/Prune                                [RFC3973] [RFC4601]
     4    Bootstrap                                 [RFC4601]
     5    Assert                                    [RFC3973] [RFC4601]
     6    Graft                                     [RFC3973]
     7    Graft-Ack                                 [RFC3973]
     8    Candidate RP Advertisement                [RFC4601]
     9    State Refresh                             [RFC3973]
    10    DF Election                               [RFC5015]
    15    Reserved (for extension of type space)    [this document]

3.2.  Assignment of new message types

   Assignment of new message types is done according to the "IETF
   Review" model, see [RFC5226].

4.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Toerless Eckert for his suggestion to reserve a type for
   future message type space extension.
