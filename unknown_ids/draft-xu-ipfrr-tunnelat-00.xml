      <t>
      When a link or node failure occurs in an IP network, there is a
      period of disruption to the delivery of traffic until the
      network re-converges on a new topology. IP fast reroute (IPFRR)
      mechanisms are methods used in pure IP networks to provide
      protection from such disruptions.  This is done by having
      failure-adjacent nodes compute backup routes in advance that
      allow them to repair failures immediately upon detection of
      failures.  Traffic can be delivered to their correct
      destinations even before the network has re-converged on a new
      topology.
      </t>

      <t>
      Thus far, there are three different IPFRR mechanisms that are
      documented in RFCs or RFC drafts: LFA
      in <xref target="refs.RFC5286" format="default"
      pageno="false">RFC 5286</xref>, Tunnel in
      [I-D.ietf-bryant-ipfrr-tunnels], and NotVia in
      [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses]. However, LFA only
      provides 50~80% single-node failure protection coverage;
      routers running NotVia must maintain extra NotVia addresses,
      which causes high address management burden. In addition, NotVia
      also can cause packets to be forwarded through unnecessary
      loops. The original Tunnel can not provide 100% protection
      coverage for single node failures and the original draft does
      not describes an efficient method to calculate tunnel endpoints. 
      </t>

      <t>
      This draft presents Tunnel-AT to improve Tunnel. Tunnel-AT
      requires less than one full SPT computation, provides 100%
      single node protection, and does not require routers to maintain
      extra addresses. In addition, the length of the backup paths
      computed under Tunnel-AT are always exactly or very close to the
      length of the shortest working path to the destination.

      <section title="Repair Paths">
      <t>
        When a failure occurs in an IP network, there is no way for the
        failure-adjacent routers to tell whether the failure was caused by a
        node failures or simply a link failure. To cope with the worst case,
        routers will first try to use the backup paths precalculated for a
        node failure. If no such routes are available, they will try to use
        the backup paths for a link failure. 
      </t>

      <t>
        The backup paths are used until the completion of the routing
        transition. Only routers adjacent to the failed component are
        aware of the nature of the failure.  Once all the routers
        compute new shortest path based on the new topology, the
        backup paths will not be used anymore since packets are no
        longer forwarded through the failed components. At this time,
        the computation of new backup paths for the new topology are
        scheduled.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Tunnel Mechanism">
        <t>
        The idea behind Tunnel is very simple: router S chooses a
        router P that can forward packets to destination D bypassing
        the supposed failed router F. If P is the neighbor of S, then
        S can force the packet directly there. Otherwise, S should
        create a tunnel using P as the endpoint.
        </t>

        <t>
        Let M denote the set of nodes in S's shortest path tree that
        are not in the branch rooted at F, and let Q denote the set of
        nodes in D's shortest path tree that are not in the branch
        rooted at F. The set of candidate tunnel end nodes for D are
        members of both M and Q (denoted as MQ).  Tunnel fails if MQ
        is empty. For example, in Figure 1, the default link cost is
        1, and link N-H and link H-I have a high cost (20). For
        destination H, and supposed failed neighbor F, the set M is
        {S, N}, while the set Q is {H}. Since MQ is empty, S can't
        find a tunnel end point to route packets to H.
        </t>

                  +----[N]-----------------[H]
                                20

          Figure 1: A case shows when Tunnel and Tunnel-DF fail.
          The default link cost is 1. And the cost of link N-H
          and link H-I is 20, much higher than the others.
          </artwork>
        </figure>
      

        <t>
      A mechanism called Directed Forwarding (DF) is introduced to
      remedy this problem (We use Tunnel-DF to denote Tunnel with
      directed forwarding). If MQ is empty, S searches a node T1 in M
      which has a neighbor T2 in Q. S uses T1 as the tunnel end point
      and makes an extra mark on the packet so that T1 would forward
      the packet to T2 directly. Using Figure 1 as an example, S
      chooses N as T1 and H as T2. S first routes a packet
      with destination H to N, and then N directly forwards it
      to H.
        </t>

        <t>
      However, even with directed forwarding, Tunnel can't provide
      100% node protection. Also using Figure 1 as an example, this
      time node I is the destination. M is {S, N} and Q is {I}. MQ is
      empty and no node in Q is a neighbor of a node in M.
        </t>

        <t>
      Tunnel-AT can handle this problem. Under Tunnel-AT, S would
      forward packets with destination I to N and tell N to directly
      forward it to H.  Since H also notices the failure of F and also
      performs Tunnel-AT, it would forward packets to I directly
      instead of using the original next hop F. So, packets have been
      protected more than once. We call the subsequent protections
      re-protections. Using re-protection, Tunnel-AT achieves 100%
      protection coverage - a significant improvement over Tunnel.

    <section title="Tunnel-AT Algorithm">
      <t>
        Under the link weight routing protocol, repairing node S has
        already computed an original shortest path tree T based on the
        current topology. Next, for each neighbor N, S deletes N and
        associated links from the original topology and computes
        repair paths for every affected destination.
      </t>

      <t>
        Tunnel-AT algorithm is based on the property that given a
        repairing node S and a supposed failed neighbor F, to deliver
        a packet to an affected node D, it is sufficient to reroute it
        to D's incoming node (This property is deduced from from the
        concept of Attaching Tree, thus comes the name
        Tunnel-AT). From the original tree T, the
        <xref target="refs.iSPF" format="default"
        pageno="false">iSPF</xref> algorithm can be used to
        compute the new shortest path tree T'. During the process of
        constructing T' from T, the incoming node of each affected
        node can be determined according to its definition given at
        <xref target="term" format="default" pageno="false" />.
       </t>

      <t>
        To reroute a packet with destination D to the incoming node I,
        the parent of I, denoted as P, can be used as the tunnel
        endpoint. It is also needed to determine whether directed
        forwarding is necessary. The original distance from
        S to P and from S to D, i.e. dist(S, P) and dist(S, D), can be
        obtained from the original tree T; the new distance from P to
        D, dist'(P, D), can be obtained from tree T'. If the network is
        symmetric, dist(P, S) equals to dist(S, P). However, the
        condition 
        <artwork height="" name="" width="" type="" alt=""
                 align="left" xml:space="preserve"> 
          dist'(P, D) &lt; dist(P, S) + dist(S, D)
        </artwork>
        But this condition only guarantees P does not forward the
        packet back to S. Figure 2 shows a very simple
        counter-example. Here, D's incoming node is D itself and
        <artwork height="" name="" width="" type="" alt=""
                 align="left" xml:space="preserve"> 
          dist'(P, D) = 7 &lt; 8 = dist(P, S) + dist(S, D) .
        </artwork>
        But P will send the packet to N if directed forwarding is not
        used because P->N->F->D is a shorter path and P is not aware
        of the failure. The packet will still reach D via
        the protection by N for the second time, but it takes a longer
        path that it has to.

                           3  

          Figure 2: An example: If S does not tell P to
          directly forwarding a packet with destination
          D to D, the packet will take the long path
          S->P->N->P->D.

      </figure>

      <t>
        To avoid P routing packets back to F, another more rigorous
        condition can be used: 
        <artwork height="" name="" width="" type="" alt=""
                 align="left" xml:space="preserve"> 
          dist'(P, D) &lt; dist(P, S) - dist(S, F) .
        </artwork>
        It can be proved that this condition ensures the shortest
        path from P to D does not traverse F.
      </t>

      <section title="Complexity">
        <t>
        Based on the original shortest path tree T calculated by the
        normal link state routing protocol, every node has to perform
        k times incremental shortest path tree (iSPT) (k is the number
        of neighbors) to construct backup routes for all
        destinations. The core of these algorithms are queue
        operations. The full SPT algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm)
        invokes three types of queue operations: ADD, EXTRACT-MIN, and
        DECREASE-KEY. The iSPT algorithm invokes one extra type of
        operation -- REMOVE.  If the queue is implemented as a binary
        heap, in a network of V nodes and E edges, the complexity
        of full SPT is O(ElgV). Let V_i denote the number of
        affected nodes if neighbor i fails, let E_i denote the
        number of edges attached to one of these nodes, the number of
        operations in the iSPT for this neighbor i
        can be expressed as follows:  
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> Maximum number of EXTRACT-MIN: the iteration number l in
          iSPT. </t>
          <t> Maximum number of ADD: V_i.</t>
          <t> Maximum number of REMOVE: V_i - l.</t>
          <t> Maximum number of DECREASE-KEY: E_i. </t>
        </list>
        The main component is DECREASE-KEY. For a node, the
        Tunnel-AT algorithm complexity is 
        <artwork height="" name="" width="" type="" alt=""
                 align="left" xml:space="preserve"> 
           O(E_1 lg V_1) + ... + O(E_k lg V_k) 
                = O (E_1 lg V) + ... + O(E_k lg V) 
                = O (ElgV)
