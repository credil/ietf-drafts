Internet-Draft            Ad Hoc IP Addressing            September 2009


1.  Introduction

   The appropriate configuration of IP addresses and subnet masks for
   router network interfaces is generally a prerequisite to the correct
   functioning of routing protocols.  Consideration of various items,
   including underlying link capabilities and connectivity, geographical
   topology, available address blocks, assumed traffic patterns,
   etc. are used when determining the appropriate network topology and
   the associated IP interface configuration.

   When the capabilities and connectivity of the links that connect
   routers are well-known and rather stable, design of the network
   topology and associated IP interface configuration is rather
   straightforward.  As link-level assumptions become less-known and
   more unstable, the design of network-level topology becomes
   increasingly difficult.  When assumptions about link-level
   connectivity are fully absent, there is no canonical method for
   determining a given IP interface configuration. This document
   proposes a model for configuration of IP addresses and subnet
   prefixes on router interfaces to links with undetermined connectivity
   properties.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability Statement

   The configuration proposed by this model is applicable to any
   router's interface.  It specifies addresses and subnet prefixes to be
   configured on network interfaces.

   When more specific assumptions can be made regarding the connectivity
   to other interfaces on the link, these SHOULD be considered when
   configuring subnet prefixes.


4.  IP Subnet Prefix Configuration

   If the link to which an interface connects enables no assumptions of
   connectivity to other interfaces, the only addresses which can be
   assumed "on link", are the address(es) of that interface itself.
   Note that while IPv6 link-local addresses are assumed to be "on

   link", the utility of IPv6 link-local addresses is limited as
   specified in Section 6.2.

   Subnet prefix configuration on such interfaces must thus not make any
   promises in terms of direct (one hop) IP connectivity to IP addresses
   other than that of the interface itself.  This translates in the
   following policy: no two such interfaces in the network should be
   configured with the same subnet prefix.

   As communication is allowed between interfaces of different routers
   on a link even if these interfaces are configured to appear within
   different subnets, IP packet exchange between routers on that link is
   still enabled.

   If on the contrary, assumptions can be made regarding connectivity to
   other interfaces on the link, these SHOULD be considered when
   configuring IP subnet prefixes, and the corresponding interfaces MAY
   be configured with the same subnet prefix.


5.  IP Address Configuration

   Routing protocols running on a router may exhibit different
   requirements for uniqueness of interface addresses; some have no such
   requirements, others have requirements ranging from local uniqueness
   only, to uniqueness within the routing domain at least.

   Configuring an IP address that is unique within the routing domain
   satisfies the less stringent uniqueness requirements of local
   uniqueness, while also enabling protocols which have the most
   stringent requirements of uniqueness within the routing domain.  This
   translates in the following policy: an IP address assigned to an
   interface that connects to a link with undetermined connectivity
   properties should be unique at least within the routing domain.


6.  Addressing Model

   Section 4 and Section 5 describe principles for IP address and subnet
   prefix configuration on an interface of a router, when that interface
   connects to a link with undetermined connectivity properties.  The
   following describes a practical translation for these principles,
   respectively for IPv4 and IPv6.

6.1.  IPv4 Model

   For IPv4, the principles described in Section 4 and Section 5 suggest
   the following rules:



Baccelli, Ed. & Townsley, Ed.  Expires March 28, 2010           [Page 4]

   o  An IP address configured on this interface should be unique, at
      least within the routing domain, and

   o  A subnet prefix configured on this interface should be of length
      /32.

6.2.  IPv6 Model

   For IPv6, the principles described in Section 4 and Section 5 suggest
   the following rules:

   o  An IP address configured on this interface should be unique, at
      least within the routing domain, and

   o  A subnet prefix configured on this interface should be of length
      /128.

   Note that while an IPv6 link-local address is assigned to each
   interface as per [RFC4291], in general link-local addresses are of
   limited utility on links with undetermined connectivity, as neighbors
   may be constantly moving in and out of reachability.  The known
   limitations are:

   o  Even if tested for local uniqueness at one moment using Duplicate
      Address Detection [RFC4862], a duplicate link-local address might
      appear as a neighbor the next moment and DAD would not detect
      that.

   o  There is no mechanism to ensure that IPv6 link-local addresses are
      unique across multiple links, hence they can not be used to
      reliably identify routers.

   o  Routers cannot forward any packets with link-local source or
      destination addresses to other links (as per [RFC4291]) while most
      of the time, routers need to be able to forward packets to/from
      different links.

   Therefore MANET autoconfiguration solutions will primarily focus on
   configuring IP addresses that are not IPv6 link-local.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

   This document does currently not describe any security
   considerations.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   The following issues were extensively discussed among the design
   team, without reaching a conclusion.

   MANET Link Model -  no satisfying MANET link model was formulated to
      date.  Lacking a better definition so far, a MANET link is: a link
      with undetermined connectivity properties.

   Global Uniqueness Requirements -  it remains to be determined whether
      or not the scope of AUTOCONF includes applications other than
      routing protocols running on the router, which may communicate
      with outside the routing domain and which for that, require
      globally unique addresses.
