Abstract

   This document defines an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) based
   Layer-1 Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) auto-discovery mechanism.
   This mechanism enables provider edge (PE) devices using OSPF to
   dynamically learn about existence of each other, and attributes of
   configured customer edge (CE) links and their associations with
   L1VPNs.  This document builds on L1VPN framework and requirements,
   and provides a L1VPN basic mode auto-discovery mechanism.

1.2. Overview

   The framework for Layer 1 VPNs is described in [RFC4847].  Basic mode
   operation is further defined in [L1VPN-BM].  [L1VPN-BM] document
   identifies the information that is necessary to map customer
   information (ports identifiers) to provider information
   (identifiers).  It also states that this mapping information may be
   provided via provisioning or via an auto-discovery mechanism.  This
   document provides such an auto-discovery mechanism using Open
   Shortest Path First (OSPF).

   Figure 1 shows the L1VPN basic service being supported using OSPF
   based L1VPN auto-discovery.  This figure shows two PE routers
   interconnected over a GMPLS backbone.  Each PE is attached to three
   CE devices belonging to three different Cons.  In this network, OSPF
   is used to provide the VPN membership, port mapping and related
   information required to support basic mode operation.

   See [L1VPN-BGP] for a parallel L1VPN auto-discovery that uses BGP.
   The OSPF approach described in this document is particularly useful
   in networks where BGP is not typically used.

   The approach used in this document to provide OSPF based L1VPN auto-
   discovery uses a new type of Opaque Link State Advertisement (LSA)
   which is referred to as an L1VPN LSA.  The L1VPN LSA carries

   information in TLV (type, length, value) structures.  An L1VPN
   specific TLV is defined in below to propagate VPN membership and port
   information.  This TLV is is referred to as the L1VPN Info TLV.  The
   L1VPN LSA may also carry Traffic Engineering (TE) TLVs, see [RFC3630]
   and [RFC4203].

   L1VPN TLV Type
      The type of the TLV.

   TLV Length
      The length of the TLV in bytes, excluding the four (4) bytes
      of the TLV header and, if present, the length of the Padding
      field.

   L1VPN Globally Unique Identifier
      As defined in [L1VPN-BM].

   PE TE Address
      This field MUST carry an address that has been advertised by
      the LSA originator per [RFC3630] and is either the Router Address
      TLV or Local interface IP address link sub-TLV.  It will
      typically carry the TE Router Address.

   Link Local Identifier

      This field is used to support unnumbered links.  When an
      unnumbered PE TE link is represented, this field MUST contain
      a value advertised by the LSA originator per [RFC4203] in a
      Link Local/Remote Identifiers link sub-TLV.  When a numbered
      link is represented, this field MUST be set to zero (0).

   L1VPN Auto-discovery information
      As defined in [L1VPN-BM].

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-l1vpn-ospf-auto-discovery-04.txtcember 3, 2007


   Padding
      A field of variable length and of sufficient size to ensure
      that the TLV is aligned on a four (4) byte boundary.  This
      field is only required when the L1VPN Auto-discovery
      information field is not four (4) byte aligned.  This field
      MUST be less than four (4) bytes long, and MUST NOT be present
      when the size of L1VPN Auto-discovery information field is
      four (4) byte aligned.


3. L1VPN LSA Advertising and Processing

   PEs advertise local <CPI, PPI> tuples in L1VPN LSAs containing L1VPN
   Info TLVs. Each PE MUST originate a separate L1VPN LSA with AS
   flooding scope for each local CE-PE link. The LSA MUST be originated
   each time a PE restarts and every time there is a change in the PIT
   entry associated with a local CE-PE link. The LSA MUST include a
   single L1VPN Info TLV and MAY include a single TE Link TLV as per
   [RFC3630] and [RFC4203].  The TE Link TLV carries TE attributes of
   the associated CE-PE link. Note that because CEs are outside of the
   provider TE domain, the attributes of CE-PE links are not advertised
   via normal OSPF-TE procedures as described in [RFC3630] and
   [RFC4203]. If more than one L1VPN Info TLVs and/or TE Link TLVs are
   found in the LSA, the subsequent TLVs SHOULD be ignored by the
   receiving PEs.

   L1VPN LSAs are of AS-scope (LS type is set to 11) and therefor are
   flooded to all PEs within the AS according to [RFC2370] or [2370BIS].
   Every time a PE receives a new, removed or modified L1VPN LSA, the PE
   MUST check whether it maintains a PIT associated with the L1VPN
   specified in the L1VPN Globally unique identifier field.  If this is
   the case (the appropriate PIT will be found if one or more local CE-
   PE links that belong to the L1VPN are configured), the PE SHOULD add,
   remove or modify the PIT entry associated with each of the advertised
   CE-PE links accordingly. Thus, in the steady mode all PEs associated
   with a particular L1VPN maintain identical local PITs for the L1VPN.


3.1. Discussion and Example

   The L1VPN auto-discovery mechanism described in this document does
   not prevent a PE from applying any local policy with respect to PIT
   management. For example, it should be possible to configure permanent
   (static) PIT entries, blocking of information carried in L1VPN LSAs
   that are advertised by some remote PEs from making it to the PITs.

   The reason why it is required that the value specified in the PE TE
   Address field of the L1VPN Info TLV matches a valid PE TE Router ID



Bryskin & Berger             Standards Track                    [Page 8]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-l1vpn-ospf-auto-discovery-04.txtcember 3, 2007


   or numbered TE Link ID is to ensure that CEs attached to this PE can
   be resolved to the PE as it is known to the Traffic Engineering
   Database (TED) and hence TE paths toward the CEs across the Provider
   domain can be computed.

   Let us consider the example presented in Figure 2.


                            CE11               CE13
                              |                 |
                      CE22---PE1--------P------PE2
                              |         |
                             CE15      PE3
                                        |
                                       CE24

                    Figure 2: Single area configuration

   Let us assume that PE1 is connected to CE11 and CE15 in L1VPN1 and to
   CE22 in L1VPN2; PE2 is connected to CE13 in L1VPN1; PE3 is connected
   to CE24 in L1VPN2. In this configuration PE1 manages two PITs: PIT1
   for L1VPN1 and PIT2 for L1VPN2; PE2 manages only PIT1, and PE3
   manages only PIT2. PE1 originates three L1VPN LSAs, each containing a
   L1VPN Info TLV advertising links PE1-CE11, PE1-CE22 and PE1-CE15
   respectively. PE2 originates a single L1VPN LSA for link PE2-CE13 and
   PE3 originates a single L1VPN LSA for link PE3-CE24. In steady state
   the PIT1 on PE1 and PE3 will contain information on links PE1-CE11,
   PE1-CE15 and PE2-CE13; PIT2 on PE1 and PE2 will contain entries for
   links PE1-CE22 and PE3-CE24. Thus, all PEs will learn about all
   remote PE-CE links for all L1VPNs supported by PEs.

   Note that P in this configuration does not have links connecting it
   to any of L1VPNs. It neither originates L1VPN LSAs nor maintains any
   PITs. However, it does participate in the flooding of all of the
   L1VPN LSA and hence maintains the LSAs in its LSDB. This is a cause
   for scalability concerns and could prove to be problematic in large
   networks.


4. Backward Compatibility

   Neither the TLV nor the LSA introduced in this document present any
   interoperability issues. Per [RFC2370], OSPF speakers that do not
   support the L1VPN auto-discovery application (Ps for example) just
   participate in the L1VPN LSAs flooding process but should ignore the
   LSAs contents.

5. Security Considerations

   The approach presented in this document describes how PEs dynamically
   learn L1VPN specific information. Mechanisms to deliver the VPN
   membership information to CEs are explicitly out of scope of this
   document. Therefore, the security issues raised in this document are
   limited to within the OSPF domain.

   This defined approach reuses mechanisms defined in [RFC2328],
   [RFC2370] and [2370BIS].  Therefore the same security approaches and
   considerations apply to this approach.  OSPF provides several
   security mechanisms that can be applied.  Specifically, OSPF supports
   multiple types of authentication, limits the frequency of LSA
   origination and acceptance, and provides techniques to avoid and
   limit impact database overflow.  In cases were end-to-end
   authentication is desired, OSPF's neighbor-to-neighbor authentication
   approach can be augmented with an experimental extension to OSPF, see
   [RFC2154], which supports the signing and authentication of LSAs.


6. IANA Considerations

   This document requests the assignment of an OSPF Opaque LSA type, see
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ospf-opaque-types.  IANA is requested
   to make an assignment in the form:

       Value   Opaque Type                              Reference
      -------  -----------                              ---------
          TBA  L1VPN LSA                                [this document]

      A value of 4 is suggested for TBA.
