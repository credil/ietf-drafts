1. Background

   GMPLS introduced explicit support for bidirectional LSPs.  The
   defined support matched the switching technologies covered by GMPLS,
   notably TDM and lambdas, and specifically only supported
   bidirectional LSPs with symmetric bandwidth allocation.  Symmetric
   bandwidth requirements are conveyed using the semantics objects
   defined in [RFC2205] and [RFC2210].

   Recent work, see [GMPLS-PBBTE] and [MEF-TRAFFIC], has looked at
   extending GMPLS to control Ethernet switching.  In this context there
   has been a requirement identified for bidirectional LSPs with
   asymmetric bandwidth.  This note defines extensions to enable support
   for such asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSPs.


2. Overview

   Bandwidth parameters are transported within RSVP (see [RFC2210],
   [RFC3209] and [RFC3473]) via several objects that are opaque to RSVP.
   While opaque to RSVP, these objects support a particular model for
   the communication of bandwidth information between an RSVP session
   sender (ingress) and receiver (egress).  The original model of
   communication defined in [RFC2205] and maintained in [RFC3209] used
   the SENDER_TSPEC and ADSPEC objects in Path messages and the FLOWSPEC
   object in Resv messages.  The SENDER_TSPEC object was used to
   indicate a sender's data generation capabilities.  The FLOWSPEC
   object was issued by the receiver and indicated the resources that
   should be allocated to the associated data traffic.  The ADSPEC
   object was used to inform the receiver and intermediate hops of the
   actual resources allocated for the associated data traffic.

   With the introduction of bidirectional LSPs in [RFC3473] the model of
   communication of bandwidth parameters was implicitly changed.  In the
   context of [RFC3473] bidirectional LSPs, the SENDER_TSPEC object
   indicates the desired resources for both upstream and downstream
   directions.  The FLOWSPEC object is simply confirmation of the
   allocated resources.  The definition of the ADSPEC object is either
   unmodified, and only has meaning for downstream traffic, or is
   implicitly or explicitly (see [RFC4606] and [MEF-TRAFFIC])
   irrelevant.

   This note defines two alternative approaches for extending the
   existing support for bidirectional LSPs to support asymmetric
   bandwidth bidirectional LSPs.  The intention is to describe the two
   alternative approaches to sufficient detail to allow the selection of
   a single approach for standardization.  Once a single approach is
   selected, the other approach will be will be eliminated.  Which

Internet-Draft draft-berger-ccamp-asymm-bw-bidir-lsps-00.txt  May 8, 2007


   approach is selected and which is eliminated is a matter for
   discussion within CCAMP working group.

   The first approach is specific to Ethernet and uses the [MEF-TRAFFIC]
   traffic parameters.  This approach is not generic and is aimed at
   providing asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSPs for just Ethernet
   transport.  With this extension, the ADSPEC object carries the
   traffic parameters for the upstream data flow.  SENDER_TSPEC object
   is used to indicate the traffic parameters for the downstream data
   flow. The FLOWSPEC object provides confirmation of the allocated
   downstream resources.  Confirmation of the upstream resource
   allocation is a Resv message, as any resource allocation failure for
   the upstream direction will always result in a PathErr message.
   Figure 1 shows the bandwidth related objects used in the first
   approach.

                         |---|        Path      |---|
                         | I |----------------->| E |
                         | n | -SENDER_TSPEC    | g |
                         | g | -ADSPEC          | r |
                         | r |                  | e |
                         | e |        Resv      | s |
                         | s |<-----------------| s |
                         | s | -FLOWSPEC        |   |

   Figure 1: Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional LSPs Using ADSPEC Object

   The second approach is a generic approach that can be applied to any
   switching technology supported by GMPLS.  In this approach, the
   existing SENDER_TSPEC, ADSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects are complemented
   with the addition of UPSTREAM_TSPEC, UPSTREAM_ADSPEC and
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC objects.  The old objects are used in the original
   fashion defined in [RFC2205] and [RFC2210], and refer only to traffic
   associated with the LSP flowing in the downsteam direction.  The new
   objects are used in exactly the same fashion as the old objects, but
   refer to the upstream traffic flow. Figure 2 shows the bandwidth
   related objects used in the second approach.

   The two approaches are defined in further detail in Sections 3 and 4
   respectively.  Section 5 provides a (partial) discussion on the
   benefits of each of the approaches.  Again, as this document
   progresses, either section 3 or section 4 will be removed.

   This extensions defined in this document are limited to P2P LSPs.
   Support for P2MP bidirectional LSPs is not currently defined and, as
   such, not covered in this document.


2.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3. Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional LSPs Using ADSPEC Object

   The setup of an asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP is signaled
   using the bidirectional procedures defined in [RFC3473] together with
   the inclusion of a new ADSPEC object.  The new ADSPEC object is
   specific to Ethernet and is called the Ethernet Upstream Traffic
   Parameter ADSPEC object.  The Ethernet Upstream Traffic Parameter
   ADSPEC object uses the Class-Number 13 and C-Type TBA (see IANA
   Considerations).  The format of the object is the same as the
   Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object defined in [MEF-TRAFFIC].

   Note this extension does not modify behavior of symmetric bandwidth
   LSPs.  Per [MEF-TRAFFIC], such LSPs are signaled without an ADSPEC or
   with an INTSERV ADSPEC.

   It should also be noted that the defined approach could be reused to

   support asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSPs for other types of
   switching technologies.  All that would be needed is to define the
   proper ADSPEC object.


3.1. Procedures

   The process of establishing an asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP
   follows the process of establishing symmetric bandwidth bidirectional
   LSP, as defined in Section 3 of [RFC3473], with two modifications.
   These modifications MUST be followed with an incoming Path message is
   received containing an Upstream_Label object and the Ethernet
   Upstream Traffic Parameter ADSPEC object.

   The first modification to the symmetric bandwidth process is that
   when allocating the upstream label, the bandwidth associated with the
   upstream label MUST be taken from the Ethernet Upstream Traffic
   Parameter ADSPEC object, see Section 3.1 of [RFC3473].  Consistent
   with [RFC3473], a node that is unable to allocate a label or internal
   resources based on the contents of the ADSPEC Object, MUST issue a
   PathErr message with a "Routing problem/MPLS label allocation
   failure" indication.

   The second modification is that the ADSPEC object MUST NOT be
   modified by transit nodes.


3.2. Compatibility

   This extension reuses semantics and procedures defined in [RFC3473].
   To indicate the use of asymmetric bandwidth a new ADSPEC object c-
   type is defined.  Per [RFC2205], nodes not supporting this extension
   should not recognize this new C-type and respond with an "Unknown
   object C-Type" error.


3.3. IANA Considerations:

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespaces defined in this section and reviewed in this subsection.

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignments
   described below in the "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types"
   section of the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at:
       http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters

   ADSPEC object:

Internet-Draft draft-berger-ccamp-asymm-bw-bidir-lsps-00.txt  May 8, 2007


   This section defines a new ADSPEC object class type:

      -  An Ethernet Upstream Traffic Parameter ADSPEC object:
         Class = 13, C-Type = TBA (see Section 3).

   The C-Type value should correspond to the values defined in section 8
   of [MEF-TRAFFIC].


4. Generalized Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional LSPs

   The setup of an asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP is signaled
   using the bidirectional procedures defined in [RFC3473] together with
   the inclusion of the new UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC, UPSTREAM_TSPEC and
   UPSTREAM_ADSPEC objects.

   The new upstream objects carried the same information and are used in
   the same fashion as the existing downstream objects; they only differ
   in that they relate to traffic flowing in the upstream direction
   while the existing objects relate to traffic flowing in the
   downstream direction.


4.1. UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object

   The format of an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object is the same as a FLOWSPEC
   object.  This includes the definition of class types and their
   formats.  The class number of the UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object object is
   TBA by IANA (of the form 0bbbbbbb).


4.1.1. Procedures

   The Path message of a asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP MUST
   contain an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object and MUST use the bidirectional
   LSP formats and procedures defined in [RFC3473].  The C-Type of the
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object MUST match the C-Type of the SENDER_TSPEC
   object used in the Path message.  The contents of the
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object MUST be constructed using a consistent
   format and procedures used to construct the FLOWSPEC object that will
   be used for the LSP, e.g., [RFC2210] or [RFC4328].

   Nodes processing a Path message containing an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC
   Object MUST use the contents of the UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object in the
   upstream label and resource allocation procedure defined in Section
   3.1 of [RFC3473].  Consistent with [RFC3473], a node that is unable
   to allocate a label or internal resources based on the contents of
   the UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object, MUST issue a PathErr message with a

Internet-Draft draft-berger-ccamp-asymm-bw-bidir-lsps-00.txt  May 8, 2007


   "Routing problem/MPLS label allocation failure" indication.


4.2. UPSTREAM_TSPEC Object

   The format of an UPSTREAM_TSPEC object is the same as a SENDER_TSPEC
   object.  This includes the definition of class types and their
   formats.  The class number of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC Object object is TBA
   by IANA (of the form 0bbbbbbb).


4.2.1. Procedures

   The UPSTREAM_TSPEC object MUST be included in any Resv message that
   corresponds to a Path message containing an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object.
   The C-Type of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object MUST match the C-Type of the
   corresponding UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object. The contents of the
   UPSTREAM_TSPEC Object MUST be constructed using a consistent format
   and procedures used to construct the FLOWSPEC object that will be
   used for the LSP, e.g., [RFC2210] or [RFC4328].  The contents of the
   UPSTREAM_TSPEC Object MAY differ from contents of the
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object based on application data transmission
   requirements.


4.3. UPSTREAM_ADSPEC Object

   The format of an UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object is the same as an ADSPEC
   object.  This includes the definition of class types and their
   formats.  The class number of the UPSTREAM_ADSPEC  object is TBA by
   IANA (of the form 0bbbbbbb).


4.3.1. Procedures

   The UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object MAY be included in any Resv message that
   corresponds to a Path message containing an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object.
   The C-Type of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object MUST be consistent with the
   C-Type of the corresponding UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object. The contents of
   the UPSTREAM_ADSPEC Object MUST be constructed using a consistent
   format and procedures used to construct the ADSPEC object that will
   be used for the LSP, e.g., [RFC2210] or [MEF-TRAFFIC].  The
   UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object is processed using the same procedures as the
   ADSPEC object and as such, MAY be updated or added at transit nodes.

4.4. Packet Formats

   This section presents the RSVP message related formats as modified by
   this section.  Unmodified formats are not listed.  Three new objects
   are defined in this section:

      Object name            Applicable RSVP messages
      ---------------        ------------------------
      UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC      Path and PathErr (via sender descriptor)
      UPSTREAM_TSPEC         Resv and Notify (via flow descriptor list)
      UPSTREAM_ADSPEC        Resv and Notify (via flow descriptor list)

   The format of the sender description for bidirectional asymmetric
   LSPs is:

      <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                               [ <ADSPEC> ]
                               [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]
                               [ <SUGGESTED_LABEL> ]
                               [ <RECOVERY_LABEL> ]
                               <UPSTREAM_LABEL>
                               <UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC>

   The format of the flow descriptor list for bidirectional asymmetric
   LSPs is:

      <flow descriptor list> ::= <FF flow descriptor list>
                               | <SE flow descriptor>

      <FF flow descriptor list> ::= <FLOWSPEC>
                               <UPSTREAM_TSPEC> [ <UPSTREAM_ADSPEC> ]
                               <FILTER_SPEC>
                               <LABEL> [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]
                               | <FF flow descriptor list>
                               <FF flow descriptor>

      <FF flow descriptor> ::= [ <FLOWSPEC> ]
                               [ <UPSTREAM_TSPEC>] [ <UPSTREAM_ADSPEC> ]
                               <FILTER_SPEC> <LABEL>
                               [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]

      <SE flow descriptor> ::= <FLOWSPEC>
                               <UPSTREAM_TSPEC> [ <UPSTREAM_ADSPEC> ]
                               <SE filter spec list>

      <SE filter spec list> is unmodified by this document.

4.5. Compatibility

   This extension reuses and extends semantics and procedures defined in
   [RFC2205], [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to support bidirectional LSPs with
   asymmetric bandwidth.  To indicate the use of asymmetric bandwidth
   three new objects are defined.  Each of these objects is defined with
   class numbers in the form 0bbbbbbb. Per [RFC2205], nodes not
   supporting this extension should not recognize the new class numbers
   and respond with an "Unknown Object Class" error.


4.6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespaces defined in this section and reviewed in this subsection.

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignments
   described below in the "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types"
   section of the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters


4.6.1. UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object

   A new class named UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC will be created in the 0bbbbbbb
   range (TBD suggested) with the following definition:

      Class Types or C-types:

      Same values as FLOWSPEC object (C-Num 9)


4.6.2. UPSTREAM_TSPEC Object

   A new class named UPSTREAM_TSPEC will be created in the 0bbbbbbb
   range (TBD suggested) with the following definition:

      Class Types or C-types:

      Same values as SENDER_TSPEC object (C-Num 12)

   4.6.3 UPSTREAM_ADSPEC Object

   A new class named UPSTREAM_ADSPEC will be created in the 0bbbbbbb
   range (TBD suggested) with the following definition:

      Class Types or C-types:

      Same values as ADSPEC object (C-Num 13)


5. Discussion

   The solutions describes in this document provide two alternate
   mechanisms for asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP establishment
   with a single RSVP-TE signaling session. However they differ in
   applicability and generality.

   The solution based on the Ethernet specific ADSPEC object limits the
   applicability to cases where the [MEF-TRAFFIC] traffic parameters are
   appropriate, and to switching technologies that define no use for the
   ADSPEC object.  On the other hand, the semantics of this approach are
   quite simple in that they only require the definition of a new ADSPEC
   object C-Type.

   The generalized asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP has the
   benefit of being applicable to any switching technology, but has the
   significant drawback of requiring support for three new types of
   object classes, i.e., the UPSTREAM_TSPEC, UPSTREAM_ADSPEC and
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC objects.


6. Security Considerations

   This document introduces new message objects for use in GMPLS
   signaling [RFC3473].  It does not introduce any new signaling
   messages, nor change the relationship between LSRs that are adjacent
   in the control plane. As such, this document introduces no additional
   security considerations.  See [RFC3473] for relevant security
   considerations.
