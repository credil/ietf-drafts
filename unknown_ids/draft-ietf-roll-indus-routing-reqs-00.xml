    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Wireless, low-power field devices enable industrial users to
      significantly increase the amount of information collected and the
      number of control points that can be remotely managed. The deployment of
      these wireless devices will significantly improve the productivity and
      safety of the plants while increasing the efficiency of the plant
      workers.</t>

      <t>Wireless field devices enable expansion of networked points by
      appreciably reducing cost of installing a device. The cost reductions
      come from eliminating cabling costs and simplified planning. Cabling for
      a field device can run from $100s/ft to $1,000s/ft depending on the
      safety regulations of the plant. Cabling also carries an overhead cost
      associated with planning the installation, determining where the cable
      has to run, and interfacing with the various organizations required to
      coordinate its deployment. Doing away with the network and power cables
      reduces the planning and administrative overhead of installing a
      device.</t>

      <t>For wireless devices to have a significant advantage over wired
      devices in an industrial environment, the wireless network needs to have
      three qualities: low power, high reliability, and easy installation and
      maintenance. The routing protocol used for low power and lossy networks
      (L2N) is important to fulfilling these goals.</t>

      <t>Industrial automation is segmented into two distinct application
      spaces, known as "process" or "process control" and "discrete
      manufacturing" or "factory automation". In industrial process control,
      the product is typically a fluid (oil, gas, chemicals ...). In factory
      automation or discrete manufacturing, the products are individual
      elements (screws, cars, dolls). While there is some overlap of products
      and systems between these two segments, they are surprisingly separate
      communities. The specifications targeting industrial process control
      tend to have more tolerance for network latency than what is needed for
      factory automation.</t>

      <t>Both application spaces desire battery operated networks of hundreds
      of sensors and actuators communicating with L2N access points. In an oil
      refinery, the total number of devices is likely to exceed one million,
      but the devices will be clustered into smaller networks that report to
      an existing plant network infrastructure.</t>

      <t>Existing wired sensor networks in this space typically use
      communication protocols with low data rates, from 1,200 baud (e.g. wired
      HART) to the one to two hundred Kbps range for most of the others. The
      existing protocols are often master/slave with command/response.</t>

      <section title="Applications and Traffic Patterns">
        <t>The industrial market classifies process applications into three
        broad categories and six classes.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Safety <list style="symbols">
                <t>Class 0: Emergency action - Always a critical function</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Control<list style="symbols">
                <t>Class 1: Closed loop regulatory control - Often a critical
                function</t>

                <t>Class 2: Closed loop supervisory control - Usually
                non-critical function</t>

                <t>Class 3: Open loop control &ndash; Operator takes action
                and controls the actuator (human in the loop)</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Monitoring <list style="symbols">
                <t>Class 4: Alerting - Short-term operational effect (for
                example event-based maintenance)</t>

                <t>Class 5: Logging and downloading / uploading - No immediate
                operational consequence (e.g., history collection,
                sequence-of-events, preventive maintenance)</t>
              </list></t>
          </list>Critical functions effect the basic safety or integrity of
        the plant. Timely deliveries of messages becomes more important as the
        class number decreases.</t>

        <t>Industrial users are interested in deploying wireless networks for
        the monitoring classes 4 and 5, and in the non-critical portions of
        classes 3 through 1.</t>

        <t>Classes 4 and 5 also include asset monitoring and tracking which
        include equipment monitoring and are essentially separate from process
        monitoring. An example of equipment monitoring is the recording of
        motor vibrations to detect bearing wear.</t>

        <t>In the near future, most low power and lossy network systems will
        be for low frequency data collection. Packets containing samples will
        be generated continuously, and 90% of the market is covered by packet
        rates of between 1/s and 1/hour, with the average under 1/min. In
        industrial process, these sensors include temperature, pressure, fluid
        flow, tank level, and corrosion. Some sensors are bursty, such as
        vibration monitors that may generate and transmit tens of kilo-bytes
        (hundreds to thousands of packets) of time-series data at reporting
        rates of minutes to days.</t>

        <t>Almost all of these sensors will have built-in microprocessors that
        may detect alarm conditions. Time-critical alarm packets are expected
        to have lower latency than sensor data.</t>

        <t>Some devices will transmit a log file every day, again with
        typically tens of Kbytes of data. For these applications there is very
        little "downstream" traffic coming from the L2N access point and
        traveling to particular sensors. During diagnostics, however, a
        technician may be investigating a fault from a control room and expect
        to have "low" latency (human tolerable) in a command/response
        mode.</t>

        <t>Low-rate control, often with a "human in the loop" (also referred
        to as "open loop"), is implemented today via communication to a
        centralized controller. The sensor data makes its way through the L2N
        access point to the centralized controller where it is processed, the
        operator sees the information and takes action, and the control
        information is then sent out to the actuator node in the network.</t>

        <t>In the future, it is envisioned that some open loop processes will
        be automated (closed loop) and packets will flow over local loops and
        not involve the L2N access point. These closed loop controls for
        non-critical applications will be implemented on L2Ns. Non-critical
        closed loop applications have a latency requirement that can be as low
        as 100 ms but many control loops are tolerant of latencies above 1
        s.</t>

        <t>In critical control, tens of milliseconds of latency is typical. In
        many of these systems, if a packet does not arrive within the
        specified interval, the system enters an emergency shutdown state,
        often with substantial financial repercussions. For a one-second
        control loop in a system with a mean-time between shutdowns target of
        30 years, the latency requirement implies nine 9s of reliability.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Network Topology of Industrial Applications">
        <t>Although network topology is difficult to generalize, the majority
        of existing applications can be met by networks of 10 to 200 field
        devices and maximum number of hops from two to twenty. It is assumed
        that the field devices themselves will provide routing capability for
        the network, and additional repeaters/routers will not be required in
        most cases.</t>

        <t>For most industrial applications, a manager, gateway or backbone
        router acts as a sink for the wireless sensor network. The vast
        majority of the traffic is real time publish/subscribe sensor data
        from the field devices over a L2N towards one or more sinks.
        Increasingly over time, these sinks will be a part of a backbone but
        today they are often fragmented and isolated.</t>

        <t>The wireless sensor network is a Low Power and Lossy Network of
        field devices for which two logical roles are defined, the field
        routers and the non routing devices. It is acceptable and even
        probable that the repartition of the roles across the field devices
        change over time to balance the cost of the forwarding operation
        amongst the nodes.</t>

        <t>The backbone is a high speed network that interconnects multiple
        WSNs through backbone routers. Infrastructure devices can be connected
        to the backbone. A gateway / manager that interconnects the backbone
        to the plant network of the corporate network can be viewed as
        collapsing the backbone and the infrastructure devices into a single
        device that operates all the required logical roles. The backbone is
        likely to always become an important function of the industrial
        network. The Internet at large is not considered as a viable option to
        perform the backbone function.</t>

        <t>A plant or corporate network is also present on the factory site.
        This is the typical IT nework for the factory operations beyond
        process control. That network is out of scope for this document.</t>

        <section title="The Physical Topology">
          <t>There is no specific physical topology for an industrial process
          control network. One extreme example is a multi-square-kilometer
          refinery where isolated tanks, some of them with power but most with
          no backbone connectivity, compose a farm that spans over of the
          surface of the plant. A few hundred field devices are deployed to
          ensure the global coverage using a wireless self-forming
          self-healing mesh network that might be 5 to 10 hops across. Local
          feedback loops and mobile workers tend to be only one or two hops.
          The backbone is in the refinery proper, many hops away. Even there,
          powered infrastructure is also typically several hops away. So
          hopping to/from the powered infrastructure will in general be more
          costly than the direct route.</t>

          <t>In the opposite extreme case, the backbone network spans all the
          nodes and most nodes are in direct sight of one or more backbone
          router. Most communication between field devices and infrastructure
          devices as well as field device to field device occurs across the
          backbone. Form afar, this model resembles the WIFI ESS (Extended
          Service Set). But from a layer 3 perspective, the issues are the
          default (backbone) router selection and the routing inside the
          backbone whereas the radio hop towards the field device is in fact a
          simple local delivery.</t>

]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>Considering that though each field device to field device route
          computation has specific constraints in terms of latency and
          availability it can be expected that the shortest path possible will
          often be selected and that this path will be routed inside the LLN
          as opposed to via the backbone. It can also be noted that the
          lifetimes of the routes might range from minutes for a mobile
          workers to tens of years for a command and control closed loop.
          Finally, time-varying user requirements for latency and bandwidth
          will change the constraints on the routes, which might either
          trigger a constrained route recomputation, a reprovisioning of the
          underlying L2 protocols, or both in that order. For instance, a
          wireless worker may initiate a bulk transfer to configure or
          diagnose a field device. A level sensor device may need to perform a
          calibration and send a bulk file to a plant.</t>

          <t>For these reasons, the ROLL routing infrastructure MUST be able
          to compute and update constrained routes on demand (that is
          reactively), and it can be expected that this model will become more
          prevalent for field device to field device connectivity as well as
          for some field device to Infrastructure devices over time.</t>

    <section title="Service Requirements">
      <t>The industrial applications fall into four large service categories
      [ISA100.11a]:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Periodic data (aka buffered). Data that is generated periodically
          and has a well understood data bandwidth requirement, both
          deterministic and predictable. Timely delivery of such data is often
          the core function of a wireless sensor network and permanent
          resources are assigned to ensure that the required bandwidth stays
          available. Buffered data usually exhibits a short time to live, and
          the newer reading obsoletes the previous. In some cases, alarms are
          low priority information that gets repeated over and over. The
          end-to-end latency of this data is not as important as the
          regularity with which the data is presented to the plant
          application.</t>

          <t>Event data. This category includes alarms and aperiodic data
          reports with bursty data bandwidth requirements. In certain cases,
          alarms are critical and require a priority service from the
          network.</t>

          <t>Client/Server. Many industrial applications are based on a
          client/server model and implement a command response protocol. The
          data bandwidth required is often bursty. The acceptable round-trip
          latency for some legacy systems was based on the time to send tens
          of bytes over a 1200 baud link. Hundreds of milliseconds is typical.
          This type of request is statistically multiplexed over the L2N and
          cost-based fair-share best-effort service is usually expected.</t>

          <t>Bulk transfer. Bulk transfers involve the transmission of blocks
          of data in multiple packets where temporary resources are assigned
          to meet a transaction time constraint. Transient resources are
          assigned for a limited period of time (related to file size and data
          rate) to meet the bulk transfers service requirements.</t>
        </list>For industrial applications Service parameters include but
      might not be limited to:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Data bandwidth &ndash; the bandwidth might be allocated
          permanently or for a period of time to a specific flow that usually
          exhibits well defined properties of burstiness and throughput. Some
          bandwidth will also be statistically shared between flows in a best
          effort fashion.</t>

          <t>Latency - the time taken for the data to transit the network from
          the source to the destination. This may be expressed in terms of a
          deadline for delivery. Most monitoring latencies will be in seconds
          to minutes.</t>

          <t>Transmission phase - process applications can be synchronized to
          wall clock time and require coordinated transmissions. A common
          coordination frequency is 4 Hz (250 ms).</t>

          <t>Service contract type - revocation priority. L2Ns have limited
          network resources that can vary with time. This means the system can
          become fully subscribed or even over subscribed. System policies
          determine how resources are allocated when resources are over
          subscribed. The choices are blocking and graceful degradation.</t>

          <t>Transmission priority - the means by which limited resources
          within field devices are allocated across multiple services. For
          transmissions, a device has to select which packet in its queue will
          be sent at the next transmission opportunity. Packet priority is
          used as one criterion for selecting the next packet. For reception,
          a device has to decide how to store a received packet. The field
          devices are memory constrained and receive buffers may become full.
          Packet priority is used to select which packets are stored or
          discarded.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The routing protocol MUST also support different metric types for
      each link used to compute the path according to some objective function
      (e.g. minimize latency).</t>

      <t>Industrial application data flows between field devices are not
      necessarily symmetric. In particular, asymmetrical cost and
      unidirectional routes are common for published data and alerts, which
      represent the most part of the sensor traffic. The routing protocol MUST
      be able to set up unidirectional or asymmetrical cost routes that are
      composed of one or more non congruent paths.</t>

      <section title="Configurable Application Requirement">
        <t>Time-varying user requirements for latency and bandwidth will
        require changes in the provisioning of the underlying L2 protocols. A
        technician may initiate a query/response session or bulk transfer to
        diagnose or configure a field device. A level sensor device may need
        to perform a calibration and send a bulk file to a plant. The routing
        protocol MUST route on paths that are changed to appropriately
        provision the application requirements. The routing protocol MUST
        support the ability to recompute paths based on underlying link
        characteristics that may change dynamically.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Different Routes for Different Flows">
        <t>Because different services categories have different service
        requirements, it is often desirable to have different routes for
        different data flows between the same two endpoints. For example,
        alarm or periodic data from A to Z may require path diversity with
        specific latency and reliability. A file transfer between A and Z may
        not need path diversity. The routing algorithm MUST be able to
        generate different routes for different flows.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Reliability Requirements">
      <t>Another critical aspect for the routing is the capability to ensure
      maximum disruption time and route maintainance. The maximum disruption
      time is the time it takes at most for a specific path to be restored
      when broken. Route maintainance ensures that a path is monitored to be
      restored when broken within the maximum disruption time. Maintenance
      should also ensure that a path continues to provide the service for
      which it was established for instance in terms of bandwidth, jitter and
      latency.</t>

      <t>In industrial applications, reliability is usually defined with
      respect to end-to-end delivery of packets within a bounded latency.
      Reliability requirements vary over many orders of magnitude. Some
      non-critical monitoring applications may tolerate a reliability of less
      than 90% with hours of latency. Most industrial standards, such as
      HART7, have set user reliability expectations at 99.9%. Regulatory
      requirements are a driver for some industrial applications. Regulatory
      monitoring requires high data integrity because lost data is assumed to
      be out of compliance and subject to fines. This can drive reliability
      requirements to higher then 99.9%.</t>

      <t>Hop-by-hop path diversity is used to improve latency-bounded
      reliability. Additionally, bicasting or pluricasting may be used over
      multiple non congruent / non overlapping paths to ensure that at least
      one instance of a critical packet is actually delivered.</t>

      <t>Because data from field devices are aggregated and funneled at the
      L2N access point before they are routed to plant applications, L2N
      access point redundancy is an important factor in overall reliability. A
      route that connects a field device to a plant application may have
      multiple paths that go through more than one L2N access point. The
      routing protocol MUST support multiple L2N access points and load
      distribution among L2N access points. The routing protocol MUST support
      multiple L2N access points when L2N access point redundancy is required.
      Because L2Ns are lossy in nature, multiple paths in a L2N route MUST be
      supported. The reliability of each path in a route can change over time.
      Hence, it is important to measure the reliability on a per-path basis
      and select a path (or paths) according to the reliability
      requirements.</t>

    <section title="Device-Aware Routing Requirements">
      <t>Wireless L2N nodes in industrial environments are powered by a
      variety of sources. Battery operated devices with lifetime requirements
      of at least five years are the most common. Battery operated devices
      have a cap on their total energy, and typically can report an estimate
      of remaining energy, and typically do not have constraints on the
      short-term average power consumption. Energy scavenging devices are more
      complex. These systems contain both a power scavenging device (such as
      solar, vibration, or temperature difference) and an energy storage
      device, such as a rechargeable battery or a capacitor. These systems,
      therefore, have limits on both long-term average power consumption
      (which cannot exceed the average scavenged power over the same interval)
      as well as the short-term limits imposed by the energy storage
      requirements. For solar- powered systems, the energy storage system is
      generally designed to provide days of power in the absence of sunlight.
      Many industrial sensors run off of a 4-20 mA current loop, and can
      scavenge on the order of milliwatts from that source. Vibration
      monitoring systems are a natural choice for vibration scavenging, which
      typically only provides tens or hundreds of microwatts. Due to
      industrial temperature ranges and desired lifetimes, the choices of
      energy storage devices can be limited, and the resulting stored energy
      is often comparable to the energy cost of sending or receiving a packet
      rather than the energy of operating the node for several days. And of
      course, some nodes will be line-powered.</t>

      <t>Example 1: solar panel, lead-acid battery sized for two weeks of
      rain.</t>

      <t>Example 2: vibration scavenger, 1mF tantalum capacitor.</t>

      <t>Field devices have limited resources. Low-power, low-cost devices
      have limited memory for storing route information. Typical field devices
      will have a finite number of routes they can support for their embedded
      sensor/actuator application and for forwarding other devices packets in
      a mesh network slotted-link.</t>

      <t>Users may strongly prefer that the same device have different
      lifetime requirements in different locations. A sensor monitoring a
      non-critical parameter in an easily accessed location may have a
      lifetime requirement that is shorter and tolerate more statistical
      variation than a mission-critical sensor in a hard-to-reach place that
      requires a plant shutdown in order to replace.</t>

      <t>The routing algorithm MUST support node-constrained routing (e.g.
      taking into account the existing energy state as a node constraint).
      Node constraints include power and memory, as well as constraints placed
      on the device by the user, such as battery life.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Broadcast/Multicast">
      <t>Existing industrial plant applications do not use broadcast or
      multicast addressing to communicate to field devices. Unicast address
      support is sufficient. However wireless field devices with communication
      controllers and protocol stacks will require control and configuration,
      such as firmware downloading, that may benefit from broadcast or
      multicast addressing.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol SHOULD support broadcast or multicast
      addressing.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Route Establishment Time">
      <t>During network formation, installers with no networking skill must be
      able to determine if their devices are &ldquo;in the network&rdquo; with
      sufficient connectivity to perform their function. Installers will have
      sufficient skill to provision the devices with a sample rate or activity
      profile. The routing algorithm MUST find the appropriate route(s) and
      report success or failure within several minutes, and SHOULD report
      success or failure within tens of seconds.</t>

      <t>Network connectivity in real deployments is always time varying, with
      time constants from seconds to months. So long as the underlying
      connectivity has not been compromised, this link churn should not
      substantially affect network operation. The routing algorithm MUST
      respond to normal link failure rates with routes that meet the Service
      requirements (especially latency) throughout the routing response. The
      routing algorithm SHOULD always be in the process of optimizing the
      system in response to changing link statistics. The routing algorithm
      MUST re-optimize the paths when field devices change due to insertion,
      removal or failure, and this re-optimization MUST not cause latencies
      greater than the specified constraints (typically seconds to
      minutes).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Mobility">
      <t>Various economic factors have contributed to a reduction of trained
      workers in the plant. The industry as a whole appears to be trying to
      solve this problem with what is called the "wireless worker". Carrying a
      PDA or something similar, this worker will be able to accomplish more
      work in less time than the older, better-trained workers that he or she
      replaces. Whether the premise is valid, the use case is commonly
      presented: the worker will be wirelessly connected to the plant IT
      system to download documentation, instructions, etc., and will need to
      be able to connect "directly" to the sensors and control points in or
      near the equipment on which he or she is working. It is possible that
      this "direct" connection could come via the normal L2Ns data collection
      network. This connection is likely to require higher bandwidth and lower
      latency than the normal data collection operation.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol SHOULD support the wireless worker with fast
      network connection times of a few of seconds, and low command and
      response latencies to the plant behind the L2N access points, to
      applications, and to field devices. The routing protocol SHOULD also
      support the bandwidth allocation for bulk transfers between the field
      device and the handheld device of the wireless worker. The routing
      protocol SHOULD support walking speeds for maintaining network
      connectivity as the handheld device changes position in the wireless
      network.</t>

      <t>Some field devices will be mobile. These devices may be located on
      moving parts such as rotating components or they may be located on
      vehicles such as cranes or fork lifts. The routing protocol SHOULD
      support vehicular speeds of up to 35 kmph.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Manageability ">
      <t>The process and control industry is manpower constrained. The aging
      demographics of plant personnel are causing a looming manpower problem
      for industry across many markets. The goal for the industrial networks
      is to have the installation process not require any new skills for the
      plant personnel. The person would install the wireless sensor or
      wireless actuator the same way the wired sensor or wired actuator is
      installed, except the step to connect wire is eliminated.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol for L2Ns is expected to be easy to deploy and
      manage. Because the number of field devices in a network is large,
      provisioning the devices manually would not make sense. Therefore, the
      routing protocol MUST support auto-provisioning of field devices. The
      protocol also MUST support the distribution of configuration from a
      centralized management controller if operator-initiated configuration
      change is allowed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security">
      <t>Given that wireless sensor networks in industrial automation operate
      in systems that have substantial financial and human safety
      implications, security is of considerable concern. Levels of security
      violation that are tolerated as a "cost of doing business" in the
      banking industry are not acceptable when in some cases literally
      thousands of lives may be at risk.</t>

      <t>Industrial wireless device manufactures are specifying security at
      the MAC layer and the transport layer. A shared key is used to
      authenticate messages at the MAC layer. At the transport layer, commands
      are encrypted with unique randomly-generated end-to-end Session keys.
      HART7 and ISA100.11a are examples of security systems for industrial
      wireless networks.</t>

      <t>Industrial plants may not maintain the same level of physical
      security for field devices that is associated with traditional network
      sites such as locked IT centers. In industrial plants it must be assumed
      that the field devices have marginal physical security and the security
      system needs to have limited trust in them. The routing protocol SHOULD
      place limited trust in the field devices deployed in the plant
      network.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol SHOULD compartmentalize the trust placed in
      field devices so that a compromised field device does not destroy the
      security of the whole network. The routing MUST be configured and
      managed using secure messages and protocols that prevent outsider
      attacks and limit insider attacks from field devices installed in
      insecure locations in the plant.</t>
