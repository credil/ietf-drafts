    <abstract>
      <t>IP networks can support real-time text communication. SIP-based real-
      time text is called Text-over-IP or ToIP. PSTN networks support
      real-time text using textphones (or TTYs). When real-time text is
      supported by different networks, gateways are needed to provide
      interoperability. Real-time text capable gateways may also support
      real-time voice.</t>

      <t>This specification describes procedures for interworking between ToIP
      and PSTN textphones using a real-time text capable gateway (RTT
      gateway). It also describes ways to route calls to RTT gateways for
      several call scenarios.</t>

      <t>Procedures that support the phased introduction of RTT gateways and
      procedures that support the invocation of text channels at any time
      during the call are included. Interworking of PSTN textphones that do
      not support simultaneity of voice and text with IP User Agents that
      support simultaneous voice and text is also described.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Real-time text is a component in IP multimedia telephony. Real-time
      text can be transported in IP networks using standard IP protocols and
      be used as a conversational service. IP devices such as multimedia
      telephones, voicemail systems, IP phones, IVR systems or other devices,
      may support the transmission of real-time text over IP networks. An IP
      User Agent that supports real-time text over IP is called a ToIP User
      Agent. A ToIP User Agent may also support text and voice.</t>

      <t>The control of IP real-time text calls is defined in SIP <xref
      target="RFC3261">RFC3261</xref> and SDP <xref
      target="RFC4566">RFC4566</xref>. <xref target="RFC4103">RFC 4103</xref>
      specifies the carriage of real-time text in RTP packets between ToIP
      devices in IP networks. Draft-ietf-sipping-toip-08 <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sipping-toip"> </xref> describes the implementation
      aspects of ToIP using SIP.</t>

      <t>PSTN networks can support the transport of real-time text by
      representing the text as audio. PSTN textphones (or TTYs) use modem
      technology to carry the text encoded as tones. Some PSTN textphones can
      support the transport of both voice and real-time text, but usually not
      both at the same time. Some PSTN textphone protocols do not include
      signalling to indicate whether or not the device is in text or voice
      mode and therefore it is unclear if the audio signal is to be treated as
      text or as voice.</t>

      <t>Interworking between the different forms of real-time text transport
      and the different call control protocols requires a real-time text
      capable gateway (RTT gateway). It supports ToIP (and possibly VoIP)
      protocols on the IP side and textphone protocols on the PSTN side.</t>

      <t>PSTN textphones and multimedia IP User Agents usually support the
      transport of both voice and real-time text. For calls that support both
      voice and text media, the gateway needs to consider the lack of media
      simultaneity imposed by some PSTN textphone protocols and procedures
      included to support medium interworking.</t>

      <t>The case where not all PSTN/IP gateways that could be selected to
      convey the call support ToIP, and therefore specific routing actions are
      needed to give calls tentatively containing text proper support is also
      considered.</t>

        <section title="From the IP side">
          <t>A call to a PSTN number will require the use of a gateway. If not
          all PSTN/IP gateways are text capable, then some means of routing to
          a RTT gateway is required. The methods resulting in one step calling
          should be preferred. The following mechanisms are possible:</t>

          <t>Option 1: Indications are used in the SIP header to indicate that
          text capability may be required. RFC 3840 [7] and RFC 3841 [8]
          provide a means of doing that.</t>

          <t>Option 2: ENUM RFC 3761 [11] procedures may be used to identify
          and route to RTT gateways.</t>

          <t>Option 3: Addressing is used consisting of the PSTN number as the
          user name and the RTT gateway as the SIP domain address on the form
          number@gateway_domain.</t>

          <t>Option 4: Dial a special RTT gateway address. The gateway answers
          in text mode. Then enter the destination number when requested by
          the RTT gateway using text.</t>
        </section>

        <t>If a PSTN textphone is not directly connected to a RTT gateway or
        if not all PSTN/IP gateways that are candidates for handling the call
        are text capable, then some means of routing to a RTT gateway is
        required. Most PSTN textphone calls appear as ordinary audio telephone
        calls and do not provide an indication that a call could involve text.
        A means of indicating the possible need to support real-time text to
        the PSTN routing procedures is required. Several options are
        available, the ones resulting in a one-step procedure should be
        preferred</t>

        <t>Option 1 - Use a prefix to destination number (e.g. 18001 +
        'destination number')</t>

        <t>Option 2 - Dial a special RTT gateway address. The gateway answers
        in text mode. Then enter the destination number or address when
        requested by the RTT gateway using text.</t>

        <t>Option 3 - a PSTN line marking of 'text' that is carried by the
        signalling</t>

        <t>Option 4 - Number analysis resulting in routing calls to a
        real-time text user in the IP network to the gateway.</t>

        <t>Option 5 - The destination SIP subscriber has an indication that
        text support is required.</t>

      <section title="Procedure for RFC 4103 and other real-time text transports">
        <t>In the case where a User Agent implements both <xref
        target="RFC4103">RFC 4103</xref> and other codecs for text transport,
        the procedures in this specification can be complemented with the
        other transport establishment. When establishing a call, a ToIP device
        may advertise support for real-time text in accordance with other
        transport methods, and for real-time Text over IP according to the
        procedures described above.</t>

        <t>The capabilities of the other party in the call setup will lead to
        the establishment of text transport according to either <xref
        target="RFC4103">RFC 4103</xref> or the other transport method.</t>

        <t></t>

    <section title="Text medium interworking">
      <t>Many PSTN textphones can support both voice and text on the one
      analog 'voice' channel. The voice and the text make use of the channel
      in an alternating fashion. This direction dependence is however a usage
      convention, while the transmission can be made in either direction. In
      most cases, voice is used in one direction and text in the other
      direction, for example a hearing impaired user talks to an relay
      operator, who then replies in text.</t>

      <t>ITU-T V.18 [9] specifies a range of PSTN textphone protocols that
      could be supported. On the IP side, text and voice are carried in
      separate text and voice media.</t>

      <t>The RTT gateway must be able to:</t>

      <t>a) indicate to the ToIP User Agent if the PSTN textphone operates in
      an alternating text and voice mode so that the IP User can be informed
      and communicate appropriately, and</t>

      <t>b) indicate to the ToIP User Agent if turntaking of text in one
      direction and text in the other direction is required by the PSTN
      textphone. The RTT gateway shall decode the characters received and
      transmit them to the ToIP User Agent.</t>

      <t>Determining the type of PSTN textphone device in use is the
      responsibility of the RTT gateway. The ToIP User Agent need not concern
      itself with what kind of PSTN textphone device is connected to the RTT
      gateway.</t>

      <t>When the ToIP User Agent first has characters to send to the RTT
      gateway the ToIP device shall open the text channel if it was not opened
      before. The ToIP device shall then transmit the characters to the RTT
      gateway. The RTT gateway shall perform any required signaling on the
      PSTN termination if the type of PSTN textphone s needed to be known by
      the RTT gateway. While connecting, the RTT gateway shall buffer any
      characters received from the ToIP User Agent and transmit them when the
      RTT gateway has connected to the PSTN textphone. The size of the
      character buffer should be sufficient to hold the characters that may
      come from one side in a connection before a response is expected.</t>

      <t>If the RTT gateway does not support the modulation used by the PSTN
      textphone device, the RTT gateway may:</t>

      <t>a) transmit the received textphone signals via Voiceband Data (VBD)
      or the audio stream, depending on the capabilities of the ToIP User
      Agent.</t>

      <t>b) discard characters received from the ToIP User Agent.</t>

      <t>c) transmit the received characters to the PSTN textphone based on a
      pre-provisioned indication of the modulation.</t>

      <t></t>

      <section title="Handling of alternating text and audio">
        <t>Many PSTN textphones support alternating voice and real-time text.
        Some PSTN textphones can only handle text transmission in one
        direction at a time. Most ToIP User Agents can send text and voice
        simultaneously and in both directions at the same time. When bridging
        between these two environments, turn-taking schemes must be introduced
        both by the human users and by the RTT gateways. The following
        procedures should be applied:</t>

        <t></t>

        <section title="Non-continuous carrier PSTN textphones">
          <t>For these PSTN textphones, audio is transmitted through the RTT
          gateway between the PSTN circuit and the audio stream of the ToIP
          User Agent. This is done as long as there is no text to transmit or
          receive on the PSTN side. Text transmission and reception has
          priority over audio transmission.</t>
        </section>

        <t></t>

        <section title="Continuous-carrier PSTN textphones">
          <t>For these PSTN textphones, the recommended procedure is:</t>

          <t>As long as carrier is maintained from the PSTN textphone, it is
          maintained from the RTT gateway, and text transmission can occur. If
          carrier is dropped from the PSTN textphone, the RTT gateway shall
          transmit any remaining characters to the PSTN textphone and then
          drop the carrier and transmit audio.</t>

          <t>When carrier is received again from the PSTN textphone and if
          text is to be transmitted to the PSTN textphone, carrier
          transmission will be resumed from the gateway and text may be
          transmitted.</t>

          <t>If, during a period of audio transmission, text is received from
          the ToIP device, then audio transmission will be interrupted,
          carrier re- established and the text transmitted.</t>

          <t>If, during a period of carrier or text transmission, the
          Interrupt command (INT) is received in the <xref
          target="T140.refs">T.140</xref> stream from the ToIP User Agent, the
          carrier should be dropped and transmission of audio through the
          gateway established. In most cases the control of the carrier can be
          left to the PSTN textphone user.</t>
