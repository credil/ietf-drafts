    <t>
	The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension allows
	UTF-8 characters in mail header fields.
	POP and IMAP servers support internationalized email messages.

	If a POP/IMAP client does not support Email Address Internationalization,
	POP/IMAP servers cannot send Internationalized Email Headers to the client
	and cannot remove the message.

	To avoid the situation,
	this document describes a conversion mechanism
	for internationalized Email messages to be traditional message format.

  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>
	Traditional mail systems, which are defined by <xref target="RFC5322" />,
	allow ASCII characters in mail header field values.
	The UTF8SMTP extension
		(<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis" /> and
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5335bis" />
	allows UTF-8 characters in mail header field values.
    </t>
    <t>

If a header field contains non-ASCII characters,
POP/IMAP servers cannot send Internationalized Email Headers to the client
and cannot remove the message.

This message downgrading mechanism converts mail header fields to an
all-ASCII representation.  The POP/IMAP servers can use the
downgrading mechanism and send the Internationalized Email message as
a traditional form.
    </t>
    <t>     
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5335bis" />
allows UTF-8 characters to be used in
mail header fields and MIME header fields.  The message downgrading
mechanism specified here converts mail header fields and MIME
header fields to ASCII.
    </t>
    <t>
	This document does not change any protocols
	except by defining new header fields. It describes the conversion
	method from the internationalized email messages
	that are defined in 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis" />, and
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5335bis" />
	to the traditional email messages
	defined in
		<xref target="RFC5322" />.
	</t>
	<t>
	Message Downgrading may be implemented in POP server and IMAP server only.
	</t>
	<t>
	This document tries to define the message downgrading process clearly.
 	</t>
	<t>
	Downgrading consists of the following three parts:
	<list style="symbols">
	<vspace blankLines="1" />
	<t>New header field definitions</t>
	<t>Email header field downgrading</t>
	<t>MIME header field downgrading</t>
	</list>
    </t>
    <t>
	In <xref target="downgradedheader" /> of this document,
	header fields starting with "Downgraded-" are introduced.
	They preserve the original header fields.
	</t>
    <t>
	Email header field downgrading is described in <xref target="HeaderDowngrading" />.
	It generates ASCII-only header fields.
    </t>
    <t>
	MIME header fields are expanded in <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5335bis" />.
	MIME header field downgrading is described in <xref target="MIMEheaderdowngrading" />.
	It generates ASCII-only MIME header fields.
    </t>
    <t>
	Displaying downgraded messages that originally contained
	internationalized header fields is out of scope of this
	document. A POP/IMAP client which does not support UTF8
	extension does not know internationalized message format
	described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5335bis" />.

      2119 <xref target="RFC2119" />.

    <t>
   All specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the

  <section title="New Header Fields Definition" anchor="downgradedheader">
  <t>
New header fields starting with "Downgraded-" are defined here to
preserve those mail header field values that contain
UTF-8 characters.  During downgrading, one new "Downgraded-"
header field is added for each mail header field
that cannot be passed as-is to a POP/IMAP client that does not support
UTF8 extension.  The original mail header field is removed or
rewritten.  Only those mail header fields that contain
non-ASCII characters are affected.  The result of this process
is a message that is compliant with existing email
specifications <xref target="RFC5322" />.
The original internationalized information can be retrieved by examining the
"Downgraded-" header fields that were added.
    </t>
    <section title="Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields" anchor="unknownencapsulation">
    <t>
	The unknown header fields' preservation header fields are
	defined to
	encapsulate those original header fields that contain non-ASCII
	characters and are not otherwise provided for in this

	concatenation of "Downgraded-" and the original name.  The value
	field holds the original header field value.

	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
	<t>
	A downgraded message's header fields contain ASCII characters only.
	But they still contain MIME-encapsulated header fields that contain
	non-ASCII UTF-8 characters. Furthermore, the body part may contain UTF-8 characters.
	Implementations parsing Internet messages need
	 to accept UTF-8 body parts and UTF-8 header fields that are MIME-encoded.
	Thus, this document inherits the security considerations of
	MIME-encoded header fields (<xref target="RFC2047" /> and
	<xref target="RFC3629" />).
	</t>
	<t>
		Rewriting header fields increases the opportunities for
		undetected spoofing by malicious senders.
		However, rewritten header fields are preserved into Downgraded-*
		header fields, and parsing Downgraded-* header fields enables
		the detection of spoofing caused by downgrading.
	</t>
	<t>
	The techniques described here invalidate methods that depend
	on digital signatures over any part of the message,
	which includes the top-level header fields and body-part header fields.
	Depending on the specific message being downgraded, the following techniques are likely to break: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and possibly S/MIME and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
	The two obvious mitigations are to stick to 7-bit transport when using these techniques
	(as most/all of them presently require)
	or to make sure to have UTF8SMTP end-to-end when needed.
	</t>
	<t>
   While information in any email header field should usually be treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   Currently, information in the new Downgraded-* header fields is usually
   not inspected by these mechanisms, and may be even less trustworthy
   than the traditional header fields.
   Note that the Downgraded-* header fields could have been inserted with malicious intent
   (and with content unrelated to the traditional header fields).

  <section title="Implementation Notes">
    <section title="RFC 2047 Encoding">
    <t>
  While <xref target="RFC2047" /> has a specific algorithm to deal with whitespace in
  adjacent encoded words, there are a number of deployed implementations
  that fail to implement the algorithm correctly.  As a result, whitespace
  behavior is somewhat unpredictable in practice when multiple encoded words
  are used.  While RFC 5322 states that implementations SHOULD limit lines
  to not more than 78 characters, implementations MAY choose to allow
  overly long encoded words in order to work around faulty <xref target="RFC2047" /> 
  implementations.  Implementations that choose to do so SHOULD have an
  optional mechanism to limit line length to 78 characters.
