    <section title="Introduction">
      
      <t>The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development organisation 
      in the field of distributed computing. The OGF produces documents such as 
      working drafts, specifications, and schemata. For more information, see 
      <eref target="http://www.ogf.org/">http://www.ogf.org/</eref></t>
      
      <t>Working groups in the OGF community have expressed the need for 
      global, distributed, persistent identifiers in working drafts and standards.
      Motivated by this need, the OGF would like to assign URNs to
      some resources in order to retain unique, permanent, 
      location-independent names for them.</t>
      
      <t>This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.</t>
      
      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

      <section title="Declaration of syntactic structure">
        
        <t>The formal syntax definitions below are given in <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>.</t>
        
        <t>The NSS in the urn:ogf names hierarchy begins with a topic
        identifier, followed by a delimiter and a topic-dependent string</t>
        
        <figure><artwork type="abnf">
   OGF-URN  =  "urn:ogf:" TOPIC-ID ":" TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING</artwork></figure>
        
        <t>where TOPIC-ID is a unique topic identifier for the
        specification, and TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING is a unique identifier 
        within the topic identifier scope.</t>
        
        <t>TOPIC-ID has the same syntax as a &lt;NID&gt; as defined in <xref target="RFC2141"/>:</t>
        
        <figure><artwork type="abnf">
   TOPIC-ID  =  ( ALPHA / DIGIT )  *31( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )</artwork></figure>
        
        <t>ALPHA and DIGIT are defined in <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B">Appendix B</eref> of <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>
        
        <t>The Technical Director at OGF (or it successor) assigns topic identifiers.</t>
        
        <t>The syntax of TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING is dependent on the TOPIC-ID, and MUST be defined by a <xref target="GFD-SERIES">Grid Forum Document</xref>. This document does not pose any additional restrictions to the TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING other than what is defined in the NSS syntax as defined by <xref target="RFC2141"/> or its successor:</t>
        
        <figure><artwork type="abnf">
   TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*&lt;URN chars&gt;
</artwork></figure>
        
        <t>&lt;URN chars&gt; is defined in <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2141#section-2.2">Section 2.2</eref> of <xref target="RFC2141"/>.</t>
        
      </section>
      
      <section title="Relevant ancillary documentation">
        
        <t>The Technical Director at OGF (or it successor) will keep a list of assigned topic identifiers and associated documentation at <eref target="http://www.ogf.org/urn/">http://www.ogf.org/urn/</eref> <xref target="URN-OGF"/>.</t>
        
        <t>Information on the procedures how to register an topic identifier can also be found at this website.</t>
        
      </section>
      
      <section title="Identifier uniqueness considerations">
        <t>Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Technical Director of the Open Grid Forum.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Identifier persistence considerations">
        <t>The Technical Director will only assign topic identifiers for persistent resources.</t>
      
      </section>
      
      <section title="Process of identifier assignment">
        <t>Assignment of topic identifiers is limited to the OGF and those 
        authorities that are specifically designated by the OGF Technical 
        Director. OGF may assign portions of its namespace (specifically, 
        those under designated topic identifiers) for assignment by third
        parties.</t>
        
        <t>The details of this process will be specified at the OGF website <xref target="URN-OGF"/>.</t>
        
        <t>The syntax and semantics of each TOPIC-ID MUST be defined by a <xref target="GFD-SERIES">Grid Forum Document</xref> before it is assigned.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Process of identifier resolution">
        <t>OGF will maintain an index of all topic identifiers
         on its Web site, <eref target="http://www.ogf.org/urn/">http://www.ogf.org/urn/</eref>.</t>
         
         <t>Resolution mechanism of TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING within each TOPIC-ID MUST be defined before assignment of a topic identifier.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Rules for Lexical Equivalence">
        <t>The TOPIC-ID part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is case insensitive. Thus, the TOPIC-ID MUST be case normalised before comparison.</t>
        
        <t>The rules for lexical equivalence of the TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for each TOPIC-ID and MUST be defined when a TOPIC-ID is assigned by the OGF Technical Director. These definitions MUST included information about case sensitivity, and in case %-escaped octets, MUST define the exact normalisation to use (e.g. interpret as octet, interpret as UTF-8, specify type of Unicode normalisation factor, etc.)</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Conformance with URN Syntax">
        <t>At the moment of writing, a revision of RFC2141 is proposed, which may allow a different set of allowed characters (URN-char) in the NSS than the current URN chars (adding "&amp;" and/or "~", whilst removing the reserved characters "%", "/", "?" and "#"). The intention of this document is to only restrict the syntax of the TOPIC-ID, and have Grid Forum Documents specify the syntax of the TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING. If RFC 2141 is to be updated, this document may be revised as well.</t>
        
        <t>In other words, the current definition:</t>
        <figure><artwork type="abnf">
   TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*&lt;URN chars&gt;
</artwork></figure>
        
        <t>is likely to change in the future to:</t>
        <figure><artwork type="abnf">
   TOPIC-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*&lt;URN-char&gt;
</artwork></figure>
        
        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that OGF URN strings be chosen in characters acceptable by both RFC2141 and the expected revision.</t>
        
      </section>
      
      <section title="Validation mechanism">
        <t>The validation mechanism of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for each TOPIC-ID and MUST be defined when a TOPIC-ID is assigned by the OGF Technical Director.</t>
        
        <t>URNs in the OGF hierarchy without an assigned TOPIC-ID are considered to be invalid.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Scope">
        <t>Global URNs, relevant for the distributed computing community in general, and the Open Grid Forum in particular.</t>
      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Examples (Informative)">
      
      <t>Since no topic identifiers have been defined yet, no actual examples can be given. 
      Therefor, the following examples are not guaranteed to be real or even syntactically correct.</t>
      
      <t>Grid forum documents defining the "gfd" and "network" topic identifiers may give the following examples.</t>
      
      <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>urn:ogf:gfd:136</t>
      <t>urn:ogf:network:canarie.ca:kisti-uninett-glif-001</t>
      </list></t>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Namespace Considerations">
      
      <t>The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development organisation 
      in the field of distributed computing.</t>
      
      <t>The use of the OGF hierarchy is expected to be broad, including but not limit to usage for:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Grid Forum Documents</t>
          <t>XML (Extensible Markup Language) Schemata</t>
          <t>RDF (Resource Description Framework) Schemata</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>The Open Grid Forum is dedicated to openly publish all technical documentation related to URNs in the OGF hierarchy and allow unlimited distribution of this documentation.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Community Considerations">
      
      <t>Members of the distributed computing community will benefit from persistent and globally unique identifiers for use in protocols developed by the Open Grid Forum.</t>
      
      <t>Practical use of the urn:ogf namespace has been detected, 
        and a formal registration will allow the Open Grid Forum to 
        document this usage and enforce technical review of current practices.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>There are no additional security considerations other than those
      normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.</t>
      
      <t>Implementors are recommended to check the OGF registry and 
      documentation <xref target="URN-OGF"/> before assuming that a 
      given identifier is valid or has a certain meaning.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">

      <t>IANA is to kindly requested to register the "ogf" namespace identifier 
        (NID) at the <xref target="URN-NAMESPACES">URN Namespaces registry</xref>
        and refer to this document and/or the website <eref target="http://www.ogf.org/urn/">http://www.ogf.org/urn/</eref>.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  
            Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called 
            Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  
            The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and 
            simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between 
            standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, 
            order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies 
            additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the 
            type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

            <t>This document lays out general definitions of and mechanisms for establishing Uniform Resource Names (URN) "namespaces".  The URN WG has defined a syntax for URNs in RFC 2141, as well as some proposed mechanisms for their resolution and use in Internet applications in RFC 3401 and RFC 3405.  The whole rests on the concept of individual "namespaces" within the URN structure.  Apart from proof-of-concept namespaces, the use of existing identifiers in URNs has been discussed in RFC 2288.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>
