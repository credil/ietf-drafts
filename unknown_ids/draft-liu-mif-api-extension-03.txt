                   Socket API Extension for MIF Host
                     draft-liu-mif-api-extension-03

Abstract

   API (Application Program Interface) is an interface implemented by a
   software program that enables it to interact with other software.  In
   IP network communication area, Socket API is the de facto standard
   and is widely used in many systems.  Recently, multiple interfaces or
   multiple connection capable devices become more and more common.  But
   due to the limitation of the default route of the host and other
   issues such as DNS selection etc prevent the utilization of multiple
   interfaces/connections benefit.  Moreover, there is no API level
   support for the application developer to utilize the benefit of the
   host's multiple interfaces/connections.  Starting with the
   requirement of MIF API extension, this document describes a new set
   of abstraction APIs to provide additional services to applications
   running on hosts attached to multiple provisioning domains.  These
   services could assist advanced applications in having greater control
   over first-hop, source address and/or DNS selection issues.

Internet-Draft              MIF API Extension               October 2010


1.  Introduction

   API is an software interface which is used to interact with other
   softwares.  In IP network area, Socket API is widely used in many
   operating systems.

   Socket API has been extended according to the evolution of TCP/IP
   protocol stack.  For example, Socket API was extended to support IPv6
   in RFC 3493 [RFC3493].  Nowadays, there are more and more devices
   that have the ability to attach to multiple provisioning domains.
   Due to the limitation of Socket API and other issues such as default
   route and DNS selection, the application can not directly control the
   multiple interfaces/connection capability of the devices.  This
   document describes a new set of abstraction APIs to provide
   additional services to applications running on hosts attached to
   multiple provisioning domains.  These services could assist advanced
   applications in having greater control over first-hop, source address
   and/or DNS selection issues.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  MIF API Concept

   Figure 1 demostrates the MIF API concept.  MIF API is extended based
   on current Socket API.  It provides the following function:

   1.Address selection

   MIF host may has multiple IP addresses. for example, different
   interface may have different IP addresses been configured.  Further
   more, some protocols, for example: mobile IP protocol may assign home
   address to the host.  Application need to control which IP address it
   want to use.  MIF API may provide the address selection function in
   this case.

   2.Routing selection

   Noramlly, host only has a default route which points to one default
   gateway. for MIF host, there may be different connections using
   multiple interfaces and each connection has its own default gateway.
   MIF API provide the capability for the MIF host to control the first
   hop route.

   3.  DNS Selection

   The MIF host may have the DNS split issues.  MIF API may provide the
   capability for the application to select and control which DNS server
   it want to use.

4.  Sokcet API extension for MIF host

   This section discusses the possible ways to design the MIF API.

   There are works in IETF relatd to socket API extensions,such as: IPv6
   socket API extension, HIP socket API extension, shim6 socket API
   extensions.  This section gives initial proposals regarding to how
   this MIF Socket APIs should be designed.


5.  MIF API Requirement

   R1: Compatible with existing Socket APIs

   The extension of Socket APIs should remain compatible with current
   existing Socket APIs which means this extension will not affect the

Internet-Draft              MIF API Extension               October 2010


   existing application and the application developer can chose whether
   to use this extension or not.

   R2: Support for multiple Connections

   The newly introduced APIs can support the host applications to
   utilize multiple connections.  If some connections fail to work,
   applications can failover to other available interfaces.

   R3: No Changes to Existing Socket APIs

   The newly introduced APIs cannot change the behavior of existing
   network APIs available on the host operating system.

   R4: Easy for Implementation

   The implementation details for the newly introduced APIs should be as
   neat as possible.  It keeps the underlying implementation details
   simple, and makes the application developers easy to use these APIs.


6.  Definition of New Socket APIs

   This section gives the definition and description of MIF API.

   Address Selection API

   In current Socket API definition, setsockopt() is used to set the
   option of socket.  It has the following definition:

   int setsockopt(int socket, int level, int option_name, const void
   *option_value, socklen_t option_len);

   The setsockopt() function shall set the option specified by the
   option_name argument, at the protocol level specified by the level
   argument, to the value pointed to by the option_value argument for
   the socket associated with the file descriptor specified by the
   socket argument.

   The option_name argument specifies a single option to set.  The
   option_name argument and any specified options are passed
   uninterpreted to the appropriate protocol module for interpretations.
   The options are as follows:

   SO_DEBUG

   SO_DONTROUTE

Internet-Draft              MIF API Extension               October 2010


   SO_SNDBUF

   ......

   This document proposes to extend the current setsockopt() function as
   follows:

   Extend new option type used for address selection:

   SO_ADDR

   When setsockopt() set this parameter, the application will use the IP
   address specified by option_value as the source IP address.

   Route Selection API

   Extend new option type parameter for setsockopt() function:

   SO_FSTHOP

   When this option is set, the packet will send via the gateway that
   specified by option_value.

   DNS Selection API

   gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() is the APIs used for DNS queries.
   Current version of gethostbyname() has the following definition:

   struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name)

   This document proposes to extend this function as follows:

   struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name, struct sockaddr
   *DNS_addr)

   DNS_addr is used to specify which DNS server the application want to
   use for the DNS query.


7.  Using the extended APIs

   To enjoy the benefit of multiple interfaces, the developers can write
   programs according to the APIs introduced in this document.  Detail
   example need to be further specified.
