Abstract 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, host self-generated 
   addresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address 
   architecture. These addresses need to be registered in the networking 
   management plate for the purposes of central address administration. 
   This document introduces a generic address registration solution 
   using DHCPv6, and defines one new ND option and one new DHCPv6 option 
   in order to propagate the solicitations of registering self-generated 
   addresses. The registration procedure reuses the existing IA_NA in 
   the DHCPv6 protocol.

1. Introduction & Requirements 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, there are many host self-
   generated addresses, such as addresses in IPv6 Stateless Address 
   Configuration [RFC4862, RFC4941] scenario and Cryptographically 
   Generated Addresses (CGA, [RFC3972]), and etc. These addresses are 
   notionally conflicted with the network managed address architecture, 
   such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6, 
   [RFC3315]) managed network or network with Access Control List. 

   Many operators of enterprise networks and similarly tightly 
   administered networks have expressed the desire to be at least aware 
   the hosts' addresses when moving to IPv6. Furthermore, they may want 
   to stop the usage of some hosts' addresses for various reasons. 

   A useful way to give network administrators most of what they want, 
   while at the same time retaining compatibility with normal stateless 
   configuration would be: if the self-generated IPv6 addresses are  
   used, they may need to be registered in and granted by the networking 
   management plate. The host may be required to perform this 
   registration since only granted IPv6 addresses are allowed to be used 
   to access the network. 

   In order to fulfill the abovementioned practice, this document 
   introduces a new Neighbor Discovery (ND) option and a new DHCPv6 
   option to propagate the address registration solicitation from 
   network management to hosts. DHCPv6 protocol is suitable to perform 
   the address registration procedure while DHCPv6 servers play as the 
   address registration server. The existing IA_NA in the DHCPv6 
   protocol is reused for the registration procedure. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Overview of Generic Address Registration Solution 

   By current default, the hosts with self-generated addresses do not 
   register their addresses to any network devices. However, this may 
   result that the network may reject the access request from these 
   devices.

   As showed in below Figure 1, in the generic address registration 
   solution, proposed by this document, the network management plate 
   firstly propagates the solicitations of registering self-generated 
   addresses, by messages from either local router (step 1a in Figure 1) 
   or DHCPv6 server (step 1b in Figure 1). 

   By received such solicitations, a host using the self-generated 
   address SHOULD send an address registration request message to the 
   network management (step 2 in Figure 1). The network management MAY 
   check whether the requested address is accepted, for example, 
   checking the address does not use the Reserved IPv6 Interface 
   Identifiers [RFC5453]. If the requested address is accepted by the 
   network management, it is registered in the address database, which 
   MAY be used by other network functions, such as DNS or ACL, etc. An 
   acknowledgement is sent to the host, granting the usage of this 
   address (step 3 in Figure 1), with assigned lifetimes for this 
   address. If the requested address is not accepted by the network 
   management, a rejected acknowledgement is sent to the host. The host 
   MAY generate a new address and register the new address again.

4. Propagating the Address Registration Solicitation 

   In order to indicate or force the hosts with self-generated addresses 
   to register their addresses and the appointed address registration 
   server, new solicitation options need to be defined. 

   There are more than one mechanism in which configuration parameters 
   could be pushed to the end hosts. The address registration 
   solicitation option can be carried in Router Advertisement (RA)

   message, which is broadcasted by local routers. In the DHCPv6 managed 
   network, it can also be carried in DHCPv6 messages. 

   By receiving the address registration solicitation option(s), a host 
   SHOULD register its self-generated addresses, if there are any, to 
   the appointed registration server. The solicitation options may 
   include the IPv6 address(es) of address registration server. 

   In principle, hosts must receive a prefix from either RA message 
   [RFC4861] or DHCPv6 message [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id] so that they 
   can generate an IPv6 address by themselves. The Address Registration 
   Solicitation options could be propagated together with prefix 
   assignment information. 

4.1. ND Address Registration Solicitation Option 

   The ND Address Registration Solicitation Option allows routers to 
   propagate the solicitation for hosts to register their self-generated 
   address. This option also carries an IPv6 address of the default 
   address registration server. This option SHOULD be propagated 
   together with ND Prefix Information Option, Section 4.6.2, [RFC4861]. 
   The format of the ND Address Registration Solicitation Option is 
   described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               + 
       |                           Reserved                            | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |                                                               | 
       +                        Address (Address                       + 
       |                      Registration Server)                     | 
       +                                                               + 
       |                                                               | 
       +                                                               + 
       |                                                               | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       [Open Question to WG] Should the new ND option carry IPv6 address 
       of the default address registration server? Or this can be 
       discovered by DHCPv6 discovery mechanism. Should we design a mark 
       bit for the scenario that ND does NOT appoint an address 
       registration server? Should we use FQDN instead of Address? 
       Multiple address registration servers?

                  Registration Server 

4.2. DHCPv6 Address Registration Solicitation Option 

   The DHCPv6 Address Registration Solicitation Option allows DHCPv6 
   server to propagate the solicitation for hosts to register their 
   self-generated address. Assuming the DHCPv6 server itself is the 
   address registration server, this option does NOT carries the IPv6 
   address of the default address registration server. This option 
   SHOULD be propagated together with DHCPv6 Prefix Information Option, 
   Section 5, [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id]. The format of the DHCPv6 
   Address Registration Solicitation Option is described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3 
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       option-len      0. Length of this option in octets (option-code 
                         and option-len are not included). 

        [Open Question to WG: is 0 allowed?] 

5. DHCPv6 Address Registration Procedure 

   The current DHCPv6 protocol is reused as the address registration 
   protocol while a DHCPv6 serve plays as address registration server. 
   Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (IA_NA) [RFC3315] is 
   reused in order to fulfill the address registration interactions.

Internet-Draft draft-jiang-dhc-addr-registration-02.txt       July 2011 
    

5.1. DHCPv6 Address Registration Request 

   The host with self-generated address(es) sends a DHCPv6 Request 
   message to the DHCPv6 server, which acts as the address registration 
   server. 

   The DHCPv6 Request message SHOULD contain at least one IA_NA option. 
   The IA_NA option SHOULD contain at least one IA Address option. The 
   host SHOULD set the T1 and T2 fields in any IA_NA options, and the 
   preferred-lifetime and valid-lifetime fields in the IA Address 
   options to 0. 

   By received, the DHCPv6 server MAY check whether the requested 
   address is accepted, for example, checking the address does not use 
   the Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers [RFC5453]. If the requested 
   address is accepted, the DHCPv6 server MUST register it in the 
   address database, which MAY be used by other network functions, such 
   as DNS or ACL, etc. The DHCPv6 server SHOULD also assign the 
   lifetimes for these registered addresses. 

   The address database contains both the self-generated addresses and 
   the DHCPv6 assigned addresses. They MAY be marked different in the 
   database. 

5.2. DHCPv6 Address Registration Acknowledge 

   The DHCPv6 server sends a Reply message as the response to 
   registration requests.  

   The DHCPv6 Reply message SHOULD contain at least one IA_NA option. 
   The IA_NA option SHOULD contain at least one IA Address option. A 
   Status Code option SHOULD be contained in the IA_NA-options field in 
   order to indicate the successful or failure of the registration 
   operations involving this IA_NA. As defined in Section 24.4 of 
   [RFC3315], Code 0 means 'Success', Code 1 stands 'Failure'. 

   [Open Question to WG] In the rejected scenarios, should we also give 
   the different reasons by different value? 

   In the success scenarios, the server SHOULD set the T1 and T2 fields 
   in any IA_NA options, and the preferred-lifetime and valid-lifetime 
   fields in the IA Address options following the rules defined in 
   Section 22 in [RFC3315]. In the failure scenarios, the server SHOULD 
   set the T1 and T2 fields in any IA_NA options, and the preferred-
   lifetime and valid-lifetime fields in the IA Address options to 0.

Internet-Draft draft-jiang-dhc-addr-registration-02.txt       July 2011 
    

   By received the success acknowledgement from the server, the host can 
   use the registered address to access the network. It SHOULD use the 
   values in the preferred and valid lifetime fields for the preferred 
   and valid lifetimes of the address. Note: the host MAY continue to 
   use expired address, such as Locators as Upper-Layer Identifiers 
   (ULID) in Shim6 protocol [RFC5533], etc.; but the network MAY refuse 
   the network access from such addresses. 

   If the registration request is failed, the host MAY generate a new 
   address and register the new address again. 

6. Security Considerations 

   An attacker may use a faked address registration request option to 
   indicate hosts reports their address to a malicious server and 
   collect the user information. These attacks may be prevented by using 
   Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]) if RA Address 
   Registration Request Option is used, or AUTH option or Secure DHCP 
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6] if DHCPv6 Address Registration Request 
   Option is used. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a new Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] option, 
   which MUST be assigned Option Type values within the option numbering 
   space for Neighbor Discovery Option Type: 

       The Address Registration Solicitation Option (TBA1), described in 
       Section 4.1. 

   This document defines one new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option, which MUST be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 options: 

       The OPTION_Addr_Reg_Solicitation (TBA2), described in  
       Section 4.2;
