Internet-Draft       Shared Transition Space Request      September 2011


1.  Introduction

   Many operators are currently implementing their IPv6 transition
   plans.  During the transition, continued support for legacy IPv4-only
   devices will be required.  Also, some IPv6 transition technologies
   require the use of IPv4 address space.  In order to facilitate the
   deployment of transition technologies and to support such legacy
   IPv4-only devices and services, Service Providers require IPv4
   address space that is separate from the range of IPv4 addresses used
   by subscribers.  This address space need not be unique to each
   provider, but should be outside of [RFC1918] space.  This document
   requests that an IPv4 /10 be reserved as Shared Transition Space
   solely to facilitate deployment of IPv6 transition/IPv4 coexistence
   technologies.

3.  Motivation

   The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
   unallocated IPv4 addresses.  During the transition period to IPv6, it
   is imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for
   devices and networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to
   IPv6.  In order to provide IPv4 service to customers and/or devices
   once the IPv4 address space is exhausted, Service Providers must
   multiplex several subscribers behind a single IPv4 address using one
   of several techniques, often using a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN)
   [RFC6264].  For several IPv4 extension/IPv6 transition technologies
   including NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444], 6RD[RFC5969], and 6to4-
   PMT[I-D.kuarsingh-v6ops-6to4-provider-managed-tunnel], addresses
   between the CGN and subscriber home routers need not be globally
   unique, only unique inside the CGN.  Thus, providers need sufficient
   non-[RFC1918] address space to deploy such technologies and avoid
   overlap with customer use of private address space.

   Many CPE router devices used to provide residential or small-medium
   business services have been optimized for IPv4 operation, and
   typically require replacement in order to fully support the
   transition to IPv6 (either natively or via one of many transition
   technologies).  In addition, various consumer devices including IP-
   enabled televisions, gaming consoles, medical and family monitoring
   devices, etc. are IPv4-only, and cannot be upgraded.  While these
   will eventually be replaced with dual-stack or IPv6 capable devices,
   this transition will take many years.  As these are typically
   consumer-owned devices, service providers do not have control over
   the speed of their replacement cycle.  However, consumers have an
   expectation that they will continue to receive IPv4 service, and that
   such devices will continue to have IPv4 Internet connectivity after
   the IPv4 pool is exhausted, even if the customer contracts for new
   service with a new provider.  Until such customers replace their Home
   Gateways and all IPv4-only CPE devices with IPv6-capable devices,
   Service Providers will be required to continue to offer IPv4 services
   through the use of an IPv4 address sharing technology such as NAT444
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444].

   Additional use cases for Shared Transition Space are described in
   [I-D.bdgks-arin-shared-transition-space].

Internet-Draft       Shared Transition Space Request      September 2011


4.  Shared Transition Space

   This document proposes the assignment of a /10 as Shared Transition
   Space.  Shared Transition Space is IPv4 address space reserved for
   Infrastructure Provider use with the purpose of facilitating IPv6
   transition and IPv4 coexistence deployment.  The requested block
   SHOULD NOT be utilized for any purpose other than as "inside"
   addresses in a carrier NAT environment (e.g., between the CGN and
   customer CPE devices) or for other IPv4 to IPv6 transition
   infrastructure.  Network equipment manufacturers MUST NOT use the
   assigned block in default or example device configurations.

   Because Shared Transition addresses have no meaning outside of the
   Infrastructure Provider, routing information about shared transition
   space networks MUST NOT be propagated on interdomain links, and
   packets with shared transition source or destination addresses SHOULD
   NOT be forwarded across such links, except where required based on
   business relationships such as hosted CGN service.  Internet service
   providers SHOULD filter out routing information about shared
   transition space networks on ingress links.  Reverse DNS queries for
   Shared Transition Space addresses MUST NOT be forwarded to the global
   DNS infrastructure.

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
   issues.  Any addresses allocated as Shared Transition Space would not
   be routable on the Internet.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to record the allocation of an IPv4 /10 for use as
   Shared Transition Space.
