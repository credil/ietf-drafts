1. Introduction

   The LDP [RFC5036] specification defines procedures and messages for
   exchanging label bindings over either IPv4 or IPv6 or both (e.g.
   dual-stack) networks.

   However, RFC5036 specification has the following deficiencies in
   regards to IPv6 usage:

   1) LSP mapping: No rule defined for mapping a particular packet to a
      particular LSP that has an Address Prefix FEC element containing
      IPv6 address of the egress router

   2) LDP identifier: No details specific to IPv6 usage

   3) LDP discovery: No details for using a particular IPv6 multicast
      address (with or without IPv4 co-existence)

   4) LDP Session establishment: No prescription for handling both IPv4
      and IPv6 transport address optional objects in a Hello message,
      and subsequently two IPv4 and IPv6 transport connections.

   This document addresses the above deficiencies by specifying the
   desired behavior.

   Note that this document updates RFC5036.



2. Specification Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   FEC   - Forwarding Equivalence Class

   TLV   - Type Length Value

   LSR   - Label Switch Router

3. LSP Mapping

   Section 2.1 of [RFC5036] specifies the procedure for mapping a
   particular packet to a particular LSP using three rules. Quoting the
   3rd rule from RFC5036:

     "If it is known that a packet must traverse a particular egress
     router, and there is an LSP that has an Address Prefix FEC element
     that is a /32 address of that router, then the packet is mapped to
     that LSP."

   Suffice to say, this rule is correct for IPv4, but not for IPv6,
   since an IPv6 router may not have any /32 address.

   This document proposes to modify this rule by also including a /128
   address (for IPv6). In fact, it should be reasonable to just say
   IPv4 or IPv6 address instead of /32 or /128 addresses as shown below
   in the updated rule:

     "If it is known that a packet must traverse a particular egress
     router, and there is an LSP that has an Address Prefix FEC element
     that is an IPv4 or IPv6 address of that router, then the packet is
     mapped to that LSP."



4. LDP Identifiers

   Section 2.2.2 of [RFC5036] specifies formulating at least one LDP
   Identifier, however, it doesn't provide any consideration in case of
   IPv6 (with or without dual-stacking).

   This document preserves the usage of 32-bit LSR Id on an IPv6 only
   LSR and allows the usage of a common LDP identifier i.e. same LSR-Id
   and same Label space id for IPv4 and IPv6 on a dual-stack LSR. This
   rightly enables the per-platform label space to be shared between
   IPv4 and IPv6.

     Editor's note: The possible conflict with last paragraph of
     section 2.5.2 of RFC5036 needs to be addressed or clarified.

   Additionally, this document reserves 0.0.0.0 as the LSR-Id, and
   prohibits its usage.

5. Peer Discovery

5.1. Basic Discovery Mechanism

   Section 2.4.1 of [RFC5036] defines the Basic Discovery mechanism for
   directly connected LSRs. Following this mechanism, LSRs periodically
   sends LDP Link Hellos destined to "all routers on this subnet" group
   multicast IP address.

   Interesting enough, per [IANA-IPv6] [RFC4291], IPv6 has three "all
   routers on this subnet" multicast addresses:

         FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:2   = Interface-local scope

         FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2   = Link-local scope

         FF05:0:0:0:0:0:0:2   = Site-local scope

   [RFC5036] does not specify which particular IPv6 'all routers on
   this subnet' group multicast IP address should be used by LDP Link
   Hellos.

   This document specifies the usage of link-local scope e.g.
   FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2 as the destination multicast IP address for IPv6
   LDP Link Hellos. An LDP Hello packet received on any of the other
   addresses should be dropped. Also, the LDP Link Hello packets must
   have their IPv6 Hop Limit set to 1.

   More importantly, if an interface is a dual-stack LDP interface
   (e.g. enabled with both IPv4 and IPv6 LDP), then the LSR must
   periodically send both IPv4 and IPv6 LDP Link Hellos and must
   separately maintain the Hello adjacency for IPv4 and IPv6. This
   ensures labeled IPv4 and labeled IPv6 traffic forwarding on a dual-
   stacked interface, as well as the LDP peerings using the appropriate
   transport can be established on a multi-access interface (even if
   there are IPv4-only, IPv6-only and dual-stack routers on that multi-
   access segment). Needless to say, the IPv4 and IPv6 LDP Link Hellos
   must carry the same LDP identifier (assuming per-platform label
   space usage).



5.2. Extended Discovery Mechanism

   Suffice to say, the extended discovery mechanism (defined in section
   2.4.2 of [RFC5036]) doesn't require any additional IPv6 specific



Asati, et. al            Expires May 8, 2011                   [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6        November 8, 2010


   consideration, since the targeted LDP Hellos are sent to a pre-
   configured destination IP address.



6. LDP Session Establishment

   Section 2.5.1 of [RFC5036] defines a two-step process for LDP
   session establishment:

     1. Transport connection establishment
     2. Session initialization

   Next two sections discuss the LDP consideration for IPv6 and/or
   dual-stacking.

6.1. Transport connection establishment

   Section 2.5.2 of [RFC5036] specifies the use of an optional
   transport address object (TLV) in LDP Link Hello message to convey
   the transport (IP) address, however, it does not specify the
   behavior of LDP if both IPv4 and IPv6 transport address objects
   (TLV) are sent in a Hello message. Moreover, it does not specify
   whether both IPv4 and IPv6 transport connections should be allowed,
   if there were Hello adjacencies for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   This document specifies that:

     - An LSR should not send a Hello containing both IPv4 and IPv6
        transport address optional objects. In other words, there
        should be at most one optional Transport Address object in a
        Hello message. An LSR should include only the transport address
        whose address family is the same as that of the IP packet
        carrying Hello.

     - An LSR should accept the Hello message that contains both IPv4
        and IPv6 transport address optional objects, but use only the
        transport address whose address family is the same as that of
        the IP packet carrying Hello.

     - An LSR should not create (or honor the request for creating) a
        TCP connection for a new LDP session with a remote LSR, if they
        already have an LDP session (for the same label spaces)
        established using whatever IP version. This means that only one
        transport connection should be established, even if there are
        two Hello adjacencies (one for IPv4 and another for IPv6).

     - An LSR should prefer the TCP connection over IPv6 for a new LDP
        session with a remote LSR, if they attempted two TCP
        connections using IPv4 and IPv6 transports simultaneously.



6.2. Session initialization

   No additional consideration needed.



7. IANA Considerations

   None.



8. Security Considerations

   The extensions defined in this document only clarify the behavior of
   LDP, they do not define any new protocol procedures. All the
   security issues relevant for the [RFC5036] are relevant for this
   document as well.

   Moreover, this document allows the use of IPsec [RFC4301] for IPv6
   protection, hence, LDP can benefit from the additional security as
   specified in [RFC4835].
