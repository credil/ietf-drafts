      <t>This document performs the initial analysis of the current state of
           Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
		  <xref target="RFC4601"></xref> 
		   according to the requirements of <xref
           target="I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide"></xref></t>      

	<t> <xref target="RFC5796"></xref> describes mechanisms
   to authenticate the PIM-SM link-local messages using the IP security
   (IPsec) Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"></xref>  
	or (optionally) the  Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"></xref> .
	</t>

	<t> This document specifies manual key management
   as mandatory to implement, i.e., that all implementations MUST
   support, and provides the necessary structure for an automated key
   management protocol that the PIM routers may use.
	</t>

	<t> However, some gaps remain between the current state and the
   requirements for manually keyed routing security expressed in the
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs"></xref>
    document.  This document explores these gaps and proposes directions 
	for addressing the gaps.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Current State and Gap Analysis">

      <t><xref target="RFC5796"></xref> describes how IPsec can be used
      to secure and authenticate PIM-SM protocol packets. It mandates the use
      of manual keying and optionally provides support for an automated 
  	 group key management  mechanism. However, it leaves the procedures
      for implementing automated group key management to other documents and
      does not discuss how this can be done. </t>

    <t> <xref target="RFC5796"></xref> uses manually configured keys, 
      rather than some automated key management
      protocol , since no suitable key management mechanism is available at
this time.  This is because PIM-SM adjacencies are formed on a
one-to-many basis and most key management mechanisms are designed for a
one-to-one communication model. Since
      <xref target="RFC5796"></xref> uses manual keying it clearly states that
      it provides no protection against both inter-session and intra-session
     replay attacks. This can be exploited
      in several ways.</t>

	<t> Since multiple PIM-SM routers can exist on a single link, it would be
          worth noting that setting up IPsec Security
   		Associations (SAs) manually can be a very tedious process. The routers might not even
support IPsec, rendering automatic key negotiation either impractical
(in those platforms where an extra license has to be obtained for using
IPsec) or infeasible (in those platforms where IPsec support is not
available at all).
	</t>

	<t> While I don't yet see a need to prioritize certain PIM-SM packets
			over the others, it should be noted that this would be extremely difficult to
			achieve since PIM-SM uses IPsec for its security and authentication.
	</t>

	<t> <xref target="RFC4601"></xref> requires all PIM-SM routers to configure
        an IPsec Security Association (SA) when sending PIM Register packets to 
        each Rendezous Point (RP). This can become highly unscalable as the number
        of RPs increase or in case of Anycast-RP <xref target="RFC4610"></xref> deployment
        where each PIM-SM router close to the source will need to establish IPsec tunnels
        to all PIM-SM routers in the Anycast-RP set.
	</t>

	<t> Similarly, the Security Policy Database at each Rendezvous Point
   should be configured to choose an SA to use when sending Register-
   Stop messages.  Because Register-Stop messages are unicast to the
   destination DR, a different SA and a potentially unique SPI are
   required for each DR.
	</t>

	<t> In order to simplify the management problem, <xref target="RFC4601"></xref> 
	       suggests using the same authentication algorithm and authentication parameters,
   regardless of the sending RP and regardless of the destination DR. While this alleviates
      the management problem by some extent it still requires a unique SA on each DR
     which can result in a significant scaling issue as the size of the PIM-SM network grows.
	</t>

   	<t> In order to encourage deployment of PIM-SM security, an
   authentication option is required that does not have the deployment
   challenges of IPsec. We thus need an authentication mechanism
   alternate to IPsec as part of the first phase of the KARP design guide where we
	secure the routing protocols using manual keying.
	</t>

	<t> The new mechanism should work for both the Unicast and Multicast 
	PIM-SM routing exchanges. It should also provide both inter-session and
	intra-session replay protection that has been spelled out in the
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs"></xref> document.
