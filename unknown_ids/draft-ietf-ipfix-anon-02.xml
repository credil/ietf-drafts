  <section title="Introduction">

    <t>The standardisation of an IP flow information export protocol <xref target="RFC5101"/> and associated representations removes a
    technical barrier to the sharing of IP flow data across organizational
    boundaries and with network operations, security, and research communities
    for a wide variety of purposes. However, with wider dissemination comes
    greater risks to the privacy of the users of networks under measurement,
    and to the security of those networks. While it is not a complete solution
    to the issues posed by distribution of IP flow information, anonymisation
    (i.e., the deletion or transformation of information that is considered
    sensitive and could be used to reveal the identity of subjects involved in
    a communication) is an important tool for the protection of privacy within
    network measurement infrastructures.</t>

    <t>This document presents a mechanism for representing anonymised data
    within IPFIX and guidelines for using it. It begins with a categorization
    of anonymisation techniques. It then describes applicability of each
    technique to commonly anonymisable fields of IP flow data, organized by
    information element data type and semantics as in <xref target="RFC5102"></xref>; enumerates the parameters required by each of
    the applicable anonymisation techniques; and provides guidelines for the
    use of each of these techniques in accordance with best practices in data
    protection. Finally, it specifies a mechanism for exporting anonymised
    data and binding anonymisation metadata to templates using IPFIX
    Options.</t>

    <section title="IPFIX Protocol Overview">

      <t>In the IPFIX protocol, { type, length, value } tuples are expressed
      in templates containing { type, length } pairs, specifying which { value
      } fields are present in data records conforming to the Template, giving
      great flexibility as to what data is transmitted. Since Templates are
      sent very infrequently compared with Data Records, this results in
      significant bandwidth savings. Various different data formats may be
      transmitted simply by sending new Templates specifying the { type,
      length } pairs for the new data format. See <xref target="RFC5101"></xref> for more information.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="RFC5102">IPFIX information model</xref> defines a
      large number of standard Information Elements which provide the
      necessary { type } information for Templates. The use of standard
      elements enables interoperability among different vendors'
      implementations. Additionally, non-standard enterprise-specific elements
      may be defined for private use.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="IPFIX Documents Overview" anchor="intro-docs">

      <t><xref target="RFC5101">"Specification of the IPFIX
      Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow Information"</xref>
      and its associated documents
      define the IPFIX Protocol, which provides network engineers and
      administrators with access to IP traffic flow information.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5470">"Architecture for IP Flow
      Information Export"</xref> defines
      the architecture for the export of measured IP flow information out of
      an IPFIX Exporting Process to an IPFIX Collecting Process, and the
      basic terminology used to describe the elements of this architecture,
      per the requirements defined in <xref target="RFC3917">"Requirements
      for IP Flow Information Export"</xref>. The IPFIX Protocol document
      <xref target="RFC5101"></xref> then covers the details of the method for
      transporting IPFIX Data Records and Templates via a congestion-aware
      transport protocol from an IPFIX Exporting Process to an IPFIX
      Collecting Process.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5102">"Information Model for IP Flow Information
      Export"</xref> describes the Information Elements used by IPFIX,
      including details on Information Element naming, numbering, and data
      type encoding. Finally, <xref target="RFC5472">"IPFIX
      Applicability"</xref> describes the various applications of the IPFIX
      protocol and their use of information exported via IPFIX, and relates
      the IPFIX architecture to other measurement architectures and
      frameworks.</t>

      <t>Additionally, <xref target="RFC5655">"Specification
      of the IPFIX File Format"</xref> describes a file format based upon the
      IPFIX Protocol for the storage of flow data.</t>

      <t>This document references the Protocol and Architecture documents for
      terminology, and extends the IPFIX Information Model to provide new
      Information Elements for anonymisation metadata. The anonymisation
      techniques described herein are equally applicable to the IPFIX Protocol
      and data stored in IPFIX Files.</t>

    <t>Note that, according to the original architecture specification, IPFIX Message anonymisation is optionally performed as the final operation before handing the Message to the transport protocol for export. While no provision is made in the architecture for anonymisation metadata as in <xref target="aes-section"></xref>, this arrangement does allow for the message rewriting necessary for comprehensive anonymisation of IPFIX export as in <xref target="export-anon-section"></xref>. The development of the <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipfix-mediators-framework">IPFIX Mediation</xref> framework and the <xref target="RFC5655">IPFIX File Format</xref> expand upon this initial architectural allowance for anonymisation by adding  to the list of places that anonymisation may be applied. The former specifies IPFIX Mediators, which rewrite existing IPFIX messages, and the latter specifies a method for storage of IPFIX data in files.</t>

  <section title="Categorisation of Anonymisation Techniques">

    <t>Anonymisation modifies a data set in order to
    protect the identity of the people or entities described by the data set
    from disclosure. With respect to network traffic data, anonymisation
    generally attempts to preserve some set of properties of the network
    traffic useful for a given application or applications, while ensuring the
    data cannot be traced back to the specific networks, hosts, or users
    generating the traffic.</t>

    <t>Anonymisation may be broadly classified according to two properties:
    recoverability and countability. All anonymisation techniques map the real
    space of identifiers or values into a separate, anonymised space,
    according to some function. A technique is said to be recoverable when the
    function used is invertible or can otherwise be reversed and a real
    identifier can be recovered from a given replacement identifier.</t>

    <t>Countability compares the dimension of the anonymised space (N) to the
    dimension of the real space (M), and denotes how the count of unique
    values is preserved by the anonymisation function. If the anonymised space
    is smaller than the real space, then the function is said to generalise
    the input, mapping more than one input point to each anonymous value
    (e.g., as with aggregation). By definition, generalisation is not
    recoverable.</t>

    <t>If the dimensions of the anonymised and real spaces are the same, such
    that the count of unique values is preserved, then the function is said to
    be a direct substitution function. If the dimension of the anonymised
    space is larger, such that each real value maps to a set of anonymised
    values, then the function is said to be a set substitution function. Note
    that with set substitution functions, the sets of anonymised values are
    not necessarily disjoint. Either direct or set substitution functions are
    said to be one-way if there exists no practical method for recovering the
    real data point from an anonymised one.</t>

    <t>This classification is summarised in the table below.</t>

  <section title="Anonymisation of IP Flow Data">

    <t>Due to the restricted semantics of IP flow data, there is a relatively
    limited set of specific anonymisation techniques available on flow data,
    though each falls into the broad categories above. Each type of field that
    may commonly appear in a flow record may have its own applicable specific
    techniques.</t>

    <t>While anonymisation is generally applied at the resolution of single
    fields within a flow record, attacks against anonymisation use entire
    flows and relationships between hosts and flows within a given data set.
    Therefore, fields which may not necessarily be identifying by themselves
    may be anonymised in order to increase the anonymity of the data set as a
    whole.</t>

    <t>Of all the fields in an IP flow record, IP addresses are the most
    likely to be used to directly identify entities in the real world. Each IP
    address is associated with an interface on a network host, and can
    potentially be identified with a single user. Additionally, IP addresses
    are structured identifiers; that is, partial IP address prefixes may be
    used to identify networks just as full IP addresses identify hosts. This
    makes anonymisation of IP addresses particularly important.</t>

    <t>Hardware addresses uniquely identify devices on the network; while they
    are not often available in traffic data collected at Layer 3, and cannot
    be used to locate devices within the network, some traces may contain
    sub-IP data including hardware address data. Hardware addresses may be
    mappable to device serial numbers, and to the entities or individuals who
    purchased the devices, when combined with external databases. They may
    also leak via IPv6 addresses in certain circumstances. Therefore, hardware
    address anonymisation is also important.</t>

    <t>Port numbers identify abstract entities (applications) as opposed to
    real-world entities, but they can be used to classify hosts and user
    behavior. Passive port fingerprinting, both of well-known and ephemeral
    ports, can be used to determine the operating system running on a host.
    Relative data volumes by port can also be used to determine the host's
    function (workstation, web server, etc.); this information can be used to
    identify hosts and users.</t>

    <t>While not identifiers in and of themselves, timestamps and counters
    can reveal the behavior of the hosts and users on a network. Any given
    network activity is recognizable by a pattern of relative time differences
    and data volumes in the associated sequence of flows, even without host
    address information. They can therefore be used to identify hosts and
    users. Timestamps and counters are also vulnerable to traffic injection
    attacks, where traffic with a known pattern is injected into a network
    under measurement, and this pattern is later identified in the anonymised
    data set. </t>

    <t>The simplest and most extreme form of anonymisation, which can be
    applied to any field of a flow record, is black-marker anonymisation, or
    complete deletion of a given field. Note that black-marker anonymisation
    is equivalent to simply not exporting the field(s) in question.</t>

    <t> While black-marker anonymisation completely protects the data in
    the deleted fields from the risk of disclosure, it also reduces the
    utility of the anonymised data set as a whole. Techniques that retain some
    information while reducing (though not eliminating) the disclosure risk
    will be extensively discussed in the following sections; note that the
    techniques specifically applicable to IP addresses, timestamps, ports, and
    counters will be discussed in separate sections.</t>

    <section title="IP Address Anonymisation">

      <t>Since IP addresses are the most common identifiers within flow data
      that can be used to directly identify a person, organization, or host,
      most of the work on flow and trace data anonymisation has gone into IP
      address anonymisation techniques. Indeed, the aim of most attacks
      against anonymisation is to recover the map from anonymised IP addresses
      to original IP addresses thereby identifying the identified hosts. There
      is therefore a wide range of IP address anonymisation schemes that fit
      into the following categories.</t>

      <texttable> 
        <ttcol align="left">Scheme</ttcol>

        <c>Permutation</c><c>Direct Substitution</c>
        <c>Prefix-preserving Pseudonymisation</c><c>Direct Substitution</c>
      </texttable>

      <section title="Truncation">

        <t>Truncation removes "n" of the least significant bits from an IP
        address, replacing them with zeroes. In effect, it replaces a host
        address with a network address for some fixed netblock; for IPv4
        addresses, 8-bit truncation corresponds to replacement with a /24
        network address. Truncation is a non-reversible generalisation scheme.
        Note that while truncation is effective for making hosts
        non-identifiable, it preserves information which can be used to
        identify an organization, a geographic region, a country, or a
        continent (or RIR region of responsibility).</t>

        <t>Truncation to an address length of 0 is equivalent to black-marker
        anonymisation. Complete removal of IP address information is only
        recommended for analysis tasks which have no need to separate flow
        data by host or network; e.g. as a first stage to per-application
        (port) or time-series total volume analyses.</t>

      <section title="Reverse Truncation">

        <t>Reverse truncation removes "n" of the most significant bits from an
        IP address, replacing them with zeroes. Reverse truncation is a
        non-reversible generalisation scheme. Reverse truncation is effective
        for making networks unidentifiable, partially or completely removing
        information which can be used to identify an organization, a
        geographic region, a country, or a continent (or RIR region of
        responsibility). However, it may cause ambiguity when applied to data
        collected from more than one network, since it treats all the hosts
        with the same address on different networks as if they are the same
        host. It is not particularly useful when publishing data where the
        network of origin is known or can be easily guessed by virtue of the
        identity of the publisher.</t>

      <section title="Permutation">

        <t>Permutation is a direct substitution technique, replacing each IP
        address with an address selected from the set of possible IP
        addresses, guaranteeing that each anonymised address represents a
        unique original address. The selection function is often random,
        though it is not necessarily so. Permutation does not preserve any
        structural information about a network, but it does preserve the
        unique count of IP addresses. Any application that requires more
        structure than host-uniqueness will not be able to use permuted IP
        addresses.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Prefix-preserving Pseudonymisation">

        <t>Prefix-preserving pseudonymisation is a direct substitution
        technique, like permutation but further restricted such that the
        structure of subnets is preserved at each level while anonymising IP
        addresses. If two real IP addresses match on a prefix of "n" bits, the
        two anonymised IP addresses will match on a prefix of "n" bits as
        well. This is useful when relationships among networks must be
        preserved for a given analysis task, but introduces structure into the
        anonymised data which can be exploited in attacks against the
        anonymisation technique.</t>

        <t>Scanning in Internet background traffic can cause particular
        problems with this technique: if a scanner uses a predictable and
        known sequence of addresses, this information can be used to reverse
        the substitution. The low order portion of the address can be left
        unanonymized as a partial defense against this attack.</t>

    <section title="Hardware Address Anonymisation">

      <t>Flow data containing sub-IP information can also contain identifying
      information in the form of the hardware (MAC) address. While hardware
      address information cannot be used to locate a node within a network, it
      can be used to directly uniquely identify a specific device. Vendors or
      organizations within the supply chain may then have the information
      necessary to identify the entity or individual that purchased the
      device.</t>

      <t>Hardware address information is not as structured as IP address
      information. EUI-48 and EUI-64 hardware addresses contain an
      Organizational Unique Identifier in the three most significant bytes of
      the address; this OUI additionally contains bits noting whether the
      address is locally or globally administered. Beyond this, the address is
      unstructured, and there is no particular relationship among the OUIs
      assigned to a given vendor.</t>

      <t>Note that hardware address information also appear within IPv6
      addresses, as the EAP-64 address, or EAP-48 address encoded as an EAP-64
      address, is used as the least significant 64 bits of the IPv6 address in
      the case of link local addressing or stateless autoconfiguration; the
      considerations and techniques in this section may then apply to such
      IPv6 addresses as well.</t>

        bits of the OUI, which identify manufacturers, before removing the
        least significant bits. Reverse truncation of 24 bits zeroes out the
        OUI.</t>

        <t>Reverse truncation is effective for making device manufacturers

      <section title="Precision Degradation">

        <t>Precision Degradation is a generalisation technique that removes
        the most precise components of a timestamp, accounting all events
        occurring in each given interval (e.g. one millisecond for millisecond
        level degradation) as simultaneous. This has the effect of potentially
        collapsing many timestamps into one. With this technique time
        precision is reduced, and sequencing may be lost, but the information
        at which time the event occurred is preserved. The anonymised data may
        not be generally useful for applications which require strict
        sequencing of flows.</t>

        <t>Note that flow meters with low time precision (e.g. second
        precision, or millisecond precision on high-capacity networks) perform
        the equivalent of precision degradation anonymisation by their
        design.</t>

        <t>Note also that degradation to a very low precision (e.g. on the
        order of minutes, hours, or days) is commonly used in analyses
        operating on time-series aggregated data, and may also be described as
        binning; though the time scales are longer and applicability more
        restricted, this is in principle the same operation.</t>

        <t>Precision degradation to infinitely low precision is equivalent to
        black-marker anonymisation. Removal of timestamp information is only
        recommended for analysis tasks which have no need to separate flows in
        time, for example for counting total volumes or unique occurrences of
        other flow keys in an entire dataset.</t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Enumeration">

        <t>Enumeration is a substitution function that retains the
        chronological order in which events occurred while eliminating time
        information. Timestamps are substituted by equidistant timestamps (or
        numbers) starting from a randomly chosen start value. The resulting
        data is useful for applications requiring strict sequencing, but not
        for those requiring good timing information (e.g. delay- or jitter-
        measurement for QoS applications or SLA validation).</t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Random Shifts">

        <t>Random time shifts add a random offset to every timestamp within a
        dataset. This reversible substitution technique therefore retains
        duration and inter-event interval information as well as chronological
        order of flows. It is primarily intended to defeat traffic injection
        fingerprinting attacks.</t>

      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Counter Anonymisation">

      <t>Counters (such as packet and octet volumes per flow) are subject to
      fingerprinting and injection attacks against anonymisation, or for user
      profiling as timestamps are. Counter anonymisation can help defeat these
      attacks, but are only usable for analysis tasks for which relative or
      imprecise magnitudes of activity are useful. Counter information can
      also be completely removed, but this is only recommended for analysis
      tasks which have no need to evaluate the removed counter, for example
      for counting only unique occurrences of other flow keys.</t>

      <section title="Precision Degradation">

        <t>As with precision degradation in timestamps, precision degradation
        of counters removes lower-order bits of the counters, treating all the
        counters in a given range as having the same value. Depending on the
        precision reduction, this loses information about the relationships
        between sizes of similarly-sized flows, but keeps relative magnitude
        information. Precision degradation to an infinitely low precision is
        equivalent to black-marker anonymisation.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Binning">

        <t>Binning can be seen as a special case of precision degradation; the
        operation is identical, except for in precision degradation the
        counter ranges are uniform, and in binning they need not be. For
        example, a common counter binning scheme for packet counters could be
        to bin values 1-2 together, and 3-infinity together, thereby
        separating potentially completely-opened TCP connections from unopened
        ones. Binning schemes are generally chosen to keep precisely the
        amount of information required in a counter for a given analysis task.
        Note that, also unlike precision degradation, the bin label need not
        be within the bin's range. Binning counters to a single bin is
        equivalent to black-marker anonymisation. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Random Noise Addition">

        <t>Random noise addition adds a random amount to a counter in each
        flow; this is used to keep relative magnitude information and minimize
        the disruption to size relationship information while avoiding
        fingerprinting attacks against anonymisation. Note that there is no
        guarantee that random noise addition will maintain ranking order by a
        counter among members of a set. Random noise addition is particularly
        useful when the derived analysis data will not be presented in such a
        way as to require the lower-order bits of the counters.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Anonymisation of Other Flow Fields">

      <t>Other fields, particularly port numbers and protocol numbers, can
      be used to partially identify the applications that generated the
      traffic in a a given flow trace. This information can be used in
      fingerprinting attacks, and may be of interest on its own (e.g., to
      reveal that a certain application with suspected vulnerabilities is
      running on a given network). These fields are generally
      anonymised using one of two techniques.</t>

      <section title="Binning">

        <t>Binning is a generalisation technique mapping a set of potentially
        non-uniform ranges into a set of arbitrarily labeled bins. Common bin
        arrangements depend on the field type and the analysis application.
        For example, an IP protocol bin arrangement may preserve 1, 6, and 17
        for ICMP, UDP, and TCP traffic, and bin all other protocols into a
        single bin, to mitigate the use of uncommon protocols in
        fingerprinting attacks. Another example arrangement may bin source and
        destination ports into low (0-1023) and high (1024-65535) bins in
        order to tell service from ephemeral ports without identifying
        individual applications.</t>

        <t>Binning other flow key fields to a single bin is equivalent to
        black-marker anonymisation. Removal of other flow key information is
        only recommended for analysis tasks which have no need to
        differentiate flows on the removed keys, for example for total traffic
        counts or unique counts of other flow keys.</t>

      </section>      

      <section title="Permutation">

        <t>Permutation is a direct substitution technique, replacing
        each value with an value selected from the set of possible
        range, guaranteeing that each anonymised value represents a unique
        original value. This is used to preserve the count of unique values
        without preserving information about, or the ordering of, the values
        themselves.</t>

  <section title="Parameters for the Description of Anonymisation Techniques"> 

    <t>This section details the abstract parameters used to describe the
    anonymisation techniques examined in the previous section, on a
    per-parameter basis. These parameters and their export safety inform the
    design of the IPFIX anonymisation metadata export specified in the
    following section.</t>

    <section title="Stability" anchor="params-stability">

      <t>Any given anonymisation technique may be applied with a varying range
      of stability. Stability is important for assessing the comparability of
      anonymised information in different data sets, or in the same data set
      over different time periods. In general, stability ranges from
      completely stable to completely unstable; however, note that the
      completely unstable case is indistinguishable from black-marker
      anonymisation. A completely stable anonymisation will always map a given
      value in the real space to the same value in the anonymised space. In
      practice, an anonymisation may also be stable for every data set
      published by an a particular producer to a particular consumer, stable
      for a stated time period within a dataset or across datasets, or stable
      only for a single data set.</t>

      <t>If no information about stability is available, users of anonymised
      data may assume that the techniques used are stable across the entire
      dataset, but unstable across datasets. Note that stability presents a
      risk-utility tradeoff, as completely stable anonymisation can be used
      for longer-term trend analysis tasks but also presents more risk of
      attack given the stable mapping.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Truncation Length">

      <t>Truncation and precision degradation are described by the truncation
      length, or the amount of data still remaining in the anonymised field
      after anonymisation.</t>

      <t>Truncation length can be inferred from a given data set, and need not
      be specially exported or protected.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Bin Map">

      <t>Binning is described by the specification of a bin mapping function.
      This function can be generally expressed in terms of an associative
      array that maps each point in the original space to a bin, although from
      an implementation standpoint most bin functions are much simpler and
      more efficient.</t>

      <t>Since knowledge of the bin mapping function can be used to partially
      deanonymise binned data, depending on the degree of generalisation, no
      information about the bin mapping function should be exported.</t>
      
    </section>
      
    <section title="Permutation">

      <t>Like binning, permutation is described by the specification of a
      permutation function. In the general case, this can be expressed in
      terms of an associative array that maps each point in the original space
      to a point in the anonymised space. Unlike binning, each point in the
      anonymised space must correspond to a single, unique point in the
      original space.</t>

      <t>Since knowledge of the permutation function can be used to completely
      deanonymise permuted data, no information about the permutation function
      or its parameters should be exported.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Shift Amount">

      <t>Shifting requires an amount to shift each value by. Since the shift
      amount can be used to deanonymise data protected by shifting, no
      information about the shift amount should be exported.</t>

    </section>

  </section> 

  <section title="Anonymisation Export Support in IPFIX" anchor="aes-section">

    <t>Anonymised data exported via IPFIX SHOULD be annotated with
    anonymisation metadata, which details which fields described by which
    Templates are anonymised, and provides appropriate information on the
    anonymisation techniques used. This metadata SHOULD be exported in Data
    Records described by the recommended Options Templates described in this
    section; these Options Templates use the additional Information Elements
    described in the following subsection.</t>

    <t>Note that fields anonymised using the black-marker (removal) technique
    do not require any special metadata support. Black-marker anonymised
    fields SHOULD NOT be exported at all; the absence of the field in a given
    Data Set is implicitly declared by not including the corresponding
    Information Element in the Template describing that Data Set.</t>
    

    <section title="Anonymisation Options Template" anchor="opt-section">

      <t>The Anonymisation Options Template describes anonymisation records,
      which allow anonymisation metadata to be exported inline over IPFIX or
      stored in an IPFIX File, by binding information about anonymisation
      techniques to Information Elements within defined Templates. IPFIX
      Exporting Processes SHOULD export anonymisation records for any Template
      describing exported anonymised Data Records; IPFIX Collecting Processes
      and processes downstream from them MAY use anonymisation records to
      treat anonymised data differently depending on the applied
      technique.</t>

      <t>An Exporting Process SHOULD export anonymisation records after the
      Templates they describe have been exported, and SHOULD export
      anonymisation records reliably.</t>

      <t>Anonymisation records, like Templates, MUST be handled by Collecting
      Processes as scoped to the Transport Session in which they are sent.
      While the Stability Class within the anonymisationFlags IE can be used
      to declare that a given anonymisation technique's mapping will remain
      stable across multiple sessions, each session MUST re-export the
      anonymisation Records along with the templates.</t>

              The Stability Class portion of this flags word describes the
              stability class of the anonymisation technique applied to a
              referenced Information Element within a referenced Template.
              Stability classes refer to the stability of the parameters of
              the anonymisation technique, and therefore the comparability of
              the mapping between the real and anonymised values over time.
              This determines which anonymised datasets may be compared with
              each other. Values are as follows:

  <section title="Applying Anonymisation Techniques to IPFIX Export and Storage" anchor="export-anon-section">

    <t>When exporting or storing anonymised flow data using IPFIX, certain
    interactions between the IPFIX Protocol and the anonymisation techniques
    in use must be considered; these are treated in the subsections below.</t>

    <section title="Arrangement of Processes in IPFIX Anonymisation" anchor="export-anon-arrangement">

      <t>Anonymisation may be applied to IPFIX data at three stages within the

      collection, as shown in <xref target="loc-fig"></xref>. Each of these
      locations has specific considerations and applicability.</t>

      <t>Anonymisation is generally performed before the wider dissemination
      or repurposing of a flow data set, e.g., adapting operational
      measurement data for research. Therefore, direct anonymisation of flow
      data on initial export is only applicable in certain restricted
      circumstances: when the Exporting Process is "publishing" data to a
      Collecting Process directly, and the Exporting Process and Collecting
      Process are operated by different entities. Note that certain guidelines
      in <xref target="header-anon"></xref> with respect to timestamp
      anonymisation may not apply in this case, as the Collecting Process may
      be able to deduce certain timing information from the time at which each
      Message is received.</t>

      <t>A much more flexible arrangement is to anonymise data within a <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipfix-mediators-framework">Mediator</xref>. Here,
      original data is sent to a Mediator, which performs the anonymisation
      function and re-exports the anonymised data. Such a Mediator could be
      located at the administrative domain boundary of the initial Exporting
      Process operator, exporting anonymised data to other consumers outside
      the organisation. In this case, the original Exporter SHOULD use TLS as
      specified in <xref target="RFC5101"></xref> to secure the channel to the
      Mediator, and the Mediator should follow the guidelines in <xref target="guidelines"></xref>, to mitigate the risk of original data
      disclosure.</t>

      <t>When data is to be published as an anonymised data set in an <xref target="RFC5655">IPFIX File</xref>, the anonymisation may be
      done at the final Collecting Process before storage and dissemination,
      as well. In this case, the Collector should follow the guidelines in
      <xref target="guidelines"></xref>, especially as regards File-specific
      Options in <xref target="opt-anon"></xref> </t>

      <t>In each of these data flows, the anonymisation of records is
      undertaken by an Intermediate Anonymisation Process (IAP); the data
      flows into and out of this IAP are shown in <xref target="iap-dataflows"></xref> below.</t>

      five basic types of anonymisation arrangements within this framework in

      7.3.7 of <xref target="RFC5655"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Note that anonymisation may occur at more than one location within a  
      given collection infrastructure, to provide varying levels of anonymisation, 
      disclosure risk, or data utility for specific purposes.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="IPFIX-Specific Anonymisation Guidelines" anchor="guidelines">

      <t>In implementing and deploying the anonymisation techniques described
      in this document, implementors should note that IPFIX already provides
      features that support anonymised data export, and use these where
      appropriate. Care must also be taken that data structures supporting the
      operation of the protocol itself do not leak data that could be used to
      reverse the anonymisation applied to the flow data. Such data structures
      may appear in the header, or within the data stream itself, especially
      as options data. Each of these and their impact on specific
      anonymisation techniques is noted in a separate subsection below.</t>

      <section title="Appropriate Use of Information Elements for Anonymised Data" anchor="iespec-anon">

        <t>Note, as in <xref target="aes-section"></xref> above, that black-marker
        anonymised fields SHOULD NOT be exported at all; the absence of the
        field in a given Data Set is implicitly declared by not including the
        corresponding Information Element in the Template describing that Data
        Set.</t>

        <t>When using precision degradation of timestamps, Exporting Processes
        SHOULD export timing information using Information Elements of an
        appropriate precision, as explained in Section 4.5 of <xref target="RFC5153"></xref>. 
        For example, timestamps measured in
        millisecond-level precision and degraded to second-level precision
        should use flowStartSeconds and flowEndSeconds, not
        flowStartMilliseconds and flowEndMilliseconds.</t>

        <t>When exporting anonymised data and anonymisation metadata,
        Exporting Processes SHOULD ensure that the combination of Information
        Element and declared anonymisation technique are compatible.
        Specifically, the applicable and recommended Information Element types
        and semantics for each technique are noted in the description of the
        anonymisationTechnique Information Element in <xref target="ie-at-section"></xref>. 
        In this description, a timestamp is an
        Information Element with the data type dateTimeSeconds,
        dataTimeMilliseconds, dateTimeMicroseconds, or dateTimeNanoseconds; an
        address is an Information Element with the data type ipv4Address,
        ipv6Address, or macAddress; and an identifier is an Information
        Element with identifier data type semantics. Exporting Process MUST
        NOT export Anonymisation Options records binding techniques to
        Information Elements to which they are not applicable, and SHOULD NOT
        export Anonymisation Options records binding techniques to Information
        Elements for which they are not recommended. </t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Export of Perimeter-Based Anonymisation Policies" anchor="perimeter-anon">

          <t>Data collected from a single network may require different
          anonymisation policies for addresses internal and external to the
          network. For example, internal addresses could be subject to simple
          permutation, while external addresses could be aggregated into
          networks by truncation. When exporting anonymised perimeter
          bidirectional flow (biflow) data as in section 5.2 of <xref
          target="RFC5103"/>, this arrangement may be easily represented by
          specifying one technique for source endpoint information (which
          represents the external endpoint in a perimeter biflow) and one
          technique for destination endpoint information (which represents the
          internal address in a perimeter biflow).</t>

          <t>However, it can also be useful to represent perimeter-based
          anonymisation policies with unidirectional flow (uniflow), or
          non-perimeter biflow data. In this case, the Perimeter Anonymisation
          bit (bit 2) in the anonymisationFlags Information Element describing
          the anonymised address Information Elements can be set to change the
          meaning of "source" and "destination" of Information Elements to
          mean "external" and "internal" as with perimeter biflows, but only
          with respect to anonymisation policies.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Anonymisation of Header Data" anchor="header-anon">

        <t>Each IPFIX Message contains a Message Header; within this Message
        Header are contained two fields which may be used to break certain
        anonymisation techniques: the Export Time, and the Observation Domain

        <t>Export of IPFIX Messages containing anonymised timestamp data where
        the original Export Time Message header has some relationship to the
        anonymised timestamps SHOULD anonymise the Export Time header field
        using an equivalent technique, if possible. Otherwise, relationships
        between export and flow time could be used to partially or totally
        reverse timestamp anonymisation.</t>

        address (32 bits) may lead to a temptation to use an IPv4 interface
        address on the Metering or Exporting Process as the Observation Domain
        ID. If this address bears some relation to the IP addresses in the
        flow data (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal addresses) and
        the IP addresses in the flow data are anonymised in a
        structure-preserving way, then the Observation Domain ID may be used
        to break the IP address anonymisation. Use of an IPv4 interface
        address on the Metering or Exporting Process as the Observation Domain
        ID is NOT RECOMMENDED in this case.</t>

      <section title="Anonymisation of Options Data" anchor="opt-anon">

        <t>IPFIX uses the Options mechanism to export, among other things,
        metadata about exported flows and the flow collection infrastructure.
        As with the IPFIX Message Header, certain Options recommended in <xref target="RFC5101"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5655"></xref> containing flow timestamps and network addresses of
        Exporting and Collecting Processes may be used to break certain
        anonymisation techniques; care should be taken while using them with
        anonymised data export and storage.</t>

        <t>The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template,
        recommended in <xref target="RFC5101"></xref>, contains an Exporting Process
        ID field, which may be an exportingProcessIPv4Address Information
        Element or an exportingProcessIPv6Address Information Element. If the
        Exporting Process address bears some relation to the IP addresses in
        the flow data (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal addresses)
        and the IP addresses in the flow data are anonymised in a
        structure-preserving way, then the Exporting Process address may be
        used to break the IP address anonymisation. Exporting Processes
        exporting anonymised data in this situation SHOULD mitigate the risk
        of attack either by omitting Options described by the Exporting
        Process Reliability Statistics Options Template, or by anonymising the
        Exporting Process address using a similar technique to that used to
        anonymise the IP addresses in the exported data.</t>

        <t>Similarly, the Export Session Details Options Template and Message
        Details Options Template specified for the <xref target="RFC5655">IPFIX File Format</xref> may contain the
        exportingProcessIPv4Address Information Element or the
        exportingProcessIPv6Address Information Element to identify an
        Exporting Process from which a flow record was received, and the
        collectingProcessIPv4Address Information Element or the
        collectingProcessIPv6Address Information Element to identify the
        Collecting Process which received it. If the Exporting Process or
        Collecting Process address bears some relation to the IP addresses in
        the flow data (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal addresses)
        and the IP addresses in the flow data are anonymised in a
        structure-preserving way, then the Exporting Process or Collecting
        Process address may be used to break the IP address anonymisation.
        Since these Options Templates are primarily intended for storing IPFIX
        Transport Session data for auditing, replay, and testing purposes, it
        is NOT RECOMMENDED that storage of anonymised data include these
        Options Templates in order to mitigate the risk of attack.</t>

        <t>The Message Details Options Template specified for the <xref target="RFC5655">IPFIX File Format</xref> also contains
        the collectionTimeMilliseconds Information Element. As with the Export
        Time Message Header field, if the exported flow data contains
        anonymised timestamp information, and the collectionTimeMilliseconds
        Information Element in a given Message has some relationship to the
        anonymised timestamp information, then this relationship can be
        exploited to reverse the timestamp anonymisation. Since this Options
        Template is primarily intended for storing IPFIX Transport Session
        data for auditing, replay, and testing purposes, it is NOT RECOMMENDED
        that storage of anonymised data include this Options Template in order
        to mitigate the risk of attack.</t>

        <t>Since the Time Window Options Template specified for the 
        <xref target="RFC5655">IPFIX File Format</xref> refers to the
        timestamps within the flow data to provide partial table of contents
        information for an IPFIX File, care must be taken to ensure that
        Options described by this template are written using the anonymised
        timestamps instead of the original ones.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Special-Use Address Space Considerations" anchor="sua-anon">

          <t>When anonymising data for transport or storage using IPFIX
          containing anonymised IP addresses, and the analysis purpose permits
          doing so, it is recommended to filter out or leave unanonymised data
          containing the special-use IPv4 addresses enumerated in <xref
          target="RFC3330"/> or the special-use IPv6 addresses enumerated in
          <xref target="RFC5153"/>. Data containing these addresses (e.g.
          0.0.0.0 and 169.254.0.0/16 for link-local autoconfiguration in IPv4
          space) are often associated with specific, well-known behavioral
          patterns. Detection of these patterns in anonymised data can lead to
          deanonymisation of these special-use addresses, which increases the
          chance of a complete reversal of anonymisation by an attacker,
          especially of prefix-preserving techniques.</t>

      <t>In this example, consider the export or storage of an anonymised IPv4 dataset from a single network described by a simple template containing a  timestamp in seconds, a five-tuple, and packet and octet counters.

  <section title="Security Considerations">

    <t>This document provides guidelines for exporting metadata about
    anonymised data in IPFIX, or storing metadata about anonymised data in
    IPFIX Files. It is not intended as a general statement on the
    applicability of specific flow data anonymisation techniques. Exporters or
    publishers of anonymised data must take care that the applied
    anonymisation technique is appropriate for the data source, the purpose,
    and the risk of deanonymisation of a given application.</t>

    <t>We note specifically that anonymisation is not a replacement for
    encryption for confidentiality. It is only appropriate for protecting
    identifying information in data to be used for purposes in which the
    protected data is irrelevant. Confidentiality in export is best served by
    using TLS or DTLS as in the Security Considerations section of <xref
    target="RFC5101"/>, and in long-term storage by implementation-specific
    protection applied as in the Security Considerations section of <xref
    target="RFC5655"/>. Indeed, confidentiality and anonymisation
    are not mutually exclusive, as encryption for confidentiality may be
    applied to anonymised data export or storage, as well, when the anonymised
    data is not intended for public release.</t>

    <t>When using pseudonymisation techniques that have a mutable mapping,
    there is an inherent tradeoff in the stability of the map between
    long-term comparability and security of the dataset against
    deanonymisation. In general, deanonymisation attacks are more effective
    given more information, so the longer a given mapping is valid, the more
    information can be applied to deanonymisation. The specific details of
    this are technique-dependent and therefore out of the scope of this
    document.</t>

    <t>When releasing anonymised data, publishers need to ensure that data
    that could be used in deanonymisation is not leaked through the export
    protocol; guidelines for addressing this risk are provided in <xref
    target="guidelines"/>.</t>

    <t>Note as well that the Security Considerations section of <xref
    target="RFC5101"/> applies as well to the export of anonymised data, and
    the Security Considerations section of <xref
    target="RFC5655"/> to the storage of anonymised data, or the
    publication of anonymised traces.</t>
