Abstract 

   The operation of optical networks can require a level of detail in 
   the characterization of network elements, subsystems, devices, and 
   cabling not typically encountered with other networking technologies. 
   In addition, these physical characteristics may be important to 
   consider during typical day-to-day operations such as optical path 
   establishment, as well as during the network planning, installation, 
   and turn-up phases. This document discusses how the definition and 
   characterization of optical fiber, devices, subsystems, and network 
   elements contained in various ITU-T recommendations can be combined 
   with common control and measurement plane and path computation 
   element technologies to support Impairment Aware Routing and 
   Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in optical networks.

1. Introduction 

   As an optical signal progresses along its path it may be altered by 
   the various physical processes in the optical fibers and devices it 
   encounters. When such alterations result in signal degradation, we 
   usually refer to these processes as "impairments". An overview of 
   some critical optical impairments and their routing (path selection) 
   implications can be found in [RFC4054]. Roughly speaking, optical 
   impairments accumulate along the path (without 3R regeneration) 
   traversed by the signal. They are influenced by the type of fiber 
   used, the types and placement of various optical devices and the 
   presence of other optical signals that may share a fiber segment 
   along the signal's path. The degradation of the optical signals due 
   to impairments can result in unacceptable bit error rates or even a 
   complete failure to demodulate and/or detect the received signal. 
   Therefore, path selection in any WSON requires consideration of 
   optical impairments so that the signal will be propagated from the 
   network ingress point to the egress point with acceptable amount of 
   degradation.  

   Some optical subnetworks are designed such that over any path the 
   degradation to an optical signal due to impairments never exceeds 
   prescribed bounds. This may be due to the limited geographic extent 
   of the network, the network topology, and/or the quality of the 
   fiber and devices employed. In such networks the path selection 
   problem reduces to determining a continuous wavelength from source 
   to destination (the Routing and Wavelength Assignment problem). 
   These networks are discussed in [WSON-Frame]. In other optical

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   networks, impairments are important and the path selection process 
   must be impairment-aware.  

   Although [RFC4054] describes a number of key optical impairments, a 
   more complete description of optical impairments and the processes 
   that spawn them can be found in textbooks or reference books on 
   optical communications [Agrawal02], [Agrawal07]. To be useful to 
   consumers and producers of optical fiber, components, and subsystems, 
   optical characteristics need to be precisely defined along with 
   methods for their measurement, estimation and approximation. The ITU-
   T and other SDOs have assumed this responsibility and as optical 
   technology has advanced these documents have been updated.  Appendix 
   A of this document provides an overview of the extensive ITU-T 
   documentation in this area. 

   The benefits of operating networks of different technologies using an 
   intelligent control plane have been described in many places, and the 
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane is 
   described in [RFC3945]. The advantages of using a path computation 
   element (PCE) to perform complex path computations are discussed in 
   [RFC4655].  

   Given the existing standards covering optical characteristics 
   (impairments) and the knowledge of how the impact of impairments may 
   be estimated along a path, this document provides a framework for 
   impairment aware path computation and establishment utilizing GMPLS 
   protocols and the PCE architecture. As in the impairment free case 
   covered in [WSON-Frame] a number of different control plane 
   architectural options are described. 

2. Motivation 

   There are several cases where optical WSON networks are designed in 
   a way that not all possible paths are feasible in term of optical 
   signals. There are multiple reasons behind this choice; here below 
   is a non-exhaustive list of typical cases: 

  o  WSON is evolving using multi-degree optical cross connects in a 
     way that network topologies are changing from rings (and 
     interconnected rings) to a full mesh. Adding network equipment 
     such amplifiers or regenerators, to make all path feasible leads 
     to an over-provisioned network. Indeed, even with over 
     provisioning the network could still have some infeasible paths.

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

  o  Within a given network the optical physical interface may change 
     over the network life, e.g., the optical interfaces might be 
     upgraded to improve bit-rates or signal quality. Such changes 
     could provide a longer path for an optical signal. Although the 
     same considerations may apply to other network equipment upgrades,  
     the optical physical interfaces are a typical case because they 
     are typically provisioned at various stages of the network's life 
     span as needed by traffic demands. 

  o  There are cases where a network is upgraded by adding new optical 
     cross connects to increase network flexibility. In such cases 
     existing paths will have their feasibility modified while new 
     paths need to have their feasibility assessed. 

   Not having an impairment validation process for such networks will 
   imply a complex network design phase that has to also take into 
   account current network status in term of equipments and traffic.  
   Moreover the network operations such as path establishment will 
   require significant pre-design via non-control plane processes and 
   generally resulting in significantly slower network provisioning.  

3. Impairment Aware Optical Path Computation 

   One of the most basic questions in communications is whether one can 
   successfully transmit information from a transmitter to a receiver 
   within a prescribed error tolerance, usually specified as a maximum 
   permissible bit error ratio (BER). This generally depends on the 
   nature of the signal transmitted between the sender and receiver and 
   the nature of the communications channel between the sender and 
   receiver. The optical path utilized (along with the wavelength) 
   determines the communications channel.  

   The optical impairments incurred by the signal along the fiber and at 
   each optical network element along the path determine whether the BER 
   performance or any other measure of signal quality can be met for 
   this particular signal on this particular path.  

3.1. Optical Network Requirements and Constraints 

   This section examines the various optical network requirements and 
   constraints that an impairment aware optical control plane may have 
   to operate under. These requirements and constraints motivate the IA-
   RWA architectural alternatives to be presented in the following 
   section. We can break the different optical networks contexts up 
   along two main criteria: (a) the level impairment detail and 
   validation required, and (b) the constraints on sharing of impairment 
   information.

      3.1.1. Impairment Estimation Level of Detail  

   A. Ignored Impairments 

   This situation is applicable to networks designed such that every 
   possible path is valid for the signal types permitted on the network. 
   In this case impairments are only taken into account during network 
   design and after that, for example during optical path computation, 
   they can be ignored. This is the case discussed in [WSON-Frame] where 
   impairments could be ignored by the control plane. 

   B. Approximated Impairment Estimation 

   This situation is applicable to networks in which impairment effects 
   can be estimated via approximation techniques such as link budgets 
   and dispersion (rise time) budgets [Agrawal02],[G.680],[G.sup39]. As 
   networks grow larger listing all useable paths for each signal type 
   can encounter scaling issues. Instead the viability of most optical 
   paths for a particular class of signals is performed using well 
   defined approximation techniques [G.680], [G.sup39].  

   Much work at ITU-T has gone into developing impairment models at this 
   and more detailed levels. Impairment characterization of network 
   elements could then made available via the control plane and then 
   used to calculate which paths are conformant with a specified BER for 
   a particular signal type. In such a case we have the potential, but 
   not the requirement, to combine the IV process with RWA process to 
   permit more optimal IA-RWA computations. 

   C. Detailed Impairment Estimation 

   This situation is applicable to networks in which impairment effects 
   must be more accurately estimated. This includes evaluation of the 
   impact to any existing paths prior to the addition of a new path. 
   This is currently performed via methods that solve the partial 
   differential equations describing signal propagation in fiber along 
   with more detailed models for the other network elements 
   [Agrawal02],[Agrawal07]. The estimation/simulation time required can 
   be very situation dependent.  

   The implication is that a significant amount of time could be 
   required to "qualify" a path. To increase the probability of passing 
   this validation it is strongly recommended to use approximate 
   impairment information prior to the detailed path validation via 
   simulations. Since the detailed path validation utilizes calculations 
   and techniques that are much different from that of RWA it could be 
   useful to allow the IV process to run on a separate computation

   entity. Hence it can be useful to consider any necessary PCEP 
   extensions required to allow this detailed IV computation to take 
   place on an additional PCE. 

      3.1.2. Impairment Information Sharing Constraints 

   In GMPLS information used in for path computation is shared without 
   constraints amongst the elements participating in the control plane. 
   For optical impairments while this would typically be the case, 
   however it may be the case that some of the information concerning 
   impairments in an optical network is considered private and not to be 
   shared with other vendors control systems. This might occur if 
   proprietary impairment models are used to evaluate paths or a vendor 
   chooses not to publish impairment information for a set of network 
   elements. An example of this is document in "situation 1" of [G.680]. 
   In "situation 1" in [G.680] there is a single WDM line system vendor 
   and multiple vendors of OADMs and PXCs and the impairment information 
   for the line system can be considered "private", while the impairment 
   information for any OADM or PXCs can be considered shared. 

   To maintain the privacy of impairment information and provide for IA-
   RWA we have the following options: 

   A. The vendor who wishes to keep impairment information private can 
      furnish a list of all viable paths between all viable node pairs 
      to a computational entity. This information would be particularly 
      useful as an input to RWA optimization to be performed by another 
      computation entity. The difficulty here is for larger networks 
      such a list of paths along with any wavelength constraints could 
      get unmanageably large. 

   B. The vendor who wishes to keep impairment information private could 
      furnish a PCE like entity that would furnish a list of viable 
      paths/wavelengths between two requested nodes. This is useful as 
      an input to RWA optimizations and can reduce the scaling issue 
      previously mentioned. Such a PCE like entity would not need to 
      perform a full RWA computation, i.e., it would not need to take 
      into account current wavelength availability on links. Such an 
      approach may require PCEP extensions for both the request and 
      response information. 

   C. The vendor who wishes to keep impairment information private can 
      furnish a PCE performs full IA-RWA services. The difficulty is 
      this requires the one vendor to also become the sole source of all 
      RWA optimization algorithms and such.

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   In all the above cases it would be the responsibility of the vendor 
   wishing to keep its information private to import the shared 
   impairment information from the other NEs via the control plane or 
   other means.  

      3.1.3. Impairment Validation Functional Blocks 

   The Impairment Validation process can be modeled by the following 
   functional blocks. These blocks are independent of any Control Plane 
   architecture, that is, they can be implemented by the same or by 
   different control plane functional blocks.

                                              |        ||       | 
                                              |    Estimation   | 
                                              |        ||       | 
                                              |        \/       |

   Starting from functional block on the left the Optical Interface 
   represents where the optical signal is transmitted or received and 
   defines the properties at the end points path. For WSON even the case 
   with no IV has to consider a minimum set of interface 
   characteristics. As an example, the document [G.698.1] reports the 
   full set of those parameters for certain interfaces. In this function 
   only a significant subset of those parameters would be considered. In 
   addition transmit and receive interface might consider a different 
   subset of properties. 

   The block "Optical Path" represents all kinds of impairments 
   affecting a wavelength as it traverses the networks through links and 
   nodes. In the case where the control plane has no IV this block will 
   not be present. Otherwise, this function must be implemented in some

   way via the control plane. Options for this will be given in the next 
   section on control plane architectural alternatives. 

   The last block implements the decision function for path feasibility. 
   Depending on the IV level of approximation this function can be more 
   or less complex. For example in case of no IV only the signal class 
   compatibility will be verified. 

3.2. IA-RWA Computing and Control Plane Architectures 

   From a control plane point of view optical impairments are additional 
   constraints to the impairment-free RWA process described in [WSON-
   Frame]. In impairment aware routing and wavelength assignment (IA-
   RWA), there are conceptually three general classes of processes to be 
   considered: Routing (R), Wavelength Assignment (WA), and Impairment 
   Validation (IV). 

   Impairment validation may come in many forms, and maybe invoked at 
   different levels of detail in the IA-RWA process. From a process 
   point of view we will consider the following three forms of 
   impairment validation: 

  o  IV-Candidates 

   In this case an Impairment Validation (IV) process furnishes a set of 
   paths between two nodes along with any wavelength restrictions such 
   that the paths are valid with respect to optical impairments. These 
   paths and wavelengths may not be actually available in the network 
   due to its current usage state. This set of paths would be returned 
   in response to a request for a set of at most K valid paths between 
   two specified nodes. Note that such a process never directly 
   discloses optical impairment information. 

  o  IV-Detailed Verification 

   In this case an IV process is given a particular path and wavelength 
   through an optical network and is asked to verify whether the overall 
   quality objectives for the signal over this path can be met. Note 
   that such a process never directly discloses optical impairment 
   information.  

  o  IV-Distributed 

   In this distributed IV process impairment approximate degradation 
   measures such as OSNR, dispersion, DGD, etc. are accumulated along 
   the path via a signaling like protocol. When the accumulated measures 
   reach the destination node a decision on the impairment validity of

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   the path can be made. Note that such a process would entail revealing 
   an individual network element's impairment information. 

   The following subsections present three major classes of IA-RWA path 
   computation architectures and their respective advantages and 
   disadvantages. 

      3.2.1. Combined Routing, WA, and IV 

   From the point of view of optimality, the "best" IA-RWA solutions can 
   be achieved if the path computation entity (PCE) can 
   conceptually/algorithmically combine the processes of routing, 
   wavelength assignment and impairment validation. 

   Such a combination can take place if the PCE is given: (a) the 
   impairment-free WSON network information as discussed in [WSON-Frame] 
   and (b) impairment information to validate potential paths.  

      3.2.2. Separate Routing, WA, or IV 

   Separating the processes of routing, WA and/or IV can reduce the need 
   for sharing of different types of information used in path 
   computation. This was discussed for routing separate from WA in 
   [WSON-Frame]. In addition, as will be discussed in the section on 
   network contexts some impairment information may not be shared and 
   this may lead to the need to separate IV from RWA.  In addition, as 
   also discussed in the section on network contexts, if IV needs to be 
   done at a high level of precision it may be advantageous to offload 
   this computation to a specialized server.  

   The following conceptual architectures belong in this general 
   category: 

  o  R+WA+IV -- separate routing, wavelength assignment, and impairment 
     validation. 

  o  R + (WA & IV) -- routing separate from a combined wavelength 
     assignment and impairment validation process. Note that impairment 
     validation is typically wavelength dependent hence combining WA 
     with IV can lead to efficiencies. 

  o  (RWA)+IV - combined routing and wavelength assignment with a 
     separate impairment validation process.  

   Note that the IV process may come before or after the RWA processes. 
   If RWA comes first then IV is just rendering a yes/no decision on the 
   selected path and wavelength. If IV comes first it would need to

   furnish a list of possible (valid with respect to impairments) routes 
   and wavelengths to the RWA processes. 

      3.2.3. Distributed WA and/or IV 

   In the non-impairment RWA situation [WSON-Frame] it was shown that a 
   distributed wavelength assignment (WA) process carried out via 
   signaling can eliminate the need to distribute wavelength 
   availability information via an IGP. A similar approach can allow for 
   the distributed computation of impairment effects and avoid the need 
   to distribute impairment characteristics of network elements and 
   links via route protocols or by other means. An example of such an 
   approach is given in [Martinelli] and utilizes enhancements to RSVP 
   signaling to carry accumulated impairment related information. 

   A distributed impairment validation for a prescribed network path 
   requires that the effects of impairments can be calculated by 
   approximate models with cumulative quality measures such as those in 
   [G.680].  

   For such a system to be interoperable the various impairment measures 
   to be accumulated would need to be agreed upon. Section 9 of [G.680] 
   can be useful in deriving such cumulative measures but doesn't 
   explicitly state how a distributed computation would take place. For 
   example in the computation of the optical signal to noise ratio along 
   a path (see equation 9-3 of [G.680]) one could accumulate the linear 
   sum terms and convert to the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) in 
   (dBs) at the destination or one could convert in and out of the OSNR 
   in (dBs) at each intermediate point along the path. 

   If distributed WA is being done at the same time as distributed IV 
   then we may need to accumulate impairment related information for all 
   wavelengths that could be used. This is somewhat winnowed down as 
   potential wavelengths are discovered to be in use, but could be a 
   significant burden for lightly loaded high channel count networks. 

3.3. Mapping Network Requirements to Architectures 

   In Figure 1 we show process flows for three main architectural 
   alternatives to IA-RWA when approximate impairment validation 
   suffices. In Figure 2 we show process flows for two main 
   architectural alternatives when detailed impairment verification is 
   required.

                        architectural alternatives. 

   The advantages, requirements and suitability of these options are as 
   follows: 

  o  Combined IV & RWA process 

   This alternative combines RWA and IV within a single computation 
   entity enabling highest potential optimality and efficiency in IA-
   RWA. This alternative requires that the computational entity knows 
   impairment information as well as non-impairment RWA information. 
   This alternative can be used when impairment information is required 
   to be kept private, but would then need to be provided by the non-
   sharing vendor. 

  o  IV-Candidates + RWA process 

   This alternative allows separation of impairment information into two 
   computational entities while still maintaining a high degree of 
   potential optimality and efficiency in IA-RWA. The candidates IV 
   process needs to know impairment information from all optical network

   elements, while the RWA process needs to know non-impairment RWA 
   information from the network elements. This alternative can be used 
   when impairment information is required to be kept private, but the 
   non-sharing vendor would need to provide the functionality of the IV-
   candidates process. Note that this is still very useful since the 
   algorithmic areas of IV and RWA are very different and prone to 
   specialization. 

  o  Routing + Distributed WA and IV 

   In this alternative a signaling protocol is extended and leveraged in 
   the wavelength assignment and impairment validation processes. 
   Although this doesn't enable as high a potential degree of optimality 
   of optimality as (a) or (b), it does not require distribution of 
   either link wavelength usage or link/node impairment information. 
   Note that this is most likely not acceptable for keeping impairment 
   information "private".

   validation options are as follows:

   impairment validation. In the case of non-shared impairment 
   information the non-sharing vendor would need to provide all 
   functionality. 

  o  Candidates-IV + RWA + Detailed-IV 

   This alternative allows separation of approximate impairment 
   information into a computational entity while still maintaining a 
   high degree of potential optimality and efficiency in IA-RWA; then a 
   separate computation entity performs detailed impairment validation. 
   In the case of non-shared impairment information the non-sharing 
   vendor would need to provide both the candidates-IV and Detailed-IV 
   processes, but not necessarily the RWA process.  

    

4. Protocol Implications 

   The previous IA-RWA architectural alternatives and process flows make 
   differing demands on a GMPLS/PCE based control plane. In this section 
   we discuss the use of (a) an impairment information model, (b) PCE as 
   computational entity assuming the various process roles and 
   consequences for PCEP, (c)any needed extensions to signaling, and (d) 
   extensions to routing. The impacts to the control plane for IA-RWA 
   are summarized in Figure 3.

4.1. Information Model for Impairments 

   As previously discussed all IA-RWA scenarios to a greater or lesser 
   extent rely on a common impairment information model. A number of 
 
 
Bernstein & Lee       Expires September 4, 2009               [Page 14] 

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   ITU-T recommendations cover detailed as well as approximate 
   impairment characteristics of fibers and a variety of devices and 
   subsystems. A well integrated impairment model for optical network 
   elements is given in [G.680] and is used to form the basis for an 
   optical impairment model in a companion document [Imp-Info]. 

   It should be noted that the current version of [G.680] is limited to 
   the networks composed of a single WDM line system vendor combined 
   with OADMs and/or PXCs from potentially multiple other vendors, this 
   is known as situation 1 and is shown in Figure 1-1 of [G.680]. It is 
   planed in the future that [G.680] will include networks incorporating 
   line systems from multiple vendors as well as OADMs and/or PXCs from 
   potentially multiple other vendors, this is known as situation 2 and 
   is shown in Figure 1-2 of [G.680].  

   The case of distributed impairment validation actually requires a bit 
   more than an impairment information model. In particular, it needs a 
   common impairment "computation" model. In the distributed IV case one 
   needs to standardize the accumulated impairment measures that will be 
   conveyed and updated at each node. Section 9 of [G.680] provides 
   guidance in this area with specific formulas given for OSNR, residual 
   dispersion, polarization mode dispersion/polarization dependent loss, 
   effects of channel uniformity, etc... However, specifics of what 
   intermediate results are kept and in what form would need to be 
   standardized. 

      4.1.1. Properties of an Impairment Information Model 

   In term of information model there are a set of property that needs 
   to be defined for each optical parameters that need to be in some way 
   considered within an impairment aware control plane. 

   The properties will help to determine how the control plane can deal 
   with it depending also on the above control plane architectural 
   options. In some case properties value will help to indentify the 
   level of approximation supported by the IV process. 

  o  Time Dependency. This will identify how the impairment may vary 
     along the time. There could be cases where there's no time 
     dependency, while in other cases there is need of an impairment 
     re-evaluation after a certain time. In some cases a level of 
     approximation will consider an impairment that has time dependency 
     as constant. 




 
 
Bernstein & Lee       Expires September 4, 2009               [Page 15] 

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

  o  Wavelength Dependency. This property will identify if an 
     impairment value can be considered as constant over all the 
     wavelength spectrum of interest or if it has different values. 
     Also in this case a detailed impairment evaluation might lead to 
     consider the exact value while an approximation IV might take a 
     constant value for all wavelengths. 

  o  Linearity. As impairments are representation of physical effects 
     there are some that have a linear behavior while other are non 
     linear. Linear impairments are in general easy to consider while a 
     non linear will require the knowledge of the full path to be 
     evaluated. An approximation level could only consider linear 
     effects or approximate non-linear impairments in linear ones. 

  o  Multi-Channel. There are cases where an impairments take different 
     values depending on the aside wavelengths already in place. In 
     this case a dependency among different LSP is introduced. An 
     approximation level can neglect or not the effects on neighbor 
     LSPs. 

  o  Value range. An impairment that has to be considered by a 
     computational element will needs a representation in bits. So 
     depending on the impairments different types can be considered 
     form integer to real numbers as well as a fixed set of values. 
     This information is important in term of protocol definition and 
     level of approximation introduced by the number representation. 

    

4.2. Routing 

   Different approaches to path/wavelength impairment validation gives 
   rise to different demands placed on GMPLS routing protocols. In the 
   case where approximate impairment information is used to validate 
   paths GMPLS routing may be used to distribute the impairment 
   characteristics of the network elements and links based on the 
   impairment information model previously discussed. In the case of 
   distributed-IV no new demands would be placed on the routing 
   protocol. 

4.3. Signaling 

   The largest impacts on signaling occur in the cases where distributed 
   impairment validation is performed. In this we need to accumulate 
   impairment information as previously discussed. In addition, since 
   the characteristics of the signal itself, such as modulation type, 
   can play a major role in the tolerance of impairments, this type of

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   information will need to be implicitly or explicitly signaled so that 
   an impairment validation decision can be made at the destination 
   node. 

   It remains for further study if it may be beneficial to include 
   additional information to a connection request such as desired egress 
   signal quality (defined in some appropriate sense) in non-distributed 
   IV scenarios.  

4.4. PCE 

   In section 3.3. we gave a number of computation architectural 
   alternatives that could be used to meet the various requirements and 
   constraints of section 3.1.  Here we look at how these alternatives 
   could be implemented via either a single PCE or a set of two or more 
   cooperating PCEs, and the impacts on the PCEP protocol.  

      4.4.1. Combined IV & RWA 

   In this situation, shown in Figure 1(a), a single PCE performs all 
   the computations needed for IA-RWA. 

  o  TE Database Requirements 

     WSON Topology and switching capabilities, WSON WDM link wavelength 
     utilization, and WSON impairment information 

  o  PCC to PCE Request Information 

     Signal characteristics/type, required quality, source node, 
     destination node 

  o  PCE to PCC Reply Information  

     If the computations completed successfully then the PCE returns 
     the path and its assigned wavelength. If the computations could 
     not complete successfully it would be potentially useful to know 
     the reason why. At a very crude level we'd like to know if this 
     was due to lack of wavelength availability or impairment 
     considerations or a bit of both. The information to be conveyed is 
     for further study. 

      4.4.2. IV-Candidates + RWA 

   In this situation, shown in Figure 1(b), we have two separate 
   processes involved in the IA-RWA computation. This requires at least 
   two cooperating PCEs: one for the Candidates-IV process and another 
 
 
Bernstein & Lee       Expires September 4, 2009               [Page 17] 

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   for the RWA process. In addition, the overall process needs to be 
   coordinated. This could be done with yet another PCE or we can add 
   this functionality to one of previously defined PCEs. We choose this 
   later option and require the RWA PCE to also act as the overall 
   process coordinator. The roles, responsibilities and information 
   requirements for these two PCEs are given below. 

   RWA and Coordinator PCE (RWA-Coord-PCE): 

   Responsible for interacting with PCC and for utilizing Candidates-PCE 
   as needed during RWA computations. In particular it needs to know to 
   use the Candidates-PCE to obtain potential set of routes and 
   wavelengths. 

  o  TE Database Requirements 

     WSON Topology and switching capabilities and WSON WDM link 
     wavelength utilization (no impairment information). 

  o  PCC to RWA-PCE request: same as in the combined case. 

  o  RWA-PCE to PCC reply: same as in the combined case. 

  o  RWA-PCE to IV-Candidates-PCE request 

     The RWA-PCE asks for a set of at most K routes along with 
     acceptable wavelengths between nodes specified in the original PCC 
     request. 

  o  IV-Candidates-PCE reply to RWA-PCE 

     The Candidates-PCE returns a set of at most K routes along with 
     acceptable wavelengths between nodes specified in the RWA-PCE 
     request. 

  IV-Candidates-PCE: 

     The IV-Candidates-PCE is responsible for impairment aware path 
     computation. It needs not take into account current link 
     wavelength utilization, but this is not prohibited. The 
     Candidates-PCE is only required to interact with the RWA-PCE as 
     indicated above and not the PCC. 

  o  TE Database Requirements 

     WSON Topology and switching capabilities and WSON impairment 
     information (no information link wavelength utilization required).

   In step (a) the PCC requests a path meeting specified quality 
   constraints between two nodes (A and Z) for a given signal 
   represented either by a specific type or a general class with 
   associated parameters. In step (b) the RWA-Coordinating-PCE requests 
   up to K candidate paths between nodes A and Z and associated 
   acceptable wavelengths. In step (c) The IV-Candidates-PCE returns 
   this list to the RWA-Coordinating PCE which then uses this set of 
   paths and wavelengths as input (e.g. a constraint) to its RWA 
   computation. In step (d) the RWA-Coordinating-PCE returns the overall 
   IA-RWA computation results to the PCC. 

      4.4.3. Approximate IA-RWA + Separate Detailed IV 

   In Figure 2 we showed two cases where a separate detailed impairment 
   validation process could be utilized. We can place the detailed 
   validation process into a separate PCE. Assuming that a different PCE

   assumes a coordinating role and interacts with the PCC we can keep 
   the interactions with this separate IV-Detailed-PCE very simple. 

   IV-Detailed-PCE: 

  o  TE Database Requirements 

     The IV-Detailed-PCE will need optical impairment information, WSON 
     topology, and possibly WDM link wavelength usage information. This 
     document puts no restrictions on the type of information that may 
     be used in these computations.  

  o  Coordinating-PCE to IV-Detailed-PCE request 

     The coordinating-PCE will furnish signal characteristics, quality 
     requirements, path and wavelength to the IV-Detailed-PCE. 

  o  IV-Detailed-PCE to Coordinating-PCE reply 

     The reply is essential an yes/no decision as to whether the 
     requirements could actually be met. In the case where the 
     impairment validation fails it would be helpful to convey 
     information related to cause or quantify the failure, e.g., so a 
     judgment can be made whether to try a different signal or adjust 
     signal parameters. 

   In Figure 5 we show a sequence diagram for the interactions for the 
   process shown in Figure 2(b). This involves interactions between the 
   PCC, RWA-PCE (acting as coordinator), IV-Candidates-PCE and the IV-
   Detailed-PCE. 

   In step (a) the PCC requests a path meeting specified quality 
   constraints between two nodes (A and Z) for a given signal 
   represented either by a specific type or a general class with 
   associated parameters. In step (b) the RWA-Coordinating-PCE requests 
   up to K candidate paths between nodes A and Z and associated 
   acceptable wavelengths. In step (c) The IV-Candidates-PCE returns 
   this list to the RWA-Coordinating PCE which then uses this set of 
   paths and wavelengths as input (e.g. a constraint) to its RWA 
   computation. In step (d) the RWA-Coordinating-PCE request a detailed 
   verification of the path and wavelength that it has computed. In step 
   (e) the IV-Detailed-PCE returns the results of the validation to the 
   RWA-Coordinating-PCE. Finally in step (f)IA-RWA-Coordinating PCE 
   returns the final results (either a path and wavelength or cause for 
   the failure to compute a path and wavelength) to the PCC.

   This document discusses a number of control plane architectures that 
   incorporate knowledge of impairments in optical networks. If such 
   architecture is put into use within a network it will by its nature 
   contain details of the physical characteristics of an optical 
   network. Such information would need to be protected from intentional 
   or unintentional disclosure.

APPENDIX A: Overview of Optical Layer ITU-T Recommendations 

   For optical fiber, devices, subsystems and network elements the ITU-T 
   has a variety of recommendations that include definitions, 
   characterization parameters and test methods. In the following we 
   take a bottom up survey to emphasize the breadth and depth of the 
   existing recommendations.  We focus on digital communications over 
   single mode optical fiber. 

A.1. Fiber and Cables 

   Fibers and cables form a key component of what from the control plane 
   perspective could be termed an optical link. Due to the wide range of 
   uses of optical networks a fairly wide range of fiber types are used 
   in practice. The ITU-T has three main recommendations covering the 
   definition of attributes and test methods for single mode fiber: 

  o  Definitions and test methods for linear, deterministic attributes 
     of single-mode fibre and cable  [G.650.1] 

  o  Definitions and test methods for statistical and non-linear 
     related attributes of single-mode fibre and cable [G.650.2] 

  o  Test methods for installed single-mode fibre cable sections 
     [G.650.3] 

   General Definitions[G.650.1]: Mechanical Characteristics (numerous), 
   Mode field characteristics(mode field, mode field diameter, mode 
   field centre, mode field concentricity error, mode field non-
   circularity), Glass geometry characteristics, Chromatic dispersion 
   definitions (chromatic dispersion, group delay, chromatic dispersion 
   coefficient, chromatic dispersion slope, zero-dispersion wavelength, 
   zero-dispersion slope), cut-off wavelength, attenuation. Definition 
   of equations and fitting coefficients for chromatic dispersion (Annex 
   A). [G.650.2] polarization mode dispersion (PMD) - phenomenon of PMD, 
   principal states of polarization (PSP), differential group delay 
   (DGD), PMD value, PMD coefficient, random mode coupling, negligible 
   mode coupling, mathematical definitions in terms of Stokes or Jones 
   vectors. Nonlinear attributes: Effective area, correction factor k, 
   non-linear coefficient (refractive index dependent on intensity), 
   Stimulated Billouin scattering. 

   Tests defined [G.650.1]: Mode field diameter, cladding diameter, core 
   concentricity error, cut-off wavelength, attenuation, chromatic 
   dispersion. [G.650.2]: test methods for polarization mode dispersion. 
   [G.650.3] Test methods for characteristics of fibre cable sections 
   following installation: attenuation, splice loss, splice location,

   fibre uniformity and length of cable sections (these are OTDR based), 
   PMD, Chromatic dispersion. 

     

   With these definitions a variety of single mode fiber types are 
   defined as shown in the table below: 

      ITU-T Standard |  Common Name  
      ------------------------------------------------------------     
      G.652 [G.652]  |  Standard SMF                              | 
      G.653 [G.653]  |  Dispersion shifted SMF                    | 
      G.654 [G.654]  |  Cut-off shifted SMF                       | 
      G.655 [G.655]  |  Non-zero dispersion shifted SMF           | 
      G.656 [G.656]  |  Wideband non-zero dispersion shifted SMF  |

A.2. Devices 

A.2.1. Optical Amplifiers 

   Optical amplifiers greatly extend the transmission distance of 
   optical signals in both single channel and multi channel (WDM) 
   subsystems. The ITU-T has the following recommendations:  

  o  Definition and test methods for the relevant generic parameters of 
     optical amplifier devices and subsystems [G.661] 

  o  Generic characteristics of optical amplifier devices and 
     subsystems [G.662] 

  o  Application related aspects of optical amplifier devices and 
     subsystems [G.663] 

  o  Generic characteristics of Raman amplifiers and Raman amplified 
     subsystems [G.665] 

   Reference [G.661] starts with general classifications of optical 
   amplifiers based on technology and usage, and include a near 
   exhaustive list of over 60 definitions for optical amplifier device 
   attributes and parameters. In references [G.662] and [G.665] we have 
   characterization of specific devices, e.g., semiconductor optical 
   amplifier, used in a particular setting, e.g., line amplifier. For 
   example reference[G.662] gives the following minimum list of relevant 
   parameters for the specification of an optical amplifier device used 
   as line amplifier in a multichannel application:

   a) Channel allocation. 

   b) Total input power range. 

   c) Channel input power range. 

   d) Channel output power range. 

   e) Channel signal-spontaneous noise figure. 

   f) Input reflectance. 

   g) Output reflectance. 

   h) Maximum reflectance tolerable at input. 

   i) Maximum reflectance tolerable at output. 

   j) Maximum total output power. 

   k) Channel addition/removal (steady-state) gain response. 

   l) Channel addition/removal (transient) gain response. 

   m) Channel gain. 

   n) Multichannel gain variation (inter-channel gain difference). 

   o) Multichannel gain-change difference (inter-channel gain-change 
   difference). 

   p) Multichannel gain tilt (inter-channel gain-change ratio). 

   q) Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD).  

    

A.2.2. Dispersion Compensation 

   In optical systems two forms of dispersion are commonly encountered 
   [RFC4054] chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion 
   (PMD). There are a number of techniques and devices used for 
   compensating for these effects. The following ITU-T recommendations 
   characterize such devices: 

  o  Characteristics of PMD compensators and PMD compensating receivers 
     [G.666] 
 
 
Bernstein & Lee       Expires September 4, 2009               [Page 24] 

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

  o  Characteristics of Adaptive Chromatic Dispersion Compensators  
     [G.667] 

   The above furnish definitions as well as parameters and 
   characteristics. For example in [G.667] adaptive chromatic dispersion 
   compensators are classified as being receiver, transmitter or line 
   based, while in [G.666] PMD compensators are only defined for line 
   and receiver configurations. Parameters that are common to both PMD 
   and chromatic dispersion compensators include: line fiber type, 
   maximum and minimum input power, maximum and minimum bit rate, and 
   modulation type. In addition there are a great many parameters that 
   apply to each type of device and configuration. 

A.2.3.  Optical Transmitters 

   The definitions of the characteristics of optical transmitters can be 
   found in references [G.957], [G.691], [G.692] and [G.959.1]. In 
   addition references [G.957], [G.691], and [G.959.1] define specific 
   parameter values or parameter ranges for these characteristics for 
   interfaces for use in particular situations. 

   We generally have the following types of parameters 

   Wavelength related: Central frequency, Channel spacing, Central 
   frequency deviation[G.692].  

   Spectral characteristics of the transmitter: Nominal source type 
   (LED, MLM lasers, SLM lasers) [G.957], Maximum spectral width, Chirp 
   parameter, Side mode suppression ratio, Maximum spectral power 
   density [G.691]. 

   Power related: Mean launched power, Extinction ration, Eye pattern 
   mask [G.691], Maximum and minimum mean channel output power 
   [G.959.1]. 

A.2.4. Optical Receivers 

   References [G.959.1], [G.691], [G.692] and [G.957], define optical 
   receiver characteristics and [G.959.1], [G.691] and [G.957]give 
   specific values of these parameters for particular interface types 
   and network contexts. 

   The receiver parameters include: 

   Receiver sensitivity: minimum value of average received power to 
   achieve a 1x10-10 BER [G.957] or 1x10-12 BER [G.691]. See [G.957] and 
   [G.691] for assumptions on signal condition.

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   Receiver overload: Receiver overload is the maximum acceptable value 
   of the received average power for a 1x10.10 BER [G.957] or a 1x10-12 
   BER [G.691]. 

   Receiver reflectance: "Reflections from the receiver back to the 
   cable plant are specified by the maximum permissible reflectance of 
   the receiver measured at reference point R." 

   Optical path power penalty: "The receiver is required to tolerate an 
   optical path penalty not exceeding X dB to account for total 
   degradations due to reflections, intersymbol interference, mode 
   partition noise, and laser chirp." 

   When dealing with multi-channel systems or systems with optical 
   amplifiers we may also need: 

   Optical signal-to-noise ratio: "The minimum value of optical SNR 
   required to obtain a 1x10-12 BER."[G.692] 

   Receiver wavelength range: "The receiver wavelength range is defined 
   as the acceptable range of wavelengths at point Rn. This range must 
   be wide enough to cover the entire range of central frequencies over 
   the OA passband." [G.692] 

   Minimum equivalent sensitivity: "This is the minimum sensitivity that 
   would be required of a receiver placed at MPI-RM in multichannel 
   applications to achieve the specified maximum BER of the application 
   code if all except one of the channels were to be removed (with an 
   ideal loss-less filter) at point MPI-RM." [G.959.1] 

A.3. Components and Subsystems  

   Reference [G.671] "Transmission characteristics of optical components 
   and subsystems" covers the following components: 

  o  optical add drop multiplexer (OADM) subsystem; 

  o  asymmetric branching component; 

  o  optical attenuator; 

  o  optical branching component (wavelength non-selective); 

  o  optical connector; 

  o  dynamic channel equalizer (DCE);

  o  optical filter; 

  o  optical isolator; 

  o  passive dispersion compensator; 

  o  optical splice; 

  o  optical switch; 

  o  optical termination; 

  o  tuneable filter; 

  o  optical wavelength multiplexer (MUX)/demultiplexer (DMUX); 

       - coarse WDM device; 

       - dense WDM device; 

       - wide WDM device.   

   Reference [G.671] then specifies applicable parameters for these 
   components. For example an OADM subsystem will have parameters such 
   as: insertion loss (input to output, input to drop, add to output), 
   number of add, drop and through channels, polarization dependent 
   loss, adjacent channel isolation, allowable input power, polarization 
   mode dispersion, etc... 

A.4. Network Elements 

   The previously cited ITU-T recommendations provide a plethora of 
   definitions and characterizations of optical fiber, devices, 
   components and subsystems. Reference [G.Sup39] "Optical system design 
   and engineering considerations" provides useful guidance on the use 
   of such parameters. 

   In many situations the previous models while good don't encompass the 
   higher level network structures that one typically deals with in the 
   control plane, i.e, "links" and "nodes". In addition such models 
   include the full range of network applications from planning, 
   installation, and possibly day to day network operations, while with 
   the control plane we are generally concerned with a subset of the 
   later. In particular for many control plane applications we are 
   interested in formulating the total degradation to an optical signal 
   as it travels through multiple optical subsystems, devices and fiber 
   segments.

Internet-Draft   Framework for Networks with Impairments      March 2009 
    

   In reference [G.680] "Physical transfer functions of optical networks 
   elements", a degradation function is currently defined for the 
   following optical network elements: (a) DWDM Line segment, (b) 
   Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADM), and (c) Photonic cross-connect 
   (PXC). The scope of [G.680] is currently for optical networks 
   consisting of one vendors DWDM line systems along with another 
   vendors OADMs or PXCs. 

   The DWDM line system of [G.680] consists of the optical fiber, line 
   amplifiers and any embedded dispersion compensators. Similarly the 
   OADM/PXC network element may consist of the basic OADM component and 
   optionally included optical amplifiers. The parameters for these 
   optical network elements (ONE) are given under the following 
   circumstances: 

  o  General ONE without optical amplifiers 

  o  General ONE with optical amplifiers 

  o  OADM without optical amplifiers 

  o  OADM with optical amplifiers 

  o  Reconfigurable OADM (ROADM) without optical amplifiers 

  o  ROADM with optical amplifiers 

  o  PXC without optical amplifiers 

  o  PXC with optical amplifiers
