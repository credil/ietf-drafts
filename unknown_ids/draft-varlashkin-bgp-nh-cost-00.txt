1.  Motivation

   In certain situation route-reflector clients may not get optimum path
   to certain destinations.  ADDPATH solves this problem by letting
   route-reflector to advertise multiple paths for given prefix.  If
   number of advertised paths sufficiently big, route-reflector clients
   can choose same route as they would in case of full-mesh.  This
   approach however places additional burden on the control plane.
   Solutions proposed by [BGP-ORR] use different approach - instead of
   calculating best path from local speaker own perspective the
   calculations are done using cost from the client to the next-hops.
   Although they eliminate need for transmitting redundant routing
   information between peers, there are scenarios where cost to the
   next-hop cannot be obtained accurately using this methods.  For
   example, if next-hop information itself has been learned via BGP then
   simple SPF run on link-state database won't be sufficient to obtain
   cost information.  To address such scenarios this document proposes a
   solution where cost information to the next-hops is carried within
   BGP itself using dedicated SAFI.


2.  NEXT-HOP INFORMATION BASE

   To facilitate further description of the proposed solution we
   introduce new table for all known next hops and costs to it from
   various routers on the network.

   Next-Hop Information Base (NHIB) stores cost to reach next-hop from
   arbitrary router on the network.  This information is essential for
   choosing best path from a peer perspective rather than BGP-speaker
   own perspective.  In canonical form NHIB entry is triplet (router,
   next-hop, cost), however this specification does not impose any
   restriction on how BGP implementations store that information
   internally.  The cost in NHIB is does not have to be an IGP cost, but
   all costs in NHIB MUST be comparable with each other.

   NHIB can be populated from various sources both static and dynamic.
   This document focuses on populating NHIB using BGP.  However it is
   possible that protocols other than BGP could be also used to populate
   NHIB.


3.  BGP BEST PATH SELECTION MODIFICATION

   This section applies regardless of method used to populate NHIB.

   When BGP speaker conforming to this specification selects routes to
   be advertised to a peer it SHOULD use cost information from NHIB

   rather than its own IGP cost to the next-hop after step (d) of
   9.1.2.2 in [RFC4271].


4.  USING BGP TO POPULATE NHIB

   This section describes extension to base BGP specification that
   allows BGP to be used for exchanging next-hop information between BGP
   speakers via new SAFI in order to populate NHIB.  Although next-hops
   costs are exchanged via dedicated SAFI, this information is vital to
   best path selection process for other AFI/SAFI (e.g.  IPv4 and IPv6
   unicast).  It's therefore recommended that next-hop cost information
   is exchanged before other AFI/SAFI.

4.1.  NEXT-HOP SAFI

   This document introduces Next-Hop SAFI (NH SAFI) with value to be
   assigned by IANA and purpose of exchanging information about cost to
   next-hops.

4.2.  CAPABILITY ADVERTISEMENT

   A BGP speaker willing to exchange next-hop information MUST advertise
   this in the OPEN message using BGP Capability Code 1 (Multiprotocol
   Extensions, see [RFC4760]) setting AFI appropriately to indicate IPv4
   or IPv6 and SAFI to the value assigned by IANA for NH SAFI.  Note
   that if BGP speaker whishes to exchange cost information for both
   IPv4 and IPv6, then it MUST advertise two capabilities: one NH SAFI
   for IPv4 and one NH SAFI for IPv6.

4.3.  INFORMATION ENCODING

   To request cost to a next-hop from peer or to inform peer about cost
   to a next-hop BGP attribute 14 is used as follow:

   1.  AFI is set to indicate IPv4 or IPv6 (whichever is appropriate)

   2.  SAFI is set to NH SAFI

   3.  Network Address of Next-Hop field is zeroed out

   4.  NLRI field is encoded as shown in the next figure

    +-------------+------------+
    |  NEXT_HOP   |     cost   |
    +-------------+------------+

   Where cost is 32-bit unsigned integer (value described below), and

Internet-Draft        draft-varalshkin-bgp-nh-cost          January 2011


   NEXT_HOP is AFI-specific address of the next-hop cost to which is
   being communicated or requested.  Size of NEXT_HOP field is inferred
   from total length of attribute 14.

   To request cost to arbitrary next-hop from a peer, BGP speaker sets
   cost field to zero.

   To inform peer about cost to a next-hop BGP speaker sets cost to
   actual cost value.

   To inform peer that a next-hop is not reachable the cost is set to
   all-ones (0xFFFFFFFF).

4.4.  SESSION ESTABLISHMENT

   BGP speakers willing to exchange next-hop information SHOULD NOT
   establish more then one session for given AFI and NH SAFI, even using
   different transport addresses.  This can be ensured for example by
   checking peer's Router Id.

4.5.  INFORMATION EXCHANGE

   Typically NH SAFI sessions will be established between route-
   reflectors and its internal peers (both clients and non-clients).  As
   soon as the NH SAFI session is ESTABLISHED requests for next-hop cost
   and information information about next-hop costs MAY be sent
   independently.  That is, route-reflector MAY send multiple requests
   without waiting for response, and its peers MAY send cost information
   before or after receiving such request.  On the other hand, Router
   Reflectors SHOULD request cost information from their internal peers
   as soon as possible (due to reasons stated in section "BGP best path
   selection modification").  BGP speaker does not need to track
   outstanding requests to the peer.

   When a BGP speaker receives request for cost information it MUST
   reply with actual cost (not necessarily IGP cost, but whatever has
   been chosen to be carried in NH SAFI) to given next-hop or with cost
   set to all-ones indicating that next-hop is unreachable.

   Note that BGP speaker MUST use longest match rather than exact match
   for the next-hop.

   When a BGP speaker detects change in cost to previously advertised
   next-hop with delta equal or exceeding configured advertisement
   threshold, it SHOULD inform peer by advertising new cost or
   0xFFFFFFFF.

   When a BGP speaker discovers new next-hop among candidate routes it

Internet-Draft        draft-varalshkin-bgp-nh-cost          January 2011


   SHOULD request cost information from the peer.

4.6.  TERMINATION OF NH SAFI SESSION

   When BGP speaker terminates (for whatever reason) NH SAFI session
   with a peer, it SHOULD remove all cost information received from that
   peer unless instructed by configuration to do otherwise.

4.7.  GRACEFUL RESTART AND ROUTE REFRESH

   NH SAFI sessions could use graceful restart and route refresh
   mechanisms in the same way as it's used for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast.


5.  Security considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate value for Next-Hop Subsequent Address
   Family Identifier.

Appendix A.  Corner case


      --+---NetA--+--
        |         |
   RR---R1        R2
          \      /
           R3---R4
   In the above network cost from R3 to R1 is 10, all other costs are 1.
   If RR advertises NetA to R3 based on cost information received from
   R3, but uses its own cost when advertising NetA to R4, there will be
   a loop formed.  This is the reason why section "BGP best path
   selection modification" requires RR to have next-hop cost information
   for every next-hop and every peer.

   Note that the problem is the same as if RR would not use extensions
   described in this document and R3 would peer directly with R1 and R2,
   while R4 would peer only with RR.
