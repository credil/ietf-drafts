2.  Introduction

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971] (SEND) utilizes X.509v3
   certificates that include the [RFC3779] extension for IPv6 addresses
   to certify a router's authorization to advertise IPv6 prefix for the
   Neighbor Discovery (ND) Protocol.  The SEND specification defines a
   basic certificate profile for SEND.  The certificate profile defined
   in this document supercedes the profile for router certificates
   specified in [RFC3971].  That is, certificates used in SEND (by
   routers, proxies, or address owners) MUST conform to this certificate
   profile and MAY conform to the original profile in [RFC3971].

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is the global PKI that
   attests to allocation of IP address space.  The RPKI represents the
   centralized model referred in Section 6.2 of [RFC3971].
   Consequently, SEND will use the RPKI certificate profile and
   certificate validation detailed in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].  A
   consequence of the use of RPKI certificate profile, the certificate
   validation method described in RFC3971 is updated with the
   certificate validation method in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

   Since the RFC 3779 IPv6 addresses extension does not mention what
   functions the node can perform for the certified IPv6 space, it
   becomes impossible to know the reason for which the certificate was
   issued.  In order to facilitate issuance of certificates for specific
   functions, it is necessary to utilize the ExtKeyUsageSyntax field
   (optional in RPKI Certificates) of the X.509 certificate to mention
   the purpose why the certificate was issued.  This document specifies
   three extended key usage values, one for routers, one for proxies,
   and one for address owners, for use with SEND.

   In RFC 3971 two deployment models were described: centralized and
   decentralized.  This document describes the different deployment
   models that can be used with the SEND certificates defined here.

4.  SEND Certificate profile

   SEND certificates MUST comply with the RPKI resource profile
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].  A Router Authorization Certificate
   example is included in the Appendix A.

   In sections 2, 4.9.10 and 4.9.11 [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] it is
   stated that RFC 3779 resource extensions MUST be critical and MUST be
   present in all Resource Certificates.  SEND certificates MUST include
   the IP Resources extension [RFC3779].  This extension MUST include at
   least one address block for the IPv6 Address Family (AFI=0002), as
   described in Section 4.9.10 of [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].  SEND
   certificates MUST NOT have more than one IP Resources extension.

4.1.  Unconstrained Certified subnet prefixes

   Section 7.3 of [RFC3971] defines the Unconstrained Certified subnet
   prefixes category by using certificates containing either the null
   prefix or no prefix extension at all.

   When using RPKI certificate profile, prefix extensions are mandatory
   and the null prefix MUST be validated.  However, a certificate may
   inherit its parent's prefix or range by using the "inherit" element
   for IPv6 AFI as defined in RFC3779.  The use of the "inherit" element
   is permited in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

   Consequently, this document updates section 7.3 of RFC 3971 adding
   the following text under Unconstrained:

   Network operators that do not want to constrain routers to route
   particular subnet prefixes but rather inherit them from its parent
   certificate, should configure routers with certificates containing
   the "inherit" element for IPv6 AFI.

5.  Deployment Models

   RFC 3971 describes two deployment models:centralized and
   decentralized.  These models were differentiated by having one or
   many trust anchor.  In this document we introduce two new deployment
   models, not based on the number of trust anchors but on the
   localization of the SEND deployment.

   The local SEND deployment model represent those cases where SEND
   deployment is confined to an administrative domain.  In this
   scenario, the deployment of SEND MAY be done independently of the
   existence of deployment in the upper RPKI hierarchy (i.e. an end user
   could perform local SEND deployment without the need of RPKI
   deployment in its ISP).  This model requires the use of local trust
   anchors and configuring islands of trust.  This model MAY include
   Unique Local Addresses(ULAs) [RFC4193].

   The public SEND deployment models represent those cases where SEND
   deployment is linked to RPKI deployment as described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch].  Trust anchor material MAY be part of a
   different administrative domain (i.e.  RIR, NIR or ISPs).  It is a
   global model suitable for mobile users.

   These two models are not mutually exclusive.  It is entirely possible
   to have a hybrid model that incorporates features from both these
   models.  In one such hybrid deployment model most IP address
   resources (e.g. global unicast addresses) would be certified under
   the global RPKI, while some others (e.g., ULAs) are certified under
   local TAs.

Internet-Draft   SEND certificate profile and management       June 2010


6.  Trust Anchor Material

   Relying parties (e.g., end hosts that implement SEND and process
   these router certificates) MUST be configured with one or more trust
   anchors to enable validation of the routers' certificates.  Section
   6.5 of RFC 3971 lists the trust anchor configurations for end hosts
   using SEND.

   In the local SEND deployment model, it is possible to use as trust
   anchor a certificate that includes in its RFC 3779 address extension
   the prefix ::/0.  In this case no new trust anchor material would be
   needed when renumbering.  However, if trying to move from the local
   deployment model to the public deployment model, new trust anchor
   material will have to be distributed to relying parties.

   [I-D.ietf-sidr-ta] describes a scenario where relying parties use as
   trust anchor material ETA (External Trust Anchor) certificates, which
   do not list any address space.  This configuration allows network
   renumbering without the need for distributing new trust anchor
   material in both the local and the public model.

   This document updates Section 6.5 of RFC3971, where the following
   paragraph should be added:

   An end host MAY use as trust anchor material ETA certificates as
   described in [I-D.ietf-sidr-ta].  In this case, the end host MUST
   obtain the correspondent RTA (RPKI Trust Anchor) certificates from
   the ETA repository in order to complete the Name Type Field of the
   ICMP Trust Anchor Option, which MUST always refer to a trust anchor
   certificate that validates Section 9.

7.  Extended Key Usage Values

   The Internet PKI document [RFC5280] specifies the extended key usage
   X.509 certificate extension.  The extension indicates one or more
   purposes for which the certified public key may be used.  The
   extended key usage extension can be used in conjunction with key
   usage extension, which indicates the intended purpose of the
   certified public key.  The Extended Key Usage extension is defined as
   optional in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] for end entity certificates but
   MUST be present when issuing end entity certificates for SEND.

   The extended key usage extension syntax is repeated here for
   convenience:

     ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

     KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   This specification defines three KeyPurposeId values: one for
   authorizing routers, one for authorizing proxies, and one for address
   owners.

   The inclusion of the router authorization value indicates that the
   certificate has been issued for allowing the router to advertise
   prefix(es) that are mentioned using the X.509 extensions for IP
   addresses and AS identifiers [RFC3779]

   The inclusion of the proxy authorization value indicates that the
   certificate has been issued for allowing the proxy to perform
   proxying of neighbor discovery messages for the prefix(es) that are
   mentioned using the X.509 extensions for IP addresses and AS
   identifiers [RFC3779]

   The inclusion of the owner authorization value indicates that the
   certificate has been issued for allowing the node to use the
   address(es) or prefix(es) that are mentioned using the X.509
   extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers [RFC3779].  For an
   address in such certificate the host can assign the address, send/
   receive traffic from this address, and can respond to NSes about that
   address.  For a prefix in such certificate the node can perform all
   the above mentioned operations for any address in that prefix.  Also,
   when a prefix is present in the certificate with the owner
   authorization value, the node cannot advertise the prefix in an RA.

   Inclusion of multiple values indicates that the certified public key
   is appropriate for use by a node performing more than one of these
   functions.

     send-kp OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
       { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
         security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) kp(3) }

     id-kp-sendRouter OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 23 }

     id-kp-sendProxy OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 24 }

     id-kp-sendOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 25 }

   As described in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs], the extended key usage
   extension, if present, MUST be non-critical.

   Relying Parties MUST require the extended key usage extension to be
   present in a certificate, and they MAY require a particular
   KeyPurposeId value to be present (such as id-kp-sendRouter or id-kp-
   sendProxy) within the extended key usage extension.  If multiple
   KeyPurposeId values are included, the relying parties need not
   recognize all of them, as long as the required KeyPurposeId value is
   present.Relying parties MUST reject certificates that do not contain
   one of the three KeyPurposeIds defined above even if they include the
   anyExtendedKeyUsage OID defined in [RFC5280].

8.  CRL profile and revocation

   RPKI requires the use of CRLs [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].The host will
   obtain the necessary CRLs and perform the certificate validation
   method described in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

8.1.  OCSP Considerations

   By adopting the [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] as the certificate profile
   for SEND, the use of the OCSP protocol is not allowed by the RPKI
   Certicate Policies [I-D.ietf-sidr-cp].  As CRLs are expected to be
   small, the fetching of the required CRLs are not expected to demand
   important bandwidth.

9.  Certificate validation

   This section updates section 6.3.1 of [RFC3971] by introducing new
   validations without introducing any conflict.

   The host MUST perform the certificate validation method described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

   The validation of certificates that uses the "inherit" element is
   describe in RFC 3779 where the existance of a parent prefix or range
   is required.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes use of object identifiers to identify Extended
   Key Usages (EKUs) and the ASN.1 module found in Appendix B.  The EKUs
   and ASN.1 module OID are registered in an arc delegated by IANA to
   the PKIX Working Group.  No further action by IANA is necessary for
   this document.

11.  Security Considerations

   The certification authority needs to ensure that the correct values
   for the extended key usage are inserted in each certificate that is
   issued.  Relying parties may accept or reject a particular
   certificate for an intended use based on the information provided in
   these extensions.  Incorrect representation of the information in the
   extended key usage field can cause the relying party to reject an
   otherwise appropriate certificate or accept a certificate that ought
   to be rejected.  In particular, since a SEND certificate attests that
   its subject is authorized to play a given role in the SEND protocol,
   certificates that contain incorrect EKU values can enable some of the
   same attacks that SEND was meant to prevent.  For example, if a
   malicious host can obtain a certificate that authorizes it to act as
   a router for a given prefix, then it can masquerade as a router for
   that prefix, e.g., in order to attract traffic from local nodes.
