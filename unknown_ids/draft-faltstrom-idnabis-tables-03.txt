Internet-Draft             Unicode Codepoints              November 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4690 [RFC4690] suggests an inclusion based approach for selecting
   the codepoints from The Unicode Standard [Unicode5] that should be
   included in the list of codepoints that may be used in
   Internationalized Domain Names.

   Specifically, RFC 4690 [RFC4690] says the following:

      The IAB has concluded that there is a consensus within the broader
      community that lists of code points should be specified by the use
      of an inclusion-based mechanism (i.e., identifying the characters
      that are permitted), rather than by excluding a small number of
      characters from the total Unicode set as Stringprep [RFC3454] and
      Nameprep [RFC3491] do today.  That conclusion should be reviewed
      by the IETF community and action taken as appropriate.

   This document reviews and classifies the collections of codepoints in
   the Unicode character set by examining various properties of the
   codepoints.  It then defines an algorithm for determining a derived
   property value.  It specifies a procedure and not a table of
   codepoints so that the algorithm can be used to determine code point
   sets independent of the version of Unicode that is in use.

   This document is not intended to specify precisely how these property
   values are to be applied in IDN labels.  That information appears in
   [IDNA200X-protocol], but it is important to understand that the
   assignment of a value of this property to a particular character is
   not sufficient to determine whether it can be used in a given label.
   In particular, some combinations of allowed codepoints are not
   advisable for use in IDNs due to rules specific to a script or class
   of characters.  The requirement for such rules is linked to the
   "CONTEXT" property value described below; the rules are described in
   other documents.

   The value of the property is to be interpreted approximately as
   follows.

   o  ALWAYS: Those that should clearly be included in IDNs.  Codepoints
      with this property value are permitted for general use in IDNs.
      Once assigned to this category, a character is never removed from
      it unless it is removed from Unicode.
   o  MAYBE YES: These characters have not yet been completely
      classified, possibly because further information is needed about
      permitted context.  The categories to which they belong generally
      predict that they will be acceptable.  Over time, characters may
      be reclassified from this category to others.

Internet-Draft             Unicode Codepoints              November 2007


   o  MAYBE NOT: These characters have not yet been completely
      classified, possibly because further information is needed about
      permitted context.  The categories to which they belong generally
      predict that they not be acceptable.  Over time, characters may be
      reclassified from this category to others.
   o  CONTEXT: (Contextual Rule Required) Some characteristic of the
      character, such as it being invisible in certain contexts or
      problematic in others, requires that it not be used in labels
      unless specific other characters or properties are present.  So
      the character must not be used unless an appropriate rule has been
      established and the context of the character is consistent with
      that rule.
   o  NEVER: Those that should clearly not be included in IDNs.
      Codepoints with this property value will never be permitted in
      IDNs.  Once a codepoint is assigned to this category, it is never
      removed or reclassified.
   o  UNASSIGNED: Those codepoints that are unassigned in the Unicode
      Standard.

   The category name MAYBE can be used for the union of the categories
   MAYBE YES and MAYBE NO.

   There is a need for more than two categories because there are
   complex trade offs involved.  In many cases, there is just not
   sufficient information available at present, especially with regard
   to considerations of appropriateness of use of the character in IDNs
   that are not related to formal Unicode character properties.  The
   (non-normative) table in Appendix A is derived from data in Unicode
   5.0, rather than the earlier Unicode 3.2; this in order to take
   advantage of the expanded character repertoire and better definitions
   in the newer version.  The mechanisms described here allow
   determination of the value of the property for future versions of
   Unicode (including characters added after Unicode 5.0).  It should be
   suitable for newer revisions of Unicode, as long as the Unicode
   properties on which it is based remain stable.

   Some codepoints need to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, but
   should be excluded in all other cases; these rules are also described
   in other documents.  The most notable of these are the ZERO WIDTH
   JOINER (U+200D) and ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (U+200C).  Both of them
   have the derived property value CONTEXT.  It is invalid to either
   register a string containing these characters or even to look one up
   unless the rule is found and satisfied.

   This document is part of a series that, together, constitute a
   preliminary proposal for updating the IDNA standards to resolve
   issues uncovered in recent years, cover a broader range of scripts,
   and provide for migration to newer versions of Unicode.  See

   [IDNA200X-issues] for a broader discussion.


2.  Category definitions Used to Calculate Derived Property Value

2.1.  Categories Based on Unicode Properties

   The derived property obtains its value based on a two step procedure.
   First, characters are placed in one or more character categories
   based on core properties defined by the Unicode Standard.  These
   categories are not mutually exclusive.  For some of the categories,
   the value is based on the explicit codepoint is tested.  One of them
   is for compatibility with "traditional DNS" hostnames.  Another
   involves an exception rule for specific codepoints.

   In the second step, set operations are used with these categories to
   determine the values for an IDN-specific property.  Those operations
   are specified in Section 3.

   In many cases aliases are used in the data in the Unicode Standard.
   This document uses both the alias and the spelled out terms (for
   example alias Ll for the General Category Lowercase_Letter).

2.1.1.  Category A - Classes of Codepoints

   A: generalCategory(cp) is in {Ll, Lu, Lo, Nd, Lm, Mn, Mc}

   These rules identify characters commonly used in mnemonics and often
   informally described as "language characters".  In general, only
   codepoints assigned to this category are suitable for use in IDN (but
   not all of them).

   The generalCategory of a codepoint is found in UnicodeData.txt [1] in
   the third column.  The mapping between the alias (for example Ll) and
   the name of the general category is found in
   PropertyValueAliases.txt [2] under the heading General_Category.

   The categories used in this rule are:
   o  Ll - Lowercase_Letter
   o  Lu - Uppercase_Letter
   o  Lo - Other_Letter
   o  Nd - Decimal_Number
   o  Lm - Modifier_Letter
   o  Mn - Nonspacing_Mark
   o  Mc - Spacing_Mark

Internet-Draft             Unicode Codepoints              November 2007


2.1.2.  Category B - Normalization

   B: NFKC(cp) != cp

   The category is used to group the characters that change under NFKC
   normalization.  In general, these codepoints are not suitable for use
   for IDN.

   The normalization algorithm NFKC is defined as NFKD (canonical)
   decomposition followed by canonical composition.  Decomposition
   mapping is found in the sixth column in UnicodeData.txt [1] that
   together with UAX #15 [3] define the various normalization forms.
   The data (sixth column) include the decomposition mapping.  In the
   case of canonical, rather than compatibility mapping, it also shows
   the decomposition type within angle brackets.  An exclusion table for
   composition exists in CompositionExclusions.txt [4].  Singleton
   decompositions, those that map a single codepoint into another single
   codepoint, are never composed.  Hangul is decomposed and composed
   according to an algorithm specified in the Unicode Standard.

   The rules that form this category may include the composed form of a
   codepoint, and because of step 2 the codepoint is not suitable for
   use in IDN.  This implies only the associated decomposed form could
   be used for IDN (as is the case with U+0140).  However, other rules
   involving the General Category might then cause rejection of some of
   the codepoints that make up the decomposed form.  If that combination
   occurs, neither the composed nor the decomposed forms are permitted
   in IDN labels unless there is a Category H (Section 2.2.2) Exception
   (U+00B7 is an example of this case).

2.1.3.  Category C - Casefolding

   C: casefold(cp) != cp

   This category is used to group all characters that change when folded
   to lower case.  In general, these codepoints are not suitable for use
   for IDN.

   Case folding rules can in general be found in UnicodeData.txt [1] in
   the 14th column.  A table of special cases can be found in
   SpecialCasing.txt [5].  The SpecialCasing.txt [5] file includes both
   general casing rules and conditional mappings.  Only transformations
   associated with unconditional mappings are included in this category.
   One can see whether the mapping is conditional or not in the 5th
   column of SpecialCasing.txt [5].  If the column is empty, the mapping
   is unconditional.

   Known codepoints with difficult case folding include U+00DF (LATIN

   SMALL LETTER SHARP S) and U+0130 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT
   ABOVE).

2.1.4.  Category D - Ignorables

   D: property(cp) is in {Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point,
                          Noncharacter_Code_Point}

   In general, these codepoints are not suitable for use for IDN.

   The required properties are associated with codepoints in
   PropList.txt [6].

   Note that there are also derived properties in
   DerivedCoreProperties.txt [7].  These are not used for reasons
   explained above.  It has been discussed whether
   Default_Ignorable_Code_Point should be used, but as that is a derived
   property, it is not used.  The definition for
   Default_Ignorable_Code_Point can be found in
   DerivedCoreProperties.txt [7] (and erratum of 2007-January-25 [8])
   and is

   Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point + Cf + Cc + Cs
   + Noncharacter_Code_Point + Variation_Selector
   - White_Space - FFF9..FFFB (Annotation Characters)

2.1.5.  Category E - Historical Scripts

   E: script(cp) in {Cuneiform, Ugaritic, Old_Persian, Gothic,
                     Old_Italic, Cypriot, Linear_B, Phoenician,
                     Kharoshthi, Phags_Pa, Glagolitic, Shavian,
                     Deseret, Osmanya, Ogham}

   This category is used for identifying codepoints in historical
   scripts.  In general, these codepoints are inappropriate for use in
   IDNs because no living script-user communities are known.

   The script to which a codepoint belongs is listed in Scripts.txt [9].
   Note that aliases for scripts can be found in
   PropertyValueAliases.txt [2], so Xsux is for example an alias for the
   script Cuneiform.

2.1.6.  Category F - Blocks of Characters

   F: block(cp) in {Combining_Diacritical_Marks_for_Symbols,
                    Musical_Symbols, Ancient_Greek_Musical_Notation}

   This category rule is used to identifying codepoints that are not

   useful in mnemonics or that are otherwise impractical for IDN use.
   In general, these codepoints are not suitable for use for IDN.

   The block to which a codepoint belongs is listed in Blocks.txt [10].

2.2.  Other Categories

2.2.1.  Category G - ASCII LDH

   G: cp is in {0061..007A, 0030..0039, 002D}

   This category is used in the second step to preserve the traditional
   "hostname" (LDH) characters (a-z, 0-9 and '-').  In general, these
   codepoints are suitable for use for IDN.

   The characters in this category are defined by a list of specific
   permitted ASCII [11] characters.

2.2.2.  Category H - Exceptions

   [[anchor3: Note in Draft: This list may be further modified as the
   implications ofare examined.]]Category J (Section 2.2.4)

   H: cp in {00B7, 05F3, 05F4, 3007, 303B, 30FB}

   This category explicitly lists codepoints for which the category
   cannot be assigned using only the core property values that exist in
   the Unicode standard.  The values are according to the table below:

   00B7; MAYBE YES # MIDDLE DOT
   05F3; MAYBE YES # HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERESH
   05F4; MAYBE YES # HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERSHAYIM
   3005; ALWAYS    # IDEOGRAPHIC ITERATION MARK
   3007; ALWAYS    # IDEOGRAPHIC NUMBER ZERO
   303B; MAYBE YES # VERTICAL IDEOGRAPHIC ITERATION MARK
   30FB; MAYBE YES # KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT

2.2.3.  Category I - CJK Subsetting

   I: script(cp) is in {Han}

   [[anchor4: Note in Draft: The actual rule here should not be a test
   for the script, as that is already part of the definition of.  This
   is only a placeholder to make the overall algorithm be
   complete.]]Category Y (Section 3.1.2)

2.2.4.  Category J - Character Groups Requiring Special Treatment

   [[anchor5: Note in Draft: This list may be increased (for example
   with Cc) as the implications of.]]Classifying more scripts
   (Section 3.2)

   J: generalCategory(cp) is in {Cf}

   This category consists of non-language characters (i.e., those that
   are not in Category A (Section 2.1.1)) but that may still be required
   in IDN labels under some circumstances.  In general, the second step
   uses this category to either require contextual rules or to exclude
   the characters.

2.2.5.  Category K - Unassigned codepoints

   K: cp is unassigned

   This category consists of codepoints in the Unicode character set
   that is not (yet) assigned.


3.  Calculation of the Derived Property

   As described above (Section 1) and in more detail in the "IDNA
   Protocol" document [IDNA200X-protocol], possible values of the IDN
   property are:

   o  ALWAYS
   o  MAYBE YES
   o  MAYBE NOT
   o  CONTEXT
   o  NEVER
   o  UNASSIGNED

   The algorithm to calculate the value of the derived property is as
   follows.  The calculation is twofold.  We first take care of
   exceptions and then look at multiple categories on a per-script
   basis.

   First the special cases.  If there is a match, do not go to the
   second phase.
   o  If the codepoint is in Category G (Section 2.2.1), the value is
      ALWAYS.
   o  If the codepoint is in Category J (Section 2.2.4), the value is
      CONTEXT.





Faltstrom                 Expires May 21, 2008                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Unicode Codepoints              November 2007


   o  If the codepoint is in Category K (Section 2.2.5), the value is
      UNASSIGNED.
   o  If the codepoint is in Category H (Section 2.2.2), the value is
      according to the table in Section 2.2.2.

   If the special cases do not yield a final value for the property, the
   value depends on the script to which the codepoint belongs.  This
   step is therefore organized by script, with the expectation that the
   list will grow over time, using criteria discussed in
   [IDNA200X-protocol].  Once a script is added to this list, it is
   never removed.  The order of scripts below is historical and has no
   substantive implications. [[anchor6: Note in Draft: A pointer to IANA
   Considerations and some discussion are probably needed here.]]

   The two sets of scripts chosen as initial cases below were selected
   because extensive specific work has been done on the applicability
   and practical use of characters in those scripts in IDNs and,
   consequently, because we feel confident that we understand these
   scripts well enough to be sure that the characters placed into the
   NEVER category by these rules cannot possibly be candidates for
   reassignment to the ALWAYS category (or vice versa).  As our
   confidence grows with regard to other scripts, we expect that they
   will be effectively added to this list, permitting the ALWAYS
   category to be used.

3.1.  Classified Scripts

3.1.1.  Scripts derived from Common European Scripts

   Z: script(cp) in {Latin, Greek, Cyrillic}

   o  If the codepoint is not in Category A (Section 2.1.1), the value
      is NEVER.
   o  If the codepoint is in Category A (Section 2.1.1), the following
      applies:
      *  If the codepoint does not appear in any of the categories B
         (Section 2.1.2), C (Section 2.1.3), D (Section 2.1.4), E
         (Section 2.1.5) or F (Section 2.1.6), the value is ALWAYS.
      *  If the codepoint is in any of the categories B (Section 2.1.2),
         C (Section 2.1.3), D (Section 2.1.4), E (Section 2.1.5) or F
         (Section 2.1.6), the value is NEVER.

3.1.2.  Scripts derived from Han

   Y: script(cp) in {Han}

   o  If the codepoint is in Category B (Section 2.1.2), then the value
      is NEVER.
   o  If the codepoint is not in Category B (Section 2.1.2), then the
      value is MAYBE YES.

3.2.  Scripts not classified for IDN so far

   Other: script(cp) not classified so far

   Scripts not classified above, or in successor documents, are never
   associated with the ALWAYS property value.  They are given values as
   follows:

   o  If the codepoint is not in Category A (Section 2.1.1), the value
      is NEVER.
   o  If the codepoint is in Category A (Section 2.1.1), the following
      applies:

         (Section 2.1.6), the value is NEVER.


4.  Codepoints

   The Categories and Rules defined in Section 2 and Section 3 apply to
   all assigned Unicode characters.  The table in Appendix A shows, for
   illustrative purposes, the consequences of the categories and
   classification rules, and the resulting property values.

   The list of codepoints that can be found in Appendix A is non-
   normative.  Section 2 and Section 3 are normative.


5.  IANA Considerations

   ...To be supplied.  This work will ultimately require registries of
   characters that are acceptable for use in IDNs.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security issues associated with this work are discussed in
   [IDNA200X-issues] and [IDNA200X-protocol].
