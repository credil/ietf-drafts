Abstract

   OSPFv3 includes a mechanism for supporting multiple instances on the
   same link.  OSPFv2 could benefit from such a mechanism in order to
   support multiple routing domains on the same subnet.  The OSPFv2
   instance ID is reserved for support of separate OSPFv2 protocol
   instances.  This is different from OSPFv3 where it could be used for
   other purposes such as putting the same link in multiple areas.
   OSPFv2 supports this capability using a separate subnet or the OSPF
   multi-area adjacency capability.

1.  Introduction

   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] includes a mechanism for supporting multiple
   instances on the same link.  OSPFv2 [OSPFV2] could benefit from such
   a mechanism in order to support multiple routing domains on the same
   subnet.  The OSPFv2 instance ID is reserved for support of separate
   OSPFv2 protocol instances.  This is different from OSPFv3 where it
   could be used for other purposes such as putting the same link in
   multiple areas.  OSPFv2 supports this capability using a separate
   subnet or the OSPF multi-area adjacency capability [MULTI-AREA].

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPFv2 Instance Packet Encoding

   OSPFv2 currently doesn't offer a mechanism to differentiate packets
   for different instances sent and received on the same interface.  In
   support of this capability, this document introduces a modified
   packet header format when the Authentication Type field is split into
   an instance ID and type.

   Checksum
      OSPFv2 standard checksum calculation as specified in specified in
      [OSPFV2].

   Instance ID
      Enables multiple instances of OSPF to be run over a single link.
      Each protocol instance would be assigned a separate Instance ID;
      the Instance ID has local subnet significance only.  Received
      packets with an Instance ID not equal to one of the configured
      OSPF Instance IDs on the receiving interface MUST be discarded.

   AuType

3.  OSPF Interface Instance ID

   OSPF [OSPFV2] describes the conceptual interface data structure in
   section 9.  The OSPF Interface ID will be added to this structure.
   The Interface Instance ID will default to 0.  Its setting to a non-
   zero value may be accomplished through configuration or implied by
   some usage beyond the scope of this document.

3.1.  Sending and Receiving OSPF packets

   When sending OSPF packets, if the interface instance ID has a non-
   zero value, it will be set in the OSPF packet header.  When receiving
   OSPF packets, the OSPFv2 Header Instance ID will be used to aid in
   demultiplexing the packet and routing it to the correct OSPFv2
   instance.  Received packets with an Instance ID not equal to one of
   the configured OSPF Instance IDs on the receiving interface MUST be
   discarded.

4.  State Sharing Optimizations between OSPF instances

   This is beyond the scope of this draft and is an area for further
   study.

5.  Backward Compatibility and Deployment Considerations

   When there are OSPF routers that support this capability on the same
   broadcast capable link as those that do not, packets with non-zero
   Instance IDs will be received by those legacy routers.  Since the
   authentication type will be unknown to them they will not process the
   packet.  This is exactly what is desired.

   Previously, a concern was that some implementations will log every
   single authentication type mismatch.  However, discussions with
   implementers have led us to the conclusion that this is not as
   current a problem as we'd first thought and it will be even less of a
   problem by the time the mechanism in this draft is standardized,
   implemented, and deployed.  Hence, the controversial mechanisms to
   avoid legacy routers receiving multicast OSPF packets with a non-zero
   instance ID have been removed.

6.  Security Considerations

   The enhancement described herein doesn't add any additional security
   considerations to OSPFv2.  Security considerations for OSPFv2 are
   described in [OSPFV2].

   Given that only three OSPFv2 authentication types have been
   standardized, it seems reasonable to reduce the OSPF packet header
   field to 8 bits.

7.  IANA Considerations

   A new registry will be added for OSPF Instance IDs.  The allocation
   is TBD.

   Dependent on the approach, two new multicast addresses from the IPv4
   Multicast Addresses registry would need to be allocated.

   Dependent on the approach, a new protocol ID may need to be allocated
   from the Protocol Numbers registry.
