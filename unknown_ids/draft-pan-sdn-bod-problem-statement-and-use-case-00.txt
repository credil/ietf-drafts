     Abstract

        Service providers and enterprises are increasingly offering services
        and applications from data centers. Subsequently, data centers
        originate significant amount of network traffic. Without proper
        network provisioning, user applications and services are subject to
        congestion and delay.

        In this document, we argue the necessity in providing network
        information to the applications, and thereby enabling the
        applications to directly provision network edge devices and relevant
        applications.

     1. Introduction

        Bandwidth on Demand services are offered by network operators in
        industry and research sectors to support the needs of selected
        customers needing high point-to-point bandwidth connections.
        Such services take advantage of dynamic control of the underlying
        network to set up forwarding and resource allocation as requested by
        the customer.  Some control is given directly to the customer
        via a portal so that there is no need to go through an intermediate
        stage of service order provisioning on the part of the network operator.

        Currently such services are often based on management interfaces to
        vendor equipment that are vendor-specific, and as a result the
        operator must redesign its supporting control application for each
        vendor domain, or limit their offering to a single vendor domain.

        In this document, we propose that providing a common interface to
        networks of different vendors and technologies would enable the
        network provider to offer Bandwidth on Demand services that are more
        widely deployable, less complex to develop and capable of offering
        more sophisticated features, using additional network information.


        Here are some of the conventions used in this document. The key

     Internet-Draft  SDN BoD Problem and Use Cases   October 3, 2011


        OpenFlow has defined an architecture for offering virtualized
        network control through a centralized controller and proxies
        called FlowVisors. These allow users to configure forwarding
        of packets within slices of the network partitioned off for
        their use.  The controller is designed to control each network
        element directly through a dedicated control interface.  It is
        not designed to work with existing control plane protocols.

        More generally, TMF has developed models and interfaces for
        operations and administration of networks through the north-
        bound interface provided by the element management system.
        These interfaces are not intended for real-time control of
        the network element and need to take into account variations
        in the design and features of different types of equipment.

        PCE is a client-server protocol that operates in MPLS networks that
        enables the network operators to compute and potentially provision
        optimal point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections. However,
        PCE does not interface with applications to optimize traffic from
        user applications.




      4. Problem Definition

        Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between application and
        network today, where customer control of bandwidth on demand
        is provided through applications created by the network
        operator supporting the user interface, features and backend
        accounting for the service.  Such applications are used in
        single domain deployments and have limited visibility of
        underlying networks and resource availability.

     Internet-Draft  SDN BoD Problem and Use Cases   October 3, 2011



        This presents a number of challenges and problems.  Without a
        standard interface to the network domain and its control plane,
        each bandwidth on demand supporting application must
        be built for a specific set of vendor equipment and is not
        easily generalizable to different vendors or even different
        equipment offered by a single vendor.  While signaling interfaces
        such as the UNI could offer standardized access to network control,
        such interfaces have not been adopted because they provide
        minimal security and functionality and are designed for more
        of a peer relationship between network elements.

        Similarly, bandwidth on demand applications must be designed for
        a single technology, which restricts the range of use and potential
        users.  If Domain #1 uses SDH, for example, and Domain #2 uses OTN
        it may be necessary to design supporting Application #2 from scratch
        even though Application #1 has been successfully offering service.
        Ideally the interface should allow some level of technology
        independence, as well as potentially integration of control of
        multiple layers (esp. packet and circuit).

        Third, the application is generally limited to simple services
        connecting a source to destination, because interfaces
        hide network topology and do not allow visualization of
        the topology for different customer views. For some services
        users may wish to exercise control over path routing aspects
        such as shared risk, or inclusion or exclusion of areas for
        policy reasons.

     5. The Role of an SDN Layer

        To solve the above problem, the proposal is to introduce a
        software-driven network (SDN) layer (as shown in Figure 2), that is
        responsible for network virtualization, programmability and
        monitoring, between supporting applications and the network.

               |                  and Monitoring)                  |
               +---------------------------------------------------+
                        |                                |
                        |                                |
               +------------------+            +------------------+
               | Physical Network |            | Physical Network |
               |  Domain #1       |            |   Domain #2      |
               +------------------+            +------------------+

                Figure 2: Application to network relationship for SDN



        The purpose of the SDN Layer is to enable the applications
        supporting bandwidth on demand services to access information
        about and control traffic flows at the network layer through
        a standard, secure and customizable interface.  Applications can
        visualize the traffic flows at the network layer, and manage the
        mapping or binding between user traffic flows to the network
        connections from the edge of the networks.

        The implementation of an SDN Layer involves interfacing among
        different types of applications and different types of network domains,
        based on technology or vendor, administrative or policy control.
        Standardized interfaces must be defined to support this.

     Internet-Draft  SDN BoD Problem and Use Cases   October 3, 2011




        For the architecture to be useful for existing technologies as
        well as new, it should be capable of interworking with existing
        forms of network control plane as well as potential new control
        structures for networks, such as OpenFlow.  The focus should be
        on providing richer access to network resources as opposed to
        redesigning network control itself.




     5. Use Cases

     5.1. Scheduled/ Dynamic Bandwidth On-Demand Service

        Figure 3 illustrates flow in a scheduled or dynamic bandwidth service.
        In the simplest case, connectivity may already be provided between
        user-specified endpoints, however the bandwidth allocated between
        endpoints can be varied within some overall limit based on predefined
        schedule or on spontaneous customer request.

        In more sophisticated services, the customer may be allowed to
        create new connections within a specified set of endpoints and delete
        such connections when the connectivity is no longer required.

        Figure 4 illustrates a BoD service that supports multi-layer
        network control.  This extends allows the network operator's
        supporting applications to control mapping of end user packet
        flows onto an underlying circuit-based transport network to
        support high speed bandwidth on demand service.  Different
        transport network technologies may be used to provide the
        server layer transport functions so that the application
        can evolve easily with new transport technologies.

        Figure 5 illustrates flow in a virtualized network service that offers
        some degree of topology visibility and control in addition to the
        features of scheduled or dynamic BoD.  For some customers it may
        be desirable to provide tailored visibility into the topology of
        the resources they control, in order for the customer to put into
        effect their own routing of traffic within their dedicated domain.

     Internet-Draft  SDN BoD Problem and Use Cases   October 3, 2011


        At this time such visibility is not possible to provide, as protocols
        provide either no visibility into topology or full visibility into
        topology.  For security reasons it is likely that a supporting
        network operator will want to limit visibility and control to some
        virtualized topology.
