1.  Introduction

   Softwire mesh framework RFC 5565 [RFC5565]is a tunneling mechanism
   which enables connectivity between islands of IPv4, IPv6 or dual-
   stack networks across single IPv4 or IPv6 backbone networks.  In
   softwire mesh solution, extended multiprotocol-BGP (MP-BGP)is used to
   set up tunnels and advertise prefixes among address family border
   routers (AFBRs).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular it defines objects for managing softwire mesh
   [RFC5565].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from softwire problem statement RFC
   4925 [RFC4925] and softwire mesh framework RFC5565 [RFC5565].

4.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The softwire mesh MIB provides a way to configure and manage the
   softwire mesh objects through SNMP.

Internet-Draft                   swmMIB                        July 2011


5.1.  The swmSupportedTunnlTable Subtree

   Since AFBR need to negotiate with BGP peer what kind of tunnel they
   use, it should firstly annouce what kind tunnels it supports.  The
   swmSupportedTunnlTable subtree provides the infomation about what
   kind of tunnels the AFBR supports.  According to section 4 of RFC
   5512, current softwire mesh tunnel includes IP-IP, GRE or L2TPv3.

5.2.  The swmEncapsTable Subtree

   The swmEncapsTable subtree provides softwire mesh NLRI-NH information
   about the AFBR.  It indicates which E-IP destination address will be
   encapsulated according to the arriving packet's I-IP destination
   address.

5.3.  The swmBGPNeighborTable Subtree

   The subtree provides softwire mesh BGP neighbor information about the
   AFBR.  It includes the address of softwire mesh BGP peer.  It also
   includes what kind of tunnel that the AFBR would use to communicate
   with this BGP peer.

5.4.  The swmMIBConformance Subtree

   The subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  Tunnels are handled
   by creating a logical interface (ifEntry) for each tunnel.  Softwire
   mesh tunnel also acts as a virtual interface, which has corresponding
   entries in IP Tunnel MIB and Interface MIB.  Those corresponding
   entries are indexed by ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in ifTable would be used to represents whether the
   mesh function of the AFBR has been started.  During the BGP OPEN
   phase, if the softwire mesh capability is negotiated, the mesh
   function could be considered to be started, and ifOperStatus is "up",
   else the ifOperStatus is "down".

   If it's IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mesh tunnel, the ifInUcastPkts
   represents the number of IPv6 packets which would be decapsulated to
   IPv4 in the virtual interface.  The ifOutUcastPkts represents the
   number of IPv6 packets which have been encapsulated from IPv4

   packets.  Particularly, if these IPv4 packets need to be fragmented,
   the number counted here is the packets after fragmentation.

   If it's IPv6-over-IPv4 softwire mesh tunnel, the ifInUcastPkts
   represents the number of IPv4 packets which would be decapsulated to
   IPv6 in the virtual interface.  The ifOutUcastPkts represents the
   number of IPv4 packets which have been encapsulated from IPv6.
   Particularly, if these IPv6 packets need to be fragmented, the number
   counted here is the packets after fragmentation.  Similar definition
   apply to other counting objects in ifTalbe.

6.2.  Relationship to the IP Tunnel MIB

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] contains objects common to all IP
   tunnels, including softwire mesh.  Additionally, tunnel encapsulation
   specific MIB (like what is defined in this document) extend the IP
   tunnel MIB to further describe encapsulation specific information.

   In case of softwire mesh, Since it's a point to multi-point tunnel,
   we need to specify a ecapsulation talbe to support E-IP routing
   between AFBRs to achieve correct forwarding in E-IP networks and
   correct encapsulation on AFBRs.  Each AFBR also needs to know
   information about remote BGP peers (AFBRs).

   The implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB is required for softwire
   mesh.  The tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the tunnelIfEntry should be set to
   softwireMesh("xx"), and corresponding entry in the softwire mesh MIB
   module will exist for every tunnelIfEntry with this
   tunnelIfEncapsMethod.  The tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress must be set to
   0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or :: for IPv6 because it's a point to multi-point
   tunnel.

   Since tunnelIfAddressType in tunnelIfTable represents the type of
   address in the corresponding tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects, we also can use the
   tunnelIfAddressType to specify the softwire mesh tunnel is IPv4-over-
   IPv6 or IPv6-over-IPv4 when the tunnelIfEncapsMethod is softwireMesh:
   When tunnelIfAddressType is IPv4, the encapsulation would be IPv6-
   over-IPv4; When tunnelIfAddressType is IPv6, the encapsulation would
   be IPv4-over-IPv6.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863] and
   INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

8.  Security Considerations

   The swmMIB module can be used for configuration of certain objects,
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results.

   There are some management objects defined in this MIB module with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Unauthorized changes to the swmVIf4over6Table and
      swmVIf6over4Table may disrupt the configuration of the 4over6 mtu
      and 6over4 mtu of the virtual interface.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry, and
   the following IANA-assigned tunnelType values recorded in the
   IANAtunnelType-MIB registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           swmMIB            { transmission XXX }


          IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
              SYNTAX     INTEGER {

                         softwireMesh ("XX")        -- softwire Mesh tunnel

                         }
