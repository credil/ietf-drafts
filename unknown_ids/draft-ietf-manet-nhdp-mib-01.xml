  XML2RFC offers an include feature described in the XML2RFC README
  file.  That syntax, however, contradicts the DTD requirements to
  have <reference> elements within the <references> element, so an 
  XML parser is likely to find your XML file invalid.  It may be
  possible that XML2RFC will change their DTD so that the XML file
  remains valid when their style of include is used.

  In the meantime therefore, we use an alternative valid-XML approach
  to includes, which unfortunately require that define your includes
  at the beginning of the file. Since the biggest benefit of includes
  is for references, this requires that your references be defined in
  ENTITY clauses here before being "included" and cited elsewhere in
  the file.

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>The NHDP protocol allows routers in a Mobile Ad-Hoc
      Network (MANET) setting to discover and track one-hop and two-hop
      neighbor sets.  This information is useful for routers running
      various routing and multicast flooding protocols developed
      within the IETF MANET Working Group.</t>

          <t>Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose
             values affect timing or attempt bounds on the
             NHDP protocol.</t>
          <t>State Objects - automatically generated values which

          <t>Performance Objects - automatically generated values
             which help an administrator or automated tool to
             assess the performance of the NHDP protocol process
             on the router and the overall discovery performance

    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">
      <t>This section presents the structure of the NHDP
      MIB module. The MIB is arranged into the following structure:</t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
        <t>nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP MIB notifications.</t>
        <t>nhdpObjects -  defining objects within this MIB.
           The objects are arranged into the following groups:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>General Information Group - defining objects of a general nature,
                 e.g., version numbers.</t>
              <t>Configuration Group - defining objects related to the configuration
                 of the NHDP instance on the device.</t>
              <t>State Group - defining objects which reflect the current
                 state of the NHDP running on the device.</t>
              <t>Performance Group - defining objects which are
                 useful to a management station when characterizing the
                 performance of the NHDP on the device and in the MANET.</t>
            <!--  <t>Maintenance Group - defining objects which can be used to trigger maintenance tests of the NHDP instance on the device.</t>-->

        <t>This section is TBD.</t>
      </section>


      <section title="The General Information Group">
        <t>This section provides general information about 
        the capabilities of the device running the NHDP.
        This group is currently empty and will be removed
        in future drafts if no objects are identified.</t>
      </section>


      <section title="The Configuration Group">

        <t>The device is configured with a set of controls.
        These will serve as the object descriptions once they are
        discussed and refined.  The list of configuration controls 
        for the NHDP-MIB (found in [ietf-manet-nhdp]),
        are discussed in the following subsections.</t>
        
        <section title="Interface Parameters">
          <t>The Interface Parameters include:</t> 

          <section title="Message Intervals">
          <t><list style='symbols'>
             <t>HELLO_INTERVAL  - is the maximum time between the transmission of two
                successive HELLO messages on this MANET interface.  If using
                periodic transmission of HELLO messages, these SHOULD be at a
                separation of HELLO_INTERVAL, possibly modified by jitter as
                specified in [XXX].</t>

             <t>HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL  - is the minimum interval between transmission of
                two successive HELLO messages, on this MANET interface.  (This
                minimum interval MAY be modified by jitter, as defined in [XXX].)</t>

             <t>REFRESH_INTERVAL  - is the maximum interval between advertisements in
                a HELLO message of each 1-hop neighbor address and its status.  In
                all intervals of length REFRESH_INTERVAL, a router MUST include all
                1-hop neighbor information which it is specified as sending in at
                least one HELLO message on this MANET interface.</t>
          </list></t>
   
          <t>The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:</t>
          <t><list style='symbols'>
             <t>HELLO_INTERVAL > 0</t>
             <t>HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL >= 0</t>
             <t>HELLO_INTERVAL >= HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL</t>
             <t>REFRESH_INTERVAL >= HELLO_INTERVAL</t>
             <t>If INTERVAL_TIME message TLVs as defined in [XXX] are included in
                HELLO messages, then HELLO_INTERVAL MUST be representable as
                described in [XXX].</t>
             <t>If REFRESH_INTERVAL > HELLO_INTERVAL, then a router may distribute its
                neighbor advertisements between HELLO messages in any manner, subject
                to the constraints above.</t>
             <t>For a router to employ this protocol in a purely responsive manner on a
                MANET interface, REFRESH_INTERVAL and HELLO_INTERVAL SHOULD both be
                set to a value such that a responsive HELLO message is always
                expected in a shorter period than this.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The following default values are recommended:</t>
          <t><list style='symbols'>
             <t>HELLO_INTERVAL = 2 seconds</t>
             <t>HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL = HELLO_INTERVAL/4</t>
             <t>REFRESH_INTERVAL = HELLO_INTERVAL</t>
          </list></t>
          </section>

          <section title="Information Validity Times">
            <t>Parameters related to the Information Validity Times include:</t>
            <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>L_HOLD_TIME  - is the period of advertisement, on this MANET
                 interface, of former 1-hop neighbor addresses as lost in HELLO
                 messages, allowing recipients of these HELLO messages to
                 accelerate removal of information from their Link Sets.
                 L_HOLD_TIME can be set to zero if accelerated information removal
                 is not required.</t>
              <t>H_HOLD_TIME  - is used as the value in the VALIDITY_TIME message TLV
                 included in all HELLO messages on this MANET interface.</t>
            </list></t>

            <t>The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:</t>
            <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>L_HOLD_TIME >= 0</t>
              <t>H_HOLD_TIME >= REFRESH_INTERVAL</t>
              <t>If HELLO messages can be lost then both SHOULD be significantly
                 greater than REFRESH_INTERVAL.</t>
              <t>H_HOLD_TIME MUST be representable as described in [XXX].</t>
              <t>H_HOLD_TIME = 3 x REFRESH_INTERVAL</t>
              <t>L_HOLD_TIME = H_HOLD_TIME</t>
              <t>N_HOLD_TIME = L_HOLD_TIME</t>
              <t>I_HOLD_TIME = N_HOLD_TIME</t>
            </list></t>
          </section>

          <section title="Link Quality">
            <t>Parameters related to the Link Quality include:</t>
            <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>HYST_ACCEPT  - is the link quality threshold at or above which a link
                 becomes usable, if it was not already so.</t>
              <t>HYST_REJECT  - is the link quality threshold below which a link
                 becomes unusable, if it was not already so.</t>
              <t>INITIAL_QUALITY  - is the initial quality of a newly identified link.</t>
              <t>INITIAL_PENDING  - if true, then a newly identified link is
                 considered pending, and is not usable until the link quality has
                 reached or exceeded the HYST_ACCEPT threshold.</t>
            </list></t>

            <t>The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:</t>
            <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>0 < = HYST_REJECT < = HYST_ACCEPT < = 1</t>
              <t>0 < = INITIAL_QUALITY < = 1.</t>
              <t>If link quality is not updated, then INITIAL_QUALITY >=
                 HYST_ACCEPT.</t>
              <t>If INITIAL_QUALITY =>  HYST_ACCEPT, then INITIAL_PENDING == false.</t>
              <t>If INITIAL_QUALITY < HYST_REJECT, then INITIAL_PENDING == true.</t>
            </list></t>

            <t>Link quality is a mechanism whereby a router MAY take considerations
               other than message exchange into account for determining when a link
               is and is not a candidate for being considered as HEARD or SYMMETRIC.
               Link quality is used only locally by a router, and routers may fully
               inter-operate whether they are using the same, different or no link
               quality methods.</t>

             <t>NHDP can be operated when the local router does not
                implement Link Quality.  In order for a router to not employ link quality, 
                the router MUST define:</t>
             <t><list style='symbols'>
                <t>INITIAL_PENDING = false</t>
                <t>INITIAL_QUALITY >= HYST_REJECT (there is no reason not to define
                   INITIAL_QUALITY = 1).</t>
             </list></t>

            <t>If link quality is changed, then parameter values will depend on the
               link quality process.  If link quality is not changed, then:</t>
            <t><list style='symbols'>
               <t>HYST_ACCEPT = 1</t>
               <t>HYST_REJECT = 0</t>
               <t>INITIAL_QUALITY = 1</t>
               <t>INITIAL_PENDING = false</t>
            </list></t>
          </section>

          <section title="Jitter">
             <t>If jitter, as defined in [XXX], is used then these parameters are as
                follows:</t>
             <t><list style='symbols'>
               <t>HP_MAXJITTER  - represents the value of MAXJITTER used in [XXX] for

      <section title="The State Group">
        <t>The State Subtree reports current state information, 
           including neighbor tables.
           These are separately discussed below.</t>

        <t>(Note: these will serve as the object descriptions once they are
           discussed and refined.)</t>

        <t>The Local Information Base (LIB),  contains the addresses of the
           interfaces (MANET and non-MANET) of this router.  The contents of
           this Information Base are not changed by signaling.
           The LIB contains two tables:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>The "Local Interface Set", which consists of Local Interface Tuples,
                 each of which records the addresses of an interface (MANET or non-
                 MANET) of the router.</t>
              <t>The "Removed Interface Address Set", which consists of Removed
                 Interface Address Tuples, each of which records a recently used
                 address of an interface (MANET or non-MANET) of the router.
                 A router's Removed Interface Address Set records addresses which were
                 recently local interface addresses.  If a router's interface addresses
                 are immutable then this set is always empty and MAY be omitted.</t>
           </list></t>

        <t>The Interface Information Based (IIB),
           recording information regarding
           links to this MANET interface and symmetric 2-hop neighbors which
           can be reached through such links.
           The IIB contains two tables:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>A "Link Set", which records information about current and recently
                 lost links between this interface and MANET interfaces of 1-hop
                 neighbors.  The Link Set consists of Link Tuples, each of which
                 contains information about a single link.  Recently lost links are
                 recorded so that they can be advertised in HELLO messages,
                 accelerating their removal from relevant 1-hop neighbors' Link
                 Sets.  Link quality information, if used and available, is
                 recorded in Link Tuples and may indicate that links are treated as
                 lost.</t>
              <t>A "Two-Hop Set", which records the existence of bidirectional links
                 between symmetric 1-hop neighbors of this MANET interface and
                 other routers (symmetric 2-hop neighbors).  The 2-Hop Set consists
                 of 2-Hop Tuples, each of which records an interface address of a
                 symmetric 2-hop neighbor, and all interface addresses of the
                 corresponding symmetric 1-hop neighbor.  The 2-Hop Set is updated
                 by the signaling of this protocol, but is not itself reported in
                 that signaling.</t>
           </list></t>

        <t>The Neighbor Information Base (NIB),
           records information regarding current
           and recently lost 1-hop neighbors of this router.
           The NIB contains two tables:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>

        <t>The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
           This section lists objects for NHDP performance monitoring,
           some of which explicitly appear in the NHDP-MIB and others which
           are obtainable through a combination of base objects from this MIB and reports available through the <xref target="REPORT">REPORT-MIB</xref>.
           Throughout this section those objects will be pointed out that are intended as
           base objects which will be explicitly defined within this MIB and
           those objects which are derived through a combination of the

        <t>The objects described in the following can be useful for determining 
           certain properties of the NHDP instance. 
           Notably unstable neighbors or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes 
           of sets can have a negative influence on the performance of NHDP. 
           The following objects thus allow to acquire information related to 
           the stability and performance of NHDP:</t>

                             (triggered or periodical) using a given bin size.

    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A locally arbitrary unique identifier associated with an
        NHDP neighbor interface.

        All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
        out of a common number space. In other words, NeighborIfIndex
        values assigned to entries in one table must not overlap with
        NeighborIfIndex values assigned to entries in another
        table.

        The NeighborIfIndex defines a discovered interface of a 1-hop
        or 2-hop neighbor of the local router.  The agent identifies a 
        unique neighbor interface through the reciept of an address
        list advertised through an NHDP HELLO message.  

        The value for each discovered neighbor interface must remain
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
        network management system to the next re-initialization, except
        that if an application is deleted and re-created.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity. An NeighborIfIndex value must not be re-used until the
        next agent restart."

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>[TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
      contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
      those modules. This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
      template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).
      Remember that the objective is not to blindly copy text from the
      template, but rather to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and
      then state/document the result of this evaluation.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
      include the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive
          if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
          security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
          example.</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they
          are sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
      use the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
      following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
          are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
          be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
          information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
          European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
          sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
      information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs
      should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
      certainly require justification during IESG review.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
      http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
      submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
      Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
      what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
      information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module document.</t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
      MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
      See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
      MIB module.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.

    <section title="Change Log ">
      <t>Here we list the changes made to the various drafts of this MIB.</t>

      <t>We list here the changes made on the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-00 draft to generate
         the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft.</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Made and extensive addition in the area of performance monitoring.  Added text
             in the front material, added a PerformanceGroup to the MIB and added the PerformanceGroup
             to the Conformance Sections.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>We list here the changes made on the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft to generate
         the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-00 draft.</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Cleanup up numerous typos and add material to the Conformance section in order
             to pass the MIB checker, i.e., smilint.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>We list here the changes made on the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-00 draft to generate
         the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft.</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Defined the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterId textual conventions.  These
             identify a remote neighbor IfIndex and a remote neighbor router and are
             used as indexes into NHDP state tables. These constructs were necessary in order
             to associate address lists with specific remote interfaces as required by the
             NHDP protocol specification.</t>
          <t>Developed the nhdpInterfaceTable as part of the configuration group.</t>
          <t>Developed the nhdpDiscIfSetTable as a means to associate address lists with
             remotely discovered neighbor interfaces.</t>
          <t>Added tables defining the router's NHDP Local Information Base (LIB)
             as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.</t>  
          <t>Added tables defining the router's NHDP Interface information Base (IIB)
             as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.</t>  
          <t>Added tables defining the router's NHDP Neighbor Information Base (NIB)
             as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.</t>  
          <t>Aligned the NHDP-MIB and the OLSRv2-MIB configuration tables and indexing.</t>

    <section title="Open Issues">
      <t>This section contains the set of open issues related to the
         development and design of the NHDP-MIB.
         This section will not be present in the final version of the MIB
         and will be removed once all the open issues have been resolved.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
	  <t>How to handle dynamic parameters within NHDP?  Should
	     we expose setting, min and max values?</t>
          <t>Need to address how to handle Link Quality settings and
             parameters for a) optional operation and b) changing nature
             of link quality.</t>
          <t>What notifications are of interest and utility?</t>
          <t>Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
          DESCRIPTION clauses.</t>
          <t>Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
          DESCRIPTION clauses.</t>
          <t>Also, specify specific SNMP response
          to the snmp set request, i.e., 'generic error', 'bad value', etc.</t>
          <t>Fill in all of the DEFVAL within the configuration group objects.</t>
          <t>Run through the MIB checker.</t>
          <t>Clean up all of the 'Note:' statements within the body of the MIB. </t>
          <t>Work on the Security Section.  This MIB does have
             settable objects, but not sensitive objects (true?).</t>
          <t>Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.</t>
          <t>Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.</t>
