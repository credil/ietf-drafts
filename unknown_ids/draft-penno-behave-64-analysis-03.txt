Abstract

   Due to specific problems, NAT-PT was deprecated by the IETF as a
   mechanism to perform IPv6/IPv4 translation.  Since then, new work has
   commenced which standardizes new mechanisms to perform IPv6/IPv4
   translation.  This document evaluates how the new translation
   mechanisms avoid the problems that caused the IETF to deprecate
   NAT-PT.

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The current 64 proposal is widely seen as the next step in the
   evolution of interconnection equipment enabling communication between
   IPv6-only and IPv4-only networks.  One of the building blocks of this
   proposal is decoupling the DNS functionality from the NAT protocol
   translation itself.

   This approach is pragmatic in the sense that there is no dependency
   on DNS implementation for the successful functionality of NAT.  As
   long as there is a function (possibly DNS64) that can construct an
   IPv6 address with a fixed prefix and IPv4 address as the suffix,
   NAT64 will work just fine.

   To understand the 64 proposal, we must keep in mind that the focus of
   this proposal is on the deployment and not the implementation
   details.  As long as a NAT64 box confirms to the externally
   behaviour, as desired in the deployment scenario, the details are not
   very important as mentioned in this excerpt from
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] ".....  A NAT64 MAY perform the
   steps in a different order, or MAY perform different steps, as long
   as the externally visible outcome in the same."

1.1.  Scope

   This document provides an analysis of how the proposed set of
   documents that specify stateful IPv6-only to IPv4-only translation
   and replace NAT-PT [RFC2766] address the issues raised in the
   document "Reasons to Move the Network Address Translator - Protocol
   Translator (NAT-PT) to Historic Status" [RFC4966].  These documents,
   henceforth referred as 64, comprise of the following:

   o  NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients
      to IPv4 Servers [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]

   o  DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6
      Clients to IPv4 Servers [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64]

   o  IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 TranslatorsFramework for IPv4/IPv6
      Translation [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]

   o  Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation
      [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework]

   This 64 proposal analyzed is limited in the sense that hosts from
   IPv6 network can initiate a connection to IPv4 network, but not vice-
   versa.  This corresponds to Scenarios 1 and 5 described in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  Hence, the scenario of servers

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           February 2010


   moving to IPv6 while clients remaining IPv4 remains unaddressed.

   The 64 proposal, just like any other technology under development,
   has some positives and some drawbacks.  The ups and downs of the
   proposal must be clearly understood while going forward with its
   future development.

   The scope of this document does not include stateless translation.

      Open Issue: should we include stateless translation in the scope?


2.  Analysis of 64 Translation Against Concerns of RFC4966

   Of the set of problems pointed out in RFC4966, the 64 proposal
   addresses some problems, whereas leaves others unaddressed.  It is
   also worth pointing out that the scope of the 64 proposal is reduced
   when compared to NAT-PT.  Following is a point by point analysis of
   the problems.

2.1.  Problems Not Addressed by 64

   Problems discussed in RFC4966, which are not addressed by the 64
   proposal:

   1.   Disruption of all protocols that embed IP addresses (and/or
        ports) in packet payloads or apply integrity mechanisms using IP
        addresses (and ports).

           Analysis: In the case of FTP [RFC0959] this problem is
           addressed by the use of a FTP64 ALG [I-D.ietf-behave-ftp64]
           which is a workaround solution.  The functioning of other
           protocols is left unaddressed.

   2.   Inability to redirect traffic for protocols that lack
        demultiplexing capabilities or are not built on top of specific
        transport-layer protocols for transport address translations.

   3.   Loss of information due to incompatible semantics between IPv4
        and IPv6 versions of headers and protocols.

           Analysis: This issue is not specific to 64 but due to the
           design of IPv4 and IPv6.

   4.   Need for additional state and/or packet reconstruction in
        dealing with packet fragmentation.  Otherwise, implement no
        support for fragments.

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           February 2010


   5.   Interaction with SCTP and multihoming.

           Analysis: There are two issues identified under section 2.6
           of [RFC4966].  The first one states that in order to support
           multihoming SCTP carries embedded addresses that would have
           to be translated.  This is another instance of the problem
           discussed earlier where NAT disrupts protocols that embeds IP
           address (and/or ports) in packet payload .

           The second one is that since all connections of a SCTP
           multihoming session need to go through the same NAT device,
           it nullifies the multihoming advantages of SCTP.  This is
           still true for 64.

   6.   Need for the NAT box to act as proxy for correspondent node when
        IPv6 node is mobile, with consequent restrictions on mobility.

           Analysis: This is not specific to NAT64 but to all NAT
           flavours.

   7.   Inability to handle multicast traffic.

           Analysis: efforts are underway to support translation of
           multicast traffic [I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework].

   8.   Scalability concerns together with introduction of a single
        point of failure and a security attack nexus.

           Analysis: If deployed in a centralised scheme, there is still
           a single point of failure for the NAT connections.  This
           robustness issue may be mitigated by deploying distributed
           NAT64 devices or any state synchronisation procedure.

   9.   Creation of a DoS (Denial of Service) threat relating to
        exhaustion of memory and address/port pool resources on the
        translator.

           Analysis: This specific DoS concern on Page 6 of [RFC4966] is
           under a DNS-ALG heading in that document, and refers to NAT-
           PT's creation of NAT mapping state when a DNS query occurred.
           With the new IPv6/IPv4 translation mechanisms, DNS queries do
           not create mapping state.  Thus, this concern is fully
           eliminated with the new IPv6/IPv4 translation mechanisms.

           it is important to note that a similar issue may be
           encountered in 64 since static mappings may be configured on
           the NAT64 devices (in addition to the dynamic per-flow state)
           owing to NAT port forwarding (e.g., UPnP IGD, NAT-PMP).

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           February 2010


   10.  Restricted validity of translated DNS records: a translated
        record may be forwarded to an application that cannot use it.

           Analysis: If a node on the IPv4 side forwards the address of
           the other endpoint to a node which cannot contact the NAT box
           or is not covered under the endpoint-dependent contraint of
           NAT, then the new node will not be able to initiate contact.

   11.  Unless UDP encapsulation is used for IPsec [RFC3498], traffic
        using IPsec AH (Authentication Header), in transport and tunnel
        mode, and IPsec ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), in
        transport mode, is unable to be carried through NAT-PT without
        terminating the security associations on the NAT-PT, due to
        their usage of cryptographic integrity protection.

           Analysis: This is still true for 64.

   12.  Address selection issues when either the internal or external
        hosts implement both IPv4 and IPv6

           Analysis: This is out of scope of 64 since Scenarios 1 and 5
           of [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework] assume IPv6-only hosts.
           Thereofre this issue is not resolved and mitigation
           techniques outside the 64 protocols need to be used.  These
           techniques may allow to offload NAT64 resources and prefer
           native communications which do not involve translators.
           Avoiding NAT devices in the path is encouraged for mobile
           nodes for instance to save power consumption due to always-on
           traffic and maintaining NAT states.  An in-depth discussion
           can be found in DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts
           [I-D.wing-behave-dns64-config]

2.2.  Problems Addressed by 64

   Problems, identified in RFC4966, which are adequately addressed by
   the 64 proposal::

   1.  Constraints on network topology (as it relates to DNS-ALG; see
       Section 3.1 of [RFC4966])

          Analysis: This issue has mitigated severity as the DNS is
          separate from the NAT device.  Nevertheless, a minimal
          coordination may be required to ensure that the NAT64 to be
          crossed (the one to which the IPv4 Converted IPv6 address
          returned to a requesting host) must be in the path and has
          also sufficient resources to handle received traffic.

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           February 2010


   2.  Inappropriate translation of responses to A queries from IPv6
       nodes.

          Analysis: DNS64 does not translate A queries since the 64
          documents assume IPv6-only hosts, therefore due to reduced
          scope this concern has been resolved.

   3.  Address selection issues and resource consumption in a DNS-ALG
       with multi-addressed nodes

          Analysis: Since the DNS-ALG is not there and new connection
          initiation is not supported from IPv4 side, their is no need
          to maintain temporary states in anticipation of connections.

   4.  Limitations on DNS security capabilities when using a DNS-ALG.

          Analysis: A DNSSEC validating stub resolver behind a DNS64 in
          server mode is not supported.  Therefore if a host wants to do
          its own DNSSEC validation, and it wants to use a NAT64, the
          host has to also perform its own DNS64 synthesis.

   5.  Creation of a DoS (Denial of Service) threat relating to
       exhaustion of memory and address/port pool resources on the
       translator.

          Analysis: This specific DoS concern on Page 6 of [RFC4966] is
          under a DNS-ALG heading in that document, and refers to NAT-
          PT's creation of NAT mapping state when a DNS query occurred.
          With the new IPv6/IPv4 translation mechanisms, DNS queries do
          not create mapping state.  Thus, this concern is fully
          eliminated with the new IPv6/IPv4 translation mechanisms.

2.3.  Problems Addressed by NAT44 Translation Documents

   Some issues mentioned in RFC4966 were solved by RFC 4787 [RFC4787],
   RFC 5382 [RFC5382] and RFC 5508 [RFC5508].  At the time when NAT-PT
   was published these recommendations were not in place but they are
   orthogonal to the translation algorithm per se, therefore they could
   be implemented with NAT-PT.  On the other hand, NAT64 explicitly
   mentions that these recommendations need to be followed and thus
   should be seen as a complete specification.

   1.  Requirement for applications to use keepalive mechanisms to
       workaround connectivity issues caused by premature timeout for
       session table and BIB entries.

          Analysis: Since NAT64 follows some of the RFC4787, RFC5382 and
          RFC5508 requirements, there is a high lower bound for the



Penno, et al.            Expires August 25, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           analysis-64-translation           February 2010


          lifetime of sessions.  In NAT-PT this was unknown and
          applications needed to assume the worst case.  For instance,
          in NAT64, the lifetime for a TCP session is approximately 2
          hours, so not much keep-alive signalling overhead is needed.

   2.  Lack of address mapping persistence: Some applications require
       address retention between sessions.  The user traffic will be
       disrupted if a different mapping is used.  The use of the DNS-
       ALG to create address mappings with limited lifetimes means that
       applications must start using the address shortly after the
       mapping is created, as well as keep it alive once they start
       using it.

          Analysis: It is not clear if address persistence should be
          maintained only between sessions that overlap across time.
          Moreover, it is not clear if addresses persistence should be
          maintained between static and dynamic bindings.

          In the simpler case of address persistence between dynamic
          sessions that overlap in time, since NAT64 recommends the use
          of endpoint independent mapping, depending on how many other
          sessions established for the same endpoint, it may be the case
          that in many situations this is solved.  Having said that, the
          same network and port allocation scheme could be used in
          NAT-PT which would make it a non-issue.


3.  Conclusions

   The above analysis of the solutions provided by the 64 proposal shows
   that the majority of the problems that are not directly related to
   the decoupling of NAT and DNS remain unaddressed.

   This points to several shortcomings of 64 proposal which must be
   addressed if the future network deployments have to move reliably
   towards 64 as a solution to IPv6 - IPv4 interconnection.

   Some of the issues, as pointed out in RFC 4966, have possible
   solutions.  However these solutions will require significant updates
   to the 64 proposal, increasing its complexity.
