Internet-Draft   IPv6 via IPv4 Service Provider Networks       July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The original idea and the name of the mechanism (6rd) specified in
   this document is described in draft-despres-6rd [I-D.despres-6rd],
   which details a successful commercial "rapid deployment" of the 6rd
   mechanism by a residential Service Provider and is recommended
   background reading.

   This document describes the 6rd mechanism, extended for use in more
   general environments, and intended for advancement on the IETF
   Standards Track.  Throughout this document, the term 6rd is used to
   refer to the new mechanisms described here and 6to4 as that which is
   described in RFC 3056.

   6rd specifies a protocol mechanism to deploy IPv6 to sites via a
   Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network.  It builds on 6to4 [RFC3056],
   with the key differentiator that it utilizes an SP's own IPv6 address
   prefix rather than 2002::/16.  By using the SP's IPv6 prefix, the
   operational domain of 6rd is limited to the SP network and under its
   direct control.  From the perspective of customer sites and the IPv6
   Internet at large connected to the 6rd-enabled SP network, the IPv6
   service provided is equivalent to native IPv6.

   6rd does not translate IPv4 into IPv6, it encapsulates IPv6 in IPv4
   with a destination IPv4 address which is either encoded within the
   IPv6 destination address itself, or is the destination address of a
   preconfigured 6rd Border Relay router that can decapsulate the IPv4
   header and route the IPv6 packet outside the SP's IPv4 network.  This
   way, IPv6 packets follow the IPv4 routing topology within the SP
   network, and Border Relays are traversed only for IPv6 packets which
   are destined outside the SP's IPv4 network.  The 6rd mechanism is
   fully stateless, so the Border Relay routers may be addressed via
   anycast within the SP network for added resiliency.

   The 6rd Customer Edge router (6rd CE) plays a critical role in a 6rd
   deployment. 6rd decouples deployment of IPv6 on the "LAN" side of the
   6rd CE router from that on the "WAN" side, allowing IPv6 on either
   side to be deployed and evolve independently.  On the LAN (e.g.,
   "Home") side of the 6rd CE router, 6rd expects that IPv6 is
   implemented as it would be for any native dual-stack IP service
   delivered by the SP.  On the WAN side of the 6rd CE router, the 6rd
   CE WAN interface itself, the access network between it and partnering
   6rd equipment, and the OSS system including DHCP, AAA, etc. may
   remain IPv4-only (e.g., there is no need to deploy DHCPv6 [RFC3315],
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, IPv6 routing, create IPv6 address plans,
   etc. within the SP network to deliver IPv6 to the customer site).

   6rd relies on IPv4 and is designed to deliver "production-quality"

   dual-stack IPv6 and IPv4 Internet access to customer sites.  IPv6
   deployment within the SP network itself may continue for the SP's own
   purposes outside of delivering IPv6 service to customers.  Once IPv6
   is fully available, 6rd may be discontinued and IPv4 eventually
   turned off or tunneled over IPv6 as described in
   draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite
   [I-D.durand-softwire-dual-stack-lite].


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   6rd Delegated Prefix  The IPv6 prefix determined by the 6rd CE device
                         for use by hosts within the customer site.
                         This prefix can be considered logically
                         equivalent to a DHCPv6 IPv6 Delegated Prefix
                         [RFC3633], though it is calculated by combining
                         the 6rd SP Prefix, 6rd Domain ID, and end
                         user's IPv4 address obtained via IPv4
                         configuration methods.

   6rd SP Prefix         An IPv6 prefix selected by the Service Provider
                         for use by a given 6rd deployment.  This may be
                         the entire IPv6 prefix obtained from an RIR and
                         announced to the IPv6 Internet, or a more-
                         specific assigned just to given 6rd deployment.

   6rd CE                The 6rd "Customer Edge" router that sits
                         between an IPv6-enabled site and an IPv4-enable
                         SP network.  In a residential broadband
                         deployment this is sometimes referred to as the
                         "Residential Gateway (RG)," "Customer Premises
                         Equipment," (CPE) or "Internet Gateway Device"
                         (IGD).  This router has a one internal 6rd
                         Virtual Interface acting as an endpoint for the
                         IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation and forwarding, at
                         least one "6rd CE LAN Side" interface and "6rd
                         CE WAN Side" interface, respectively.

   6rd CE LAN Side       The functionality of a 6rd CE router that
                         serves the "Local Area Network (LAN)" or "Home"
                         side of a broadband service provider
                         connection.  The 6rd CE LAN Side interface is
                         fully IPv6 enabled.

   6rd CE WAN Side       The functionality of a 6rd CE Router that
                         serves the "Wide Area Network" or "Service
                         Provider" side of the 6rd CE Router.  The 6rd
                         CE WAN side is IPv4-only, except that it
                         delivers IPv6 packets encapsulated in IPv4 by
                         the 6rd Virtual Interface.

   6rd BR                A 6rd-enabled "Border Relay" router located at
                         the SP premises.  The 6rd BR router has at
                         least one IPv4 interface, an internal 6rd
                         Virtual Interface for multi-point tunneling,
                         and at least one IPv6 interface that is
                         reachable via the IPv6 Internet or IPv6-enabled
                         portion of the SP network.

   6rd Virtual Interface Internal multi-point tunnel interface where 6rd
                         encapsulation and decapsulation of IPv6 packets
                         inside IPv4 occurs.  A typical 6rd CE or 6rd BR
                         implementation requires one 6rd Virtual
                         Interface.

   6rd Domain ID         6rd deployment domains are differentiated by
                         areas of a network where RFC 1918 Private IPv4
                         addresses may overlap, or administrative
                         separation of a 6rd deployment is desired.


4.  6rd Prefix Delegation

   In 6rd, a customer site's IPv6 Delegated Prefix is derived from 3
   elements:

   1.  An IPv6 Prefix selected by the SP to be the common 6rd SP Prefix
       for the given 6rd deployment.

   2.  An optional Domain ID field

   3.  An assigned IPv4 address for the subscriber.  This IPv4 address
       may be a global IPv4 address, or a Private RFC 1918 [RFC1918]
       IPv4 address.

   From these three items, the 6rd Delegated Prefix is automatically



Townsley & Troan         Expires January 8, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   IPv6 via IPv4 Service Provider Networks       July 2009


   created for the customer site when IPv4 service is obtained.  From
   the perspective of the 6rd CE LAN-Side functionality, this IPv6
   delegated prefix is used in the same manner as a prefix obtained via
   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633].

   In 6to4, the location of the stored 32-bit IPv4 prefix is at a fixed
   location within the IPv6 address.  In 6rd it varies, so the size of
   the SP IPv6 prefix and the optional Domain ID is important.  Also, in
   6rd the SP chooses how many suffix bits of the IPv4 prefix are used
   in the algorithm to create the IPv6 prefix for its subscribers.  This
   allows the SP to adjust the balance between IPv6 addresses used by
   the 6rd mechanism, and how many are left to be delegated to end user
   sites.  To allow for stateless address auto-configuration and sub
   delegation a 6rd delegated prefix MUST be shorter than a /64.

   The 6rd Delegated Prefix is created by concatenating the 3 items
   above in order.  The sum of the number of bits used by each
   determines the size of the prefix that is delegated to the 6rd CE
   router for use by the customer site.


       /n      + d + (<= 32)  + (<= 16)   +      64       = 128 bits
   +-----------------+----------+-----------+-------------------------+
   | SP-prefix   | D |  V4ADDR  | Subnet ID |      Interface ID       |
   +-----------------+----------+-----------+-------------------------+
   |<---6rd Delegated Prefix--->|<---  End user's address space  ---->|


                                 Figure 1

   For example, if a 6rd SP Prefix (SP-prefix) is /28 bits, and we use
   24 suffix bits of an IPv4 address (V4ADDR), and choose a 4 bit domain
   ID (D), the delegated 6rd prefix for the site is 28 + 24 + 4 = 56
   bits.  This allows a /56 prefix to be delegated to each end user
   site.

   Embedding less than the full 32 bits of an IPv4 address is possible
   only with an aggregated block of IPv4 addresses for a given 6rd SP
   Prefix.  This may not be practical for global IPv4 addresses at a
   given SP, but is quite likely in a deployment where private addresses
   are being assigned to end users (for example 10.0.0.0/8).  If private
   addresses overlap within a given SP deployment, the Domain ID is
   suitable for disambiguating between them.  In effect, the common part
   of the IPv4 address is being replaced by a shorter Domain ID value
   which allows for a shorter IPv6 prefix used by 6rd.

   Multiple encodings are possible within a single 6rd deployment, but
   each must be used with a different IPv6 SP prefix.  For example, if



Townsley & Troan         Expires January 8, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   IPv6 via IPv4 Service Provider Networks       July 2009


   global and private IPv4 addresses are used within the same 6rd site,
   and the number of IPv4 bits encoded in the IPv6 Delegated Prefix
   varies between the two (e.g., 32 bits for global, and 24 bits for
   private), then a different 6rd SP Prefix must be used to disambiguate
   the two different encoding settings.  The 6rd Domain ID is only
   applicable among common 6rd IPv4 encoding styles.

   Since 6rd IPv6 prefixes are selected algorithmically from an IPv4
   address, changing the IPv4 address will cause a change in the IPv6
   delegated prefix which would normally ripple through the site's
   network and be disruptive.  As such, if possible the service provider
   should utilize a long-lived IPv4 address assignment for a given end
   user.

   6rd IPv6 address assignment and hence the IPv6 service itself is tied
   to the IPv4 address lease (whether set via DHCP, PPP, or otherwise),
   thus the 6rd service is also tied to this in terms of authorization,
   accounting, etc.  For example, the 6rd Delegated Prefix has the same
   DHCP lease time as its associated IPv4 address.  The prefix lifetimes
   advertised in Router Advertisements or used by DHCP on the 6rd CE LAN
   side MUST be equal or shorter than the IPv4 address lease time.

   For trouble-shooting and traceability, a 6rd IPv6 address and the
   associated IPv4 address for the same site can always be determined
   algorithmically.  This may be useful for referencing logs and other
   data at an SP that may be limited to IPv4 address assignment
   activity.


5.  Address selection

   A 6rd delegated prefix is a native IPv6 prefix in the 6rd site.  For
   the purpose of source and destination address selection the prefix
   should be treated as native IPv6 and no changes to the source address
   selection or destination address selection policy table [RFC3484] is
   needed.


6.  Provisioning the 6rd CE router

   The 6rd CE router must be configured with the 6rd SP prefix, the
   common IPv4 prefix length and a 6rd BR router IPv4 address.  The 6rd
   Domain ID is appended to the 6rd SP prefix, making it implicit within
   the SP 6rd IPv6 prefix (a given 6rd CE router is expected to exist in
   only one 6rd domain, making this possible).

   This information can be configured into the device in a variety of
   ways.  DHCP and IPCP are defined here, other automatic provisioning

                             implementation must handle receipt of this
                             option with zero padding up to a full 16
                             octets, for deployments preferring to send
                             a fixed size option.

   The client must validate the values received in the option as
   follows:

   The 6rd IPv6 prefix includes the domain ID embedded within it, sizing
   the v6prefix-length accordingly to cover both the 6rd SP prefix size
   and domain ID for this 6rd route entry.

   The 6rd router MUST install a default route to the relay.  Using the
   addresses in the example above with a 6rd IPv4 relay address of
   10.0.0.1, the RIB will look like:

      ::/0 -> 2001:ABC1:0000:0100::   (default route)
      2001:ABC1:6464:0100::/56 -> Null0 (6rd prefix sink route)


6.2.  6rd PPP IPCP option

   PPP [RFC1661], and PPPoE [RFC2516], remains a common way for a
   residential broadband end user to obtain configuration.  In such
   deployments, the DHCPINFORM message may be used along with the DHCP
   option described above after IPCP [RFC1332] completes.  However, PPP-
   based deployments often have no DHCP infrastructure in place,
   obtaining IP configuration solely from RADIUS servers and network
   equipment via IPCP.

   The PPP IPCP option is identical to the DHCP option, aside of the
   OPTION_6RD field, which is assigned by IANA.  It's fields and their
   function are identical, and not repeated here.

6.3.  6rd Broadband Forum TR-69 Object

   A large number of 6rd CE routers are managed directly by service
   providers via the Broadband Forum's "TR-69" management interface.
   This section will make informational reference to the associated
   Broadband Forum document that describes this object.

7.  Provisioning the Service Provider 6rd Border Relay

   As the 6rd IPv4 relay address is configurable, there is no need for a
   well known anycast address as specified in RFC3068 [RFC3068].  For
   increased reliability and load-balancing, the relay address can be an
   anycast address shared by all of the provider's relays for that 6rd
   domain.  As 6rd is stateless, any relay may be used at any time.  The
   6rd relay MUST use its anycast IPv4 address as the source address in
   packets relayed via the SP network to the 6rd CE router.

   Since 6rd uses provider address space, no specific routes need to be
   advertised externally for 6rd to work, neither in IPv6 or IPv4 BGP.
   However, the 6rd IPv4 relay anycast addresses must be advertised in
   the providers IGP.

   For example:

         SP prefix: 2001:ABC0::/28
         6rd domain id: 1
         Making the SP prefix a /32: 2001:ABC1::/32
         6rd IPv4 prefix: 10.0.0.0/8
         6rd router IPv4 address: 10.100.100.1
         6rd site IPv6 prefix: 2001:ABC1:6464:0100::/56


8.  Encapsulation considerations

   IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation is done as specified in 6to4 [RFC3056] and
   in Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers [RFC4213].

   IPv6 packets from a 6rd site are encapsulated in IPv4 packets when
   they leave the site via its external IPv4 connection.  The V4ADDR
   MUST be configured on the IPv4 interface.

   MTU and fragmentation issues for IPv6 in IPv4 tunnelling is discussed
   in detail in section 3.2 of RFC4213 [RFC4213]. 6rd's scope is limited
   to a service provider network.  If the MTU is well-managed such that
   the IPv4 MTU on the 6rd CE WAN interface is set so that no
   fragmentation occurs within the boundary of the SP, then the IPv6 MTU
   should be set to the IPv4 MTU minus the size of the encapsulating
   IPv4 header.  IPv4 Path MTU discovery MAY be used to adjust the MTU
   of the tunnel as described in section 3.2.2 of RFC4213 [RFC4213] or
   the IPv6 tunnel MTU may be explicitly configured.

   The IPv6 tunnel MTU, whether determined automatically or configured
   directly, MUST be advertised on the LAN-side by setting the MTU
   option in Router Advertisements [RFC4861] messages to the IPv6 tunnel
   MTU.

9.  Receiving Rules

   The 6rd router and relay on receiving a packet on its 6rd virtual
   interface SHOULD validate the packet as follows:

    - if IPv4 SA is not covered by the 6rd IPv4 prefix
      drop packet
    - if the IPv4 SA is the 6rd IPv4 relay address:
      goto ipv6_checks;
    - if IPv4 SA does not match the IPv4 address in the IPv6 SA
      drop packet

      ipv6_checks:
    - if IPv6 DA does not match the 6rd CE router's 6rd IPv6 prefix
      drop packet
    - if IPv6 forwarding leads to the packet being sent back out the
      same 6rd interface
      drop packet


10.  Transition Considerations

   6rd is intended to deliver a production-level service to customer
   sites.  Once 6rd IPv6 access is available, the SP network can migrate
   to IPv6 at its own pace with no affect on the customer.  When native
   IPv6 is fully available, the 6rd CE router is provisioned with IPv6
   on its WAN-side. 6rd and native IPv6 can coexist for a time while the
   customer site is adopts the new IPv6 native prefix, and then 6rd
   deprovisioned.  Alternatively, the same numbering plan for 6rd may be
   used for the native service, though this might require a "flag day"
   when the 6rd service is turned off and native service is initialized.

   While 6rd bears resemblance to 6to4 and utilizes the same
   encapsulation and base mechanisms, it is not intended as a
   replacement for 6to4.  Unlike 6to4, 6rd is for use only in an
   environment where a service provider cooperates closely to deliver
   the IPv6 service. 6to4 routes with the 2002::/16 prefix may exist
   alongside 6rd in the 6rd CE router, and doing so may offer some
   efficiencies when communicating directly with 6to4 routers.


11.  Security Considerations

   A 6to4 router as specified in RFC 3056 [RFC3056] can be used as an
   open relay.  It can be used to relay IPv6 traffic and as a traffic
   anonymizer.  By restricting the 6rd domain to within a provider
   network a 6rd router only needs to accept packets from a single or
   small set of known 6rd relay routers.  As such many of the threats

   against 6to4 as described in RFC3964 [RFC3964] do not apply.


12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new DHCP Option code point for
   OPTION_6RD.

   IANA is requested to assign a new IPCP Type for 6RD_IPCP_TYPE.
