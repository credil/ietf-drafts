Internet-Draft     Application Layer Statistics Blocks          May 2011


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3611 [RFC3611] defines seven report block formats for network
   management and quality monitoring.  However, some of these metrics
   are mostly for multicast inference of network characteristics (MINC)
   or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring and not widely applicable to other
   applications, e.g., video quality monitoring.  This document focuses
   on specifying new additional report block types used to convey video
   related parameters at application layer that are genericly designed
   for use in voice, audio and video services.

   The metrics belong to the class of transport level metrics defined in
   [MONARCH] (work in progress).


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Picture Type

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms compose of
      the key-frame and the Derivation frame.  Key-frame is also called
      a reference frame and used as a reference for predicting other
      pictures.  It is coded without prediction from other pictures.
      The Derivation frame is derived from Key-frame using prediction
      from the reference frame.



3.  Applicability

   The Metric Block defined in this document can be applied to any real
   time applications that convey video related parameters at application
   layer.

Internet-Draft     Application Layer Statistics Blocks          May 2011


4.1.  Application Layer Statistics Summary Report Block

   This block reports statistics beyond the information carried in the
   Statistics Summary Report Block RTCP packet specified in the section
   4.6 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].  Information is recorded about lost frame
   packets, duplicated frame packets, lost layered component packets,
   duplicated layered component packets.  Such information can be useful
   for network management and video quality monitoring.

   The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
   carried in the first part of the header.  Not all parameters need to
   be reported in each block.  Flags indicate which parameters are
   reported and which are not.  The fields corresponding to unreported
   parameters MUST be present, but are set to zero.  The receiver MUST
   ignore any Video Statistics Summary Report Block with a non-zero
   value in any field flagged as unreported.

   The Application Layer Statistics Summary Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft     Application Layer Statistics Blocks          May 2011


   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.

   Picture type indicator (T): 1 bits

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms compose of
      key-frame and derivation frame.  This field is used to indicate
      the frame type to be reported.  Bits set to 0 if the lost_frames
      field or dup_frames field contain a key_frame report or reference
      frame report, 1 if the lost_frames field and dup_frames field
      contain other derivation frame report.

   P: 1 bit

      Bit set to 1 if the partial_lost_frames field or the partial_dup_
      frames field contains a report, 0 otherwise.

   Rsd.: 2 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 5, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   begin_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

      interval.

   partial dup_frames: 32 bits

      Number of partial_dup_frames in the above sequence number
      interval.

   key frames impairment proportion:32bits

      The proportion of key frame impaired by packet loss,discard and
      duplication.


4.2.  Application Layer Loss and Discard Metrics Block

   This block reports Loss and Discard metrics statistics beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  The block
   reports separately on packets lost on the IP channel, and those that
   have been received but then discarded by the receiving jitter buffer.

   It is very useful to distinguish between packets lost by the network
   and those discarded due to jitter.  Both have equal effect on the
   quality of the video stream, however, having separate counts helps
   identify the source of quality degradation.  These fields MUST be
   populated, and MUST be set to zero if no packets have been received.

   Implementations MUST provide values for all the fields defined here.
   For certain metrics, if the value is undefined or unknown, then the
   specified default or unknown field value MUST be provided.

   The block is encoded as six 32-bit words:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      A Application Layer Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant <ALLDM>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the metrics block is an
      Interval or a Cumulative report,

   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.

   Picture type indicator (T): 1 bits

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms compose of
      key-frame and derivation frame.  This field is used to indicate
      the picture type to be reported.  Bits set to 0 if the Loss rate
      field and discard rate field contain a Key_frame report or
      reference frame report, 1 if the Loss rate field and discard rate
      field contain other derivation frame reports.

   reserved: 3 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   block length: 16 bits

      The constant 1, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Loss rate: 8 bits

      The fraction of RTP data packets from the source lost since the
      beginning of reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the
      binary point at the left edge of the field.  This value is
      calculated by dividing the total number of lost packets containing
      specified frame (e.g., Key frame) (after the effects of applying
      any error protection such as FEC) by the total number of packets
      expected, multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting
      the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the
      integer part.  The numbers of duplicated packets and discarded
      packets do not enter into this calculation.  Since receivers
      cannot be required to maintain unlimited buffers, a receiver MAY
      categorize late-arriving packets as lost.  The degree of lateness
      that triggers a loss SHOULD be significantly greater than that
      which triggers a discard.

Internet-Draft     Application Layer Statistics Blocks          May 2011


   Discard rate: 8 bits

      The fraction of RTP data packets from the source that have been
      discarded since the beginning of reception, due to late or early
      arrival, under-run or overflow at the receiving jitter buffer.
      This value is expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated by dividing
      the total number of discarded packets containing specified frame
      (e.g., Key Frame) (excluding duplicate packet discards) by the
      total number of packets expected, multiplying the result of the
      division by 256, limiting the maximum value to 255 (to avoid
      overflow), and taking the integer part.


4.3.  Application Layer Burst Metrics Block

   This block reports Burst metrics statistics beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  It reports on the
   combined effect of losses and discards, as both have equal effect on
   video quality.

   In order to properly assess the quality of a video stream, it is
   desirable to consider the degree of burstiness of packet loss RFC
   3357 [RFC3357].  Following the one-way loss pattern sample metrics
   discussed in [RFC3357], a measure of the spacing between consecutive
   network packet loss or error events, is a "loss distance".  The loss
   distance metric captures the spacing between the loss periods.  The
   duration of a loss or error event (e.g. and how many packets are lost
   in that duration) is a "loss period", the loss period metric captures
   the frequency and length (burstiness) of loss once it starts.  Delay
   reports include the transit delay between RTP end points and the end
   system processing delays, both of which contribute to the user
   perceived delay.

   Implementations MUST provide values for all the fields defined here.
   For certain metrics, if the value is undefined or unknown, then the
   specified default or unknown field value MUST be provided.

   The block is encoded as three 32-bit words:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      Appliation Layer Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant <ALBM>.

   reserved: 8 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the metrics block is an
      Interval or a Cumulative report,

   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.

   reserved: 4 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Loss Distance: 16 bits

      The mean duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the loss
      intervals that have occurred since the beginning of reception
      [DSLF].  The duration of each loss distance is calculated based
      upon the frames that mark the beginning and end of that period.
      It is equal to the timestamp of the end frame, plus the duration
      of the end frame, minus the timestamp of the beginning frame.  If
      the actual values are not available, estimated values MUST be
      used.  If there have been no burst periods, the burst duration
      value MUST be zero.

   Loss Period: 16 bits

      The mean duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the burst loss
      periods that have occurred since the beginning of reception
      [DSLF].  The duration of each period is calculated based upon the
      frame that marks the end of the prior burst loss and the frame
      that marks the beginning of the subsequent burst loss.  It is
      equal to the timestamp of the subsequent burst frame, minus the
      timestamp of the prior burst packet, plus the duration of the
      prior burst packet.  If the actual values are not available,
      estimated values MUST be used.  In the case of a gap that occurs
      at the beginning of reception, the sum of the timestamp of the
      prior burst packet and the duration of the prior burst packet are
      replaced by the reception start time.  In the case of a gap that
      occurs at the end of reception, the timestamp of the subsequent
      burst packet is replaced by the reception end time.  If there have
      been no gap periods, the gap duration value MUST be zero.

   Max Loss Duration of a single error: 16 bits

      The maximum loss duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the loss
      periods that have occurred since the beginning of reception.  The
      recommended max loss duration is specified as less than 16 ms in
      [DSLF], which provides a balance between interleaver depth
      protection from xDSL errors induced by impulse noise, delay added
      to other applications and video service QoE requirements to reduce
      visible impairments.

   Reserved: 16 bits

      All bits SHALL be set to 0 by the sender and SHALL be ignored on
      reception.

   block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns three new block type value in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:


         Name:       ALSS
         Long Name:  Application Layer Statistics Summary
         Value       <ALSS>
         Reference:  Section 4.1

         Name:       ALLDM
         Long Name:  Application Layer Loss and Discard Metrics
         Value       <ALLDM>
         Reference:  Section 4.2

         Name:       ALBM
         Long Name:  Application Layer Burst Metrics
         Value       <ALBM>
         Reference:  Section 4.3
   This document also registers three new SDP [RFC4566] parameters for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:

      *  "application-layer-loss-metrics"
      *  "application-layer -burst-metrics"
      *  "application-layer -stat-summary"

   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   The new RTCP XR report blocks proposed in this document introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
