Internet-Draft          Extended MKCOL for WebDAV          February 2009


1.  Introduction

   WebDAV [RFC4918] defines the HTTP [RFC2616] method MKCOL.  This
   method is used to create WebDAV collections on the server.  However,
   several WebDAV-based specifications (e.g., CalDAV [RFC4791]) define
   "special" collections - ones which are identified by additional
   values in the DAV:resourcetype property assigned to the collection
   resource, or through other means.  These "special" collections are
   created by new methods (e.g., MKCALENDAR).  The addition of a new
   MKxxx method for each new "special" collection adds to server
   complexity and is detrimental to overall reliability due to the need
   to make sure intermediaries are aware of these methods.

   This specification proposes an extension to the WebDAV MKCOL method
   that adds a request body allowing a client to specify WebDAV
   properties to be set on the newly created collection or resource.  In
   particular, the DAV:resourcetype property can be used to create a
   "special" collection, or other properties used to create a "special"
   resource.  This avoids the need to invent new MKxxx methods.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions of XML elements in this document use XML element type
   declarations (as found in XML Document Type Declarations), described
   in Section 3.2 of [W3C.REC-xml-20060816].

   When XML element types in the namespace "DAV:" are referenced in this
   document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:"
   will be prefixed to the element type names.

   Processing of XML by clients and servers MUST follow the rules
   described in Appendix A of [RFC4918].

3.  WebDAV extended MKCOL

   The WebDAV MKCOL request is extended to allow the inclusion of a
   request body.  The request body is an XML document containing a
   single DAV:mkcol XML element as the root element.  The Content-Type
   request header MUST be set appropriately for an XML body (e.g., set
   to "text/xml" or "application/xml").  XML-typed bodies for an MKCOL
   request that do not have DAV:mkcol as the root element are reserved
   for future usage.

   One or more DAV:set XML elements MAY be included in the DAV:mkcol XML

   element to allow setting properties on the collection as it is
   created.  In particular, to create a collection of a particular type,
   the DAV:resourcetype XML element MUST be included in a DAV:set XML
   element and MUST specify the expected resource type elements for the
   new resource, that MUST include the DAV:collection element that needs
   to be present for any WebDAV collection.

   As per the PROPPATCH method ([RFC4918], Section 9.2), servers MUST
   process any DAV:set instructions in document order (an exception to
   the normal rule that ordering is irrelevant).  Instructions MUST
   either all be executed or none executed.  Thus, if any error occurs
   during processing, all executed instructions MUST be undone and a
   proper error result returned.  Failure to set a property value on the
   collection MUST result in a failure of the overall MKCOL request.

   If a server attempts to make any of the property changes in an
   extended MKCOL request (i.e., the request is not rejected for high-
   level errors before processing the body), the response MUST be an XML
   document containing a single DAV:mkcol-response XML element, which
   MUST contain DAV:propstat XML elements with the status of each
   property.

   In all other respects the behavior of the extended MKCOL request
   follows that of the standard MKCOL request.

3.1.  Extended MKCOL Support

   A server supporting the features described in this document, MUST
   include "extended-mkcol" as a field in the DAV response header from
   an OPTIONS request on any URI that supports use of the extended MKCOL
   method.

3.1.1.  Example: Using OPTIONS for the Discovery of Support for Extended
        MKCOL

   >> Request <<

   OPTIONS /addressbooks/users/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: addressbook.example.com

3.2.  Status Codes

   As per Section 9.3.1 of [RFC4918].

3.3.  Additional Precondition for Extended MKCOL

   WebDAV ([RFC4918], Section 16) defines preconditions and
   postconditions for request behavior.  This specification adds the
   following precondition for the extended MKCOL request.

   Name:  valid-resourcetype

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Use with:  Typically 403 (Forbidden)

   Purpose:  (precondition) -- The server MUST support the specified
      resourcetype value for the specified collection.

3.4.  Example: Successful Extended MKCOL Request

   This example shows how the extended MKCOL request is used to create a
   collection of a fictitious type "special-resource".

4.  Replacing Existing MKxxx Methods

   One of the goals of this extension is to eliminate the need for other
   extensions to define their own variant of MKCOL to create the special
   collections they need.  This extension can be used to replace
   existing MKxxx methods in other extensions as detailed below.  If a
   server supports this extension and the other extension listed, then
   the server MUST support use of the extended MKCOL method to achieve

Internet-Draft          Extended MKCOL for WebDAV          February 2009


   the same result as the MKxxx method of the other extension.

4.1.  MKCALENDAR Replacement

   CalDAV defines the MKCALENDAR method to create a calendar collection
   as well as set properties during creation ([RFC4791], Section 5.3.1).

   The extended MKCOL method can be used instead by specifying both DAV:
   collection and CALDAV:calendar-collection XML elements in the DAV:
   resourcetype property, set during the extended MKCOL request.

4.1.1.  Example: Replacing MKCALENDAR with MKCOL

   The first example below shows an MKCALENDAR request containing a
   CALDAV:mkcalendar XML element in the request body, and returning a
   CALDAV:mkcalendar-response XML element in the response body.  The
   second example shows the equivalent extended MKCOL request with the
   same request and response XML elements.

   >> MKCALENDAR Request <<

   MKCALENDAR /home/lisa/calendars/events/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: calendar.example.com

   <C:mkcalendar xmlns:D="DAV:"
                 xmlns:C="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav">

         <D:displayname>Lisa's Events</D:displayname>
       </D:prop>
     </D:set>
   </C:mkcalendar>
