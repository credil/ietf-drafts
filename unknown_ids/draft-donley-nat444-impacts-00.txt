         Assessing the Impact of NAT444 on Network Applications
                     draft-donley-nat444-impacts-00

Abstract

   NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service
   Providers to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while
   transitioning to IPv6.  This technology adds an extra Large-Scale NAT
   ("LSN") in the Service Provider network, thereby resulting in two
   NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications
   independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet
   services using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and
   vendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding a
   second layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common
   Internet applications.

Internet-Draft               NAT444 impacts                 October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Current projections suggest that IANA will exhaust its free pool of
   IPv4 addresses in 2011.  IPv6 is the solution to the IPv4 depletion
   problem; however, the transition to IPv6 will not be completed prior
   to IPv4 exhaustion.  NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444] is one transition
   mechanism that will allow Service Providers to multiplex customers
   behind a single IPv4 address, which will allow many legacy devices
   and applications some IPv4 connectivity without requiring a home
   router upgrade.  While NAT444 does provide basic IPv4 connectivity,
   it breaks a number of advanced applications.  This document describes
   suboptimal behaviors of NAT444 in our test environments.


2.  NAT444 Findings

   Overall, NAT444 was able to provide IPv4 connectivity for many basic
   operations conducted by consumers; however, there are several areas
   of concern with respect to the nested NAT environments.  In
   particular, many advanced tasks (e.g. peer-to-peer seeding, video
   streaming, some Internet gaming, and IPv6 transition technologies
   such as 6to4 [RFC3056] and Teredo [RFC4380]) fail outright or are
   subject to severe service degradation.  We observed that performance
   often differs from vendor to vendor and from test environment to test
   environment, and the results are somewhat difficult to predict.

2.1.  NAT444 Additional Challenges

   There are other challenges that arise when using shared IPv4 address
   space, as with NAT444.  Some of these challenges include:

   o  Loss of geolocation information - Often, translation zones will
      cross traditional geographic boundaries.  Since the source
      addresses of packets traversing an LSN are set to the external
      address of the LSN, it is difficult for external entities to
      associate IP/Port information to specific locations/areas.

   o  Lawful Intercept/Abuse Response - Due to the nature of NAT444
      address sharing, it will be hard to determine the customer/
      endpoint responsible for initiating a specific IPv4 flow based on
      source IP address alone.  Content providers, service providers,
      and law enforcement agencies will need to use new mechanisms (e.g.
      logging port/IP information, timestamps etc) to potentially
      mitigate this new problem.  This may impact the timely response to
      various identification requests.

   o  Antispoofing - Multiplexing users behind a single IP address can
      lead to situations where traffic from that address triggers

      antispoofing/DDoS protection mechanisms, resulting in
      unintentional loss of connectivity for some users.


3.  Test Cases

   The test cases illustrated below are designed to simulate an average
   home user experience for various combinations of clients behind a
   single or multiple LSN devices.

                             +---------------+

   This is a typical case for a client accessing content on the
   Internet.  For this case, we focused on basic web browsing, voice and
   video chat, instant messaging, video streaming (using YouTube, Google
   Videos , etc.), Torrent leeching and seeding, FTP, and gaming.
   Applications used in this case generally worked better than other
   topologies.  However, Netflix streaming performance was generally
   slow and erratic.  Also, large FTP downloads experienced issues when
   translation mappings timed out.  Bittorrent seeding also failed
   during some tests.  Finally, when a feature on XBOX is used to
   determine the Network Settings, it generates a warning that NAT
   settings are not ideal and may slow down the experience when more

   than one client is connected.  Gaming generally worked, but had
   connectivity problems behind one specific LSN platform.  Slingcatcher
   video streaming failed.

   This is similar to Case 1, except that two clients are behind the
   same LSN and in the same home network.  This test case was conducted
   to observe any change in speed in basic web browsing and video
   streaming.  It is generally noted that the performance decreases in
   bandwidth intensive applications.  Torrent leeching was performed
   from the two clients to a public server in the Internet.  The
   observed speed was considerably slower than with only one client
   connected to the home network.  Torrent seeding fails.  Netflix video
   streaming is also observed to be considerably choppy.  When streaming
   starts on one client, it does not start on the other, generating a
   message saying that the Internet connection is too slow.

   In this scenario, the two clients are under the same LSN but behind
   two different gateways.  This simulates connectivity between two
   residential subscribers on the same ISP.  We tested peer-to-peer
   applications. utorrent leeching and limewire leeching passed, while
   utorrent seeding and limewire seeding failed.

   This test case is similar to Case 1 but with the addition of another
   identical ISP.  This topology allows us to test traffic between two
   residential customers connected across the Internet.  We focused on
   client-to-client applications such as IM and peer-to-peer.  Instant
   messaging applications including Skype and Google Talk perform well.
   Skype video and voice chat also performed well.  However, FTP
   transfers and peer-to-peer seeding failed.
