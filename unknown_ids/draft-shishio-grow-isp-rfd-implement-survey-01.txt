              Route Flap Damping Deployment Status Survey
             draft-shishio-grow-isp-rfd-implement-survey-01

Abstract

   BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route
   stability.  It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing
   CPU load on the routers.

   But it has side-effects.  Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended not to use
   Route Flap Damping (see RIPE-378).

   Now, some researchers propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive
   parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable].

   This document describes results of a survey conducted amoung service
   provider on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.

   Free format

3.6.1.  Japan

   -Our peer seems to have damping enabled, and our prefix gets damped
   sometimes.

   -We do not enable damping because we think that customers want a non-
   damped route.

   -From the perspective of a downstream ISP, if our upstream told us
   that an outage occurred because a route was damped, I may call and
   ask "is it written in the agreement that you will do this?"

   -We use damping pretty heavily

   -I had RFD turned on until this morning when I discovered our router
   has CSCtd26215 issues.  I would like to turn on a "useful" RFD.

3.6.2.  All

   No results yet!


4.  Summary of data

   From the survey we see that there are many service providers with RFD

   disabled.  The reason varies among providers, but it is clear that
   there are those who wish that RFD was made useful.
   [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable] describes how to improve RFD with minor
   changes to some parameters.  From the comments in the survey, the
   most significant fear of enabling RFD is its impact on customers.
