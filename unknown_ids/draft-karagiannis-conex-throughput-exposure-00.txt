Abstract

   This document describes a possible implementation complexity problem 
   associated with the current Conex concept defined by the ConEx WG 
   and it proposes a solution to this. This problem occurs due 
   to the fact that it is complex to measure the congestion rate, 
   at each intermediate Conex enabled device.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput              April 2011


1.  Introduction

   The ConEx working group is defining how IP packets will carry 
   additional ConEx information. This document describes a possible  
   implementation complexity problem associated with the current 
   Conex concept defined by the ConEx WG and it proposes a solution to 
   this. This problem occurs due to the fact that it is complex 
   to measure the congestion rate, at each intermediate 
   Conex enabled device. A conex enabled device can be for example, a 
   policer or an audit device. Moreover, this document provides a 
   solution to this problem, by measuring and monitoring the per flow 
   throughput on each intermediate Conex enabled device instead of 
   measuring and monitoring the per flow congestion rate on each 
   intermediate Conex enabled device.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition to the terminology specified in [draft-ietf-conex-
   abstract-mech-01] and [draft-ietf-conex-concepts-uses-01] the 
   following terms are used and defined in this document. 
   
   O transport path throughput calculated at the sender: The per flow 
     transport sending rate as a function of the congestion rate, round-
     trip time, and segment size. The transport path throughput 
     calculated at the sender using the TCP throughput equation 
     specified in [RFC5348]. Note that in [RFC5348] the term congestion 
     rate is denoted as loss event rate. According to [RFC5348] a loss 
     event is defined as one or more lost or marked packets from a 
     window of data, where a marked packet refers to a congestion 
     indication (CE) from Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) 
     [RFC3168]; 

   O throughput exposure signal (Conex-Throughput): a ConEx signal 
     encoded in IP packet headers from the sender to the network to 
     exposure the transport path throughput calculated at the sender. 

   O intermediate Conex enabled device: each Conex enabled device 
     located on a communication path between a sender and a receiver. 

   O measured per flow throughput at intermediate Conex enabled devices: 
     the per flow rate of packets that are passing through the output
     buffer of an intermediate Conex enabled device and 
     are not dropped, (2) are not ECN CE marked. Each Conex enabled 
  device is only holding state on a flow if it first receives a   
  Throughput exposure signal.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput              April 2011

  O throughput exposure rate at intermediate Conex devices: the 
    per flow rate of the received throughput exposure signals (Conex-
    Throughput). Each Conex enabled device is only holding state on a 
    flow if it first receives a Throughput exposure signal (Conex- 
    Throughput).


2. Implementation Complexity Problem

   The mentioned problem is related to the fact that in the context of 
   Conex it is complex to measure the congestion rate, see [RFC5348] at 
   each intermediate Conex enabled device, see Figure 1. A conex enabled 
   device, can be a policer or an audit device. In particular, the main 
   solution proposed in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01] on measuring 
   the congestion rate on an audit device is: "The auditor could monitor 
   TCP flows or aggregates of flows, only holding state on a flow if it 
   first sends a Credit or a Re-Echo-Loss marking.  The auditor could 
   detect retransmissions by monitoring sequence numbers.  It would 
   assure that (volume of retransmitted data) <= (volume of data marked 
   Re-Echo-Loss).  Traffic would only be auditable in this way if it 
   conformed to the standard TCP protocol and the IP payload was not 
   encrypted (e.g. with IPsec). ", from 
   [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]. 
   
   In other words, an audit device needs to keep per flow (individual or 
   aggregated) state after it receives a credit or Re-echo-Loss marking 
   in order to measure the per flow congestion rate. In addition to this 
   the audit device must be able to read the TCP header in order to 
   observe the TCP header numbers. This is complex to be implemented and 
   it is not always possible, e.g., when the IP payload is 
   encrypted (e.g. with IPsec). In this way the audit device is also 
   able to take into consideration also the number of ECN CE marked 
   packets that were dropped by nodes located upstream.
   Note that in the opinion of the authors of this draft the same method 
   of measuring the congestion rate at a policer is required as the one 
   applied at the audit device.
  
   3. Conex Throughput Solution 

   This document provides a solution to this problem, see Figure 2, by 
   measuring and monitoring the per flow throughput on each intermediate 
   Conex enabled device instead of measuring and monitoring the per flow 
   congestion rate on each intermediate Conex enabled device.

   In addition to this, a sender calculates the per flow transport path 
   throughput, which describes the sending rate as a function of the 
   congestion rate, round-trip time, and segment size. The transport 
   path throughput calculated at the sender can be accomplished using 
   the TCP throughput equation specified in [RFC5348].
   Moreover, the sender uses the throughput exposure signal (Conex-
   Throughput) that is a ConEx signal encoded in IP packet headers from 
   the sender to the network to exposure the transport path throughput 
   calculated at the same sender.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput              April 2011


   Each intermediate Conex enabled device measures the per flow 
   throughput, which is the per flow rate of packets that are passing
   through the output buffer of an intermediate Conex enabled device and   
   (1) not dropped, (2) are not ECN CE marked. Each Conex enabled device
   is only holding state on a flow if it first receives a Throughput 
   exposure signal (Conex-Throughput).  Note that in this way the 
   intermediate Conex enabled device can also take into account the ECN 
   CE marked packets that were dropped by nodes located upstream. 

   Furthermore, each intermediate Conex enabled device measures 
   the throughput exposure rate at intermediate Conex devices, which is 
   the per flow rate of the received throughput exposure signals (Conex-
   Throughput). Each Conex enabled device is only holding state on a 
   flow if it first receives a Throughput exposure signal (Conex-
   Throughput).
   It is important to note that the per flow throughput measured by  
   intermediate Conex enabled devices located closer to the sender can 
   be higher than the per flow throughput measured by Conex enabled 
   devices located closer to the receiver.

   Identical use cases and applications can be used as the ones 
   described in [draft-ietf-conex-concepts-uses-01], using the same 
   semantics related to the exposed and measured congestion. The only 
   difference is now that the intermediate Conex enabled devices can 
   monitor and process the "Measured per flow throughput" and the 
   "Throughput exposure rate", instead of monitoring and processing the 
    measured congestion rate and the signaled exposed congestion rate, 
   respectively. An example of this is that each intermediate Congestion 
   enabled device ensures that the "Throughput exposure rate" is always 
   less or equal to the "Measured per flow throughput".

3.1.  Requirements for the ConEx Signal

      The following requirements apply to the Conex-Throughput signal, 
      which are in line with most of the requirements presented in 
     [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]:
       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be visible to internetwork layer 
          devices along the entire path from the transport sender to the 
          transport receiver.  

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be useful under only partial 
          deployment.

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be timely.  

       o)  The ConEx Signal SHOULD be accurate.  

   {More details will be provided in a next version of this draft}

3.2.  Codepoint Encoding

   This encoding involves signaling the following 
   codepoint:
   Conex-Throughput: a ConEx signal 
   encoded in IP packet headers from the sender to the network to 
   exposure the transport path throughput calculated at the sender. 

3.3. Conex Throughput Components
  
   The same Conex enabled devices can be used as the ones specified in   
  [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01].

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput              April 2011

3.3.1 Modified Senders 

   The senders should be able to support a TCP based 
   congestion control protocol, e.g., [RFC5681] in combination with 
   [RFC3168], [RFC5348]. In addition, the sender MUST be able to support  
   the following functionality:

   O calculates the transport path throughput calculated: The per flow 
     transport sending rate as a function of the congestion rate, round-
     trip time, and segment size. The transport path throughput 
     calculated at the sender using the TCP throughput equation 
     specified in [RFC5348]. Note that in [RFC5348] the term congestion 
     rate is denoted as loss event rate. According to [RFC5348] a loss 
     event is defined as one or more lost or marked packets from a 
     window of data, where a marked packet refers to a congestion 
     indication (CE) from Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) 
     [RFC3168]. 

   O generates and encodes ConEx-Throughput signals in IP packet headers 
    from the sender to the network to exposure the transport path 
    throughput calculated at the same sender. 

 3.3.2 Intermediate Conex Enabled Devices

   The same intermediate Conex enabled devices could be used as the 
   intermediate Conex enabled devices specified in [draft-ietf-conex-  
   abstract-mech-01], e.g., Policer and Audit. The only difference is 
   now that the intermediate Conex enabled devices MUST monitor and MUST 
   process the "Measured per flow throughput" and the "Throughput 
   exposure rate", instead of monitoring and processing the measured 
   congestion rate and the signaled exposed congestion rate, 
   respectively.

3.3.3 Modified Receivers 

   The receivers should be able to support a TCP based 
   congestion control protocol, e.g., [RFC5681] in combination with 
   [RFC3168], [RFC5348]. In addition, the receiver MUST be able to 
   support the following functionality:

   O Measure per flow throughput: the per flow rate of packets that are 
     Received and (1) are not dropped, (2) are not ECN CE marked. 

   O Measure throughput exposure rate at intermediate Conex devices: the 
     per flow rate of the received throughput exposure signals.
