Abstract 
    
   IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between sites
   across an IP backbone. These VPNs can be supported using BGP/MPLS and
   the connections can be created by using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs). 
   
   New RSVP-TE extensions are required to support multiple MPLS-TE based
   BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs that are interconnected via the same Provider Edge 
   (PE) routers. These extensions are necessary so that RSVP control 
   messages from the Customer Edge (CE) equipment, such as Path messages
   and Resv messages, are appropriately handled by the PE routers. This
   document defines the procedure and objects that enable a PE router
   to distinguish between BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs.

1. Introduction 
    
   Some Service Providers would like to use BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs to support 
   connections between Customer Edge (CE) sites. These connections can
   be established using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched 
   Paths (LSPs). [RFC3209] defines extensions to RSVP for establishing a
   customer LSP using MPLS. In order to establish a customer MPLS-TE LSP
   over BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, it is necessary for the RSVP control messages,
   including Path messages and Resv messages described in [RFC3209], to
   be appropriately handled by the Provider Edge (PE) routers. The
   requirements for supporting BGP/MPLS RSVP-TE based IP-VPNs are
   documented in [E2E-RSVP-TE].
    
   [RSVP-L3VPN] defines the new types of existing objects (i.e. SESSION,
   SENDER_TEMPLATE, FILTERSPEC and RSVP_HOP) described in [RFC2205] to 
   establish reservations for customer flows in the context of a 
   BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. Section 7.4 (Support for CE-CE RSVP-TE) of 
   [RSVP-L3VPN], describes the procedure used in this draft. 
    
   This document defines new object types in SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE 
   and FILTERSPEC object to establish a customer MPLS TE LSP in the 
   context of BGP/IP-VPNs and describes a procedure of RSVP control 
   messages including new object types. The new object types are 
   defined in section 3.1 (Object Definitions) and the specific
   procedure is described in section 3.2 (Handling). 
    
2. Problem Statement 
    
   Customer MPLS TE LSPs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs are shown in
   figure 1. Here, we make the following set of assumptions. 
    
   1. VPN1 and VPN2 are completely different customers. 
   2. CE1 and CE3 are head-end routers. 
   3. CE2 and CE4 are tail-end routers. 
   4. A same address (e.g., 192.0.2.1) is assigned at CE2 and CE4.

     Figure 1 Customer MPLS TE LSPs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs 
    
   Consider that customers in VPN1 and VPN2 would like to establish a
   customer MPLS TE LSP between their sites (i.e., between CE1 and CE2,
   between CE3 and CE4). In this situation the following RSVP-TE 
   Path messages would be sent:
   
      1. CE1 would send a Path message to PE1 to establish
         the MPLS TE LSP (VPN1) between CE1 and CE2.
         
      2. CE3 would also send a Path message to PE1 to establish
         the MPLS TE LSP (VPN2) between CE1 and CE2. 
      
   After receiving each Path messages, PE1 can identify each 
   Path message from each incoming interface. Afterwards, PE1
   forwards the messages to PE2 by routing information described in
   [RFC4364] and [RFC4659]. However, the current RSVP control message
   specification [RFC3209] does not specify how PE2 is able to identify
   each Path message (i.e., the Path message for VPN1 and VPN2). 
   Additionally, Resv messages per VPN sent from PE2 cannot be 
   identified at PE1.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 K.Kumaki, et al.                                              [Page 4]
draft-kumaki-murai-ccamp-rsvp-te-l3vpn-02                  March 2010

   
   In order to distinguish between the VPN1 Path/Resv messages and the 
   VPN2 Path/Resv messages, an identifier in Path/Resv messages is 
   required. This document proposes a number of additional objects 
   that extend RSVP. These new object types are SESSION, 
   SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTERSPEC object. These new objects will act as
   identifiers and allow PEs to distinguish Path/Resv messages per
   VPN in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. 


3. Protocol Extensions and Procedures 
    
3.1 Object Definitions 
    
3.1.1 LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 and LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 SESSION Object 
    
   The LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) SESSION Object appears in RSVP 
   messages that ordinarily contain a SESSION Object and are sent 
   between ingress PE and egress PE in either direction. The object MUST 
   NOT be included in any RSVP messages that are sent outside of the 
   provider's backbone. 
    
   The LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 SESSION Object is analogous to the  
   LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 SESSION Object, using a VPN-IPv6 address  
   ([RFC4659]) instead of a VPN-IPv4 address ([RFC4364]). 
    
   The formats of the objects are as follows: 
    
   Class = SESSION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 C-Type = TBA

   The VPN-IPv4 tunnel sender address (respectively VPN-IPv6 tunnel 
   sender address) field contains an address of the VPN-IPv4 
   (respectively VPN-IPv6) address family encoded as specified in 
   [RFC4364] and [RFC4659]. 
    
   The LSP ID is identical to the LSP ID field in the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4  
   and LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE objects as per [RFC3209]. 
    
3.1.3 LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 and LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC objects 
    
   The LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) FILTER_SPEC Object appears in 
   RSVP messages that ordinarily contain a FILTER_SPEC Object and are 
   sent between ingress PE and egress PE in either direction (such as 
   Resv, ResvError, and ResvTear).  The object MUST NOT be included in 
   any RSVP messages that are sent outside of the provider's backbone.

   The format of the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 FILTER_SPEC Object is identical  
   to the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 SENDER_TEMPLATE Object. 
    
      Class = FILTER SPECIFICATION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 C-Type = TBA 
    
   The format of the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC Object is identical  
   to the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE Object. 
    
3.1.4 VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 RSVP_HOP objects 
    
   The format of the VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 RSVP_HOP objects are 
   identical to objects described in [RSVP-L3VPN]. 
    
3.2 Handling 
    
   It assumes that ingress PEs and egress PEs in the context of BGP/MPLS 
   IP-VPNs have RSVP capabilities. 
    
3.2.1 Path Message Processing at Ingress PE 
    
   When a Path message arrives at the ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1), the 
   PE needs to establish suitable Path state and forward the Path 
   message on to the egress PE (PE2 in Figure 1). In this section 
   we described the message handling process at the ingress PE. 
    
      1. CE1 would send a Path message to PE1 to establish the MPLS TE
         LSP (VPN1) between CE1 and CE2. The Path message
         is addressed to the eventual destination (the receiver at the
         remote customer site) and carries the IP Router Alert option,
         in accordance with [RFC2205].  The ingress PE must recognize
         the router alert, intercept these messages and process them
         as RSVP signalling messages. 
    
      2. When the ingress PE receives a Path message from a CE that is
         addressed to the receiver, the VRF that is associated with the
         incoming interface can be identified (this step does not 
         deviate from current behavior). 
         
      3. The tunnel end point address of the receiver is looked up in 
         the appropriate VRF, and the BGP Next-Hop for that tunnel end
         point address is identified. The next-hop is the egress PE.  
         
      4. A new LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 SESSION Object is 
         constructed, containing the Route Distinguisher (RD) that is
         part of the VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 route prefix for this tunnel end
         point address, and the IPv4/IPv6 tunnel end point address from
         the original SESSION Object.  
         

K.Kumaki, et al.                                              [Page 8]
draft-kumaki-murai-ccamp-rsvp-te-l3vpn-02                  March 2010


      5. A new LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-Pv4/IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE Object is 
         constructed, with the original IPv4/IPv6 tunnel sender address 
         from the incoming SENDER_TEMPLATE plus the RD that is used by
         the PE to advertise the prefix for the customers VPN.
       
      6. A new Path message is sent containing all the objects from the
         original Path message, replacing the original SESSION and 
         SENDER_TEMPLATE objects with the new 
         LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 type objects. This Path message is
         sent without IP Router Alert. 
    
3.2.2 Path Message Processing at Egress PE 
    
   In this section we described the message handling process at the 
   egress PE. 
   
       1. When a Path message arrives at the egress PE (PE2 in Figure 1)
          , it is addressed to the PE itself, and is handed to RSVP for
          processing. 
          
       2. The router extracts the RD and IPv4/IPv6 address from the 
          LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 SESSION Object, and determines
          the local VRF context by finding a matching VPN-IPv4 prefix 
          with the specified RD that has been advertised by this router
          into BGP.  
   
       3. The entire incoming RSVP message, including the VRF 
          information, is stored as part of the Path state. 
    
       4. The egress PE can now construct a Path message which differs 
          from the Path message it received in the following ways: 
    
            a.  Its tunnel end point address is the IP address extracted
                from the SESSION Object; 
    
            b.  The SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects are converted
                back to IPv4-type/IPv6-type by discarding the attached
                RD; 
    
            c. The RSVP_HOP Object contains the IP address of the
               outgoing interface of the egress PE and an LIH, as per
               normal RSVP processing. 
    
        5. The egress PE then sends the Path message on towards its
           tunnel end point address over the interface identified above.
           This Path message carries the IP Router-Alert option as
           required by [RFC2205].

3.2.3 Resv Processing at Egress PE 
    
   When a receiver at the customer site originates a Resv message for 
   the session, normal RSVP procedures apply until the Resv, making its 
   way back towards the sender, arrives at the "egress" PE (it is 
   "egress" with respect to the direction of data flow, i.e.  PE2 in 
   figure 1).  On arriving at PE2, the SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects 
   in the Resv, and the VRF in which the Resv was received, are used to 
   find the matching Path state stored previously. 
    
   The PE constructs a Resv message to send to the RSVP HOP stored in 
   the Path state, i.e., the ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1).  The LSP 
   TUNNEL IPv4/IPv6 SESSION Object is replaced with the same 
   LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 SESSION Object received in the Path. The 
   LSP TUNNEL IPv4/IPv6 FILTER_SPEC Object is replaced with a 
   LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC Object, which copies the 
   VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address from the LSP TUNNEL SENDER_TEMPLATE 
   received in the matching Path message. 
   
   The Resv message MUST be addressed to the IP address contained within  
   the RSVP_HOP Object in the Path message. 
    
3.2.4 Resv Processing at Ingress PE 
    
   Upon receiving a Resv message at the ingress PE (with respect to data 
   flow, i.e.  PE1 in Figure 1), the PE determines the local VRF context 
   and associated Path state for this Resv by decoding the received 
   SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects.  It is now possible to generate a 
   Resv message to send to the appropriate CE.  The Resv message sent to 
   the ingress CE will contain LSP TUNNEL IPv4/IPv6 SESSION and LSP 
   TUNNEL FILTER_SPEC objects, derived from the appropriate Path state. 
    
4.  Security Considerations 
    
   This document defines RSVP-TE extensions for BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. Hence 
   the security of the RSVP-TE extensions relies on the security of 
   RSVP-TE extensions for LSP tunnels. 
    
   The security issues are described in the existing RSVP-TE extensions 
   for LSP tunnels. [RFC3209] 
    
5.  IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA maintains a registry of RSVP parameters. As described in Section
   3 (Protocol Extensions and Procedures) six new Class Types (C-types)
   have been defined. IANA is requested to make the following
   allocations from the "RSVP C-Types" sub-registry:

   Class = FILTER SPECIFICATION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 C-Type = TBA 
   Class = FILTER SPECIFICATION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 C-Type = TBA
