Internet-Draft  PS:Diameter Prefix Delegation Application  November 2007


Abstract

   Point-to-point link model requires unique prefixes to be assigned to
   each interface of the mobile nodes.  In NEMO, home agents need to
   assign unique prefixes to mobile routers.  Prefix management in
   point-to-point links and in NEMO will be facilitated if AAA servers
   can delegate prefixes.  This document identifies the following use
   cases where Diameter prefix delegation application is needed.  In
   16NG, prefix delegation only occurs between an Access Router and a
   mobile node, and there is no discussion about how an Access Router
   acquires prefix from an external entity.  NEMO deals with
   synchronization of Mobile Network prefixes between a Mobile Router
   and a Home Agent, while the method is agnostic to the way that a Home
   Agent gets prefix from back end servers.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6, Proxy
   Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message pair is used
   to allocate prefix from a Local Mobile Anchor for a Mobile Node's
   interface but how a Local Mobile Anchor gets prefixes from external
   server is currently left open.  Next, the document identifies
   requirements on a AAA-based prefix delegation application.

Internet-Draft  PS:Diameter Prefix Delegation Application  November 2007


1.  Terminology

   Prefix Delegation (PD):  The process by which a router or a host
      obtains a prefix dynamically.


2.  Introduction and Motivation

   Prefix assignment for an IPv6 node (host or router) is essential to
   IPv6 address formulation.  Even though IPv6 address space is large
   enough, it still makes sense for operators to manage addresses in a
   central way, e.g. using central DHCPv6 servers or AAA servers.
   Delegating prefix from a central server to a prefix user (e.g. a host
   or router) needs communication between different network entities.

   Prefix delegation is widely discussed in IETF 16NG, NEMO, and NETLMM
   Working Group respectively.  Corresponding solutions are also
   introduced.  But these solutions only solve a part of the problem.
   In 16NG, an Access Router allocates a mobile node's prefix using
   Router Advertisement message defined in [RFC4861]. and there is no
   discussion about how the Access Router acquires prefixes from
   external entity.  NEMO deals with synchronization of Mobile Network
   prefixes between a Mobile Router and a Home Agent, while the method
   is agnostic to the way that a Home Agent gets prefixes from back end
   servers.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6 [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6], Binding
   Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages are used to
   allocate prefixes from a Local Mobile Anchor to a mobile node, but
   how the Local Mobile Anchor gets prefixes from external server is out
   of the scope.

   [RFC3633] defines Prefix Delegation options to provide a mechanism
   for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  But there is no existing mechanism to
   manage prefixes dynamically by an AAA server.

   Making use of AAA infrastructure for prefix management can solve the
   aforementioned problems in a uniform way.


3.  Problem Description

3.1.  Prefix Management in Access Routers

   [RFC4968] provides different IPv6 link models that are suitable for
   IEEE 802.16 based networks and provides analysis of various
   considerations for each link model and the applicability of each link
   model under different deployment scenarios.  As to IPv6 addressing,
   there are two models, shared link model and point-to-point link



Sarikaya & Xia             Expires May 9, 2008                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  PS:Diameter Prefix Delegation Application  November 2007


   model.  In the former model, an IPv6 prefix is shared by multiple
   MNs.  While in the latter model, a prefix is only assigned to one
   interface of MN.  Different MNs can't share a prefix, and an
   interface can have multiple prefixes.
   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs] specifies the addressing and
   operation of IPv6 over the IPv6 specific part of the packet
   convergence sub-layer of IEEE Std 802.16e [802.16e] , and point-to-
   point link model is recommended.  Also, 3GPP/3GPP2 have earlier
   adopted the point-to-point link model [RFC3314].  A mobile node and
   an Access Router are connected via a point-to-point connection at the
   IPv6 layer.  Hence each mobile node can be considered to be on a
   separate subnet.  The prefixes for the mobile node are advertised
   through Router Advertisement message in [RFC4861].  When an MN
   attaches an Access Router(AR), the AR requests one or more prefixes
   for the MN from an external server or a local prefix pool.  When the
   MN detaches the AR, the prefixes should be released.  When an
   operator wants to renumber its network, prefixes with different
   lifetime are advertised to the MN. there isn't any mechanism to deal
   with how AR acquires and manages these prefixes.

3.2.  Prefix Management in Local Mobile Anchors

   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] enables mobility support to a host
   without requiring its participation in any mobility related
   signaling.  Point-to-point access link is supported.  It assumes that
   the mobile node and the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) are the only two
   nodes on the access link.  Figure 1 shows a typical process that MN
   requests it's home network prefix.


          MN      MAG      LMA      Server
            |------>|        |        |      1. RtSol
            |       |------->|        |      2. PBU (HNP=0)
            |       |        |<------>|      3. Prefix Exchange
            |       |<-------|        |      4. PBA (HNP)
            |<------|        |        |      5. RA(HNP)


             Figure 1: Prefix Delegation in Proxy Mobile IPv6

   1.  An MN solicits a router advertisement (RtSol) for stateless
       address configuration
   2.  The Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) sends Proxy Binding Update (PBU)
       message to Local Mobile Anchor(LMA) and with Home Network Prefix
       (HNP) to zero.
   3.  No details are provided in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] on how LMA
       manages prefixes.  This is one of the motivations to design a
       Diameter application for prefix exchange.

   4.  The LMA replies PBU with Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) and
       sets MN's prefix to HNP field of PBA
   5.  MAG advertises prefixes to MN with Router Advertisement (RA) for
       stateless address configuration

3.3.  Prefix Management for Mobile Routers

   [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] specifies mechanism for a Mobile
   Router(MR) to synchronize its Mobile Network Prefixes with its Home
   Agents and obtain new ones dynamically.  Figure 2 shows the process
   that a Mobile Router requests prefixes from a Home Agent.


            MR       HA      Server
            |        |        |
            |------->|        |      1. BU
            |        |        |
            |        |<------>|      2. Prefix Exchange
            |        |        |
            |<-------|        |      3. BA
            |        |        |


                    Figure 2: Prefix Delegation in NEMO

   1.  Mobile Network Prefix request option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] is included in the Binding
       Update(BU) to indicate to the Home Agent(HA) that the MR wishes
       to get new prefixes assigned to it for use as Mobile Networks
       Prefixes.
   2.  The HA requests prefix from an external entity.  There is no
       further description in [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation].  The
       problem can also be solved by defining a new Diameter
       application.
   3.  Mobile Network Prefix Confirm option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-prefix-delegation] is included in the Binding
       Acknowledgement to allocate prefixes to the MR.


4.  Requirements on AAA-based Prefix Delegation Application

   AAA-based prefix delegation (PD) application MUST run between a
   requesting router (RR), e.g.  AR, LMA, MR, etc. and a delegating
   server (DS) which MUST be AAA server.

   AAA-based PD application MUST support the AAA client as RR to request
   prefixes from an AAA server as DS.  AAA-based PD application MUST
   support the client as RR to give back the prefixes to AAA server as

   DS.

   In point-to-point link operation, the requesting router MUST identify
   the interface of MN in its request.  The requesting router MAY
   provide a prefix hint, e.g. of length /48 to which the delegating
   server MUST reply with one or more prefixes, e.g. of length /64.

   AAA-based prefix delegation application SHOULD support prefix release
   procedures.

   The AAA client as RR is responsible for renewing the prefixes when
   the lifetime expires.  The AAA client as RR SHOULD be able to extend
   the lifetime of the prefixes using messages designed for this
   purpose.

   It SHOULD be possible to renumber the prefixes delegated by AAA
   server.  The AAA server as DS SHOULD initiate prefix renumbering
   process.


5.  Conclusions

   AAA servers managing IP address is a convention.  [RFC2865] defines
   attribute Framed-IP-Address for allocation IPv4 address for a host.
   [RFC3162] introduces some attributes for IPv6 address management.
   [RFC4818] designs Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute which is used for
   delegating prefixes for user.  Prefix management is the natural
   extension of address management.

   Existing AAA (RADIUS and Diameter) mechanisms can't accomodate prefix
   delegation.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document is a problem statement that does not by itself
   introduce any security issues.
