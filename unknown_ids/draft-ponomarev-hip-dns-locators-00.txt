Internet-Draft             Locators in HIP RR                  July 2009


Abstract

   There is a resource record (RR) in the Domain Name System (DNS) used
   for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  This document proposes to
   store the host locators in the HIP resource records as well.

Internet-Draft             Locators in HIP RR                  July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The HIP RR allows a node to store its Host Identity (HI, the public
   component of the node public-private key pair), Host Identity Tag
   (HIT, a truncated hash of its public key), and the Domain Names of
   its rendezvous servers (RVSs) in the DNS [RFC5205].  The host may
   have a set of IP address(es) in A [RFC1035] and AAAA [RFC3596] RR
   sets (RRSets [RFC2181]).

   However there is no mechanism to specify custom UDP port for incoming
   UDP-encapsulated HIP control packets without using a third party as a
   rendezvous server (RVS)[RFC5204].  Furthermore separate queries for
   the set of IP address cause extra delays and additional load to the
   nameservers.  The situation can be changed by listing locators in HIP
   RR.  The format of extended LOCATOR parameter
   [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal] may be used.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[RFC2119].
