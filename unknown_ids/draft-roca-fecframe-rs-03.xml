		<abstract>
<t>
This document describes two fully-specified simple FEC schemes for Reed-Solomon codes
that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.
Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which
means they offer optimal protection against packet erasures.
They are also systematic codes, which means that the source symbols are part of the encoding
symbols.
The price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum number of encoding
symbols, and a computational complexity higher than that of LDPC codes for instance.
<!--
However, this complexity remains compatible with software codecs.
Finally, the FEC schemes described here are compatible with the software codec from Luigi Rizzo.-->
</t>

<t>
The first scheme is for Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &le; m &le; 16
and arbitrary packet flows.
The second scheme is similar to the first scheme, with the exception that it is restricted
to a single sequenced flow.

		<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
		<!-- =========================================== -->

<t>The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes is a classic solution to improve the reliability
of unicast, multicast and broadcast Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) and applications.
The <xref target="FECFRAME-FRAMEWORK"/> document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
with media delivery applications, and for instance with real-time streaming media applications based
on the RTP real-time protocol.
Similarly the <xref target="RFC5052"/> document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
with with objects (e.g., files) delivery applications based on the ALC  <xref target="RFC5775"/>
and NORM <xref target="RFC5740"/> reliable multicast transport protocols.
</t>

<t>More specifically, the <xref target="RFC5053"/> and <xref target="RFC5170"/> FEC schemes introduce
erasure codes based on sparse parity check matrices for object delivery protocols like ALC and NORM.
These codes are efficient in terms of processing but not optimal in terms of erasure recovery
capabilities when dealing with "small" objects.
</t>

<t>The Reed-Solomon FEC codes described in this document belong to the class of Maximum Distance
Separable (MDS) codes that are optimal in terms of erasure recovery capability.
It means that a receiver can recover the k source symbols from any set of exactly k encoding symbols.
These codes are also systematic codes, which means that the k source symbols are part of the encoding
symbols.
However they are limited in terms of maximum source block size and number of encoding symbols.
Since the real-time constraints of media delivery applications usually limit the maximum
source block size, this is not considered to be a major issue in the context of the FEC Framework
for many (but not necessarily all) use-cases.
Additionally, if the encoding/decoding complexity is higher with Reed-Solomon codes than it is with
<xref target="RFC5053"/> or <xref target="RFC5170"/> codes, it remains reasonable for most use-cases,
even in case of a software codec.</t>

<t>Many applications dealing with reliable content transmission or content storage already rely on
packet-based Reed-Solomon erasure recovery codes.
In particular, many of them use the Reed-Solomon codec of Luigi Rizzo  <xref target="RS-codec"/>
<xref target="Rizzo97"/>.
The goal of the present document is to specify simple Reed-Solomon schemes that are compatible with this codec.
</t>

<t>
More specifically, the <xref target="RFC5510"/> document introduced such Reed-Solomon codes and
several associated FEC schemes that are compatible with the <xref target="RFC5052"/> framework.
The present document inherits from <xref target="RFC5510"/> the specification of the core Reed-Solomon codes
based on Vandermonde matrices, and specifies FEC schemes that are compatible with the
FECFRAME framework <xref target="FECFRAME-FRAMEWORK"/>.
Therefore this document specifies only the information specific to the FECFRAME context and
refers to <xref target="RFC5510"/> for the core specifications of the codes.
</t>

<t>To that purpose, the present document introduces:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> the Fully-Specified FEC Scheme with FEC Encoding ID XXX
	that specifies a simple way of using of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &le; m &le; 16,
	with a simple FEC encoding for arbitrary packet flows;</t>
	<t> the Fully-Specified FEC Scheme with FEC Encoding ID XXX
	is similar to Scheme XXX except that it is for a single sequenced flow;</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
For instance, with the first (resp. second) scheme, a set of Application Data Units (or ADUs) coming from one
or several (resp. one) media delivery applications (e.g., a set of RTP packets), are grouped in a ADU block
and FEC encoded as a whole.
With Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8), there is a strict limit over the number
ADUs that can be protected together, since the number of encoded symbols, n, must
be inferior or equal to 255.
This constraint is relaxed when using a higher finite field size (m &gt; 8), at the price of an increased
computational complexity.

<section anchor="CommonProcedures" title="Common Procedures Related to the ADU Block and
Source Block Creation">
<!-- ================ -->
<t>
This section introduces the procedures that are used during the ADU block and the related
source block(s) creation, for the various FEC schemes considered.
</t>


	<section anchor="Requirements" title="Restrictions">
	<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
This specification has the following restrictions:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> there MUST be exactly one source symbol per ADU;</t>
	<t> there MUST be exactly one repair symbol per FEC Repair Packet;</t>
	<t> there MUST be exactly one source block per ADU block;</t>
</list>
</t>
	</section>


	<section anchor="CommonProc_problem" title="ADU Block Creation">
	<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
Several aspects must be considered, that impact the ADU block creation:
<list style="symbols">
<!--
<t> the distribution of ADU sizes for the ADU flow(s) protected by the FECFRAME instance;</t>
-->
<t> the maximum source block size (k parameter) and number of encoding symbols
	(n parameter), that are constrained by the finite field size (m parameter);</t>
<t> the potential real-time constraints, that impact the maximum ADU block size,
	since the larger the block size, the larger the decoding delay;</t>
</list>
We now detail each of these aspects.
</t>

<t>
The finite field size parameter, m, defines the number of non zero elements in
this field which is equal to: q - 1 = 2^^m - 1.
This q - 1 value is also the theoretical maximum number of encoding symbols that can
be produced for a source block.
For instance, when m = 8 (default) there is a maximum of 2^^8 - 1 = 255 encoding symbols.
So: k &lt; n &le; 255.
Given the target FEC code rate (e.g., provided by the end-user or upper application when
starting the FECFRAME framework, and taking into account the (known or estimated) packet
loss rate), the sender calculates:
      <list style="empty">
	<t>max_k = floor((2^^m - 1) * CR)</t>
      </list>
This max_k value leaves enough room for the sender to produce the
desired number of repair symbols.
Since there is one source symbol per ADU, max_k is also an upper bound to the maximum
number of ADUs per ADU block.
</t>

<t>
The source ADU flows usually have real-time constraints. 
It means that the maximum number of ADUs of an ADU block must not exceed a certain
threshold since it directly impacts the decoding delay.
It is the role of the developer, who knows the flow real-time features, to define an
appropriate upper bound to the ADU block size, max_rt.
</t>

<t>
If we take into account these constraints, we find: max_B = min(max_k, max_rt).
Then max_B gives an upper bound to the number of ADUs that can constitute an ADU block.
</t>
	</section>


	<section anchor="CommonProc_src_block_creation_global_encoding"
		title="Source Block Creation">
	<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
In its most general form the FECFRAME framework and the RS FEC schemes
are meant to protect a set of independent flows.
Since the flows have no relationship to one another, the ADU size of each
flow can potentially vary significantly.
Even in the special case of a single flow, the ADU sizes can largely
vary (e.g., the various frames of a "Group of Pictures (GOP) of an H.264 flow).
This diversity must be addressed since the RS FEC scheme requires a constant
encoding symbol size (E parameter) per source block.
Since this specification requires that there is only one source symbol per ADU,
E must be large enough to contain all the ADUs of an ADU block along
with their prepended 3 bytes (see below).
</t>

<t>
In situations where E is determined per source block
(default, specified by the FCCI/FSSI with S = 0, <xref target="RSover2mArbitraryGE_fssi"/>),
E is equal to the size of the largest ADU of this source block plus three (for the
prepended 3 bytes, see below).
In this case, upon receiving the first FEC Repair Packet for this source block,
since this packet MUST contain a single repair symbol (<xref target="RSover2mArbitraryGE_repair_fpi"/>),
a receiver determines the E parameter used for this source block.
</t>

<t>
In situations where E is fixed 
(specified by the FCCI/FSSI with S = 1, <xref target="RSover2mArbitraryGE_fssi"/>),
then E must be greater or equal to the size of the largest ADU of this source block
plus three (for the prepended 3 bytes, see below).
If this is not the case, an error is returned.
How to handle this error is use-case specific (e.g., a larger E parameter may be 
communicated to the receivers in an updated FFCI message, using an appropriate
mechanism) and is not considered by this specification.
</t>

<t>
The ADU block is always encoded as a single source block.
There are a total of B &le; max_B ADUs in this ADU block.
For the ADU i, with 0 &le; i &le; B-1, 3 bytes are prepended
(<xref target="fig_src_block_creation_global_enc"/>):
<list style="symbols">
	<t>The first byte, FID[i] (Flow ID), contains the integer identifier
		associated to the source ADU flow to which this ADU
		belongs to.
		It is assumed that a single byte is sufficient, or said
		differently, that no more than 256 flows will be protected by
		a single instance of the FECFRAME framework.
	</t>
	<t>The following two bytes, L[i] (Length), contain the length of this
		ADU, in network byte order (i.e., big endian).
		This length is for the ADU itself and does not include the 
		FID[i], L[i], or Pad[i] fields.
	</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Then zero padding is added to ADU i (if needed) in field Pad[i], for alignment purposes
up to a size of exactly E bytes.
The data unit resulting from the ADU i and the F[i], L[i] and Pad[i] fields, is called
ADU Information (or ADUI).
Each ADUI contributes to exactly one source symbol to the source block.

<t>
Note that neither the initial 3 bytes nor the optional padding
are sent over the network.
However, they are considered during FEC encoding.
It means that a receiver who lost a certain FEC source packet (e.g., the
UDP datagram containing this FEC source packet) will be able to recover the ADUI
if FEC decoding succeeds.
Thanks to the initial 3 bytes, this receiver will get rid of the padding (if any)
and identify the corresponding ADU flow.

When SDP is used to communicate the FFCI, this FEC scheme-specific information is carried in
the 'fssi' parameter in textual representation as specified in <xref target="SDP_ELEMENTS"/>.
For instance:
</t>
<t>
fssi = E:1400,S:0,m:8
</t>

If another mechanism requires the FSSI to be carried as an opaque octet string
(for instance after a Base64 encoding), the encoding format consists of the following 3 octets:
<list style="symbols">
    <t> Encoding symbol length (E): 16 bit field.</t>
    <t> Strict (S) flag: 1 bit field.</t>

<section anchor="SecurityConsiderations" title="Security Considerations">
<!-- ==================================== -->


  <section title="Problem Statement">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
A content delivery system is potentially subject to many attacks.
Some of them target the network (e.g., to compromise the routing infrastructure,
by compromising the congestion control component), others target
the Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) (e.g., to compromise its normal behavior),
and finally some attacks target the content itself.
Since this document focuses on various FEC schemes, this
section only discusses the additional threats that their use within the
FECFRAME framework can create to an arbitrary CDP.
</t>

<t>
More specifically, these attacks may have several goals:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> those that are meant to give access to a confidential content (e.g., in
	  case of a non-free content),</t>
	<t> those that try to corrupt the ADU Flows being transmitted (e.g., to
	  prevent a receiver from using it),</t>
	<t> and those that try to compromise the receiver's behavior (e.g., by
	  making the decoding of an object computationally expensive).</t>
</list>
These attacks can be launched either against the data flow itself (e.g.,
by sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets) or against the FEC parameters that are
sent either in-band (e.g., in the Repair FEC Payload ID) or out-of-band (e.g., in
a session description).
</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Attacks Against the Data Flow">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
First of all, let us consider the attacks against the data flow.
</t>


	<section title="Access to Confidential Contents">
	<!-- ================ -->

<t>
Access control to the ADU Flow being transmitted is typically provided by means
of encryption.
This encryption can be done within the content provider itself, by the
application (for instance by using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
<xref target="RFC3711"/>), or at the Network Layer, on a packet per packet basis
when IPSec/ESP is used <xref target="RFC4303"/>.
If confidentiality is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED that one of these solutions be used.
Even if we mention these attacks here, they are not related nor facilitated by
the use of FEC.
</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Content Corruption" anchor="sec_content_corruption">
	<!-- ================ -->

<t>
Protection against corruptions (e.g., after sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets)
is achieved by means of a content integrity verification/sender authentication scheme.
This service is usually provided at the packet level. In this case, after 
removing all forged packets, the ADU Flow may be sometimes recovered.
Several techniques can provide this source authentication/content integrity
service:
<list style="symbols">
<!--
<t> at the packet level, each packet can be digitally signed. A major limitation is
  the high computational and transmission overheads that this solution requires (unless
  perhaps if Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used).
  To avoid this problem, the signature may span a set of symbols (instead of a
  single one) in order to amortize the signature calculation.
  But if a single symbol is missing, the integrity of the whole set cannot be checked;</t>

<t> at the packet level, a Group Message Authentication Code (MAC) <xref target="RFC2104"/>
  scheme can be used, for instance by using HMAC-SHA-1 with a secret key shared by all
  the group members, senders and receivers.
  This technique creates a cryptographically secured (thanks to the secret key)
  digest of a packet that is sent along with the packet.
  The Group MAC scheme  does not create prohibitive processing load nor transmission
  overhead, but it has a major limitation: it only provides a group authentication/integrity
  service since all group members share the same secret group key, which means that each
  member can send a forged packet. It is therefore restricted to situations where
  group members are fully trusted (or in association with another technique as a
  pre-check);</t>

<t> at the packet level, Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA)
  <xref target="RFC4082"/> is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides
  a true authentication/integrity service, and does not create any prohibitive processing
  load or transmission overhead.
  Yet, checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after its reception.
  For instance, <xref target="RFC4383"/> details the use of TESLA within SRTP.XXXXXXXX</t>

-->
<t>	at the application level, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
	<xref target="RFC3711"/> provides several solutions to authenticate the source and
	check the integrity of RTP and RTCP messages, among other services.
	For instance, associated to the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA)
	<xref target="RFC4383"/>, SRTP is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides
	a true authentication/integrity service, and does not create any prohibitive processing
	load or transmission overhead.
	Yet, checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after its reception with
	TESLA.
	Other building blocks can be used within SRTP to provide authentication/content
	integrity services.
</t>
<t>	at the Network Layer, IPSec/ESP offers (among other services) an integrity verification
	mechanism that can be used to provide authentication/content integrity services.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<!--
<t>
Techniques relying on public key cryptography (digital signatures and TESLA during
the bootstrap process, when used) require that public keys be securely associated
to the entities. This can be achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or by a
PGP Web of Trust, or by pre-distributing the public keys of each group member.
</t>

<t>
Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography (group MAC) require that a
secret key be shared by all group members. This can be achieved by means of a
group key management protocol, or simply by pre-distributing the secret key
(but this manual solution has many limitations).
</t>
-->

<t>
It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security requirements and
features of the target application area, to define which solution is the most appropriate.
Nonetheless it is RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques be used.
</t>
	</section>

  </section>

  <section title="Attacks Against the FEC Parameters">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
Let us now consider attacks against the FEC parameters included in the FFCI that
are usually sent out-of-band (e.g., in a session description).
Attacks on these FEC parameters can prevent the decoding of the associated object.
For instance modifying the m field (when applicable) will lead a receiver to consider
a different code.
Modifying the E parameter will lead a receiver to consider bad Repair Symbols for
a received FEC Repair Packet.
</t>

<t>
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to guarantee the
FFCI integrity.
When the FFCI is sent out-of-band in a session description,
this latter SHOULD be protected, for instance by digitally signing it.
</t>

<t>
Attacks are also possible against some FEC parameters included in the
Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload ID.
For instance modifying the Source Block Number of a FEC Source of Repair Packet will
lead a receiver to assign this packet to a wrong block.
</t>

<t>
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to guarantee the
Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload ID integrity.
To that purpose, one of the packet-level source authentication/content integrity
techniques of <xref target="sec_content_corruption"/> can be used.
</t>
