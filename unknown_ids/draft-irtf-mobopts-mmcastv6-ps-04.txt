1. Introduction and Motivation 
    
   Group communication forms an integral building block of a wide 
   variety of applications, ranging from content broadcasting and 
   streaming, voice and video conferencing, collaborative environments 
   and massive multiplayer gaming, up to the self-organization of 
   distributed systems, services or autonomous networks. Network layer 
   multicast support will be needed whenever globally distributed, 
   scalable, serverless or instantaneous communication is required.  
    
   The early idea of Internet multicasting [2] soon lead to a wide 
   adoption of Deering's host group model [3]. Broadband media delivery 
   is emerging as a typical mass scenario that demands scalability and 
   bandwidth efficiency from multicast routing. Although multicast 
   mobility has been a concern for about ten years [4] and has led to 
   numerous proposals, there is as yet no generally accepted solution. 
   Multicast network support will be of particular importance to mobile 
   environments, where users commonly share frequency bands of limited 
   capacity. Reception of 'infotainment' streams may soon require wide 
   deployment of mobile multicast services. 
    
   Mobility in IPv6 [5] is standardized in the Mobile IPv6 RFCs [6,7]. 
   MIPv6 [6] only roughly defines multicast mobility for Mobile Nodes 
   (MN), using a remote subscription approach or through bi-directional 
   tunneling via the Home Agent (HA). Remote subscription suffers from 
   slow handovers, relying on multicast routing to adapt to handovers. 
   Bi-directional tunneling introduces inefficient overhead and delay 
   due to triangular forwarding, i.e., instead of traveling on shortest 
   paths, packets are routed through the Home Agent. Therefore these

   approaches have not been optimized for a large scale deployment. A 
   mobile multicast service for a future Internet should provide 'close 
   to optimal' routing at predictable and limited cost, offering 
   robustness combined with a service quality compliant to real-time 
   media distribution.  
    
   Intricate multicast routing procedures are not easily extensible to 
   satisfy the requirements for mobility. A client subscribed to a group 
   while performing mobility handovers, requires the multicast traffic 
   to follow to its new location; a mobile source needs the entire 
   delivery tree to comply with or to adapt to its changing position. 
   Significant effort has already been invested in protocol designs for 
   mobile multicast receivers; only limited work has been dedicated to 
   multicast source mobility, which poses the more delicate problem 
   [63]. 
    
   In multimedia conference scenarios, games or collaborative 
   environments each member commonly operates as a receiver and as a 
   sender for multicast group communication. In addition, real-time 
   communication such as conversational voice or video places severe 
   temporal requirement on mobility protocols: Typical seamless handover 
   scenarios are expected to limit disruptions or delay to less than 100 
   ms. Jitter disturbances should not exceed 50 ms. Note that 100 ms is 
   about the duration of a spoken syllable in real-time audio. This 
   problem statement is intended to also be applicable to a range of 
   other scenarios with a range of delivery requirements appropriate to 
   the general Internet. 
    
1.1Document Scope 
    
   This document defines the problem scope for multicast mobility 
   management, which may be elaborated in future work. It is subdivided 
   to present the various challenges according to their originating 
   aspects, and identifies existing proposals and major bibliographic 
   references. 
    
   When considering multicast node mobility, two basic scenarios are of 
   interest: Single-hop mobility (shown in figure 1.a) and multi-hop 
   mobile routing (figure 1.b). Single-hop mobility is the focus of this 
   document, which coincides with the perspective of MIPv6 [6]. The key 
   issues of mobile multicast membership control, and the interplay of 
   mobile and multicast routing will be illustrated using this simple 
   scenario. 
    
   Multi-hop network mobility is a subsidiary scenario. All major 
   aspects are inherited from the single-hop problem, while additional 
   complexity is incurred from traversing a mobile cloud. This may be 
   solved by either encapsulation or flooding ([8] provides a general 
   overview). Specific issues arising from (nested) tunneling or

   flooding, especially the preservation of address transparency, 
   require treatment analogous to MIPv6.

2. Problem Description 
    
2.1 General Issues 
    
   Multicast mobility is a generic term, which subsumes a collection of 
   distinct functions. First, multicast communication is divided into 
   Any Source Multicast (ASM) [3] and Source Specific Multicast (SSM) 
   [9,10]. Second, the roles of senders and receivers are distinct and 
   asymmetric. Both may individually be mobile. Their interaction is 
   facilitated by a multicast routing protocol such as DVMRP [11], PIM-
 
 
Schmidt, Waehlisch      Expires - January 2009                [Page 5] 
                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
   SM/SSM [12,13], Bi-directional PIM [14],or inter-domain multicast 
   prefix advertisements via MBGP [15]. IPv6 clients interact using the 
   multicast listener discovery protocol (MLD and MLDv2) [16,17]. Other 
   multicast routing protocols without significant current deployment 
   include CBT [18], BGMP [19]. 
    
   Any multicast mobility solution must take all of these functional 
   blocks into account. It should enable seamless continuity of 
   multicast sessions when moving from one IPv6 subnet to another. It 
   should preserve the multicast nature of packet distribution and 
   approximate optimal routing. It should support per-flow handover for 
   multicast traffic, because the properties and designations of flows 
   can be distinct. Such distinctions may result from differing 
   QoS/real-time requirements, but may also be caused by network 
   conditions that may differ for different groups. 
    
   The host group model extends the capability of the network layer 
   unicast service. In common with the architecture of fixed networks, 
   multicast mobility management should transparently utilize or 
   smoothly extend the unicast functions of MIPv6 [6], its security 
   extensions [7,20], its expediting schemes FMIPv6 [21] and HMIPv6 
   [22], its context transfer protocols [23], its multihoming 
   capabilities [24,25], emerging protocols like PMIPv6 [61] or future 
   developments. From the perspective of an integrated mobility 
   architecture, it is desirable to avoid multicast-specific as well as 
   unicast-restricted solutions, whenever general approaches can be 
   derived that can jointly support unicast and multicast.  
    
   Multicast routing dynamically adapts to the topology of the sender(s) 
   and receiver(s) participating in a multicast session, which then may 
   change under mobility. However, depending on the topology and the 
   protocol in use, current multicast routing protocols may require a 
   time close to seconds, or even minutes, to converge following a 
   change in receiver or sender location. This is far too slow to 
   support seamless handovers for interactive or real-time media 
   sessions. The actual temporal behavior strongly depends on the 
   multicast routing protocol in use, the configuration of routers, and 
   on the geometry of the current distribution tree. A mobility scheme 
   that re-adjusts routing, i.e., partially changes or fully 
   reconstructs a multicast tree, is forced to comply with the time 
   scale for protocol convergence. Specifically, it needs to consider a 
   possible rapid movement of the mobile node, as this may occur at much 
   higher rates than common protocol state updates.  
    
   The mobility of hosts using IP multicast can impact the service 
   presented to the higher-layer protocols. IP layer multicast packet 
   distribution is an unreliable service that is bound to connectionless 
   transport protocols. Where applications are sensitive to packet loss 
   or jitter, countermeasures must be performed (loss recovery, content

   recoding, concealment, etc) by the multicast transport or 
   application. Mobile multicast handovers should not introduce 
   significant additional packet drops. Due to statelessness, the bi-
   casting of multicast flows does not cause foreseeable degradations at 
   the transport layer. 
    
   IP multicast applications can be designed to adapt the multicast 
   stream to prevailing network conditions (adapting the sending rate to 
   the level of congestion, adaptive tuning of clients in response to 
   measured delay, dynamic suppression of feedback messages, etc). An 
   adaptive application may also use more than one multicast group 
   (e.g., layered multicast in which a client selects a set of multicast 
   groups based on perceived available network capacity). A mobility 
   handover may temporarily disrupt the operation of these higher-layer 
   functions. The handover can invalidate assumptions about the 
   forwarding path (e.g., acceptable delivery rate, round trip delay), 
   which could impact an application and level of network traffic. Such 
   effects need to be considered in the design of multicast applications 
   and in the design of network-layer mobility. Specifically, mobility 
   mechanisms need to be robust to transient packet loss that may result 
   from invalid path expectations following a handover of an MN to a 
   different network. 
    
   Group addresses in general are location transparent, even though they 
   may be scoped and methods can embed unicast prefixes or Rendezvous 
   Point addresses [26]. The addresses of sources contributing to a 
   multicast session are interpreted by the routing infrastructure and 
   by receiver applications, which frequently are aware of source 
   addreses. Multicast therefore inherits the mobility address duality 
   problem of MIPv6 for source addresses: Addresses being a logical node 
   identifier, i.e., the home address (HoA) on the one hand, and a 
   topological locator, the care-of-address (CoA), on the other. At the 
   network layer, the elements that comprise the delivery tree, i.e., 
   multicast senders, forwarders and receivers, need to carefully 
   account for address duality issues, e.g., by using binding caches, 
   extended multicast states or signaling. 
    
   Multicast sources in general operate decoupled from their receivers 
   in the following sense: A multicast source sends packets to a group 
   of unknown receivers and thus operates without a feedback channel. It 
   neither has means to inquire about the properties of its delivery 
   trees, nor is it able to learn about the network-layer state of its 
   receivers. In the event of an inter-tree handover, a mobile multicast 
   source therefore is vulnerable to loosing connectivity to receivers 
   without noticing. (Appendix A describes implicit source notification 
   approaches). Applying a MIPv6 mobility binding update or return 
   routability procedure will similarly break the semantic of a receiver 
   group remaining unidentified by the source and thus cannot be applied 
   in unicast analogy.

   Despite the complexity of the requirements, multicast mobility 
   management should seek lightweight solutions with easy deployment. 
   Realistic, sample deployment scenarios and architectures should be 
   provided in future solution documents. 
    
2.2 Multicast Listener Mobility 
    
2.2.1 Node & Application Perspective 
    
   A mobile multicast listener entering a new IP subnet requires 
   multicast reception following a handover in real-time. This needs to 
   transfer the multicast membership context from its old to its new 
   point of attachment. This can either be achieved by (re-) 
   establishing a tunnel or by transferring the MLD Listening State 
   information of the MN's moving interface(s) to the new upstream 
   router(s). In the latter case, it may encounter either one of the 
   following conditions: The new network may not be multicast-enabled or 
   the specific multicast service may be unavailable, e.g. unsupported 
   or prohibited. Alternatively, the requested multicast service may be 
   supported and enabled in the visited network, but the multicast 
   groups under subscription may not be forwarded to it. This means that 
   current distribution trees for the desired groups may only be re-
   joined at a large routing distance. The simplest scenario is when 
   packets of some, or all, of the subscribed groups of the mobile node 
   are already received by one or several group members in the 
   destination network, and thus multicast streams natively flow after 
   the MN arrives at the new network. 
    
   The problem of achieving seamless multicast listener handovers is 
   thus threefold: 
     o Ensure multicast reception, even in visited networks, without  
       appropriate multicast support. 
     o Minimize multicast forwarding delay to provide seamless 
       and fast handovers for real-time services. Dependant on layer 2  
       and 3 handover performance, the time available for multicast  
       mobility operations is typically bound to a fraction of 100 ms. 
     o Minimize packet loss and reordering that result from multicast  
       handover management. 
    
   Moreover, in many wireless regimes it is also desirable to minimize 
   multicast-related signaling to preserve the limited resources of 
   battery powered mobile devices and the constrained transmission 
   capacities of the networks. This may lead to a desire to restrict MLD 
   queries towards the MN. Multihomed MNs may ensure smooth handoffs by 
   using a 'make-before-break' approach, which requires a per interface 
   subscription, facilitated by an MLD JOIN operating on a pre-selected

   Encapsulation on the path between the upstream router and the 
   receiver may result in MTU size conflicts, since path-MTU discovery 
   is often not supported for multicast and can reduce scalability in 
   networks with many different MTU sizes or introduce potential denial 
   of service vulnerabilities (since the originating addresses of ICMPv6 
   messages can not be verified for multicast). In the absence of 
   fragmentation at tunnel entry points, this may prevent the group 
   being forwarded to the destination.  
    
2.2.2 Network Perspective 
    
   The infrastructure providing multicast services is required to keep 
   traffic following the MN without compromising network functionality. 
   Mobility solutions thus have to face some immediate problems:  
    
     o Realize native multicast forwarding, and where applicable  
       conserve network resources and utilize link layer multipoint  
       distribution to avoid data redundancy. 
     o Activate link multipoint services, even if the MN performs  
       only a layer 2 / vertical handover.  
     o Ensure routing convergence, even when the MN moves rapidly 
       and performs handovers at a high frequency. 
     o Avoid avalanche problems and n-casting, which potentially result 
       from replicated tunnel initiation or redundant forwarding at  
       network nodes.  
    
   There are additional implications for the infrastructure: In changing 
   its point of attachment, an exclusive mobile receiver may cause 
   initiation in the new network and termination of a group distribution 
   service in the previous network. Mobility management may issue 
   traffic directives that lead to suboptimal routing, i.e., erroneous 
   subscriptions following predictive handover operations, or slow 
   effective leaves caused by MLD querying, or by departure of the MN 
   from a previous network without leaving the subscribed groups. 
   Finally, packet duplication and re-ordering may follow a change of 
   topology.  
    
2.3 Multicast Source Mobility 
    
2.3.1 Any Source Multicast Mobility 
    
   A node submitting data to an ASM group either forms the root of a 
   source specific shortest path tree (SPT), distributing data towards a 
   rendezvous point (RP) or receivers, or it forwards data directly down 
   a shared tree, e.g., via encapsulated PIM Register messages, or using 
   bi-directional PIM routing. Native forwarding along source specific 
   delivery trees will be bound to the source's topological network 
   address, due to reverse path forwarding (RPF) checks. A mobile 
   multicast source moving to a new subnetwork is only able to either

                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
   inject data into a previously established delivery tree, which may be 
   a rendezvous point based shared tree, or to (re)initiate the 
   construction of a multicast distribution tree for its new network 
   location. In the latter case, the mobile sender will have to precede 
   without knowing whether the new tree has regained ability to forward 
   traffic to the group, due to the decoupling of sender and receivers. 
    
   A mobile multicast source must therefore provide address transparency 
   at two layers: To comply with RPF checks, it has to use an address 
   within the source field of the IPv6 basic header, which is in 
   topological agreement with the employed multicast distribution tree. 
   For application transparency the logical node identifier, commonly 
   the HoA, must be presented as the packet source address to the 
   transport layer at the receiver side.  
    
   The address transparency and temporal handover constraints pose major 
   problems for route optimizing mobility solutions. Additional issues 
   arise from possible packet loss and from multicast scoping. A mobile 
   source away from home must respect scoping restrictions that arise 
   from its home and its visited location [6]. 
    
   Intra-domain multicast routing may allow the use of shared trees that 
   can reduce mobility-related complexity. A static rendezvous point may 
   allow a mobile source to continuously send data to the group by 
   encapsulating packets to the RP with its previous topologically 
   correct or home source address. Intra-domain mobility is 
   transparently provided by bi-directional shared domain-spanning 
   trees, when using bi-directional PIM, eliminating the need for 
   tunneling to the corresponding RP (in contrast to IPv4, IPv6 ASM 
   multicast groups are associated with a specific RP/RPs). 
    
   Issues arise in inter-domain multicast, whenever notification of 
   source addresses is required between distributed instances of shared 
   trees. A new CoA acquired after a mobility handover will necessarily 
   be subject to inter-domain record exchange. In the presence of an 
   embedded rendezvous point address [26], e.g., the primary rendezvous 
   point for inter-domain PIM-SM will be globally appointed and the 
   signaling requirements obsolete. 
    
2.3.2 Source Specific Multicast Mobility 
    
   Source Specific Multicast has been designed for multicast senders 
   with static source addresses. The source addresses in a client 
   subscription to an SSM group is directly used to route 
   identification. Any SSM subscriber is thus forced to know the 
   topological address of the contributor to the group it wishes to 
   join. The SSM source identification becomes invalid when the 
   topological source address changes under mobility. Hence client 
   implementations of SSM source filtering must be MIPv6 aware in the 
 
 
Schmidt, Waehlisch      Expires - January 2009               [Page 10] 
                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
   sense that a logical source identifier (HoA) is correctly mapped to 
   its current topological correspondent (CoA). 
    
   As a consequence, source mobility for SSM requires a conceptual 
   treatment beyond the problem scope of mobile ASM. A listener 
   subscribes to an (S,G) channel membership and routers establish an 
   (S,G)-state shortest path tree rooted at source S, therefore any 
   change of source addresses under mobility requires state updates at 
   all routers on the upstream path and at all receivers in the group. 
   On source handover, a new SPT needs to be established that will share 
   paths with the previous SPT, e.g., at the receiver side. As the 
   principle multicast decoupling of a sender from its receivers holds 
   for SSM, the client updates needed for switching trees become a 
   severe burden. 
    
   An SSM listener may subscribe to or exclude any specific multicast 
   source, and thereby wants to rely on the topological correctness of 
   network operations. The SSM design permits trust in equivalence to 
   the correctness of unicast routing tables. Any SSM mobility solution 
   should preserve this degree of confidence. Binding updates for SSM 
   sources thus should have to prove address correctness in the unicast 
   routing sense, which is equivalent to binding update security with a 
   correspondent node in MIPv6 [6]. 
    
   The above methods add significant complexity to provide a robust SSM 
   mobility solution, which needs to converge to optimal routes and, for 
   efficiency, should avoid data encapsulation. Like ASM, handover 
   management is a time-critical operation. The routing distance between 
   subsequent points of attachment, the 'step size' of the mobile from 
   previous to next designated router, may serve as an appropriate 
   measure of complexity [27,28]. 
    
   Finally, Source Specific Multicast has been designed as a light-
   weight approach to group communication. In adding mobility 
   management, it is desirable to preserve the leanness of SSM by 
   minimizing additional signaling overhead. 
    
2.4 Deployment Issues 
    
   IP multicast deployment in general has been hesitant over the past 15 
   years, even though all major router vendors and operating systems 
   offer implementations that support multicast [29]. While many 
   (walled) domains or enterprise networks operate point-to-multipoint 
   services, IP multicast rollout is currently limited in public inter-
   domain scenarios [30]. A dispute arose on the appropriate layer, 
   where group communication service should reside, and the focus of the 
   research community turned towards application layer multicast. This 
   debate on "efficiency versus deployment complexity" now overlaps the 
   mobile multicast domain [31]. Garyfalos and Almeroth [32] derived 
 
 
Schmidt, Waehlisch      Expires - January 2009               [Page 11]

   from fairly generic principles that when mobility is introduced, the 
   performance gap between IP and application layer multicast widens in 
   different metrics up to a factor of four. 
    
   Facing deployment complexity, it is desirable that any solution for 
   mobile multicast should leave routing protocols unchanged. Mobility 
   management in such a deployment-friendly scheme should preferably be 
   handled at edge nodes, preserving a mobility-agnostic routing 
   infrastructure. Future research needs to search for such simple, 
   infrastructure transparent solutions, even though there are 
   reasonable doubts, whether this can be achieved in all cases.  
    
   Nevertheless, multicast services in mobile environments may soon 
   become indispensable, when multimedia distribution services such as 
   DVB-H [33,34] or IPTV develop a strong business case for IP 
   portables. As IP mobility becomes an important service and as 
   efficient link utilization is of a larger impact in costly radio 
   environments, the evolution of multicast protocols will naturally 
   follow mobility constraints. 
    
    
3.Characteristics of Multicast Routing Trees under Mobility 
    
   Multicast distribution trees have been studied from a focus of 
   network efficiency. Grounded on empirical observations Chuang and 
   Sirbu [35] proposed a scaling power-law for the total number of links 
   in a multicast shortest path tree with m receivers (proportional to 
   m^k). The authors consistently identified the scale factor to attain 
   the independent constant k = 0.8. The validity of such universal, 
   heavy-tailed distribution suggests that multicast shortest path trees 
   are of self-similar nature with many nodes of small, but few of 
   higher degrees. Trees consequently would be shaped rather tall than 
   wide. 
    
   Subsequent empirical and analytical work [36,37] debated the 
   applicability of the Chuang and Sirbu scaling law. Van Mieghem et al. 
   [36] proved that the proposed power law cannot hold for an increasing 
   Internet or very large multicast groups, but is indeed applicable for 
   moderate receiver numbers and the current Internet size N = 10^5 core 
   nodes. Investigating self-similarity Janic and Van Mieghem [38] semi-
   empirically substantiated that multicast shortest path trees in the 
   Internet can be modeled with reasonable accuracy by uniform recursive 
   trees (URT) [39], provided m remains small compared to N. 
    
   The mobility perspective on shortest path trees focus on their 
   alteration, i.e., the degree of topological changes induced by 
   movement. For receivers, and more interestingly for sources this may 
   serve as an outer measure for routing complexity. Mobile listeners 
   moving to neighboring networks will only alter tree branches

   extending over a few hops. Source specific multicast trees 
   subsequently generated from source handover steps are not 
   independent, but highly correlated. They most likely branch to 
   identical receivers at one or several intersection points. By the 
   self-similar nature, the persistent sub-trees (of previous and next 
   distribution tree), rooted at any such intersection point, exhibit 
   again the scaling law behavior, are tall-shaped with nodes of mainly 
   low degree and thus likely to coincide. Tree alterations under 
   mobility have been studied in [28], both analytically and by 
   simulations. It was found that even in large networks and for 
   moderate receiver numbers more than 80 % of the multicast router 
   states remain invariant under a source handover. 
    
    
4. Link Layer Aspects 
    
4.1 General Background 
    
   Scalable group data distribution has the highest potential in leaf 
   networks, where large numbers of end systems reside. Consequently, it 
   is not surprising that most LAN network access technologies natively 
   support point-to-multipoint or multicast services. Of focal interest 
   to the mobility domain are wireless access technologies, which always 
   operate on a shared medium with limited frequency and bandwidth. 
    
   Several aspects need consideration: First, dissimilar network access 
   radio technologies cause distinct group traffic transmissions. There 
   are: 
    
    o connection-less link services of a broadcast type, which mostly 
      are bound to limited reliability; 
    
    o connection-oriented link services of a point-to-multipoint type, 
      which require more complex control and frequently exhibit reduced  
      efficiency; 
    
    o connection-oriented link services of a broadcast type, which are 
      restricted to unidirectional data transmission. 
    
   Second, point-to-multipoint service activation at the network access 
   layer requires a mapping mechanism from network layer requests. This 
   function is commonly achieved by L3 awareness, i.e., IGMP/MLD 
   snooping [67] or proxy [40], which occasionally is complemented by 
   Multicast VLAN Registration (MVR). MVR allows sharing of a single 
   multicast IEEE 802.1Q Virtual LAN in the network, while subscribers 
   remain in separate VLANs. This layer 2 separation of multicast and 
   unicast traffic can be employed as a workaround for point-to-point 
   link models to establish a common multicast link.

   Third, an address mapping between the layers is needed for common 
   group identification. Address resolution schemes depend on framing 
   details for the technologies in use, but commonly cause a significant 
   address overlap at the lower layer. 
    
4.2 Multicast for Specific Technologies 
    
4.2.1 802.11 WLAN 
    
   IEEE 802.11 WLAN is a broadcast network of Ethernet type. This 
   inherits multicast address mapping concepts from 802.3. In 
   infrastructure mode an access point operates as repeater, only 
   bridging data between the Base (BSS) and the Extended Service Set 
   (ESS). A mobile node submits multicast data to an access point in 
   point-to-point acknowledged unicast mode (when the ToDS bit is set). 
   An access point receiving multicast data from a MN simply repeats 
   multicast frames to the BSS and propagates them to the ESS as 
   unacknowledged broadcast. Multicast frames received from the ESS 
   receive similar treatment. 
    
   Multicast frame delivery has the following characteristics: 
    
    o As an unacknowledged service it offers limited reliability. 
      Frames (and hence packet) loss arise from interference,  
      collision, or time-varying channel properties. 
    
    o Data distribution may be delayed, as unicast power saving  
      synchronization via Traffic Indication Messages (TIM) does not 
      operate in multicast mode. Access points buffer multicast packets 
      while waiting for a larger DTIM interval, whenever stations use 
      the power saving mode.  
    
    o Multipoint data may cause congestion, because the distribution 
       system floods multicast, without further control. All access 
      points of the same subnet replicate multicast frames. 
    
   To limit or prevent the latter, many vendors have implemented a 
   configurable rate limit for forwarding multicast packets. 
   Additionally, an IGMP/MLD snooping or proxy may be active at the 
   bridging layer between the BSS and the ESS or at switches 
   interconnecting access points. 
    
4.2.2 802.16 WIMAX 
    
   IEEE 802.16 WIMAX combines a family of connection-oriented radio 
   transmission services, operating in distinguished, unidirectional 
   channels. The channel assignment is controlled by Base Stations, 
   which assign channel IDs (CIDs) within service flows to the 
   subscriber stations. Service flows may provide an optional Automatic 
 
 
Schmidt, Waehlisch      Expires - January 2009               [Page 14] 
                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
   Repeat Request (ARQ) to improve reliability and may operate in point-
   to-point or point-to-multipoint (restricted to downlink and without 
   ARQ) mode. 
    
   A WIMAX Base Station operates as a L2 switch in full duplex mode, 
   where switching is based on CIDs. Two possible IPv6 link models for 
   mobile access deployment scenarios exist: Shared IPv6 prefix and 
   point-to-point link model [41]. The latter treats each connection to 
   a mobile node as a single link and is recommended in the IPv6 
   Convergence Sublayer [42], while MAC separation within a shared 
   prefix is applied in the IP over Ethernet CS [43]. The point-to-point 
   link model on the IP layer conflicts with a consistent group 
   distribution via a shared medium (cf. section 4.1 for MVR as a 
   workaround). 
    
   To invoke a multipoint data channel, the base station assigns a 
   common CID to all Subscriber Stations in the group. An IPv6 multicast 
   address mapping to these 16 bit IDs is proposed by copying either the 
   4 lowest bits, while sustaining the scope field, or by utilizing the 
   8 lowest bits derived from Multicast on Ethernet CS [44]. For 
   selecting group members, a Base Station may implement IGMP/MLD 
   snooping or proxy as foreseen in 802.16e-2005 [45].  
    
   A Subscriber Station will send multicast data to a Base Station as a 
   point-to-point unicast stream, which - in the presence of the IPv6 CS 
   - is forwarded to the upstream access router. The access router or - 
   in the presence of the IP over Ethernet CS - the Base Station may 
   return multicast data to the downstream Base Station by feeding into 
   a multicast service channel. On reception, a Subscriber Station 
   cannot distinguish multicast from unicast streams.  
    
   Multicast services have the following characteristics: 
    
    o Multicast CIDs are unidirectional and available only in the  
      downlink direction. Thus a native broadcast-type forwarding model  
      is not available. 
    
    o The mapping of multicast addresses to CIDs needs standardization,  
      since different entities (Access Router, Base Station) may have 
      to perform the mapping.  
    
    o CID collisions for different multicast groups are very likely due 
      to the short ID space. As a consequence, multicast data  
      transmission may occur in joint point-to-multipoint groups of  
      reduced selectiveness.  
    
    o The point-to-point link model for mobile access contradicts a  
      consistent mapping of IP layer multicast onto 802.16  
      point-to-multipoint services.

    o Multipoint channels cannot operate ARQ service and thus  
      experience a reduced reliability. 
    
4.2.3 3GPP 
    
   The 3GPP System architecture spans a circuit switched (CS) and a 
   packet switched (PS) domain, the latter General Packet Radio Services 
   (GPRS) incorporates the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) [46]. The 3GPP 
   PS is connection-oriented and based on the concept of Packet Data 
   Protocol (PDP) Contexts. PDPs define point-to-point links between the 
   Mobile Terminal and the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). Internet 
   service types are PPP, IPv4 and IPv6, where the recommendation for 
   IPv6 address assignment associates a prefix to each (primary) PDP 
   context [47]. Current packet filtering practice causes inter-working 
   problems between Mobile IPv6 nodes connected via GPRS [48]. 
    
   In UMTS Rel. 6 the IMS was extended to include Multimedia Broadcast 
   and Multicast Services (MBMS). A point-to-multipoint GPRS connection 
   service is operated on radio links, while the gateway service to 
   Internet multicast is handled at the IGMP/MLD-aware GGSN. Local 
   multicast packet distribution is used within the GPRS IP backbone 
   resulting in the common double encapsulation at GGSN: global IP 
   multicast datagrams over GTP (with multipoint TID) over local IP 
   multicast.  
    
   The 3GPP MBMS has the following characteristics: 
    
    o There is no immediate layer 2 source-to-destination transition,  
      resulting in transit of all multicast traffic at the GGSN. 
    
    o As GGSN commonly are regional, distant entities, triangular  
      routing and encapsulation may cause a significant degradation of 
      efficiency.  
    
4.2.4 DVB-H / DVB-IPDC 
    
   Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds (DVB-H) is a unidirectional 
   physical layer broadcasting specification for the efficient delivery 
   of broadband, IP-encapsulated data streams, and published as an ETSI 
   standard [49] (see http://www.dvb-h.org). DVB uses a mechanism called 
   multi-protocol encapsulation (MPE), which enables a transport of 
   network layer protocols on top of a link layer built from MPEG-2 
   transport streams and includes link forward error correction (FEC). 
   In this model, DVB transmission networks not only support TV 
   broadcasting, but also offer an IP Datacast Service. DVB-IPDC [33] 
   consists of a number of individual, application layer specifications, 
   some of which continue to be developed. Transport Streams (TS) form 
   the basic logical channels, identified by a 13 bit TS ID (PID). This, 
 
 
Schmidt, Waehlisch      Expires - January 2009               [Page 16] 
                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
   together with a multiplex service ID, is associated with IPv4 or IPv6 
   addresses [50] and used for selective traffic filtering at receivers. 
   Upstream channels may complement DVB-H using alternative transmission 
   technologies. 
    
   Multicast distribution services are defined by a mapping of groups 
   onto appropriate PIDs, which is managed at the IP Encapsulator [51]. 
   To increase flexibility and avoid collisions, this address resolution 
   is facilitated by dynamic tables, provided within the self-consistent 
   MPEG-2 TS. Mobility is supported in the sense that changes of cell 
   ID, network ID or Transport Stream ID are foreseen [52]. A multicast 
   receiver thus needs to re-locate the multicast services it is 
   subscribed to, which is to be done in the synchronization phase, and 
   update its service filters. Its handover decision may depend on 
   service availability. An active service subscription (multicast join) 
   requires initiation at the IP Encapsulator / DVB-H Gateway, which 
   cannot be signaled in a pure DVB-H network.  
    
4.3 Vertical Multicast Handovers 
    
   A mobile multicast node may operate homogeneous (horizontal) or 
   heterogeneous (vertical) layer 2 handovers with or without layer 3 
   network changes. Consequently, a dedicated context transfer of 
   multicast configuration is required at network access. Media 
   Independent Handover (MIH) is addressed in IEEE 802.21 [53], but is 
   relevant also beyond IEEE protocols. Mobility services transport for 
   MIH naturally reside on the network layer and are currently in the 
   process of specification [54]. 
    
   MIH needs to assist in more than service discovery: There is a need 
   for complex, media dependent multicast adaptation, a possible absence 
   of MLD signaling in L2-only transfers and requirements originating 
   from predictive handovers, a multicast mobility services transport 
   needs to be sufficiently comprehensive and abstract to initiate a 
   seamless multicast handoff at network access. 
    
   Functions required for MIH include: 
    
    o Service discovery. 
    o Service context transformation. 
    o Service context transfer. 
    o Service invocation. 
    
    
5. Solutions 
    
5.1 General Approaches 
    
   Three approaches to mobile multicast are common [55]:  
 
 
Schmidt, Waehlisch      Expires - January 2009               [Page 17] 
                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
    
    o Bi-directional Tunnelling, in which the mobile node tunnels all 
      multicast data via its home agent. This fundamental multicast  
      solution hides all movement and results in static multicast  
      trees. It may be employed transparently by mobile multicast  
      listeners and sources, at the cost of triangular routing and  
      possibly significant performance degradation from widely spanned  
      data tunnels. 
    
    o Remote Subscription forces the mobile node to re-initiate  
      multicast distribution following handover, e.g., by submitting an  
      MLD listener report to the subnet where a receiver attaches. This  
      approach of tree discontinuation relies on multicast dynamics to  
      adapt to network changes. It not only results in significant  
      service disruption, but leads to mobility-driven changes of  
      source addresses, and thus cannot support session persistence  
      under multicast source mobility. 
    
    o Agent-based solutions attempt to balance between the previous two  
      mechanisms. Static agents typically act as local tunnelling  
      proxies, allowing for some inter-agent handover when the mobile  
      node moves. A decelerated inter-tree handover, i.e. 'tree  
      walking', will be the outcome of agent-based multicast mobility,  
      where some extra effort is needed to sustain session persistence  
      through address transparency of mobile sources. 
    
   MIPv6 [6] introduces bi-directional tunnelling as well as remote 
   subscription as minimal standard solutions. Various publications 
   suggest utilizing remote subscription for listener mobility only, 
   while advising bi-directional tunnelling as the solution for source 
   mobility. Such an approach avoids the 'tunnel convergence' or 
   'avalanche' problem [55], which refers to the responsibility of the 
   home agent to multiply and encapsulate packets for many receivers of 
   the same group, even if they are located within the same subnetwork. 
   However, this suffers from the drawback that multicast communication 
   roles are not explicitly known at the network layer and may change 
   unexpectedly. 
    
   None of the above approaches address SSM source mobility, except the 
   use of bi-directional tunnelling. 
    
    
5.2 Solutions for Multicast Listener Mobility 
    
5.2.1 Agent Assistance 
    
   There are proposals for agent-assisted handover for host-based 
   mobility, which complement the unicast real-time mobility 
   infrastructure of Fast MIPv6 [21], the M-FMIPv6 [56,57], and of

   Hierarchical MIPv6 [22], the M-HMIPv6 [58], and to context transfer 
   [59], which have been thoroughly analyzed in [27,60].  
    
   Network based mobility management, PMIPv6 [61], at its current stage 
   of evolution is multicast transparent, as the MN experiences a point-
   to-point home link fixed at its local mobility anchor (LMA). A PMIPv6 
   domain thereby inherits the tunnel convergence problem; future 
   optimizations and extensions to shared links should foresee native 
   multicast distribution towards the edge network, including context 
   transfer between access gateways to assist IP-mobility-agnostic MNs.  
    
   An approach based on dynamically negotiated inter-agent handovers is 
   presented in [62]. Aside from IETF work, countless publications 
   present proposals for seamless multicast listener mobility, e.g. [63] 
   provides a comprehensive overview. 
    
5.2.2 Multicast Encapsulation 
    
   Encapsulation of multicast data packets is an established method to 
   shield mobility and to enable access to remotely located data 
   services, e.g., streams from the home network. Applying generic 
   packet tunnelling in IPv6 [64] using a unicast point-to-point method 
   will also allow multicast-agnostic domains to be transited, but does 
   inherit the tunnel convergence problem and may result in traffic 
   multiplication. 
    
   Multicast enabled environments may take advantage of point-to-
   multipoint encapsulation, i.e., generic packet tunnelling using an 
   appropriate multicast destination address in the outer header. Such 
   multicast-in-multicast encapsulated packets similarly enable 
   reception of remotely located streams, but do not suffer from the 
   scaling overhead from using unicast tunnels. 
    
   The tunnel entry point performing encapsulation should provide 
   fragmentation of data packets to avoid issues resulting from MTU size 
   constraints within the network(s) supporting the tunnel(s).  
    
5.2.3 Hybrid Architectures 
 
   There has been recent interest in seeking method that avoid the 
   complexity at the Internet core network, e.g. application layer and 
   overlay proposals for (mobile) multicast. The possibility of 
   integrating multicast distribution on the overlay into the network 
   layer is also being considered by the IRTF Scalable Adaptive 
   Multicast (SAM) Research Group. 
    
   An early hybrid architecture using reactively operating proxy-
   gateways located at the Internet edges was introduced by Garyfalos 
   and Almeroth [32]. The authors presented an Intelligent Gateway

                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
   Multicast as a bridge between mobility-aware native multicast 
   management in access networks and mobility group distribution 
   services in the Internet core, which may be operated on the network 
   or application layer. The Hybrid Shared Tree approach [65] introduced 
   a mobility-agnostic multicast backbone on the overlay. 
    
   Current work in the SAM RG is developing general architectural 
   approaches for hybrid multicast solutions [66] that will require a 
   detailed design in future work. 
    
5.2.4 MLD Extensions 
    
   The default timer values specified in MLD [17] were not designed for 
   the mobility context. This results in a slow reaction of the 
   multicast routing infrastructure (including layer-3-aware access 
   devices [67]) following a client leave. This may be a disadvantage 
   for wireless links, where performance may be improved by carefully 
   tuning the Query Interval. Some vendors have optimised performance by 
   implementing a listener node table at the access router that can 
   eliminate query timeouts on leaves (explicit receiver tracking).  
    
   A MN operating predictive handover, e.g., using FMIPv6, may 
   accelerate multicast service termination when leaving the previous 
   network by submitting an early Done message before handoff. MLD 
   router querying will allow the multicast forwarding state to be 
   restored in case of an erroneous prediction (i.e., an anticipated 
   move to a network that is not fulfilled). Backward context transfer 
   may otherwise ensure a leave is signaled. A further optimization was 
   introduced by Jelger and Noel [68] for the special case when the HA 
   is a multicast router. A Done message received through a tunnel from 
   the mobile end node (through a point-to-point link directly 
   connecting the MN, in general), should not initiate regular MLD 
   membership queries (with a subsequent timeout). Such explicit 
   treatment of point-to-point links will reduce traffic and accelerate 
   the control protocol. Explicit tracking will cause identical protocol 
   behavior. 
    
   While away from home, a MN may wish to rely on a proxy or 'standby' 
   multicast membership service, optionally provided by a HA or proxy 
   router. Such functions rely on the ability to restart fast packet 
   forwarding; it may be desirable for the proxy router to remain part 
   of the multicast delivery tree, even when transmission of group data 
   is paused. To enable such proxy control, the authors in [68] propose 
   an extension to MLD, introducing a Listener Hold message that is 
   exchanged between the MN and the HA. This idea was developed in [58] 
   to propose multicast router attendance control, allowing for a 
   general deployment of group membership proxies. Some currently 
   deployed IPTV solutions use such a mechanism in combination with a

   recent (video) frame buffer, to enable fast channel switching between 
   several IPTV multicast flows (zapping).  
    
5.3 Solutions for Multicast Source Mobility 
    
5.3.1 Any Source Multicast Mobility Approaches 
    
   Solutions for multicast source mobility can be divided in to three 
   categories: 
    
    o Statically Rooted Distribution Trees. These methods follow a 
      shared tree approach. Romdhani et al. [69] proposed employing 
      the Rendezvous Points of PIM-SM as mobility anchors. Mobile 
      senders tunnel their data to these "Mobility-aware Rendezvous 
      Points" (MRPs). When restricted to a single domain, this scheme is 
      equivalent to bi-directional tunneling. Focusing on interdomain 
      mobile multicast, the authors designed a tunnel- or SSM-based 
      backbone distribution of packets between MRPs. 
    
    o Reconstruction of Distribution Trees. Several authors have  
      proposed the construction of a completely new distribution tree 
      after the movement of a mobile source and therefore have to  
      compensate for the additional routing (tree-building) delay.  
      M-HMIPv6 [58] tunnels data into a previously established tree 
      rooted at mobility anchor points to compensate for the routing 
      delay until a protocol dependent timer expires. The RBMoM  
      protocol [70] introduces an additional Multicast Agent (MA) that 
      advertises its service range. A mobile source registers with 
      the closest MA and tunnels data through it. When moving out of  
      the previous service range, it will perform MA discovery, a re- 
      registration and continue data tunneling with a newly established 
      Multicast Agent in its new current vicinity. 
    
    o Tree Modification Schemes. In the case of DVMRP routing,  
      Chang and Yen [71] propose an algorithm to extend the root of a 
      given delivery tree for incorporating a new source location in 
      ASM. The authors rely on a complex additional signaling protocol 
      to fix DVMRP forwarding states and heal failures in the reverse 
      path forwarding (RPF) checks. 
    
5.3.2 Source Specific Multicast Mobility Approaches 
    
   The shared tree approach of [69] has been extended to support SSM 
   mobility by introducing the HoA address record to the Mobility-aware 
   Rendezvous Points. The MRPs operate using extended multicast routing 
   tables that simultaneously hold the HoA and CoA and thus can 
   logically identify the appropriate distribution tree. Mobility thus 
   re-introduces the concept of rendezvous points to SSM routing. 
    
 
 
Schmidt, Waehlisch      Expires - January 2009               [Page 21] 
                             MMCASTv6-PS                    July 2008 
 
 
   Approaches for reconstructing SPTs in SSM rely on a client 
   notification to establish new router state. It also needs to preserve 
   address transparency for the client. Thaler [72] proposed introducing 
   a binding cache and providing source address transparency analogous 
   to MIPv6 unicast communication. Initial session announcements and 
   changes of source addresses are distributed periodically to clients 
   via an additional multicast control tree rooted at the home agent. 
   Source tree handovers are then activated on listener requests.  
    
   Jelger and Noel [73] suggest handover improvements employing anchor 
   points within the source network, supporting continuous data 
   reception during client initiated handovers. Client updates are 
   triggered out of band, e.g. by SDR/SAP [74]. Receiver-oriented tree 
   construction in SSM thus remains unsynchronized with source 
   handovers. 
    
   To address the synchronization problem at the routing layer, several 
   proposals have focused on direct modification of the distribution 
   trees. A recursive scheme may use loose unicast source routes with 
   branch points, based on a multicast Hop-by-Hop protocol. Vida et al 
   [75] optimized SPT for a moving source on the path between the source 
   and first branching point. O'Neill [76] suggested a scheme to 
   overcome RPF check failures that originate from multicast source 
   address changes with a rendezvous point scenario by introducing 
   extended routing information, which accompanies data in a Hop-by-Hop 
   option "RPF redirect" header. The Tree Morphing approach of Schmidt 
   and Waehlisch [77] used source routing to extend the root of a 
   previously established SPT, thereby injecting router state updates in 
   a Hop-by-Hop option header. Using extended RPF checks the elongated 
   tree autonomously initiates shortcuts and smoothly reduces to a new 
   SPT rooted at the relocated source. Lee et al. [78] introduced a 
   state-update mechanism for re-using major parts of established 
   multicast trees. The authors start from an initially established 
   distribution state, centered at the mobile source's home agent. A 
   mobile leaving its home network will signal a multicast forwarding 
   state update on the path to its home agent and, subsequently, 
   distribution states according to the mobile source's new CoA along 
   the previous distribution tree. Multicast data is then intended to 
   flow natively using triangular routes via the elongation and an 
   updated tree centered on the home agent. 
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document discusses multicast extensions to mobility. It does not 
   define new methods or procedures. Security issues arise from source 
   address binding updates, specifically in the case of source specific 
   multicast. Threats of hijacking unicast sessions will result from any

   solution jointly operating binding updates for unicast and multicast 
   sessions.  
    
   Admission control issues may arise with new CoA source addresses 
   being introduced to SSM channels (cf. [79] for a comprehensive 
   discussion). Due to lack of feedback, the admission [80] and binding 
   updates [81] of mobile multicast sources require self-consistent 
   authentication as achievable by Cryptographically Generated Addresses 
   (CGAs).  
    
   Modification to IETF protocols (e.g. routing, membership, session 
   announcement and control) can introduce security vulnerabilities and 
   require consideration of issues such as authentication of network 
   entities, methods to mitigate denial of service (in terms of unwanted 
   network traffic, unnecessary consumption of router/host resources and 
   router/host state/buffers). Future solutions must therefore analyze 
   and address the security implications of supporting mobile multicast. 
    
    
7.Summary and Future Steps 
    
   This document is intended to provide a basis for the future design of 
   mobile IPv6 multicast methods and protocols by: 
    
        o providing a structured overview of the problem space that 
          multicast and mobility jointly generate at the IPv6 layer; 
    
        o referencing the implications and constraints arising from  
          lower and upper layers, and from deployment; 
    
        o briefly surveying conceptual ideas of currently available  
          solutions; 
    
        o including a comprehensive bibliographic reference base. 
    
   It is recommended that future steps towards extending mobility 
   services to multicast proceed to first solve the following problems: 
    
     1. Ensure seamless multicast reception during handovers,  
        meeting the requirements of mobile IPv6 nodes and networks. 
        Thereby address the problems of home subscription without  
        n-tunnels, as well as native multicast reception in those  
        visited networks, which offer a group communication service. 
    
     2. Integrate multicast listener support into unicast mobility  
        management schemes and architectural entities to define a  
        consistent mobility service architecture, providing equal  
        supporting for unicast and multicast communication.

     3. Provide basic multicast source mobility by designing  
        address duality management at end nodes.  
    
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this draft. 
    
    
Appendix A. Implicit Source Notification Options 
    
   An IP multicast source transmits data to a group of receivers without 
   requiring any explicit feedback from the group. Sources therefore are 
   unaware at the network-layer of whether any receivers have subscribed 
   to the group, and unconditionally send multicats packets which 
   propagate in the network to the first-hop router (often known in PIM 
   as the designated router). There have been attempts to implicitly 
   obtain information about the listening group members, e.g. extending 
   an IGMP/MLD querier to inform the source of the existence of 
   subscribed receivers. Multicast Source Notification of Interest 
   Protocol (MSNIP) [82] was such a suggested method that allowed a 
   multicast source to querying the upstream designated router. However, 
   this work did not progress within the IETF mboned working group and 
   was terminated by IETF.  
    
   Multicast sources may also be controlled at the session or transport 
   layer using end-to-end control protocols. A majority of real-time 
   applications employ the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) [83].  The 
   accompanying control protocol RTCP [81] allows receivers to report 
   information about multicast group membership and associated 
   performance data. In multicast, the RTCP reports are submitted to the 
   same group and thus may be monitored by the source to monitor, manage 
   and control multicast group operations. The Real Time Streaming 
   Protocol (RTSP), (RFC 2326) provides session layer control that may 
   be used to control a multicast source. However, RTCP and RTSP 
   information is intended for end-to-end control and is not necessarily 
   visble at the network layer. Application designers may chose to 
   implement any appropriate control plane for their multicast 
   applications (e.g. reliable multicast transport protocols_), and 
   therefore a network-layer mobility mechanism must not assume the 
   presence of a specific transport or session protocols.

Acknowledgments 
    
   Work on exploring the problem space for mobile multicast has been 
   pioneered by Greg Daley and Gopi Kurup within their early draft 
   "Requirements for Mobile Multicast Clients" (draft-daley-magma-
   mobile). 
    
   Since then, many people have actively discussed the different issues 
   and contributed to the enhancement of this memo. The authors would 
   like to thank (in alphabetical order) Kevin C. Almeroth, Hans L. 
   Cycon, Hui Deng, Zhigang Huang, Christophe Jelger, Rajeev Koodli, 
   Mark Palkow, Imed Romdhani, Hesham Soliman, Dave Thaler and last but 
   not least very special thanks to Stig Venaas for his frequent and 
   thorough advice.
