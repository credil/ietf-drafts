1.  Introduction

   This document defines a framework for certificate management
   interactions between a resource issuer ("Internet Registry" or "IR")
   and a resource recipient ("Internet Service Provider" or "ISP")
   through the specification of a protocol for interaction between the
   two parties.  The protocol supports the transmission of requests from
   the ISP, and corresponding responses from the IR encompassing the
   actions of certificate issuance, certificate revocation and
   certificate status information reports.  This protocol is intended to
   be limited to the application of resource certificate management and
   is not intended to be used as part of a more general certificate
   management framework.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC3280], "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], "Internet
   Protocol" [RFC0791], "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing
   Architecture" [RFC4291], "Internet Registry IP Allocation Guidelines"
   [RFC2050], and related regional Internet registry address management
   policy documents.

   Additional terms used in this document are:

   "IR"  an abbreviation of "Internet Registry", using in the context of
      this document as an entity undertaking the role of resource
      issuer.  An IR is a Certificate Authority, and can issue Resource
      Certificates.

   "ISP"  an abbreviation of "Internet Service Provider", using in the
      context of this document as an entity undertaking the role of
      resource recipient who is the subject of a Resource Certificate.
      An ISP may be issued with a CA-enabled certificate, allowing the
      entity to also assume the role of an IR.

   "resource class"  a resource class refers to a collection of
      resources that can be certified in a single resource certificate
      by an issuer.

   "server"  in the context of this client/server protocol
      specification, the IR assumes the role of the "server."

Internet-Draft            Rescert Provisioning              January 2008


   "client"  in the context of this client/server protocol
      specification, the ISP assumes the role of the "client."


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Scope

   This protocol defines a basic set of interactions that allow an ISP
   to request certificate issuance, revocation and status information
   from the IR, and for a IR to maintain an issued certificate set that
   is aligned to the allocation records relating to each ISP.  The IR's
   resource allocation database, is the authoritative source of what
   resource allocations the IR may certify for an ISP.

   A resource recipient (ISP) may also undertake the role of a resource
   issuer (IR), such as in the case of a Local Internet Registry (LIR).

   This protocol specification does not encompass:

   o  signing of objects with keys that are certified by resource
      certificates, nor the issuance of end-entity certificates.

   o  the specification of interaction with the IR's resource allocation
      database, nor the specification of a protocol to manage the
      publication repository.

   o  the interactions between client and server that establish
      identities, exchange the keys used in the protection of the
      communications channel between client and server, and the exchange
      of the certificates and validation PKI contexts used in the
      Cryptographic Message Syntax message exchange.



3.  Protocol Specification

   This protocol is expressed as a simple request/response interaction,
   where the client passes a request to the server, and the server
   generates a corresponding response.

   The protocol is implemented as an exchange of XML-formatted data
   objects.

   The underlying transport for this protocol is HTTPS [RFC2818] using 2



Huston, et al.            Expires July 5, 2008                  [Page 4]

   way (mutual) identification.  The client initiates an HTTP POST with
   content type of "application/x-rpki", with the message object as the
   body.  The server's response will similarly be the body of the
   response with a content type of "application/x-rpki".  The content of
   the POST, and the server's response, will be a "well-formed"
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852] object, encoded using
   the Distinguished Encoding Rules for ASN.1 (DER) [X.509-88].

   The request / response interaction is assumed to be reliable, in that
   all requests will generate a matching response.  The protocol
   requires sequential operation, where the server MUST NOT accept a
   client's request unless it has generated and sent a response to the
   client's previous request.  Attempts by the client to initiate
   multiple requests in parallel MUST be detected by the server and
   rejected with an error response.

3.1.  Common Message format

   The XML template for all messages is as follows:


   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <message xmlns="http://www.apnic.net/specs/rescerts/up-down/"
            version="1"
            sender="sender name"
            recipient = "recipient name"
            type="message type">

   [payload]

   </message>

   ---------------------------------------------------------------


   The message is passed over an HTTPS transport connection that
   safeguards against interception and replay attacks.  The HTTPS
   session uses mutually authenticated TLS.  The TLS keys and associated
   certificates have been previously established between the two
   entities.

   The message is signed by the sender using a communications key and
   associated certificate that has been previously established between
   the two entities.  The message signing format is CMS with a
   timestamp.  The CMS keys and certificates MAY be the same as those
   used for TLS.

   version:
      the value of this attribute is the version of this protocol.  This
      document describes version 1.

   sender:
      the value of this attribute is the agreed name of the message
      sender, as determined between the client and the server by prior
      arrangement.

   recipient:
      the value of this attribute is the agreed name of the message
      recipient, as determined between the client and the server by
      prior arrangement.

   type:
      the possible values of this attribute are "list", "list_response",
      "issue", "issue_response", "revoke", "revoke_response", and
      "error_response".

   Conforming parsers MUST reject any document with a version number
   they do not understand, or with any elements or attributes they do
   not understand.  Servers must generate an error response when
   receiving such a request.  Clients should generate an operator alert
   error when receiving such a response.

   A message in this protocol is a digitally signed object that makes
   use of CMS [RFC3852], and is encoded as DER.  It uses the signed-data
   object contentType OID: 1.2.840.113549.1.7.2.  The attribute "id-
   signingTime" (contentType OID: 1.2.840.113549.1.9.5) MUST be present
   in the CMS object.

   The encapsulated content of the CMS wrapping is an XML document.  The
   remainder of this protocol specification omits this CMS wrapper and
   only discusses the XML document.

   Messages are checked using the following tests:

   1.  Check the integrity of the HTTPS message and validate the TLA
       certificate using the PKI that has been determined by prior
       arrangement between client and server.

   2.  Check that the CMS is well-formed.

   3.  Check that the XML is well-formed.

   4.  Check that the XML sender and recipient attributes reference a
       known client and this server's system respectively.

Internet-Draft            Rescert Provisioning              January 2008


   5.  Verify the digital signature using the public key provided in the
       certificate carried in the CMS wrapper.

   6.  Validate the CMS-provided certificate using the PKI that has been
       determined by prior arrangement between client and server.

   7.  Check that the value of the version number of the message is 1.

   The checks should generally be applied in the order specified here.

   Any errors encountered while checking items 1 through 6 would cause
   the server to generate an "HTTP 400 Bad Data" response to the HTTPS
   POST operation.  An error in step 7 would cause the server to
   generate a "Request-Not-Performed" error response.

3.2.  Control - Resource Class Query

3.2.1.  Resource Class List Query

   The value of the message "type" message attribute for this query is:

      type="list"


   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Payload:

   [No message payload is defined for this query]

   ---------------------------------------------------------------


3.2.2.  Resource Class List Response

   The value of the message "type" element for this response is:

      type="list_response"

   Payload:

    <class class_name="class name"
        cert_url="url"
        resource_set_as="as resource set"
        resource_set_ipv4="ipv4 resource set"
        resource_set_ipv6="ipv6 resource set"
        resource_set_notafter="datetime"
        suggested_sia_head="[directory uri]" >
        <certificate cert_url="url"
            req_resource_set_as="as resource set"
            req_resource_set_ipv4="ipv4 resource set"
            req_resource_set_ipv6="ipv6 resource set" >
        [certificate]
        </certificate>

        ...

        (repeated for each current certificate where the client
         is the certificate's subject)

        <issuer>[issuer's certificate]</issuer>
        </class>

    ...

    (repeated for each of the issuer's resource class where the
     client has been allocated resources)


   ---------------------------------------------------------------


   Where the client has been allocated resources from multiple resource
   classes, then the response will contain multiple class elements,
   corresponding to the complete set of the issuer's resource classes
   where the client holds allocated resources.  Those issuer's resource
   classes where the client holds no allocated resources will not be
   included in the response.

   Where the issuer has issued multiple certificates in a resource class
   signed with different keys (as may occur during a staged issuer-key
   rollover), only the most recent certificate issued with the currently
   "active" issuer's key will be listed in the response.

   Each "class" element describes a set of resources that are certified

   within the scope of a single certificate, referring to a single
   resource class with a common validation path.

   class_name:
      the value of this attribute is the issuer-assigned name of the
      issuer's Resource Class.

   cert_url:
      in the context of a class element, the value of this attribute is
      a pointer to the issuer's CA certificate (i.e. a reference to the
      immediate superior certificate, being the CA-enabled certificate
      where the issuer is the certificate's subject).  Its value is a
      comma-separated list of URIs, of which at least one MUST be an
      RSYNC URI.  Any comma values within a URI MUST be escaped ("%2C").
      The ordering of the list may be interpreted by the client as a
      relative preference for access methods as expressed by the
      publisher of this certificate.

   resource_set_as:
      in the context of a class element, the value of this attribute is
      the set of AS numbers and AS number ranges that the issuer has
      allocated to the client within the scope of this resource class,
      presented in ASCII as a comma-separated list.  The list elements
      are decimal integer values and ranges of decimal integers
      specified by the low and high value of the range with a hyphen
      delimiter, using the canonical order as described in [RFC3779],
      without leading zeros, and with no white space or punctuation
      other than the comma and the hyphen range designator (e.g.:
      resource_set_as="123,456-789,123456").  If there are no AS numbers
      in this Resource Class the empty set will be represented by a null
      string value ("") for this attribute.

   resource_set_ipv4:
      in the context of a class element, the value of this attribute is
      the set of IPv4 addresses that the issuer has allocated to the
      client within the scope of this resource class.  The value is
      presented in ASCII as a comma-separated list of elements.  Each
      element is either an address prefix using the notation of <dotted
      quad>/mask length, or a range specified as low and high range
      values in dotted quad notation with a hyphen delimiter.  The list
      is presented in canonical order, as described in [RFC3779].  The
      dotted quad notation is without leading zeros, and the list
      contains no white space or punctuation other than the period,
      forward slash, hyphen and comma. (e.g.
      resource_set_ipv4="192.0.2.0/26,192.0.2.66-192.0.2.76") If there
      are no IPv4 addresses in this resource class the empty set will be
      represented by a null string value ("") for this attribute.

Internet-Draft            Rescert Provisioning              January 2008


   resource_set_ipv6:
      in the context of a class element, the value of this attribute is
      the set of IPv6 addresses that the issuer has allocated to the
      client within the scope of this resource class.  The value is
      presented in ASCII as a comma-separated list of elements.  Each
      element is either an address prefix using the notation of <hex
      nibble sequence>/mask length, or a range specified as low and high
      range values in hex nibble notation with a hyphen delimiter.
      Trailing zero nibbles are truncated and represented by '::'.  The
      list is presented in canonical order, as described in [RFC3779].
      The hex nibble sequence notation is without leading zeros, and the
      list contains no white space or punctuation other than the colon,
      forward slash, hyphen and comma (e.g. resource_set_ipv6="2001:
      0DB8::/48,2001:0DB8:002::-2001:0DB8:005::").  The XML Schema data
      type is http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#hexBinary and value is
      case insensitive, with the canonical form being upper case.  If
      there are no IPv6 addresses in this resource class the empty set
      will be represented by a null string value ("") for this
      attribute.

   resource_set_notafter:
      The value of this attribute specified the date/time that would be
      set in the Validity notAfter field in any new certificate issued
      for this particular client within the scope of this resource
      class, should the client request a new certificate.  The time
      format used for the value of this attribute is specified as ISO
      8601 [ISO.8601:2004], and MUST use UTC time (i.e.  YYYY-MM-
      DDThh:mm:ssZ, e.g. 2007-11-29T04:40:00Z).  If the client's
      certificate has a validity notAfter time that is different to this
      this time then the client SHOULD request a new certificate to be
      issued for this resource class.

   suggested_sia_head:  (OPTIONAL)
      If this field is present then it indicates a publication namespace
      which the server has made available to the client to use for its
      own collection of published products.  Presence of this field does
      not mean that the client has permission from the repository
      operator to lodge under this URI, only that the client has
      permission from the server to lodge under this URI.

   [issuer's certificate]
      value is the Base64 encoding of the DER-encoded issuer's CA
      certificate (the CA-enabled certificate where the issuer is the
      certificate's subject).

   Each certificate element describes the most recently issued current
   certificate where the certificate's subject refers to the client for
   each active client key pair.  A "current" certificate is a non-

   expired, non-revoked certificate.  If no current certificate has been
   issued, then no certificate element will be included in the response.

   cert_url:
      in the context of a certificate element, this is a pointer to the
      location where the certificate issuer has published this
      certificate.  This field is the issuer's suggestion for the AIA
      field for the subject to use in subordinate certificates that are
      issued by the subject.  According to the Resource Certificate
      Profile [insert ref here] the AIA field is a non-empty (contains a
      minimum of 1 element) list of URI's, one of which MUST be an RSYNC
      URI.  The order of URI's in the AIA field may be interpreted as
      the publisher's relative preference for access methods for this
      certificate.  The cert_url conforms to this AIA specification.
      Its value is a comma-separated list of URIs, one of which MUST be
      an RSYNC URI.  Any comma values within a URI MUST be escaped
      ("%2C").

   req_resource_set_as:
      the set of AS numbers that were specified in the corresponding
      original certificate request that defined the maximal requested
      span of the certified AS number set, following the syntax
      described above.  If this attribute was present in the certificate
      request, then the attribute MUST be present in this response,
      otherwise it MUST NOT be present.

   req_resource_set_ipv4:
      the set of IPv4 addresses that were specified in the corresponding
      original certificate request that defined the maximal requested
      span of the certified IPv4 address set, following the syntax
      described above.  If this attribute was present in the certificate
      request, then the attribute MUST be present in this response,
      otherwise it MUST NOT be present.

   req_resource_set_ipv6:
      the set of IPv6 addresses that were specified in the corresponding
      original certificate request that defined the maximal requested
      span of the certified IPv6 address set, following the syntax
      described above.  If this attribute was present in the certificate
      request, then the attribute MUST be present in this response,

3.3.  CA - Certificate Issuance

3.3.1.  Certificate Issuance Request

   The value of the message "type" element for this request is:

      type="issue"


   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Payload:

   <request
              class_name="class name"
              req_resource_set_as="as resource set"
              req_resource_set_ipv4="ipv4 resource set"
              req_resource_set_ipv6="ipv6 resource set">
              [Certificate request]
              </request>

   ---------------------------------------------------------------


   The client must use different key pairs for each distinct resource
   class.

   If any of the req_resource_set attributes are specified in the
   request, then any missing req_resource_set attributes are to be
   interpreted as specifying the complete set of the corresponding
   resource type that match the client's current resource allocation.
   If the value of any req_resource_set attributes is the null value
   (""), then this indicates that no resources of that resource type are
   to be certified with this request.

   The requested resource set values are held as a local record by the
   issuer against the resource class and the client's public key.  Any
   subsequent Certificate Issuance Requests that specify the same
   Resource Class and the same client's public key will (re)set the
   issuer's local record of the requested resource sets to the most
   recently specified values.

   class_name:
      value is the server's identifier of a Resource Class.

Internet-Draft            Rescert Provisioning              January 2008


   req_resource_set_as:  (OPTIONAL)
      the set of AS numbers that define the maximal requested span of
      the certified AS number set, formatted as per the resource_set_as
      attribute of the Resource Class List Response.

   req_resource_set_ipv4:  (OPTIONAL)
      the set of IPv4 addresses that define the maximal requested span
      of the certified IPv4 address set, formatted as per the
      resource_set_ipv4 attribute of the Resource Class List Response.

   req_resource_set_ipv6:  (OPTIONAL)
      the set of IPv6 addresses that define the maximal requested span
      of the certified IPv6 address set, formatted as per the
      resource_set_ipv6 attribute of the Resource Class List Response.

   [Certificate request]
      value is the certificate request.  This is a Base-64 encoded DER
      version of a request formatted using PKCS#10.

3.3.2.  Certificate Issuance Response

   The value of the message "type" element for this response is:

      type="issue_response"


   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Payload:


    <class class_name="class name"
           cert_url="url"
           resource_set_as="as resource set"
           resource_set_ipv4="ipv4 resource set"

   If the certificate issuer determines that the issued certificate
   would be identical in all respects to the most recently issued
   certificate for this client, other than the certificate's serial
   number, were the certificate to be issued, the issuer may choose to
   respond with the most recently issued certificate and not issue a new
   certificate for this request.

   The definition of the attributes and syntax of the values is the same
   as the resource class list response, but the response only references
   the (single) named resource class, and the (single) certificate
   issued against the client's public key as provided in the
   corresponding certificate request.

3.4.  Certificate Revocation

3.4.1.  Certificate Revocation Request

   The value of the message "type" element for this request is:

      type="revoke"


   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Payload:


   <key class_name="class name"
        ski="encoded hash of the subject public key]" />


   ---------------------------------------------------------------


   This command 'retires' a client's key pair by requesting the issuer
   to revoke all certificates for this client that contain the matching
   public key, within the scope of a named Resource Class.  Individual
   issued certificates cannot be revoked within the scope of this
   protocol.

   This command directs the issuer to immediately mark all issued valid
   certificates issued by this issuer within the named Resource Class
   with this client's SKI value to be marked as revoked, causing the
   issued certificates to be withdrawn from the publication repository
   and to be listed in the server's subsequent CRLs within this Resource
   Class.

Internet-Draft            Rescert Provisioning              January 2008


   class_name:
      value is the issuer-assigned name of the issuer's Resource Class.

   ski:
      value is the encoded hash of the client's public key that is to be
      revoked.  The algorithm for the encoding is to generate the 160-
      bit SHA-1 hash of the client's public key, as defined in method
      (1) of section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC3280], and encode this value using
      the Base 64 encoding with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet, as
      defined in section 5 of [RFC4648].

3.4.2.  Certificate Revocation Response

   The value of the message "type" element for this response is:

      type="revoke_response"


   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Payload:


   <key class_name="class name"
        ski="encoded hash of the subject public key" />

   ---------------------------------------------------------------


   class_name:
      value is the issuer-assigned name of the server's Resource Class.

   ski:
      value is the encoded hash of the client's public key that is to be
      revoked.  The algorithm for the encoding is to generate the 160-
      bit SHA-1 hash of the client's public key, as defined in method
      (1) of section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC3280], and encode this value using
      the Base 64 encoding with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet, as
      defined in section 5 of [RFC4648].

3.5.  Request-Not-Performed Response

   The value of the message "type" element for this response is:

      type="error_response"

   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Payload:


   <status>[Code]</status>
   <description xml:lang="en-US">[Readable text]</description>

   ---------------------------------------------------------------


   All states where an error response if to be generated, either due to
   detected errors or inconsistencies in the content of the request or
   server-side states that prevent the request being performed, generate
   a Request-Not-Performed response.

   description:
      value is a text field.  This element MAY be present.  It's value
      has no defined meaning within the scope of this protocol, and
      implementations may assume that some form of human-readable text
      may be used here.  If the HTTP request that triggered this error
      response includes an Accept-Language header as defined in section
      14.4 of the HTTP/1.1 specification [insert reference to RFC2616]
      then the server will make a best effort to include a second
      description element using the highest ranked preferred language of
      the client.  The en-US description will always be included if the
      element is present.

   The error code set is:

      Code Value    Description
      1101          already processing request
      1102          version number error
      1103          unrecognised request type
      1201          request - no such resource class
      1202          request - no resources allocated in resource class
      1203          request - badly formed certificate request
      1301          revoke - no such resource class
      1302          revoke - no such key 2000+ Server Error
