                         Logging of NAT Events

Abstract

   Carrier grade NAT (CGN) devices are required to log events like
   creation and deletion of translations and information about the
   resources it is managing.  The logs are required in many cases to
   identify an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious
   attacks and/or for various other purposes of accounting.  Since there
   is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices
   behave differently and hence it is difficult to expect a consistent
   behavior.  The lack of a consistent way makes it difficult to write
   the collector applications that would receive this data and process
   it to present useful information.  This document describes the
   information that is required to be logged by the NAT devices.

1.  Terminology

   The usage of the term "NAT device" in this document refer to any
   NAT44 and NAT64 devices.  The usage of the term "collector" refers to
   any device that receives the binary data from a NAT device and
   converts that into meaningful information.  This document uses the
   term "Session" as it is defined in [RFC2663] and the term BIB as it
   is defined in [RFC6146]


2.  Introduction

   This document details the Information Elements(IEs) that are required
   to be logged by a NAT device.  The document will specify the formats
   of each and every field that are required to be logged by every NAT
   device and all the optional fields.  The fields specified in this
   document are gleaned from [RFC4787] and [RFC5382].

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Scope

   This document provides the information model to be used for logging
   the Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) events.  This document does not provide
   guidance on the transport protocol that is to be used to log NAT
   events.  The log events SHOULD NOT be lost but the choice of the
   actual transport protocol is beyond the scope of this document.

   This document assumes that the NAT device will use some existing
   framework like IPFIX, Netflow version 9 etc to send the log events to
   the collector.  But it is beyond the scope of the document to define
   the framework to be used for logging.  However, the framework should
   support specifying a template that the NAT device will use to send
   its events.  The templates can be of varying length and there could
   be multiple templates that a NAT device could use to log the events.
   This document provides IPFIX IEs as examples as most of the IEs
   defined for NAT event logging are already allocated by IANA in the
   IPFIX registry.

   The implementation details of the collector application is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   The optimization of logging the NAT events are left to the

   implementation and are beyond the scope of this document.


4.  Event based logging

   An event in a NAT device can be viewed as a happening as it relates
   to the management of NAT resources.  The creation and deletion of NAT
   sessions and bindings are examples of events as it results in the
   resources (addresses and ports) being allocated or freed.  The events
   can happen either through the processing of data packets flowing
   through the NAT device or through an external entity installing
   policies on the NAT router.  The list of events are provided in
   Section 4.1.  Each of these events SHOULD be logged, unless they are
   administratively prohibited.  A NAT device MAY log these events to
   multiple collectors if redundancy is required.  The network
   administrator will specify the collectors to which the log records
   are to be sent.

   Prior to logging any events, the NAT device MUST send the template of
   the record to the collector to declare the format of the data record
   that it is using to send the events.  The templates can be exchanged
   as frequently as required given the reliability of the connection.
   NAT device SHOULD combine as many events as possible in a single
   packet to effectively utilize the network bandwidth.

4.1.  Information Elements

   The templates could contain a subset of the Information Elements(IEs)
   shown in Table 1 depending upon the event being logged.  For example
   a NAT44 session creation template record will contain,

   {sourceIPv4Adress, postNATSourceIPv4Address, destinationIpv4Address,
   postNATDestinationIPv4Address, sourceTransportPort,
   postNAPTSourceTransportPort, destinationTransportPort,
   postNAPTDestTransportPort, natOriginatingAddressRealm, natEvent,
   timeStamp}

   An example of the actual event data record is shown below - in a
   readable form

   {192.168.16.1, 201.1.1.100, 207.85.231.104, 207.85.231.104, 14800,
   1024, 80, 80, 0, 1, 09:20:10:789}

   A single NAT device could be exporting multiple templates and the
   collector should support receiving multiple templates from the same
   source.

4.3.  Templates for NAT Events

   The following events are identified at the time of this writing but
   the events are expandable.  Depending on the implementation and
   configuration various IE's specified can be included or ignored

4.3.1.  NAT44 create and delete session event

   This event will be generated when a NAT44 session is created or
   deleted.  The template will be the same, the natEvent will indicate
   whether it is a create or a delete event.  The following is a
   template of the event.

4.3.9.  Addresses Exhausted event

   This event will be generated when a NAT device runs out of global
   IPv4 addresses.  Typically, this event would mean that the NAT device
   wont be able to create any new translations until some addresses/
   ports are freed.  The following is a template of the event.

4.3.10.  Ports Exhausted event

   This event will be generated when a NAT device runs out of ports for
   a global IPv4 addresses.  Port exhaustion shall be reported per
   protocol (UDP, TCP etc) The following is a template of the event.

4.3.11.  Quota exceeded

   This event will be generated when a NAT device cannot allocate
   resources as a result of an administratively defined policy.  The
   examples of Quota exceeded are to allow only certain number of NAT
   sessions per device, certain number of NAT sessions per user etc.
   The following is a template of the event.
