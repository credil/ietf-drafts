<section anchor="pcn_enc_intro" title="Introduction">
 <t>
   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) <xref target="RFC5559"></xref> is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic 
   flows within a Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable and robust fashion. The overall rate of the PCN-traffic 
   is metered on every link in the PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured 
   rates are exceeded. These configured rates are below the rate of the link thus providing notification before 
   any congestion occurs (hence “pre-congestion notification”). The level of marking allows the boundary nodes to 
   make decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) whether to 
   terminate some of the existing flows, thereby protecting the QoS of previously admitted flows.</t>
   
<t>
This document specifies how these PCN marks are encoded into the IP header by 
re-using the bits of the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>. 
It also describes how packets are identified as belonging to a PCN flow.  Some 
deployment models require two PCN encoding states, others require more. The baseline 
encoding described here only provides for two PCN encoding states. However the encoding
can be easily extended to provide more states. Rules for such extensions are given in 
<xref target="pcn_enc_experiments"></xref>.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_IP" title="Encoding two PCN States in IP">

<t> 
   The PCN encoding states are defined using a combination of the DSCP and ECN 
   fields within the IP header. The baseline PCN encoding closely follows the semantics 
   of ECN [RFC3168]. It allows the encoding of two PCN states: Not-marked and PCN-marked. 
   It also allows for traffic that is not PCN-capable to be marked as such (not-PCN). 
   Given the scarcity of codepoints within the IP header the baseline encoding leaves
   one codepoint free for experimental use. The following table defines 
   how to encode these states in IP:</t> 
<texttable anchor="pcn_enc_Tab_Default_coding" title="Encoding PCN in IP">
    <ttcol align="center">ECN codepoint</ttcol>

     <postamble>Where DSCP n is a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint (see <xref target="pcn_enc_DSCPs"></xref>) 
     and EXP means available for Experimental use. N.B. we deliberately reserve this codepoint for experimental 
     use only (and not local use) to prevent future compatibility issues.</postamble>
 </texttable>

 <t>
The following rules apply to all PCN traffic:
<list style="symbols">
      <t>PCN-traffic MUST be marked with a PCN-compatible Diffserv Codepoint. To conserve DSCPs, 
      Diffserv Codepoints SHOULD be chosen that are already defined for use with 
      admission controlled traffic. <xref target="pcn_enc_app_DSCP_choice"></xref> gives guidance to implementiors on suitable
	  DSCPs. Guidelines for mixing traffic-types within
      a PCN-domain are given in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Any packet that is not-PCN but which shares the same 
      Diffserv codepoint as PCN-enabled traffic MUST have the ECN field of its 
      outermost IP header equal to 00.  </t>

      </list> 
</t>
<section anchor="pcn_enc_valid_invalid" title="Valid and Invalid Codepoint Transitions">
<t>
A PCN-ingress-node MUST set the Not-marked (10) codepoint on any arriving packet that belongs to a PCN-flow. 
It MUST set the not-PCN (00) codepoint on all other packets sharing a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint.
</t>
<t>
The only valid codepoint transitions within a PCN-interior-node are from NM to PM (which should occur if either 
meter indicates a need to PCN-mark a packet <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour"></xref>) and from EXP to PM 
(which MAY be allowed by some future experimental extensions). The following table gives the full set of valid and 
invalid codepoint transitions.</t>
<artwork>
               +-------------------------------------------------+
               |                  Codepoint Out                  |
+--------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Codepoint in | not-PCN(00) |   NM(10)  |  EXP(01)  |   PM(11)  |

                   PCN-packets at PCN-interior-nodes         
       </artwork>    

<t>
A PCN-egress-node SHOULD set the not-PCN (00) codepoint on all packets it forwards out of the PCN-domain. 
The only exception to this is if the PCN-egress-node is certain that revealing other codepoints outside 
the PCN-domain won't contravene the guidance given in <xref target="RFC4774"></xref>.
</t>
</section>
<!-- ================================================================ -->
<section anchor="pcn_enc_rationale" title="Rationale for Encoding">

<t> 
 The exact choice of encoding was dictated by the constraints imposed by existing 
 IETF RFCs, in particular <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4301"></xref> and 
 <xref target="RFC4774"></xref>. One of the tightest constraints was 
 the need for any PCN encoding to survive being tunnelled through either an 
 IP in IP tunnel or an IPsec Tunnel. <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel"></xref> 
 explains this in more detail. The main effect of this constraint is that any PCN 
 marking has to carry the 11 codepoint in the ECN field since this is the only codepoint
 that is guaranteed to be copied down into the inner header upon 
 decapsulation. An additional constraint is the need to minimise the use of Diffserv 
 codepoints because there is a limited supply of standards track codepoints remaining. 
 <xref target="pcn_enc_DSCPs"></xref> explains how we have minimised this still 
 further by reusing pre-existing Diffserv codepoint(s) such that non-PCN traffic 
 can still be distinguished from PCN traffic. There are a number of factors that
 were considered before choosing to set 10 as the NM state instead of 01. These included similarity to 
 ECN, presence of tunnels within the domain, leakage into and out of PCN-domain and
 incremental deployment (see <xref target="pcn_enc_app_rationale"></xref>).
</t><t>
The encoding scheme above seems to meet all these constraints and ends up looking very similar to ECN. This is 
perhaps not surprising given the similarity in architectural intent between PCN and ECN. 

</t>

</section>
<!-- ================================================================ -->
<section anchor="pcn_enc_DSCPs" title="PCN-Compatible Diffserv Codepoints">

<t> 
 Equipment complying with the baseline PCN encoding MUST allow PCN to be enabled 
 for certain Diffserv codepoints. This document defines the term 
 "PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint" for such a DSCP. To be clear, any packets with such a DSCP
 will be PCN enabled only if they are within a PCN-domain and have their ECN field set to indicate a codepoint other than not-PCN.
 </t> <t>
Enabling PCN marking behaviour for a specific DSCP disables any other marking behaviour (e.g. enabling 
PCN  disables the default ECN marking behaviour introduced in 
<xref target="RFC3168"></xref>). All traffic metering and marking behaviours are discussed in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour"></xref>. This ensures compliance with the 
BCP guidance set out in <xref target="RFC4774"></xref>.
</t>
<t> The PCN Working Group has chosen not to define a single DSCP for use with PCN for several reasons. 
Firstly the PCN mechanism is applicable to a variety of different traffic classes. Secondly 
standards track DSCPs are in increasingly short supply. Thirdly PCN should be seen as being 
essentially a marking behaviour similar to ECN but intended for inelastic traffic. More details
are given in the informational appendix <xref target="pcn_enc_app_DSCP_choice"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="pcn_enc_not-PCN" title="Co-existence of PCN and not-PCN traffic">
	<t>
	The scarcity of pool 1 DSCPs coupled with the fact that PCN is envisaged as a marking behaviour that could be applied
    to a number of different DSCPs makes it essential that we provide a not-PCN state. As stated above (and expanded in 
	<xref target="pcn_enc_app_DSCP_choice"></xref>) the aim is for PCN to re-use existing DSCPs. Because PCN re-defines the 
	meaning of the ECN field for such DSCPs it is important to allow an operator to still use the DSCP for traffic that isn't
	PCN-enabled. This is achieved by providing a not-PCN state within the encoding scheme.	
	</t>

<section anchor="pcn_enc_experiments" title="Rules for Experimental Encoding Schemes">
<t>
Any experimental encoding scheme MUST follow these rules to ensure backward compatibility
with this baseline scheme: 
<list style="symbols">
<t>All Interior-nodes within a PCN-domain MUST interpret the 00 codepoint in the ECN field 
as not-PCN and MUST NOT change it to another value. Therefore an ingress node wishing to disable 
PCN marking for a packet within a PCN-compatible Diffserv Codepoint MUST set the ECN field to 00.
</t>
<t>The 11 codepoint in the ECN field MUST indicate PCN-marked (though this does not 
exclude the 01 Experimental codepoint from carrying the same meaning).
</t>
<t>Once set, the 11 codepoint in the ECN field MUST NOT be changed to any other codepoint.
</t>
<t>Any experimental scheme MUST include details of all valid and invalid codepoint 
transitions at any PCN nodes.</t>
<t> Any experimental scheme MUST NOT update the meaning of the 00 and 11 codepoints defined above.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="pcn_enc_compat" title="Backwards Compatibility">

<t>  BCP 124 <xref target="RFC4774"></xref> gives guidelines for specifying 
alternative semantics for the ECN field. It sets out a number of factors to be 
taken into consideration. It also suggests various techniques to allow 
the co-existence of default ECN and alternative ECN semantics. The baseline encoding 
specified in this document defines PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoints as no longer 
supporting the default ECN semantics. As such this document is compatible with 
BCP 124. It should be noted that this baseline encoding effectively disables end-to-end ECN 
unless mechanisms are put in place to tunnel such traffic across the PCN-domain.
Standard IP-in-IP or IPsec tunnels will always copy the CE codepoint from the outer header into the inner 
header in decapsulation (unless the inner packet is not-ECT). If an operator wishes to allow ECN 
to exist end-to-end they must ensure there are no tunnel end-points within the PCN-domain to prevent 
any risk of PCN-markings being exposed to endpoints.

    <t>This document assumes the PCN-domain to be entirely under the control of
    a single operator, or a set of operators who trust each other. However future 
    extensions to PCN might include inter-domain versions where trust cannot be 
    assumed between domains. If such schemes are proposed they must ensure
    that they can operate securely despite the lack of trust. However such considerations
    are beyond the scope of this document.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_Conclusions" title="Conclusions">

    <t>This document defines the baseline PCN encoding utilising a combination of a 
    PCN-enabled DSCP and the ECN field in the IP header. This baseline encoding 
    allows the existence of two PCN encoding states, not-Marked and PCN-marked. 
    It also allows for the co-existence of competing traffic within 
    the same DSCP so long as that traffic does not require ECN support within the PCN-domain.
    The encoding scheme is conformant with <xref target="RFC4774"></xref>. The Working Group
	has chosen not to define a single DSCP for use with PCN. The rationale for this decision
	along with advice relating to choice of suitable DSCPs can be found in <xref target="pcn_enc_app_DSCP_choice"></xref>.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_app_deployment" title="PCN Deployment Considerations (Informational)">
<section anchor="pcn_enc_app_DSCP_choice" title="Choice of Suitable DSCPs">
<t>The PCN Working Group chose not to define a single DSCP for use with PCN for several reasons. 
Firstly the PCN mechanism is applicable to a variety of different traffic classes. Secondly 
standards track DSCPs are in increasingly short supply. Thirdly PCN should be seen as being 
essentially a marking behaviour similar to ECN but intended for inelastic traffic. The choice 
of which DSCP is most suitable for a given PCN-domain is dependent on the nature of the traffic 
entering that domain and the link rates of all the links making up that domain. In PCN-domains 
with uniformly high link rates, the appropriate DSCPs would currently be those for the Real Time 
Traffic Class <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>. To be clear the PCN Working Group recommends 
using admission control for the following service classes:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Telephony (EF)</t>
<t>Real-time interactive (CS4)</t>
<t>Broadcast Video (CS3)</t>
<t>Multimedia Conferencing (AF4)</t>
</list>
 </t>

<t>PCN marking is intended to provide a scalable admission control mechanism for traffic with a high degree of statistical
multiplexing. PCN marking would therefore be appropriate to apply to traffic in the above classes, but only within a 
PCN region containing highly aggregated traffic. In such cases, the above service classes may well all be subject to a single 
forwarding treatment (treatment aggregate <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>). However, this does not imply all such IP traffic would necessarily 
be identified by one DSCP - each service class might keep a distinct DSCP within the highly aggregated region <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>.</t>

<t>Additional service classes may be defined for which admission control is appropriate, whether through some future standards 
action or through local use by certain operators, e.g. the Multimedia Streaming service class (AF3). This document does not 
preclude the use of PCN in more cases than those listed above.</t>

<t> NOTE: The above discussion is informative not normative, as operators are ultimately free to decide whether 
to use admission control for certain service classes and whether to use PCN as their mechanism of choice.</t>

<section anchor="pcn_enc_app_rationale" title="Rationale for Using ECT(0) for Not-marked">
<t> The choice of which ECT codepoint to use for the Not-marked state was based on the following considerations: 
<list style="symbols">
<t><xref target="RFC3168"></xref> full functionality tunnel within the PCN-domain: Either ECT is safe.</t>
<t> Leakage of traffic into PCN-domain: because of the lack of take-up of the ECN nonce <xref target="RFC3540"></xref>,
 leakage of ECT(1) is less likely to occur so might be considered safer.</t>
<t> Leakage of traffic out of PCN-domain: Either ECT is equally unsafe (since this would incorrectly indicate 
the traffic was ECN-capable outside the controlled PCN-domain).</t>
<t> Incremental deployment: Either codepoint is suitable providing that the codepoints are used consistently.</t>
<t> Conceptual consistency with other schemes: ECT(0) is conceptually consistent with <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>.</t>
</list>
Overall this seemed to suggest ECT(0) was most appropriate to use.
