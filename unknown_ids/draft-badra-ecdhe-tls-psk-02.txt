Abstract 

   This document extends RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 and specifies a set of 
   ciphersuites that use an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange 
   authenticated with a pre-shared key. These ciphersuites provide 
   Perfect Forward Secrecy. It also specifies one authentication-only 
   ciphersuites (with no encryption). This ciphersuite is useful when 
   authentication and integrity protection is desired, but 
   confidentiality is not needed or not permitted.

   The reader is expected to become familiar with RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 
   prior to studying this document.  

1. Introduction 

   RFC 4279 specifies ciphersuites for supporting TLS using pre-shared 
   symmetric keys and they (a) use only symmetric key operations for 
   authentication, (b) use a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with 
   a pre-shared key, or (c) combines public key authentication of the 
   server with pre-shared key authentication of the client.  

   RFC 4785 specifies authentication-only ciphersuites (with no 
   encryption).  

   This document specifies a set of ciphersuites that use an Elliptic 
   Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with a pre-shared key. 
   These ciphersuites provide Perfect Forward Secrecy. This document 
   also specifies one authentication-only ciphersuites (with no 
   encryption). This ciphersuite is useful when authentication and 
   integrity protection is desired, but confidentiality is not needed or 
   not permitted. 

1.1. Conventions used in this document  

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. ECDHE_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm 

   The ciphersuites in this section match the ciphersuites defined in 
   [RFC4279], except that they use an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   exchange [RFC4492] authenticated with a pre-shared key. They are 
   defined as follow:  

   CipherSuite                           Key Exchange  Cipher      Hash 

   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_RC4_128_SHA        ECDHE_PSK     RC4_128      SHA 
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA   ECDHE_PSK     3DES_EDE_CBC SHA 
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA    ECDHE_PSK     AES_128_CBC  SHA 
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA    ECDHE_PSK     AES_256_CBC  SHA  

   When the ciphersuites defined in this document are used, the 
   'ec_diffie_hellman_psk' case inside the ServerKeyExchange and 
   ClientKeyExchange structure is used instead of the 'psk' case defined 
   in [RFC4279] (i.e. The ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange 
   messages include the Diffie-Hellman parameters). The PSK identity and

   identity hint fields MUST have the same meaning specified in 
   [RFC4279] (note that the ServerKeyExchange message is always sent, 
   even if no PSK identity hint is provided).  

   The format of the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange messages is 
   shown below.  

         struct {  
             select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {  
                 /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */  
                 case ec_diffie_hellman_psk:  /* NEW */  
                     opaque psk_identity_hint<0..2^16-1>;  
                     ServerECDHParams params;  
             };  
         } ServerKeyExchange;  

         struct {  
             select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {  
                 /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */  
                 case ec_diffie_hellman_psk:   /* NEW */  
                     opaque psk_identity<0..2^16-1>;  
                     ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic public;  
             } exchange_keys;  
         } ClientKeyExchange; 

   The premaster secret is formed as follows. First, perform the 
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman computation in the same way as for 
   other Diffie-Hellman-based ciphersuites defined in RFC4492 to 
   generate the octet string [RFC4492]. Next, concatenate a uint16 
   containing the length of the octet string (in octets), the octet 
   strinf itself, a uint16 containing the length of the PSK (in octets), 
   and the PSK itself. 

   This corresponds to the general structure for the premaster secrets 
   (see Note 1 in Section 2 in RFC 4279) in [RFC4279], with 
   "other_secret" containing Z:  

         struct { 
              opaque other_secret<0..2^16-1>;  
              opaque psk<0..2^16-1>;  
         };  

   Here "other_secret" comes from the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   exchange (ECDHE_PSK).

3. 2. ECDHE_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm with NULL Encryption 

   The ciphersuite in this section matches the ciphersuites defined in 
   [RFC4785], except that it uses an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   exchange authenticated with a pre-shared key. 

   CipherSuite                     Key Exchange   Cipher      Hash  

   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA     ECDHE_PSK      NULL        SHA  

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC4346], [RFC4785] 
   and [RFC4279] apply here as well. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines the following new ciphersuites, whose values 
   are to be assigned from the TLS Cipher Suite registry defined in 
   [RFC4346]. 

   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_RC4_128_SHA        = { 0xXX, 0xXX }; 
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA   = { 0xXX, 0xXX }; 
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA    = { 0xXX, 0xXX }; 
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA    = { 0xXX, 0xXX }; 
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA           = { 0xXX, 0xXX };
