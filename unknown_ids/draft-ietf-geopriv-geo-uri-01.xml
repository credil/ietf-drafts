        <t>This document specifies an Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
	for geographic locations using the 'geo' scheme name. A 'geo' 
	URI identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional
        coordinate reference system in a compact, simple, human-readable, 
	and protocol independent way. The default coordinate reference system
        used is WGS-84.

	<t>An increasing number of Internet protocols and data formats are
	extended by specifications for adding spatial 
	(geographic) location. In most cases, latitude as well as 
	longitude of simple points are added as new attributes to existing data structures. 
	However, all those methods are very specific to a certain data format 
	or protocol, and don't provide a protocol independent, compact  and 
	generic way to refer to a physical geographic location.
	</t>
	<t>Over the past few years, fast emerging location aware applications 
	and location based services were observable on the Internet. 
	Most web search engines use geographic information, and a vivid 
	open source mapping community brought an enormous momentum into 
	location aware 
	technology. A wide range and former to professionals exclusive
	tools and data were provided free of charge for an everyday use
	on the mass market.
	</t>
	<t>The 'geo' URI scheme is another step into that direction and aims
	to facilitate, support and standardize the problem of location 
	identification
	in geospatial services and applications. Accessing information about 
	or trigger further services based on a particular place on earth
	shouldn't be any harder for users than clicking on a 'mailto:' link
	and write an email straight away.
	</t>
	<t>According to <xref target='RFC3986'/>, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
	is "a compact sequence of 
	characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource". The 
	'geo' URI scheme defined in this document identifies geographic
	locations (a physical resource) in a coordinate references system
        (CRS), per default in <xref target='WGS84'>World Geodetic System 1984 
        (WGS-84)</xref>.
	The optional "crs" URI parameter 
	described below may be used by future specifications to 
	define the use of other CRSes. However, such definitions are out of 
        scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
	'Geo' URIs identify a geographic location using a 
	textual representation of the location's spatial coordinates in 
	either two or three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and optionally 
	altitude for the default CRS of WGS-84). Such URIs are independent 
	from a specific protocol, application, or data format, and can be 
	used in any other protocol or data format that supports 
	inclusion of arbitrary URIs.
	</t>
	<t>For the sake of usability, the definition of the URI scheme 
        is strictly focused on the simplest, but also most common
        representation of a spatial location - a single point. The 
	provision of more complex geometries or locations described by
	civic addresses is out of scope of this document.
	</t>
	<t>Note: The choice of WGS-84 as the default CRS
	is based on the widespread availability of Global Positioning System
	(GPS) devices, which use the WGS-84 reference system. It is anticipated
	that such devices serve as one of the primary data sources for authoring
	'geo' URIs, hence the adoption of the native GPS reference system 
	for the URI scheme. Also, many other data formats for representing
        geographic locations use the WGS-84 reference system, which makes
        transposing from and to such data formats less error prone (no 
        re-projection involved).

        <t>Geographic locations in this document are defined using WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984), equivalent to the International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers (OGP) Surveying and Positioning Committee EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) code 4326 (2 dimensions) and 4979 (3 dimensions).

          <t>This specification does not define 
	  a query component. Future 
          revisions might define such components, using the 
	  "?" character to delimit query components from 
          the path component specified above. Clients MUST be prepared to 
	  encounter 
	  such 'geo' URI instances, and MUST reduce the URI to the components

          the URI.

          <t>
          Clients MUST NOT attempt to dereference URIs given in an

          produce entirely bogus results.

          <t>Authors of 'geo' URIs should carefully check that coordinate
          components are set in 
          the specified order, since wrong order of those components is 
          a commonly observed mistake and produces completely bogus 
          locations.

      <section anchor='uriops' title="URI Operations">
          <t>Currently, just one operation on a 'geo' URI is defined - location
  	  dereference: In that operation, a client dereferences the URI by
	  extracting the geographical coordinates from the URI path component
          ('geo-path' in the ABNF).
	  Further use of those coordinates is then up to the application 
	  processing the URI, and might depend on the context of the URI.
	  </t>
	  <t>An application may then use this location information for various
	  purposes, for example:
	  <list style='symbols'>
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
	    <t>A web browser could use that information to open a  
		    web mapping service of the user's choice, and display a map of 
		    the location</t>
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
		    <t>A navigational device such as a Global Positioning System (GPS)
		    receiver could offer the user to start navigation to the location.

		  <t>The following 3-dimensional 'geo' URI example references 
		  to the office location of one of the authors in 
		  Vienna, Austria:
		  </t>
		  <t>geo:48.2010,16.3695,183</t>
		  <t>A user could type the data extracted from this URI into a 
		  electronic navigation device, or even use it to locate the 
		  identified location on a paper map.

		<section anchor='htmlembed' title='Hyperlink'>
		  <t>'geo' URIs (like any other URI scheme) could also be embedded 
		  as hyperlinks in web pages. A Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) 
		  snippet with such a hyperlink could look like:
		  </t>
		  <t>&lt;p&gt;one of Vienna's popular sights is the 
                  &lt;a href='geo:48.198634,16.371648;crs=wgs84'&gt;Karlskirche&lt;/a&gt;.
		  </t>
		  <t>A web brower could extract the coordinates from the HTML snippet, and offer the user various options (based on

		  </t>
		  <list style='symbols'>
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>

            <t>Locate nearby resources, for example by comparing the

            <t>Convert the coordinates to a format suitable for uploading 
            to a navigation device</t>
          </list>
          <t>Note that the URI in this example also makes use of the

        <section anchor='barcode' title="'geo' URI in 2-dimensional barcode">
          <t>Due to it's short length, a 'geo' URI could easily be encoded 
          in 2-dimensional barcodes. Such barcodes could be printed on 
          business cards, flyers, paper maps and subsequently used by mobile
          devices, for example as follows:

              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>The mobile phone dereferences the 'geo' URI, and offers

        <t>Because the 'geo' URI is not tied to any specific protocol, 
	and identifies a physical location rather than a network 
	resource,
        most of the general security considerations on URIs (Section 7 of
	RFC 3986) do not apply. However, the following (additional)
	issues apply:
	</t>
	<section anchor='invalidloc' title='Invalid Locations'>
	  <t>The <xref target='urisyntax'>URI syntax</xref> 
	  makes it possible to construct valid 'geo' URIs which don't 
	  identify a valid location on earth. Applications MUST NOT use 
	  URIs which such invalid values, and SHOULD warn the user when such
	  URIs are encountered.
	  </t>
	  <t>An example of such an invalid URI 
	  would be &lt;geo:94,0&gt; (latitude "beyond" north pole).

        <section anchor='locprivacy' title='Location Privacy'>
	  <t>Location information about individuals is an extremely 
	  sensitive topic, especially when location is combined with 
	  Personally Identifyable Information (PII). Authors of 'geo' 
	  URIs MUST consider data protection and privacy before publishing
          such URIs.
	  </t>
          <t>However, it should be noted that a 'geo' URI by itself is 
          just opaque location information, and privacy considerations
          typically arise only when such opaque location information
          is put in context by combining it with other information (for 
          example, embedding it within a message to reflect the current
          location of a person).
