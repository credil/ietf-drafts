    <abstract>
      <t>One of the obstacles to implementing AMT Multicast in a multi-network
      environment is the difficulty an AMT Gateway may have in finding an AMT
      Relay that is optimal. Optimal in this context means that the AMT Relay
      has multicast connectivity to the Source, and its location minimizes the
      unicast (tunneled) portion of the path to the Gateway. Blind use of the
      global anycast address specified for AMT Relays in &ldquo;Automatic IP
      Multicast Without Explicit Tunnels (AMT)&rdquo; could result in reaching
      an AMT Relay that does not have multicast connectivity to the source,
      which would yield a failure to obtain the multicast content; or it could
      result in reaching an AMT Relay that is otherwise less than optimal.
      This document proposes a method for implementing standard DNS procedures
      so that an AMT Gateway using normal DNS queries can virtually always
      find the optimal AMT Relay for a given Source.</t>
    </abstract>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Overview and Rationale">
      <t>Implicit in the definition of a global anycast address for AMT Relays
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast"></xref> is the assumption
      that an AMT Gateway will succeed in obtaining multicast content simply
      by finding the closest (in routing distance) AMT Relay. Consideration of
      a moderately complex multi-network architecture reveals that this is not
      necessarily a valid assumption.</t>

      <t>An environment in which all networks are multicast-enabled and have
      multicast-capable interconnections would be well-suited to globally
      anycast-addressed AMT Relays. In that environment, the nearest AMT Relay
      to any given AMT Gateway will be optimal and successful in delivering
      multicast content. However, in general, connections among networks will
      not ubiquitously be multicast-capable, and that is likely to be the case
      for some time. In that case, reaching the nearest AMT Relay is not
      guaranteed to be successful. Accordingly, this document addresses the
      problem of finding an optimal AMT Relay in an SSM multicast,
      multi-network environment, where connectivity between networks may or
      may not be multicast-enabled.</t>

      <t>In order to successfully provide multicast content to an AMT Gateway,
      the AMT Relay reached must have multicast connectivity to the source. In
      order for it to be optimal, it must maximize the portion of the path
      that is multicast, and minimize the portion that requires a unicast
      tunnel. Further, the network reached should retain some flexibility so
      that its own policies may be invoked in the allocation of usage of its
      resources. It may, for example, seek to consider network load when
      directing the AMT Gateway to a specific AMT Relay. In addition, the
      discovery procedure should minimize the risk of exposure to the
      possibility of a malicious party that could advertise an anycast AMT
      address and attract AMT Gateway messages. This could have the potential
      of disabling multicast for those end-users whose Gateways reach that
      malicious destination.</t>

      <t>The solution presented in this document has the following
      characteristics:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>It requires very little or no change to existing
          technologies.</t>

          <t>It naturally results in finding the optimal AMT Relay in most
          cases.</t>

          <t>It allows AMT Gateways to use existing protocols and
          procedures.</t>

          <t>It simplifies and minimizes administration and management of
          resources.</t>

          <t>It allows flexibility in network allocation of resources.</t>

          <t>It avoids exposure to malicious actors.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The implementation proposed can achieve the above characteristics for
      the following reasons:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>AMT Gateways require only a single, simple DNS query to find the
          optimal AMT Relay.</t>

          <t>This implementation requires no changes to existing DNS
          procedures, and only requires DNS servers in relevant authoritative
          domains to be administered to incorporate awareness of source
          networks to which they have multicast connectivity, and to respond
          appropriately to DNS queries for optimal AMT Relays.</t>

          <t>It builds efficiency into the procedure itself, and thus does not
          require a centralized intelligence to direct the AMT Relay discovery
          process.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Assumptions">
      <t>This document will not address the manner in which the application
      discovers the Multicast Source, and generally assumes there is one
      source per content provider. However, a method similar to that proposed
      here for finding the optimal AMT Relay may in fact be used to find the
      optimal source in a multi-source environment.</t>

      <t>This document is meant to address issues solely related to SSM<xref
      target="SSM"></xref>. It does not propose to make any changes to the way
      SSM works as a transport, or the way DNS works to resolve names to IP
      addresses, and therefore will not go into any detail on the inner
      working of SSM or DNS.</t>

      <t></t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Proposed Procedure for Finding an AMT Relay">
      <t>Once a multicast-enabled application obtains an address for desired
      content, e.g., (S1,G1), it generates an IGMP message to join that
      stream. An AMT Gateway client (stand-alone or one incorporated into the
      application) will determine whether native multicast is available, and
      if not will invoke AMT Gateway functions to attempt to find an AMT
      Relay.</t>

      <section title="The AMT Gateway Forms a DNS Query to Find the AMT Relay">
        <t>At this point, the AMT Gateway generate a DNS query of the form
        "S1.amt.net" or "S1-amt.net" or "S1.net" (alternatives to be examined
        below) instead of seeking the AMT Relay by means of the global AMT
        Relay anycast address. This domain, "S1*.net", is defined so that
        authoritative DNS servers are resident on networks that have multicast
        connectivity to the network that hosts the source "S1". As an example
        of such a query, for a source IP address 12.123.221.123, the value of
        "S1" in the DNS query could be of the form "12123221123*.net.
        Alternatively, it could be of a more restrictive form that could
        eliminate some domain possibilities. Only two things are required for
        this solution to function correctly:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Each network that has one or more AMT Relays with multicast
            connectivity to a given source, and that wishes to serve content
            from that source, must have a DNS server that is authoritative for
            that source domain, and</t>

            <t>That all be reachable by the same anycast address.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The query for "S1*.net" will initially be directed to the local DNS
        server defined for the end-user, which will in most cases be local to
        the end-user's access network.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="&quot;.net&quot; DNS Redirects the Query to the &quot;S1*.net&quot; Authoritative DNS ">
        <t>In general, the local DNS will not be authoritative either for the
        ".net" domain or the "S1*.net" domain. However, the local DNS server
        will be aware of and will query the ".net" authoritative DNS for the
        anycast address of the "S1*.net" authoritative DNS.</t>

        <section title="Option 1: DNS Query of the Form &quot;S1.amt.net&quot;">
          <t>This option assumes that there is an organization responsible for
          an "amt.net" domain. Then that organization would maintain DNS
          servers that are aware of those DNS servers authoritative for
          "Sx.amt.net", where "x" specifies any multicast source reachable by
          an AMT Relay.</t>

          <t>The ".net" DNS server redirects the local DNS query to the
          "amt.net" DNS server. In turn, the "amt.net" DNS servers redirects
          the DNS query to the appropriate DNS servers authoritative for the
          source being sought in the query. That will be a set of DNS servers
          reachable by an anycast address.</t>

          <t>When the local DNS server queries that "S1.amt.net" DNS server,
          the query will naturally (via anycast) be routed to the nearest (in
          routing metric) DNS authoritative for source "S1".</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Option 2: DNS Query of the Form &quot;S1-amt.net&quot;">
          <t>This option assumes no "amt.net" domain. Then ".net"
          authoritative DNS servers must be aware of those DNS servers
          authoritative for "Sx-amt.net", where "x" again specifies any
          multicast source reachable by an AMT Relay. The "-amt" qualifier
          simply aids the lookup by the ".net" DNS of the DNS servers
          authoritative for the "S1" domain. Thus, the ".net" DNS server
          redirects the DNS query to the appropriate DNS servers authoritative
          for the source being sought in the query. That will be a set of DNS
          servers reachable by an anycast address.</t>

          <t>When the local DNS server queries that "S1-amt.net" DNS server,
          the query will naturally (via anycast) be routed to the nearest (in
          routing metric) DNS authoritative for source "S1".</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Option 3: DNS Query of the form &quot;S1.net&quot;">
          <t>This option assumes no "-amt" to aid the lookup by the ".net" DNS
          of the DNS servers authoritative for "Sx". The ".net" DNS server
          simply looks up the DNS servers authoritative for "S1" and redirects
          the DNS query to those DNS servers. That will be a set of DNS
          servers reachable by an anycast address.</t>

          <t>When the local DNS server queries that "S1.net" DNS server, the
          query will naturally (via anycast) be routed to the nearest (in
          routing metric) DNS authoritative for source "S1".</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="&quot;S1*.net&quot; DNS Returns the IP Address of Its Own Network's AMT Relay">
        <t>By virtue of the conditions set out in 3.1, above, the DNS
        authoritative for "S1*.net" will be resident on a network that has
        multicast connectivity to the source "S1". This may be because the
        source is on that same network, or it may be because that network has
        multicast interconnection to the network on which the source is
        located.</t>

        <t>Because the DNS authoritative for "S1*.net" was reached by anycast,
        that network is assured to be nearest (in routing metric) to the DNS
        local to the AMT Gateway.</t>

        <t>As a result of the above, the DNS reached by this last query may
        safely respond with the address of an AMT Relay on its own network.
        That DNS may provide a response according to its own network's
        policies and capabilities. For example, the response may be an anycast
        address that would route to the closest among several possible AMT
        Relays. Alternatively, it may respond with a CNAME, which can be
        resolved by an intelligent DNS server that takes into account network
        load in deciding to which AMT Relay to direct the AMT Gateway. Or it
        may respond with the unicast address of a specific AMT Relay.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Result of the Procedure ">
        <t>The procedure detailed above results in reaching an AMT Relay that
        has multicast connectivity to the desired source. In addition, the AMT
        Relay will be in the multicast-capable network closest to the
        end-user's local DNS server, which is in most cases local to the
        end-user. This minimizes the inter-network unicast path between the
        AMT Relay and the AMT Gateway. The reached network can, however,
        implement its own policies with regard to selecting a particular AMT
        Relay for that query, thus allowing flexibility in network
        administration. The end-user's AMT Gateway will thus have reached the
        optimal AMT Relay within the constraints of also taking into account
        the policies of the reached network provider.</t>

        <t>Administration of the DNS hierarchy is minimally affected. However,
        only those network providers that wish to carry multicast traffic for
        a given source need to undertake the minor additional steps required
        to make their AMT Relays authoritative for that source, and hence
        available to AMT Gateways seeking content from that source. Further,
        if the ".amt.net" option of Section 3.2.1 is adopted, the authority
        for the "amt.net" domain is required to administer those DNS servers
        in accordance with this hierarchy.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Possible Inefficiencies">
        <t>In the case that an end-user's application or browser is assigned a
        DNS server that is not local, the anycast routing will yield a false
        "nearest" network DNS. The content will still be served via multicast,
        but the AMT Relay found will not be optimal.</t>
