INTERNET DRAFT          The 'tn3270' URI scheme         January 26, 2011


1.  Introduction

   The 'tn3270' URI scheme was first mentioned in RFC 1738 [RFC1738] as
   used for 'Interactive 3270 emulation sessions'.  Following the
   creation of the URI scheme registries per RFC 4395 [RFC4395], it was
   added to the "Provisional URI Schemes" registry [PROVURI].  RFC 1738
   [RFC1738] does not give any definition of syntax and semantics of
   this URI scheme.

   Since there are no any acceptable specification of 'tn3270' URI
   scheme, there is a risk that somebody might try to implement it with
   some new, possibly undocumented syntax, just by looking at IANA
   registry.  In order to minimize such risk, this documents gives
   precise definition of syntax, semantics and use of this URI scheme.

   The generic syntax of URIs is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. 
   Registering procedures for new URI schemes are defined in RFC 4395
   [RFC4395].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT          The 'tn3270' URI scheme         January 26, 2011


2.  Scheme Definition 

   The 'tn3270' URI scheme is used to access services that are provided
   via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) (see RFC 1041 [RFC1041], RFC 1576
   [RFC1576], RFC 1646 [RFC1646] and IBM Publication GA23-0059 [GA23-
   0059] for details) and Telnet 3270 Enchanted Mode (TN3270E) (see RFC
   2355 [RFC2355], RFC 2561 [RFC2561], RFC 2562 [RFC2562] and RFC 3049
   [RFC3049] for details).  In fact these are Telnet services with
   special data transfer mode, so the syntax of 'tn3270' URI is similar
   to that of 'telnet' one [RFC4248].

   Note: This document does not specify the TN3270 and TN3270E 
         services themselves, but only the URI scheme for them.

   The 'tn3270' URI takes the following form (given in ABNF, as
   described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]):

   tn3270uri = "tn3270:" hier-part 
   hier-part = "//" authority ["/"]
               ;the URI takes the form 
               ;tn3270://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/
               ;that is formally defined via the 'authority'

   The 'authority' rule is specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  If 'port'
   (in the 'authority' part) is omitted, it SHALL default to 21.  The
   final character "/" MAY be omitted.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of [RFC3986].

   Since the 'tn3270' URI scheme is used to provide the modified from of
   Telnet service (see Section 2), there are no other security
   considerations for 'tn3270' URI scheme not mentioned in Section 3 of
   RFC 4248 [RFC4248], that defines 'telnet' URI scheme. 


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of tn3270 URI scheme using
   the following registration template (see [RFC4395]):

   URI scheme name: tn3270

   Status: Provisional

   URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

   URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

   URI scheme encoding considerations: generic encoding considerations
   for URI schemes, defined in Section 2 of [RFC3986], concern 'tn3270'
   one as well.  Non-ASCII characters are to be treated as defined in
   RFC 3987 [RFC3987]

   Protocols that use the scheme: Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) (see RFC
   1041 [RFC1041], RFC 1576 [RFC1576], RFC 1646 [RFC1646] and IBM
   Publication GA23-0059 [GA23-0059] for details) and Telnet 3270
   Enchanted Mode (TN3270E) (see RFC 2355 [RFC2355], RFC 2561 [RFC2561],
   RFC 2562 [RFC2562] and RFC 3049 [RFC3049] for details)

   Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC xxxx
