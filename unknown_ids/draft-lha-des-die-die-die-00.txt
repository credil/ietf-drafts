Internet-Draft  Move DES to Historic Status for Kerberos       July 2009


Abstract

   A long long time ago DES was standardized.  Some 30 years later
   (2003) is was withdrawn as a standard by NIST, today 6 years later,
   its time for DES to finally die.  By 2008 it was possible to brute
   force DES keys in 6.4 days using less than USD 10k worth of hardware.
   So by 2008 DES had passsed its sell-by date.  Use in Kerberos should
   therefore stop.

2.  Background

   Kerberos 5 was defined in [RFC1510] and updated in [RFC4120], the
   Kerberos crypto system is defined by [RFC3961] and includes support
   for DES encryption types.  This document move all of the DES
   encryption types to historic.

   DES was withdrawn in [DES-Transition-Plan] by NIST.

3.  Recommendations

   Kerberos implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT use the single DES
   encryption: DES-CBC-MD5, DES-CBC-MD4, DES-CBC-CRC.

4.  Security Considerations

   Removing support for single DES improves security since DES is
   considered to be insecure by most parties.
