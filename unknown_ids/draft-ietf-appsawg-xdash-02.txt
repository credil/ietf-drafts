      Deprecating Use of the "X-" Prefix in Application Protocols
                      draft-ietf-appsawg-xdash-02

Abstract

   Historically, designers and implementers of application protocols
   have often distinguished between "standard" and "non-standard"
   parameters by prefixing the latter with the string "X-" or similar
   constructions.  In practice, this convention causes more problems
   than it solves.  Therefore, this document deprecates the "X-"
   convention for most application protocol parameters.

Internet-Draft                The X- Prefix                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Many application protocols use named parameters to identify data
   (media types, header fields in Internet mail messages and HTTP
   requests, vCard parameters and properties, etc.).  Historically,
   designers and implementers of application protocols have often
   distinguished between "standard" and "non-standard" parameters by
   prefixing the latter with the string "X-" or similar constructions
   (e.g., "x."), where the "X" is commonly understood to stand for
   "eXperimental" or "eXtension".

   Although in theory the "X-" convention was a good way to avoid
   collisions (and attendant interoperability problems) between standard
   parameters and non-standard parameters, in practice the benefits have
   been outweighed by the costs associated with the leakage of non-
   standard parameters into the standards space.  Therefore this
   document deprecates the "X-" convention for most application
   protocols and makes specific recommendations about how to proceed in
   a world without the distinction between standard and non-standard
   parameters.

   See Appendix A for background information about the history of the
   "X-" convention, and Appendix B for the reasoning that led to the
   recommendations in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Recommendations for Implementers of Application Protocols

   Implementers of application protocols MUST NOT treat the general
   categories of "standard" and "non-standard" parameters in
   programatically different ways within their applications.


3.  Recommendations for Creators of New Parameters

   Creators of new parameters to be used in the context of application
   protocols:

   1.  SHOULD assume that all parameters they create might become
       standardized, public, commonly deployed, or used across multiple
       implementations.

Internet-Draft                The X- Prefix                 October 2011


   2.  SHOULD employ meaningful but currently unused names (without the
       "X-" prefix).

   Note: If the relevant parameter name space has conventions about
   associating parameter names with those who create them, a parameter
   name could incorporate the organization's name or primary domain name
   (see Appendix B for examples).


4.  Recommendations for Protocol Designers

   Designers of new application protocols that allow extensions using
   parameters:

   1.  SHOULD establish registries with potentially unlimited value-
       spaces, if appropriate including both permanent and provisional
       registries.

   2.  SHOULD define simple, clear registration procedures.

   3.  SHOULD mandate registration of all non-private parameters,
       independent of the form of the parameter names.

   4.  SHOULD identify a convention to allow local or implementation-
       specific extensions, and reserve delimeters for such uses as
       needed.

   5.  SHOULD NOT prohibit parameters with the "X-" prefix from being
       registered with the IANA.

   6.  MUST NOT assume that a parameter with an "X-" prefix is non-
       standard.

   7.  MUST NOT assume that a parameter without an "X-" prefix is
       standard.


5.  Security Considerations

   Interoperability and migration issues with security-critical
   parameters can result in unnecessary vulnerabilities (see Appendix B
   for further discussion).


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not modify registration procedures currently in
   force for various application protocols.  However, such procedures

Appendix A.  Background

   The beginnings of the "X-" convention can be found in a suggestion
   made by Brian Harvey in 1975 with regard to FTP parameters [RFC691]:

      Thus, FTP servers which care about the distinction between Telnet
      print and non-print could implement SRVR N and SRVR T. Ideally the
      SRVR parameters should be registered with Jon Postel to avoid

Internet-Draft                The X- Prefix                 October 2011


      conflicts, although it is not a disaster if two sites use the same
      parameter for different things.  I suggest that parameters be
      allowed to be more than one letter, and that an initial letter X
      be used for really local idiosyncracies.

   This "X" prefix was subsequently used in [RFC737], [RFC743], and
   [RFC775].  This usage was noted in [RFC1123]:

      FTP allows "experimental" commands, whose names begin with "X".
      If these commands are subsequently adopted as standards, there may
      still be existing implementations using the "X" form....  All FTP
      implementations SHOULD recognize both forms of these commands, by
      simply equating them with extra entries in the command lookup
      table.

   The "X-" convention has been used for email header fields since at
   least the publication of [RFC822] in 1982, which distinguished
   between "Extension-fields" and "user-defined-fields" as follows:

      The prefatory string "X-" will never be used in the names of
      Extension-fields.  This provides user-defined fields with a
      protected set of names.

   That rule was restated by [RFC1154] as follows:

      Keywords beginning with "X-" are permanently reserved to
      implementation-specific use.  No standard registered encoding
      keyword will ever begin with "X-".

   This convention continued with various specifications for media types
   ([RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2047]), HTTP headers ([RFC2068],
   [RFC2616]), vCard parameters and properties ([RFC2426]), Uniform
   Resource Names ([RFC3406]), LDAP field names ([RFC4512]), and other
   application technologies.

   However, use of the "X-" prefix in email headers was effectively
   deprecated between the publication of [RFC822] in 1982 and the
   publication of [RFC2822] in 2001 by removing the distinction between
   the "extension-field" construct and the "user-defined-field"
   construct (a similar change happened with regard to Session
   Initiation Protocol "P-" headers when [RFC3427] was obsoleted by
   [RFC5727]).

   Despite the fact that parameters containing the "X-" string have been
   effectively deprecated in email headers, they continue to be used in
   a wide variety of application protocols.  The two primary situations
   motivating such use are:

   1.  Experiments that are intended to possibly be standardized in the
       future, if they are successful.

   2.  Extensions that are intended to never be standardized because
       they are intended only for implementation-specific use or for
       local use on private networks.

   Use of this naming convention is not mandated by the Internet
   Standards Process [BCP9] or IANA registration rules [BCP26].  Rather
   it is an individual choice by each specification that references the
   convention or each administrative process that chooses to use it.  In
   particular, some standards-track RFCs have interpreted the convention
   in a normative way (e.g., [RFC822] and [RFC5451]).


Appendix B.  Analysis

   The primary problem with the "X-" convention is that non-standard
   parameters have a tendency to leak into the protected space of
   standard parameters (whether de jure or de facto), thus introducing
   the need for migration from the "X-" name to the standard name.
   Migration, in turn, introduces interoperability issues (and sometimes
   security issues) because older implementations will support only the
   "X-" name and newer implementations might support only the standard
   name.  To preserve interoperability, newer implementations simply
   support the "X-" name forever, which means that the non-standard name
   has become a de facto standard (thus obviating the need for
   segregation of the name space into "standard" and "non-standard"
   areas in the first place).

   We have already seen this phenomenon at work with regard to FTP in
   the quote from [RFC1123] in the previous section.  The HTTP community
   had the same experience with the "x-gzip" and "x-compressed" media
   types, as noted in [RFC2068]:

      For compatibility with previous implementations of HTTP,
      applications should consider "x-gzip" and "x-compress" to be
      equivalent to "gzip" and "compress" respectively.

   A similar example can be found in [RFC5064], which defined the
   "Archived-At" message header field but also found it necessary to
   define and register the "X-Archived-At" field:

      For backwards compatibility, this document also describes the
      X-Archived-At header field, a precursor of the Archived-At header
      field.  The X-Archived-At header field MAY also be parsed, but
      SHOULD NOT be generated.

   One of the original reasons for segregation of name spaces into
   standard and non-standard areas was the perceived difficulty of
   registering names.  However, the solution to that problem has been
   simpler registration rules, such as those provided by [RFC3864] and
   [RFC4288].  As explained in [RFC4288]:

      [W]ith the simplified registration procedures described above for
      vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be necessary
      to use unregistered experimental types.  Therefore, use of both
      "x-" and "x." forms is discouraged.

   For some name spaces, another helpful practice has been the
   establishment of separate registries for permanent names and
   provisional names, as in [RFC4395].

   Furthermore, often standardization of a non-standard parameter or
   protocol element leads to subtly different behavior (e.g., the
   standard version might have different security properties as a result
   of security review provided during the standardization process).  If
   implementers treat the old, non-standard parameter and the new,
   standard parameter as equivalent, interoperability and security
   problems can ensue.

   For similar considerations with regard to the "P-" convention in the
   Session Initiation Protocol, see [RFC5727].

   In some situations, segregating the parameter name space used in a
   given application protocol can be justified:

   1.  When it is extremely unlikely that some parameters will ever be
       standardized.  However, in this case implementation-specific and
       private-use parameters could at least incorporate the
       organization's name (e.g., "ExampleInc-foo" or, consistent with
       [RFC4288], "VND.ExampleInc.foo") or primary domain name (e.g.,
       "com.example.foo" or a Uniform Resource Identifier [RFC3986] such
       as "http://example.com/foo").  In rare cases, truly experimental
       parameters could be given meaningless names such as nonsense
       words, the output of a hash function, or UUIDs [RFC4122].

   2.  When parameter names might have significant meaning.  However,
       this case too is rare, since implementers can almost always find
       a synonym for an existing term (e.g., "urgency" instead of
       "priority") or simply invent a more creative name (e.g., "get-it-
       there-fast").

   3.  When parameter names need to be very short (e.g., as in [RFC5646]
       for language tags).  However, in this case it can be more
       efficient to assign numbers instead of human-readable names

       numeric range for implementation-specific extensions or private
       use (e.g., as with the codec numbers used with the Session
       Description Protocol [RFC4566]).

   There are three primary objections to deprecating the "X-" convention
   as a best practice for application protocols:

   1.  Implementers are easily confused and can't be expected to know
       that a parameter is non-standard unless it contains the "X-"
       prefix.  However, implementers already are quite flexible about
       using both prefixed and non-prefixed names based on what works in
       the field, so the distinction between de facto names (e.g.,
       "X-foo") and de jure names (e.g., "foo") is without force.

   2.  Collisions are undesirable and it would be bad for both a
       standard parameter "foo" and a non-standard parameter "foo" to
       exist simultaneously.  However, names are almost always cheap, so
       an experimental, implementation-specific, or private-use name of
       "foo" does not prevent a standards development organization from
       issuing a similarly creative name such as "bar".

   3.  [BCP82] is entitled "Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers
       Considered Useful" and therefore implies that the "X-" prefix is
       also useful for experimental parameters.  However, BCP 82
       addresses the need for protocol numbers when the pool of such
       numbers is strictly limited (e.g., DHCP options) or when a number
       is absolutely required even for purely experimental purposes
       (e.g., the Protocol field of the IP header).  In almost all
       application protocols that make use of protocol parameters
       (including email headers, media types, HTTP headers, vCard
       parameters and properties, URNs, and LDAP field names), the name
       space is not limited or constrained in any way, so there is no
       need to assign a block of names for private use or experimental
       purposes (see also [BCP26]).

   Therefore it appears that segregating the parameter space into a
   standard area and a non-standard area has few if any benefits, and
   has at least one significant cost in terms of interoperability.
