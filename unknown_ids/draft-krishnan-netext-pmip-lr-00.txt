                  Local Routing for Proxy Mobile IPv6
                    draft-krishnan-netext-pmip-lr-00

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management
   protocol that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its
   participation in any mobility-related signaling.  PMIPv6 requires all
   communications to go through the local mobility anchor.  As this can
   be suboptimal, local routing allows mobile nodes attached to the same
   or different mobile access gateways to exchange traffic by using
   localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways.  This
   document proposes an initiation mechanism for local routing.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] describes the protocol operations to
   maintain reachability and session persistence for a Mobile Node (MN)
   without the explicit participation from the MN in signaling
   operations at the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.  In order to
   facilitate such network-based mobility, the PMIPv6 protocol defines a
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy for the Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC3775] signaling, and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which
   acts similar to a Home Agent.  The LMA and the MAG estalish a
   bidirectional tunnel for forwarding all data traffic belonging to the
   Mobile Nodes.  In the case where both endpoints are located in the
   same PMIPv6 domain, this can be suboptimal and results in higher
   delay and congestion in the network.  Moreover, it increases
   transport costs and traffic load at the LMA.

   To overcome these issues, local routing can be used to allow nodes
   attached to the same or different MAGs to directly exchange traffic
   by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the
   gateways.  [LR-PS] defines the problem statement for PMIPv6 local
   routing.  This document describes a solution for PMIPv6 localized
   routing.  The protocol specified here assumes that both the LMA and
   the MAG have established bindings for the communicating Mobile Nodes
   using the PBU and PBA messages specified in [RFC5213].

2.  Scenario A11: Two MNs attached to the same MAG and LMA

   In this scenario, the two Mobile Nodes involved in communication are
   attached to a single MAG and both are anchored at the same LMA.

                        | MAG |
                        +-----+

                      +---+ +---+

   The LMA initiates a local routing session by detecting a flow between
   two MNs attached to the same MAG.  The exact flow identification
   mechanism is not specified in this document, and is left open for
   implementations and specific deployments.  An example trigger could
   be that an application-layer signaling entity (such as a SIP Proxy)
   notifies the LMA about two VoIP flow end-points, and the latter
   determines that the two end-points are attached to the same MAG.
   Such a trigger mechanism offers local routing at the granularity of
   an individual application session, providing flexibility in usage.
   This and other possible examples serve to illustrate the trigger
   mechanism for initiating local routing.

   After detecting a possibility for local routing, the LMA constructs a
   Local Routing Initiation (LRI) message that is used to signal the
   intent to initiate local routing and to convey parameters for the
   same.  This is a Mobility Header message and it contains the MN-
   Identifier and the Home Network Prefix (as Mobility Header options)
   for each of the MNs involved.  The LMA sends the LRI message to the
   MAG where the two MNs are attached.

   The MAG starts by verifying that the two MNs are indeed attached to
   it.  It then creates Local Routing Entries(LREs) for each direction
   of the communication between the two MNs.  The exact form of the
   forwarding entries is left for the implementations to decide;
   however, they should contain the HNP corresponding to the destination
   IP address and a next-hop identifier (e.g. the layer 2 address of the
   next- hop).  These LREs MUST override the BUL entries for the
   specific HNPs identified in the LRI message.  Hence all traffic
   matching the HNPs is forwarded locally.

   If a MAG is unable to make deliver packets using the LREs, it is
   possible that the MN is no longer attached to the MAG.  Hence, the
   MAG SHOULD fall back to using the BUL entry, and the LMA MUST forward
   the received packets using its BCE.  The MAG MAY use other

   mechanisms, such as Proxy MIP6 Fast Handovers [PFMIP6] to forward
   packets when a handover has taken place.

   The local forwarding is not permanent.  For instance, the LMA may
   send a LRI message with a request to cancel an existing local
   forwarding service.  The local forwarding also has a default
   lifetime, upon the expiry of which, the forwarding reverts to
   bidirectional tunneling.  When local forwarding service ceases, the
   corresponding LFE entries MUST be removed.

   The MAG completes the processing of the LRI message and responds with
   a Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA) message.  This Mobility Header
   message also includes the MN-ID and the HNP for each of the
   communicating MNs as well as an appropriate Status code indicating
   the outcome of LRI processing.  Status code 0 indicates local routing
   was successfully offered by the MAG.  Any other value for Status code
   indicates the reason for the failure to offer local routing service.
   When Status code is 0, the LMA sets a flag in the BCE corresponding
   to the HNPs to record that local routing is in progress for that HNP.

   The MAG may refresh the lifetime of an existing local forwarding
   service.  For this, it sends an unsolicited LRA (U-LRA) message that
   contains the new lifetime value.  The MAG MUST wait for the following
   LRI message from the LMA before it can conclude that the refresh
   request is granted.

3.  Scenario A21: Two MNs attached to different MAGs but same LMA

   The LMA may choose to support local forwarding to mobile nodes
   attached to two different MAGs within a single PMIPv6 domain.

                        Internet
                           :
                           |
                           |

                           |
                           |
                      +----+-----+
                      |          |
                   +----+     +----+
                   |MAG1|     |MAG2|
                   +----+     +----+
                     :           :
                   +---+       +---+
                   |MN1|       |MN2|
                   +---+       +---+

   As earlier, the LMA initiates LRI as a response to some trigger
   mechanism.  In this case, however, it sends two separate LRI messages
   to the two MAGs.  In addition to the MN-ID and the HNP options, each
   LRI message contains the IP Address of the counterpart MAG.  When the
   MAG IP Address option is present, each MAG MUST create a local
   forwarding entry such that the packets for the MN attached to the
   remote MAG are sent over a tunnel associated with that remote MAG.
   The tunnel between the MAGs is assumed to be established by means
   outside the scope of this document.

   As before, each MAG responds to the LRI with an LRA message.  Barring
   the error cases, all subsequent packets are routed between the MAGs
   locally, without traversing the LMA.

   The protocol does not require any synchronization between the MAGs
   before local forwarding begins.  Each MAG begins its local forwarding
   independent of the other.

4.  Scenario A12: Two MNs attached to the same MAG with different LMAs

   In this scenario, both the MNs are attached to the same MAG, but are
   anchored at two different LMAs.


                        Internet
                  :                  :
                  +------------------+
                  |                  |
               +----+              +----+
               |LMA1|              |LMA2|
               +----+              +----+
                  |                  |
                  |                  |
                  +------------------+
                           |
                           |
                           |
                        +-----+
                        | MAG |
                        +-----+
                         :   :
                      +---+ +---+
                      |MN1| |MN2|
                      +---+ +---+

   Hence, neither LMA has a means to determine that the two Mobile Nodes
   are attached to the same MAG.  Only the MAG can possibly determine
   that the two Mobile Nodes involved in communication are attached to
   it.  Hence the local routing has to be initiated by the MAG.

   The MAG sends an LRI message containing the MN-ID, HNP and the
   counterpart LMA address to each LMA.  Each LMA makes decision to
   support local forwarding independently, based on, among others,
   policy configuration for the counterpart LMA.  Each LMA MUST respond
   to the LRI message with an LRA message.  Only after it receives both
   the LRA messages each with Status value set to zero (success) from
   the two different LMAs, the MAG MUST conclude that it can provide
   local forwarding support for the two Mobile Nodes.

5.  Message Formats

5.1.  Local Routing Initiation (LRI)

   The LMA sends an LRI message to a MAG to request local forwarding for
   a pair of MNs.  The MAG may also send this message to request the two
   LMAs for offering local forwarding Section 3.3.

      Sequence Number: A monotonically increasing integer.  Set by a
      sending node in a request message, and used to match a reply to
      the request.

      'R' flag: Set to 0, indicates it is an LRI message.

      'S' flag: When set to 1, indicates a request to stop local
      routing.

      Reserved: This field is unused.  MUST be set zero.

      Lifetime: The requested time in seconds for which the sender
      wishes to have local forwarding.

      Mobility Options: MUST contain the MN-ID, followed by one or more
      HNPs for each of the MNs.  For instance, for Mobile Nodes MN-1 and
      MN-2 with identifiers MN-ID1, MN-ID2 and Home Network Prefixes
      HNP-MN-1 and HNP-MN-2, the following tuple in the following order
      MUST be present: [MN-ID1, HNP-MN-1], [MN-ID2, HNP-MN-2].  The
      MN-ID and HNP options are the same as in [RFC5213].  MAY contain
      the remote MAG IPv6 address option, which is identical to the HNP
      option except for Prefix Length equal to 128 bits.  MAY contain
      the conterpart LMA IPv6 option, which is identical to the HNP
      option except for Prefix Length equal to 128 bits.

   The LRI message SHOULD be re-transmitted if a corresponding LRA
   message is not received within LRA_WAIT_TIME time units, up to a
   maximum of LRI_RETRIES, each separated by LRA_WAIT_TIME time units.

5.2.  Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA)

   A MAG sends an LRA message to the LMA as a response to the LRI
   message.  An LMA may also send this message to a MAG as a response to
   the LRI message Section 3.3.

      Sequence Number: A monotonically increasing integer.  Set by a
      sending node in a request message, and used to match a reply to
      the request.

      'R' flag: Set to 1, indicates it is an LRA message.

      'U' flag: When set to 1, the LRA message is sent unsolicited.
      The Lifetime field indicates a new requested value.  The MAG MUST
      wait for the regular LRI message to confirm that the request is
      acceptable to the LMA.

      Reserved: This field is unused.  MUST be set zero.

      Status:


         0: Success

         1: Failure

      Lifetime: The time in seconds for which the local forwarding is
      supported.  Typically copied from the corresponding field in the
      LRI message.

      Mobility Options: When Status code is 0, MUST contain the [MN-ID,
      HNP] tuples in the same order as in the LRI message.  When Status
      code is 1, MUST contain only those [MN-ID, HNP] tuples for which
      local forwarding is supported.  The MN-ID and HNP options are the
      same as in [pmipv6].

6.  Security Considerations

   The protocol specified in this document uses the same security
   association between the LMA and the MAG to protect the LRI and LRA
   messages.  No new security risks are identified.  Support for
   integrity protection using IPsec is required, but support for
   confidentiality is not necessary.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The Local Routing Initiation, described in Section 5.1 and the Local
   Routing Acknowledgment, described in Section 5.2 require a single
   Mobility Header Type from the registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters
