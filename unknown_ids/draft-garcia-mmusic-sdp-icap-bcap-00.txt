   Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation in the Session Description
                             Protocol (SDP)
                  draft-garcia-mmusic-sdp-icap-bcap-00

Abstract

   SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism
   framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols
   and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a Media
   capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate
   additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded
   into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.

   This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow
   endpoints to negotiate two miscellaneous SDP capabilities.  In
   particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate media titles
   ("i=" line for each media) and media bandwidth ("b=" line).

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is intended for
   describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session
   announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia
   session initiation.  SDP has been extended with a capability
   negotiation mechanism framework [RFC5939] that allows the endpoints
   to negotiate capabilities, such as support for Realtime Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] and Secure Realtime Transport Protocol
   (SRTP) [RFC3711].  The SDP media capabilities [RFC5939] provides
   negotiation capabilities to media lines as well.

   This negotiation is embedded into the widely used SDP offer/answer
   procedures [RFC3264].  This memo provides the means to negotiate
   further capabilities than those specified in the SDP capability
   negotiation mechanism framework [RFC5939] and the SDP media
   capabilities [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities].  In
   particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate media titles
   ("i=") and media bandwidth ("b=").  It would have been possible to
   define a mechanism to negotiate media encryption keys ("k=").
   However, the usage of the media encryption keys ("k=") is highly
   discouraged in favour of other existing more sophisticated
   mechanisms.  Therefore, we are not providing a mechanism to provide
   capabilities for media encryption keys ("k=") at this stage.

   Since the two added capabilities are highly unconnected, it is not
   expected that implementations will support both at the same time.
   Instead, it is expected that applications will choose their needed
   capability for their specific purpose.  Due to this, we are writing
   the normative part pertaining to both capabilities in a self-
   contained section.  In particular, Section 3.1.1 describes the
   bandwidth capability extension, and Section 3.1.2 describes the
   information capability extension.  Separate option tags are defined
   for both capabilities.

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


3.1.  Extensions to SDP

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] and the SDP media
   capabilities [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities] specify
   attributes for negotiating SDP capabilities.  These documents specify
   new attributes (e.g., 'acap', 'tcap', 'mcap') for achieving their
   purpose.  In this document we define two new additional capability
   attributes for SDP lines of the the general form:

      type=value

   for types "i" and "b".  The corresponding capability attributes are
   defined as "icap" and "bcap", respectively.

   From the sub-rules of "a=" line in SDP [RFC4566], SDP attributes are
   of the form:

   attribute          = (att-field ":" att-value) / att-field
   att-field          = token
   att-value          = byte-string

   Capability attributes use only the 'att-field:att-value' form.

   The new attributes may be referenced in potential configurations
   ("a=pcfg") or in latent configurations ("a=lcfg"), as productions
   conforming to the extension-config-list as defined in [RFC5939].

   extension-config-list = ["+"] ext-cap-name "="
                                  ext-cap-list
   ext-cap-name          = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
   ext-cap-list          = 1*VCHAR  ; defined in [RFC5234]

   The optional "+" is used to indicate that the entire configuration,
   not just the parameter, must be ignored if the parameter is not
   supported.  The attributes may be referenced in actual configurations
   as productions conforming to the sel-extension-config defined in
   [RFC5939].

   sel-extension-config = ext-cap-name "=" 1*VCHAR

   The specific parameters are defined in the individual description of
   each capability, below.

   It is not the intention of this work to negotiate these new
   capabilities at the session level, rather only at the media level.
   Therefore, capabilities referenced by any configuration attribute
   MUST appear at the media level when a configuration is "converted" to
   a corresponding media block.  For this reason, the "icap" attribute



Garcia-Martin, et al.    Expires April 11, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


   is called the "media information capability".  Specific values for
   each new attribute are described below.

3.1.1.  Bandwidth Capability

   According to RFC 4566 [RFC4566] the bandwidth field denotes the
   proposed bandwidth to be used by the session or media.  For what it
   concerns this memo, we focus on the bandwidth at the media level.
   This bandwidth field is specified in RFC 4566 [RFC4566] according to
   the following syntax:

      b=<bwtype>:<bandwidth>

   where <bwtype> is an alphanumeric modifier giving the meaning of the
   <bandwidth> figure.

   In this document, we define a new capability attribute: the bandwidth
   capability attribute "bcap".  This attribute lists bandwidth as
   capabilities according to the following definition:

      "a=bcap:" bw-cap-num 1*WSP bwtype ":" bandwidth CRLF

   where <bw-cap-num> is a unique ordinal identifier of the bandwidth
   capability, and the other elements are as defined for the "b=" field
   in [RFC4566].

   This format satisfies the general attribute production rules in
   [RFC4566] according to the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax:

   att-field       = "bcap"
   att-value       = bw-cap-num 1*WSP bwtype ":" bandwidth
   bw-cap-num      = 1*DIGIT   ; integer between 1 and 2^31-1, inclusive

   Negotiation of bandwidth per media stream can be useful when
   negotiating media encoding capabilities with different bandwidths.

3.1.1.1.  Configuration Parameters

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] provides for the
   existence of the "pcfg" and "acfg" attributes, which can carry one or
   more potential configurations to be negotiated.  The concept is
   extended by the the Media Capabilities Negotiation
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities] with an "lcfg" attribute
   that conveys latent configurations.  Extensions to the "pcfg" and
   "lcfg" attributes are defined through <extension-config-list>, and
   extensions to the "acfg" attribute are defined through the <sel-
   extension-config> as defined in [RFC5939].

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


   In this document we extend the <extension-config-list> field to be
   able to convey lists of bandwidth capabilities in latent or potential
   configurations, according to the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax:

   extension-config-list  = bandwidth-config-list

   bandwidth-config-list  = ["+"] "b=" bw-cap-list *(BAR b-cap-list)
   bw-cap-list            = bw-cap-num *("," b-cap-num)
   bw-cap-num             = 1*DIGIT   ; 1 to 2^32-1 inclusive

       Figure 1: Syntax of the bandwidth parameter in lcfg and pcfg
                                attributes

   Each bandwidth capability configuration is a comma-separated list of
   bandwidth capability attribute numbers where 'b-cap-num' refers to
   the bw-cap-num bandwidth capability numbers defined explicitly
   earlier in this document, and hence must be between 1 and 2^31-1
   (both included).  Alternative bandwidth configurations are separated
   by a vertical bar ("|").

   The bandwidth parameter to the actual configuration attribute
   ("a=acfg") is formulated as a sel-extension-config with

      ext-cap-name = "b"

   hence

   sel-extension-config = sel-bandwidth-config
   sel-bandwidth-config = "b=" bw-cap-list  ; bw-cap-list as above.

      Figure 2: Syntax of the bandwidth parameter in acfg attributes

3.1.1.2.  Option tag

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] solution allows
   for capability negotiation extensions to be defined.  Associated with
   each such extension is an option tag that identifies the extension in
   question.  Hereby, we define a new option tag of "bcap-v0" that
   identifies support for the bandwidth capability.  This option tag
   SHOULD be added to other existing option tags present in the "csup"
   and "creq" attributes in SDP, according to the procedures defined in
   the SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939].

3.1.2.  Information Capability

   RFC 4566 [RFC4566] provides for the existence of an information field
   expressed in the format of the "i=" line, which can appear either at



Garcia-Martin, et al.    Expires April 11, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


   the session level or at the media level.  An "i=" line that is
   present at the session level is known as the "session name", and its
   purpose is to convey a human-readable textual information about the
   session.  We don't see much usage of capabilities related to the "i="
   line at the session level.

   The "i=" line in SDP can also appear at the media level, in which
   case it is used to provide human-readable information about the media
   stream to which it is related, e.g., it may indicate the purpose of
   the media stream.  The information field is not to be confused with
   the label attribute ("a=label:...), [RFC4574]) which provides a
   machine-readable tag.  It is foreseen that applications declaring
   capabilities related to different configurations of a media stream
   may need to provide different identifying information for each of
   those configurations.  That is, a party might offer alternative media
   configurations for a stream, each of which represents a different
   presentation of the same or similar information.  For example, an
   audio stream might offer English or Spanish configurations, or a
   video stream might offer a choice of video source such as speaker
   camera, group camera, or document viewer.  The information capability
   is needed to inform the answering user in order to select the proper
   choice, and the label is used to inform the offering machine which
   choice the answerer has selected.  Hence, there is value in defining
   a mechanism to provide information of media streams as capabilities.

   According to SDP [RFC4566], the media label has the following syntax:

      "i="text

   where "text" represents a human-readable text indicating the purpose
   of the media stream.

   In this document we define a new capability attribute: the
   information media capability, "icap".  This attribute lists
   information media labels as capabilities, according to the following
   definition:

      "a=icap:" info-cap-num 1*WSP text

   where <info-cap-num> is the ordinal identifier of the particular
   media information capability and <text> is a human-readable text that
   indicates the purpose of the media stream it is supposed to
   characterize.

   As an example, one might use:

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


      a=icap:1 Document Camera

   to represent a purpose of a media stream identified with the
   capability number 1.

   The media information capability attribute satisfies the general
   attribute production rules in [RFC4566] according to the following
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax:

   att-field       = "icap"
   att-value       = info-cap-num 1*WSP text
                               ; text is defined in RFC 4566
   info-cap-num    = 1*DIGIT   ; integer between 1 and 2^31-1

3.1.2.1.  Configuration Parameters

   The SDP Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939] provides for the
   existence of the "pcfg" and "acfg" attributes, which can carry one or
   more potential configurations to be negotiated.  The concept is
   extended by the the Media Capabilities Negotiation
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities] with an "lcfg" attribute
   that conveys latent configurations.

   In this document, we define an <info-config-list> parameter to be
   used to convey information capabilities in a potential or latent
   configuration.  This parameter is defined as an <extension-config-
   list> with the following associations:

      ext-cap-name = "i"

      ext-cap-list = info-cap-list

   This leads to the following definition for the information capability
   parameter:

   extension-config-list = info-config-list
   info-config-list      = "i=" info-cap-list
   info-cap-list         = info-cap-num *(BAR info-cap-num)
   info-cap-num          = 1*DIGIT   ; 1 to 2^32-1 inclusive
                            ; BAR defined in SDP capabilities
                            ; negotiation

   Figure 3: Syntax of the information capability parameter in lcfg and
                              pcfg attributes

   Each potential capability configuration contains a single information
   capability attribute number where 'info-cap-num' is the information
   capability number defined explicitly earlier in this document, and



Garcia-Martin, et al.    Expires April 11, 2011                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


   hence must be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both included).  The information
   capability allows the expression of only a single capability in each
   alternative, since no more than a single information field is
   permitted per media block.  Nevertheless, it is still allowed to
   express alternative potential information configurations separated by
   a vertical bar ("|").

3.1.2.2.  Option Tag

   At present, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which the
   'icap' attribute must be supported or the offer must be rejected.  In
   most cases, if the icap attribute or its contents were to be ignored,
   an offered configuration could still be chosen based on other
   criteria such as configuration numbering.  However, one might imagine
   an SDP offer that contained English and Spanish potential
   configurations for an audio stream.  The session might be
   unintelligible if the choice is based on configuration numbering,
   rather than informed user selection.  Based on such considerations,
   it may well prove useful to announce the ability to use the icap
   attribute and its contents to select media configurations, or to
   inform the user about the selected configuration(s).  Therefore, we
   define a new option tag of "icap-v0" that identifies support for the
   media information capability.  This option tag SHOULD be added to
   other existing option tags present in the "csup" and/or "creq"
   attributes in SDP, according to the procedures defined in the SDP
   Capability Negotiation Framework [RFC5939].  The discusion above
   suggests that "icap-v0" will typically appear in a "csup" attribute,
   but rarely in a "creq" attribute.

3.2.  Session Level versus Media Level

   The icap, ccap, and bcap attributes can appear at the session level
   and/or at the media level, but MUST be interpreted as a media-level
   capability.  To avoid confusion, the <type-attr-num> for each line
   must be unique across all capability attributes of the same type
   within the entire session description.  As described below, these
   capability attributes may be referenced by acfg, pcfg and/or lcfg
   attributes.


4.  Field Replacement Rules

   To simplify the construction of SDP records, given the need to
   include fields at the base level for endpoints that do not support
   capabilities negotiation, we define some simple field-replacement
   rules for those fields invoked by potential or latent configurations.
   In particular, any i-field or c-field invoked by a configuration MUST
   replace the corresponding field, if present at the base media level.

Internet-Draft      Miscellaneous Capabilities in SDP       October 2010


   Any b-field invoked by a configuration MUST replace any b-field of
   the same bandwidth type at the media level.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New SDP Attributes

   IANA is hereby requested to register the following new SDP
   attributes:

      Attribute name: icap

      Long form name: Information Capability

      Type of attribute: Media-level

      Subject to charset: Yes

      Purpose: Negotiate human-readable media information

      Appropriate values: See Section 3.1.2

      Attribute name: bcap

      Long form name: Bandwidth Capability

      Type of attribute: Media-level

      Subject to charset: No

      Purpose: Negotiate media-level bandwidths

      Appropriate values: See Section 3.1.1

5.2.  New Option Tags

   IANA is hereby requested to add the new option tags "ccap-v0" and
   "bcap-v0", defined herein, to the SDP Capability Negotiation Option
   Tag Registry.

5.3.  New SDP Capability Negotiation Configuration Parameters

   IANA is hereby requested to add the new parameter identifiers "i" for
   "information" and "b" for "bandwidth" to the Potential Configuration
   Parameter Registry.  These parameters are permitted in 'lcfg',
   'acfg', and 'pcfg' attributes.
