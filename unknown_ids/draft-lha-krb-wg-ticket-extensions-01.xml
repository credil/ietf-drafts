      <t>

	The Kerberos protocol does not allow ticket extensions.  This
	make it harder to deploy features like referrals and PKCROSS.

      </t>
      <t>

	Since the Kerberos protocol did not specified extensibility
	for the Ticket structure and the current implementations are
	aware of the contents of tickets, the extension protocol
	cannot simply extend the Ticket ASN.1 structure.  Instead, the
	extension data needs to be hidden inside the ticket.

	This document uses the special encryption type etype-TBETicket
	to signal that enc-part.cipher contains the DER-encoded
	TBETicket structure, instead of an encrypted EncTicketPart.

	The content of cipher data and encryption type fields is moved
	inside TBETicket.

      </t>
      <t>

	Negative ticket extension types (te-type) is private
	extensions and MUST only be used for experimentation or
	private use.

      </t>
      <t>

	The te-type field specifies the type of the content in
	te-data. Unknown te-types MUST be ignored both by the client
	and the server.

      </t>
      <t>

	The te-csum field is optional for the type, when in use by
	type type specifed in te-type, the key have to be specifed and
	the key usage number. The key is usually the session key of
	the ticket, but doesn't have to be, an extension could specify
	an new session key used for the ticket.

      </t>

      <t>

	The KDC MUST NOT use extended ticket in an AS or TGS reply
	unless it is known that all instances of the service in
	question support it.  In particular, a (local or cross-realm)
	TGT MUST NOT use extended tickets unless all of the KDCs to
	which it may be sent are known to support it.

      </t>
      <t>

	The KDC MAY return extended tickets to servers supporting
	ticket extensions even if the extended ticket does not contain
	any extensions.

    <section title="How to request a new assignment for a ticket extension">

      <t>
	When anyone is writing a internet-draft for which a new
	assignment for te-type is needed/wanted under the ticket
	extension, then the proper way to do so is as follows:

	<figure>
          <artwork>
            <![CDATA[
      EXAMPLE-MODULE DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

      krb5-ticket-extension-Name ::= INTEGER nnn
      -- IANA: please assign nnn
      -- RFC-Editor: replace nnn with IANA-assigned
      --             number and remove this note
      END
]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>

	IANA: Don't do note above, its an example, remove this note
	RFC-Editor: Don't do note above, its an example, remove this note

	IANA will assign the number as part of the RFC publication process.

      </t>
      <t>

	When reviewing the document, the reviewer should take sure to
	check that if te-csum is used, the siging key and key usage is
	specifed.

      </t>

    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>
	This document describes how to extend Kerberos tickets to
	include additional data in the ticket. This does have a
	security implications since the extension data in the
	TBETicket is only optionally signed, not encrypted and is not
	replay protected. It is up to the consumers of this interface
	to make sure its used safely.
      </t>

      <t>
	Some of the issues that the exensions need to protect themself
	from are: MITM downgrade to normal ticket, add or remove
	extentions, cut and paste extensions between requests,
	retransmission of requqests to a diffrent KDC.
      </t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">

      <t>
	There are currently no ticket extensions. Future ticket extensions will be published at:

	IANA is requested to maintain this registry for future assignments.
	New assignments can only be made via Specification Required as described in
