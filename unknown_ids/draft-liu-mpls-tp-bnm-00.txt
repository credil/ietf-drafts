Internet-Draft             MPLS-TP BNM packet              February 2009


Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to MPLS BDI packet to form a new
   type of OAM packet BNM(Backward Notify Message) , this BNM packet
   will not only have the function of informing source MEP about
   existing fault in the back of path like MPLS BDI packet, but also it
   may response or feedback to performance and test aspect.  And these
   response or fault indication information will be encapsulated in BNM
   packet by the way of TLV packet.  So it may decrease the number of
   OAM type and keep compatibility with MPLS network. on the other hand,
   this encapsulating these feedback or response information by the way
   of TLV packet will be easy to extend OAM function to operate an MPLS
   Transport profile(MPLS-TP) label switched path (LSP).

Internet-Draft             MPLS-TP BNM packet              February 2009


1.  Introduction

   this document mainly introduce a kind of new OAM packet(BNM) that can
   extend BDI packet and use encapsulation in the way of G-ACH.  It used
   for a MEP to inform or tell another MEP about fault and
   performance,i.e ,VSR,EXR etc.These response information packet may be
   feedbacked or informed by BNM packet , so another MEP will set out
   switching of LSP or path and measure link performance. for all kinds
   of response or notifying information, which may be encapsulated into
   BNM packet by the way of TLV will be sent to another MEP along
   MPLS-TP LSP. so it may ensure not to add the number of MPLS OAM and
   it is easy to extend MPLS OAM function.

3.  MPLS-TP BNM Message

   For mpls-tp BNM packet, it must be encapsulated by G-ACH to keep the
   same as all other MPLS-TP OAM packet.  The G-ACH with MPLS-TP BNM
   code point indicates that the message is an MPLS BDI message.  In
   addition, a 32-bit field is added to carry the message ID and the
   message length as shown below Figure 1:



       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5   6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   by the way of TLV in the Message Packet;

   Resv field:senven bits followed A bit will all be set 0;

   channel type:16bit, the field value is 0x03 that is the same as mpls
   BDI code point;

   Message ID:the 32-bits field is set by the sender.  The receiver MUST
   include the Message ID in the response.  This way, the sender can
   correlate a reply with the corresponding request.

   Message Length:the value of this field is the total length of the
   message in bytes excluding the length of the MPLS-TP OAM message
   header.


3.1.  Packet Loss Response TLV

   Packet loss response TLV is used to reply and notify source MEP about
   packet loss performance of this path or LSP connection and it is the
   feedback or response to LMM packet. when source MEP receives the
   packet loss response TLV that was sent by another end MEP, it will
   process and analyse this TLV message packet till the MEP point can_t
   identify this TLV . then it will select a better LSP and switch LSP
   or Path.  The packet loss response TLV packet show below figure 2:



        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.2.  one-way delay reponse TLV

   One-way delay response TLV is a response or feedback to 1DM packet
   that is used to request delay measure of one way by source MEP.
   Firstly, the source MEP of unidirectional LSP will send DMM message
   include time stamp of sending to another sink MEP . when sink MEP
   received 1DM packet and saved the time of received the 1DM packet.
   then computed the difference between the two time.  And the
   difference value will be delay of this one-way LSP.  Then this sink
   MEP will send one-way delay response TLV encapsulated in BNM message
   to source MEP by the return path to inform or tell source MEP about
   the performance value of one-way delay of this LSP.  And one-way
   delay response TLV shows below figure 3:



        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.3.  Experimental response TLV

   Experimental response TLV is a response or feedback to EXM packet
   that is used for experimental activities in cases where an OAM PDU
   type is not defined in MPLS-TP aspect. and it can be used within an
   administrative domain on a temporary basis.  Firstly a MEP sends a
   EXM packet to another MEP for experimental activities.  When another
   target MEP receives the EXM packet and processes the packet. and then
   the result of experimental activity will be encapsulated into
   Experimental response TLV packet like EXR packet in BNM packet, then
   the sink MEP sends this BNM including Experimental response TLV to
   source MEP, so the source MEP understands or knows the result of
   experimental activity.  The Experimental response TLV packet show
   below figure 4:

   value: the data about Experimental activities;

3.4.  Vendor Specific response TLV

   Vendor Specific response TLV that may have the function of VSR packet
   is response or feedback to VSM packet that may be used to check or
   test Interoperability by a vendor across its equipment.  Firstly
   Vendor Specific Equipment MEP may send VSM packet to another Vendor
   Specific Equipment MEP.  When another MEP received the VSM packet and
   processed it .and then sink MEP can send a BNM packet including
   Vendor Specific response TLV to source MEP.  And these Vendor
   Specific Equipment can communicate with each other . the Vendor
   Specific response TLV packet show below figure 5:



        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.5.  Client Signal Fail(CSF) TLV

   Client Signal Fail(CSF) TLV is used to to propagate a Client Signal
   Fail (CSF) indication to the far-end MPLS-TP client-specific sink-
   adaptation process on detection of a failure of the ingress client
   signal in case the client-layer itself does not support an alarm
   suppression mechanism.  This BNM packet in which may have
   encapsulated CSF TLV can be issued by a MEP upon receiving signal
   fail information from its client-layer.  When far-end MEP received
   this BNM packet including CSF TLV and processed it , the MEP detects
   a client-layer signal fail condition and forward this as a signal
   fail indication to its client-laye, this CSF TLV packet show below
   figure 6:



        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   length:the length of this Client Signal Fail(CSF) TLV;

   value: the data of CSF state;

3.6.  Fault Message Notify TLV

   Fault Message Notify TLV that is like BDI packet is used to inform
   the upstream LSR that there is a defect at the downstream LSP_s LSR
   point.  When there is a fault happened in the LSP, the downstream
   LSP_s LSR point can detect this fault and send FDI packet to the
   termination sink point.  Then fault type and location information
   will be filled in Fault Message Notify TLV packet and further can be
   encapsulated into BNM packet that will be sent to the upstream LSR
   and trigger 1:1 or 1:n protection switching; the Fault Message Notify
   TLV structure show below figure 7:

3.7.  other

   The BNM packet can not only inform or response to these information,
   but also it may notify or response to other information, i.e
   Synchronisation Status Message(SSM) may be encapsulated into a TLV
   packet that can be further encapsulated into the BNM packet. so by
   extending TLV packet, it is easy that BNM packet may support more
   other functions.

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further
   study.
