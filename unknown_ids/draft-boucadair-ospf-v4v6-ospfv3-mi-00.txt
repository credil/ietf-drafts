Abstract

   This memo defines two new Instance Identifiers (Instance IDs) in
   OSPFv3 [RFC2740]).  These new Instance IDs [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] are
   meant to instantiate distinct OSPFv3 instances to convey routing
   information which is restricted to IPv4-mapped IPv6 address Address
   Family [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The ultimate goal of
   running separate instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 is to isolate the
   native IPv6 routing table from the IPv4 and to prevent to be
   overloaded by IPv4-mapped one.  This isolation is motivated also from
   an operational perspective to allow specific engineering policies for
   each instance.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft        IPv4 Mapped IPv6 Instance ID          October 2009


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] specifies a mechanism to map each address
   family (AF) to a separate OSPFv3 [RFC2740] Instance identified by an
   ID.  Many Instance IDs have been reserved for different AF (e.g.,
   Instance ID #0 - #31 for IPv6 unicast AF, Instance ID#32 - #63 for
   IPv6 multicast AF, etc.).  Instance ID #0 is used by default for IPv6
   unicast AF.  This document requests to assign two new Instance IDs
   for the IPv4-mapped IPv6 AF.  They are:

   o  Unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 AF;

   o  Multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 AF.

   In the context of IPv4 address exhaustion and the IPv6-IPv4
   interconnection, numerous solutions are currently elaborated within
   IETF.  Both translation (e.g., [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   and [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate]) and encapsulation (e.g.,
   [I-D.boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6] and
   [I-D.boucadair-behave-ipv6-portrange]) based schemes are proposed to
   allow IPv6-IPv4 interconnection.  These solutions require injecting
   in intra-domain routing protocols routes to IPv4-mapped IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] destinations.  The IPv4-mapped IPv6
   address embeds an IPv4 address in an IPv6 address.  Technically, this
   AF carries the IPv4 routing information in which the transition
   routers can make routing decision to forward IPv4 packets.  This is
   considered harmful to inject IPv4 routing information to the IPv6
   routing database if the router does not belong to the transition
   network.

   In order to prevent from polluting the native IPv6 routing table with
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes, this memo defines new Instance IDs which are
   required for the activation of several OSPFv3 instances for unicast/
   multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6.  This isolation is also motivated for
   operational reasons and to ease the migration to full IPv6.  As a
   result, when a separate OSPFv3 instance for unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6
   AF is activated, there creates a separate OSPFv3 topology based on
   which unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 routing is calculated and performed,
   and similarly, when a separate OSPFv3 instance for multicast IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 AF is activated, there creates a separate OSPFv3 topology
   for multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 routing.

   As a reminder, [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] specifies an alternative
   mechanism to maintain multiple OSPFv3 topologies within the same
   domain.  This memo does not make any preference between the solution
   described in [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] and [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt].
   Network administrators have to make their decisions based on local
   policies and preferences.  If multi-instance mechanism

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] is deployed in an OSPFv3 network as a
   preference for multiple topologies, the extensions as defined in this
   memo may be used to support unicast/multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6
   routing.


2.  Procedure

   This document does not require any modification to the procedure
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt].  Nevertheless, only routes to
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 prefixes MUST be instantiated within a IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 routing MI-OSPFv3.  Concretely, the IANA's prefix defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be supported by default.
   Service providers MAY choose a LIR prefix to build the IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 addresses.


3.  Forwarding

   Only incoming datagrams destined to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are
   associated with the IPv4-mapped IPv6 unicast/multicast OSPFv3
   Instance, respectively.  WKP and/or LIR prefix defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be configured in all
   participating nodes.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following OSPFv3 Instance IDs:

   o  Instance ID# for IPv4-mapped IPv6 unicast AF;

   o  Instance ID# for multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 AF.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue in addition to
   those defined in [RFC2740].
