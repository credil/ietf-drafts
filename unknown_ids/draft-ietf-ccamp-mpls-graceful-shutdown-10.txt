Abstract 
 
   MPLS-TE Graceful Shutdown is a method for explicitly notifying 
   the nodes in a Traffic Engineering (TE) enabled network that the 
   TE capability on a link or on an entire Label Switching Router 
   (LSR) is going to be disabled. MPLS-TE graceful shutdown 
   mechanisms are tailored toward addressing planned outage in the 
   network.  
    
   This document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms to 
   reduce/eliminate traffic disruption in the event of a planned 
   shutdown of a network resource. These operations are equally 
   applicable to both MPLS and its Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
   extensions.

1. Introduction 
 
   When outages in a network are planned (e.g. for maintenance 
   purpose), some mechanisms can be used to avoid traffic 
   disruption. This is in contrast with unplanned network element 
   failure, where traffic disruption can be minimized thanks to 
   recovery mechanisms but may not be avoided. Hence, a Service 
   Provider may desire to gracefully (temporarily or indefinitely) 
   remove a TE Link, a group of TE Links or an entire node for 
   administrative reasons such as link maintenance, 
   software/hardware upgrade at a node or significant TE 
   configuration changes. In all these cases, the goal is to 
   minimize the impact on the traffic carried over TE LSPs in the 
   network by triggering notifications so as to gracefully reroute 
   such flows before the administrative procedures are started.

   These operations are equally applicable to both MPLS [RFC3209] 
   and its Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extensions [RFC3471], [RFC3473].  
    
   Graceful shutdown of a resource may require several steps. These 
   steps can be broadly divided into two sets: disabling the 
   resource in the control plane and removing the resource for 
   forwarding. The node initiating the graceful shutdown condition 
   is expected to introduce a delay between disabling the resource 
   in the control plane and removing the resource for forwarding. 
   This is to allow the control plane to gracefully divert the 
   traffic away from the resource being gracefully shutdown. The 
   trigger for the graceful shutdown event is a local matter at the 
   node initiating the graceful shutdown. Typically, graceful 
   shutdown is triggered for administrative reasons, such as link 
   maintenance or software/hardware upgrade.  
    
   This document describes the mechanisms that can be used to 
   gracefully shutdown MPLS/ GMPLS Traffic Engineering on a resource 
   such as a TE link, a component link within a bundled TE link, a 
   label resource or an entire TE node.  
 
2. Terminology 
  
   LSR - Label Switching Router. The terms node and LSR are used 
   interchangeably in this document.  
    
   GMPLS - The term GMPLS is used in this document to refer to 
   packet MPLS-TE, as well as GMPLS extensions to MPLS-TE.  
    
   LSP - An MPLS-TE/ GMPLS-TE Label Switched Path. 
    
   Head-end node: Ingress LSR that initiated signaling for the Path. 
    
   Border node: Ingress LSR of an LSP segment (S-LSP).   
    
   Path Computation Element (PCE): An entity that computes the 
   routes on behalf of its clients (PCC). 
    
   TE Link - The term TE link refers to single or a bundle of 
   physical link(s) or FA-LSP(s) on which traffic engineering is 
   enabled [RFC4206], [RFC4201]. 
    
   Last resort resource: If a path to a destination from a given 
   head-end node cannot be found upon removal of a resource (e.g., 
   TE link, TE node), the resource is called last resort to reach 
   that destination from the given head-end node.  
 
 
3. Requirements for Graceful Shutdown 
 
   This section lists the requirements for graceful shutdown in the 
   context of GMPLS Traffic Engineering.

   - Graceful shutdown is required to address graceful removal of 
   one TE link, one component link within a bundled TE link, a set 
   of TE links, a set of component links, label resource(s) or an 
   entire node.  
    
   - Once an operator has initiated graceful shutdown of a network 
   resource, no new TE LSPs may be set up that use the resource. 
   Any signaling message for a new LSP that explicitly specifies the 
   resource, or that would require the use of the resource due to 
   local constraints, is required to be rejected as if the resource 
   were unavailable. 
    
   - It is desirable for new LSP setup attempts that would be 
   rejected because of graceful shutdown of a resource (as described 
   in the previous requirement) to avoid any attempt to use the 
   resource by selecting an alternate route or other resources. 
    
    
   - If the resource being shutdown is a last resort, it can be 
   used. Time or decision for removal of the resource being shutdown 
   is based on a local decision at the node initiating the graceful 
   shutdown procedure.  
     
   - It is required to give the ingress node the opportunity to take 
   actions in order to reduce/eliminate traffic disruption on the 
   LSP(s) that are using the network resources which are about to be 
   shutdown.  
 
   - Graceful shutdown mechanisms are equally applicable to intra-
   domain and TE LSPs spanning multiple domains. Here, a domain is 
   defined as either an IGP area or an Autonomous System [RFC4726]. 
    
   - Graceful shutdown is equally applicable to GMPLS-TE, as well as 
   packet-based (MPLS) TE LSPs. 
    
   - In order to make rerouting effective, it is required that when 
     a node initiates the graceful shutdown of a resource, it 
     identifies to all other network nodes the TE resource under 
     graceful shutdown. 
   - Depending on switching technology, it may be possible to 
     shutdown a label resource, e.g., shutting down a lambda in a 
     Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) node.  
 
 
4. Mechanisms for Graceful Shutdown 
 
   An IGP only solution based on [RFC3630], [RFC5305], [RFC4203] and 
   [RFC5307] are not applicable when dealing with Inter-area and 
   Inter-AS traffic engineering, as IGP LSA/LSP flooding is 
   restricted to IGP areas/levels. Consequently, RSVP based 
   mechanisms are required to cope with TE LSPs spanning multiple

   domains. At the same time, RSVP mechanisms only convey the 
   information for the transiting LSPs to the router along the 
   upstream Path and not to all nodes in the network. Furthermore, 
   graceful shutdown notification via IGP flooding is required to 
   discourage a node from establishing new LSPs through the 
   resources being shutdown. In the following sections the 
   complementary mechanisms for RSVP-TE and IGP for Graceful 
   Shutdown are described. 
    
   A node where a link or the whole node is being shutdown may first 
   trigger the IGP updates as described in Section 4.1, introduce a 
   delay to allow network convergence and only then use the 
   signaling mechanism described in Section 4.2. 
    
 
4.1 OSPF/ ISIS Mechanisms for graceful shutdown 
 
   The procedures provided in this section are equally applicable to 
   OSPF and ISIS.  
 
   OSPF and ISIS procedure for graceful shutdown of TE link(s) is 
   similar to graceful restart of OSPF and ISIS as described in 
   [RFC4203] and [RFC5307], respectively. Specifically, the node 
   where graceful-shutdown of a link is desired originates the TE 
   LSA/LSP containing Link TLV for the link under graceful shutdown 
   with Traffic Engineering metric set to 0xffffffff, 0 as 
   unreserved bandwidth, and if the link has LSC or FSC as its 
   Switching Capability then also with 0 as Max LSP Bandwidth. A 
   node may also specify a value for Minimum LSP bandwidth which is 
   greater than the available bandwidth. This would discourage new 
   LSP establishment through the link under graceful shutdown.  
    
   If graceful shutdown procedure is performed for a component link 
   within a TE Link bundle and it is not the last component link 
   available within the TE link, the link attributes associated with 
   the TE link are recomputed. Similarly, If graceful shutdown 
   procedure is performed on a label resource within a TE Link, the 
   link attributes associated with the TE link are recomputed. If 
   the removal of the component link or label resource results in a 
   significant bandwidth change event, a new LSA is originated with 
   the new traffic parameters. If the last component link is being 
   shutdown, the routing procedure related to TE link removal is 
   used.  
 
   Neighbors of the node where graceful shutdown procedure is in 
   progress continues to advertise the actual unreserved bandwidth 
   of the TE links from the neighbors to that node, without any 
   routing adjacency change.  
 
   When graceful shutdown at node level is desired, the node in 
   question follows the procedure specified in the previous section 
   for all TE Links.

4.2 RSVP-TE Signaling Mechanisms for graceful shutdown 
 
   As discussed in Section 3, one of the requirements for the 
   signaling mechanism for graceful shutdown is to carry information 
   about the resource under graceful shutdown. For this purpose the 
   Graceful Shutdown uses LSP rerouting mechanism as defined in 
   [LSP-REROUTE].  
    
   Specifically, the node where graceful shutdown of an unbundled TE 
   link or an entire bundled TE link is desired triggers a PathErr 
   message with the error codes and error values of "Notify/Local 
   link maintenance required", for all affected LSPs. Similarly, the 
   node that is being gracefully shutdown triggers a PathErr message 
   with the error codes and error values of "Notify/ Local node 
   maintenance required", for all LSPs. For graceful shutdown of a 
   node, an unbundled TE link or an entire bundled TE link, the 
   PathErr message may contain either an [RFC2205] format ERROR_SPEC 
   object, or an IF_ID [RFC3473] format ERROR_SPEC object. In either 
   case, it is the address and TLVs carried by the ERROR_SPEC object 
   and not the error value that indicates the resource that is to be 
   gracefully shutdown. 
    
   MPLS TE Link Bundling [RFC4201] requires that an LSP is pinned 
   down to a component link. Consequently, graceful shutdown of a 
   component link in a bundled TE link differs from graceful 
   shutdown of unbundled TE link or entire bundled TE link. 
   Specifically, in the former case, when only a subset of component 
   links and not the entire TE bundled link is being shutdown, the 
   remaining component links of the bundled TE link may still be 
   able to admit new LSPs. The node where graceful shutdown of a 
   component link is desired triggers a PathErr message with the 
   error codes and error values of "Notify/Local link maintenance 
   required". The rest of the ERROR_SPEC object is constructed using 
   Component Reroute Request procedure defined in [LSP-REROUTE].  
    
   If graceful shutdown of a label resource is desired, the node 
   initiating this action triggers a PathErr message with the error 
   codes and error values of "Notify/Local link maintenance 
   required". The rest of the ERROR_SPEC object is constructed using 
   Label Reroute Request procedure defined in [LSP-REROUTE].   
 
    
   When a head-end node, a transit node or a border node receive a 
   PathErr message with error codes and error values of "Notify/Local 
   link maintenance required" or "Notify/ Local node maintenance 
   required", it follows the procedures defined in [LSP-REROUTE] to 
   reroute the traffic around the resource being gracefully shutdown. 
   When performing path computation for the new LSP, the head-end node,  
   or border node avoids using the TE resources identified by the

       draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-graceful-shutdown-10.txt      
 
 
   ERROR_SPEC object. If PCE is used for path computation, head-end  
   node or border node acts as PCC to request the PCE via PCEP for path 
   computation avoiding resource being gracefully shutdown. The 
   amount of time the head-end node, or border node avoid using the 
   TE resources identified by the IP address contained in the 
   PathErr is based on a local decision at head-end node or border 
   node.  
    
   If node initiating the graceful shutdown procedure received path 
   setup request for a new tunnel using resource being gracefully 
   shutdown, it sends a Path Error message with "Notify" error code 
   in the ERROR SPEC object and an error value consistent with the 
   type of resource being gracefully shutdown. However, based on a 
   local decision, if an existing tunnel continues to use the 
   resource being gracefully shutdown, the node initiating the 
   graceful shutdown procedure may allow resource being gracefully 
   shutdown to be used as a "last resort". The node initiating the 
   graceful shutdown procedure can distinguish between new and 
   existing tunnels based on the tunnel ID in the SESSION object.  
    
   Time or decision for removal of the resource being shutdown from 
   forwarding is based on a local decision at the node initiating 
   the graceful shutdown procedure. For this purpose, the node 
   initiating graceful shutdown procedure follows the Reroute 
   Request Timeout procedure defined in [LSP-REROUTE].  
    
5. Security Considerations 
 
   This document introduces no new security considerations as this 
   document describes usage of existing formats and mechanisms. This 
   document relies on existing procedures for advertisement of TE 
   LSA/LSP containing Link TLV. Tampering with TE LSAs may have an 
   effect on traffic engineering computations, and it is suggested 
   that any mechanisms used for securing the transmission of normal 
   OSPF LSAs/ ISIS LSPs be applied equally to all Opaque LSAs/ LSPs 
   this document uses.  Existing security considerations specified 
   in [RFC3630], [RFC5305], [RFC4203], [RFC5307] and [MPLS-GMPLS-
   SECURITY] remain relevant and suffice. Furthermore, security 
   considerations section in [LSP-REROUTE] and the Section 9 of 
   [RFC4736] should be used for understanding the security 
   considerations related to the formats and mechanisms used in this 
   document. 
 
 
6. IANA Considerations
