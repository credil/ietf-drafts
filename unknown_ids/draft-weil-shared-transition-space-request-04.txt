         IANA Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Transition Space
             draft-weil-shared-transition-space-request-04

Abstract

   This document requests a reserved IANA IPv4 address allocation as

Internet-Draft       Shared Transition Space Request         August 2011


1.  Introduction

   Many operators are currently implementing their IPv6 transition
   plans.  During the transition, continued support for heritage IPv4-
   only devices will be required.  In order to facilitate the deployment
   of transition technologies to support such heritage IPv4-only devices
   and services, Service Providers require IPv4 address space that is
   separate from the range of IPv4 addresses used by subscribers.  This
   address space need not be unique to each provider, but should be
   outside of [RFC1918] space.  This document requests that an IPv4 /10
   be reserved as Shared Transition Space solely to facilitate
   deployment of IPv6 transition/IPv4 coexistence technologies.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Applicability

   The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
   unallocated IPv4 addresses.  During the transition period to IPv6, it
   is imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for
   devices and networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to
   IPv6.

   The applicability of and justification for Shared Transition Space is
   described in [I-D.bdgks-arin-shared-transition-space].

4.  Shared Transition Space

   This document proposes the assignment of a /10 as Shared Transition
   Space.  Shared Transition Space is IPv4 address space reserved for
   Infrastructure Provider use with the purpose of facilitating IPv6
   transition and IPv4 coexistence deployment.  The requested block
   SHOULD NOT be utilized for any purpose other than as "inside"
   addresses in a carrier NAT environment (e.g., between the CGN and
   customer CPE devices) or for other IPv4 to IPv6 transition
   infrastructure.  Network equipment manufacturers MUST NOT use the
   assigned block in default or example device configurations.

   Because Shared Transition addresses have no meaning outside of the
   Infrastructure Provider, routing information about shared transition
   space networks MUST NOT be propagated on interdomain links, and
   packets with shared transition source or destination addresses SHOULD
   NOT be forwarded across such links.  Internet service providers
   SHOULD filter out routing information about shared transition space
   networks on ingress links.

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
   issues.  Any addresses allocated as Shared Transition Space would not
   be routable on the Internet.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to record the allocation of an IPv4 /10 for use as
   Shared Transition Space.
