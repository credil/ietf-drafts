Abstract

   Network virtualization technique leveraged by a virtual machine makes
   it possible to dynamically relocate functional entities without
   topological and physical constraints.  By tapping into this
   technique, service mobility, which deals with not only functional
   entities but also sessions established between those entities, will
   become possible and such capability is especially longed for
   realizing more scalable and reliable telecom networks.  This document
   provides the reference model for service mobility in a virtual
   environment and defines the control protocol between the virtualized
   platform and the managing controller to realize service mobility.

2.  Introduction

   There is a growing consensus that a significant number of services
   will be delivered using a cloud-computing model.  These applications
   and services will be hosted in data centers located in various parts
   of the network.  New services will be instantiated by deploying a
   service delivery system in a dynamic manner such that the network and
   data center resources are allocated dynamically.

   At the same time, telecom networks are moving toward all-IP based
   systems such as 3GPP SAE (System Architecture Evolution), IMS (IP
   Multimedia Subsystem) and SDP (Service Delivery Platform), whereby
   the transport and services are being handled by IP technology.  These
   systems are composed of a number of components or functional entities
   connected with each other, which makes the whole telecom network even
   more complex.  Wide variety of services ranging from conventional
   voice, gaming to Web2.0 type of ones such SNS (Social Network
   Service), are being introduced and the number of users is also
   dynamically changes.  In such environments, the telecom network needs
   to scale on demand with efficient use of infrastructure as well as to
   improve reliability and availability.

   It is imperative that such ever-evolving new services be seen by the
   user as having no delay and can be accessed from anywhere with high
   reliability.  If service components or functional entities in the
   telecom networks (e.g., call control function or policy control
   function) can be located and moved without any topological or
   geographical constraint, higher reliability can be achieved than
   conventional redundancy systems.  By tapping into cloud-computing
   technology, telecom network deployed in a virtualized environment (or
   virtualized telecom network), will be able to scale telecom services
   on demand, to improve reliability and availability and to efficiently
   use the infrastructure [IMSAA09].  One of the key features provided
   by the virtualized telecom network is service mobility.  A general
   property of service mobility is to ensure it is transparent to
   service user, that is, the on-going service must be continued in a
   transparent manner and existing protocols or interfaces should not be
   affected.

   This document provides the reference model for service mobility in a
   virtual environment and defines the control protocol between the
   virtualized platform (e.g., virtual machines) and the managing
   controller to enable service mobility.

3.  Overview and Terminology

   The components in the virtualized network include "Manager Node",
   "Execution Node" and optional "Information Server".  The management
   role for the execution nodes can be realized in both a centralized
   way as well as a distributed (Peer-to-peer) way.  The Execution node
   is a physical or virtual machines on which target functions
   (software) are running.  For example, in the context of IMS (IP
   Multimedia Subsystem), the CSCF (Call Session Control Function) and
   HSS (Home Subscriber Server) are candidates of such functions.
   Information servers include DHCP, DNS, etc.  Use for discovery and
   assignment of execution node for a session (Proxy-CSCF at a UE's
   registration).

   Execution Node:
        Logical entity that can execute functions.  A well-know example
        is a virtual machine or VM.

   Manager Node:
        Logical entity that manages functions running on the execution
        nodes.

   Information Server:
        A server used for discovery of Manager Node or Execution Node
        via IETF standardized protocols (e.g., DNS server or DHCP
        server).  This entity is so far outside the scope of this
        document's specifications.

   Function:
        Logical unit that provides a specific service such as
        "authentication" or "call control"

   Session:
        Relationship between functions providing a specific service.
        Each function maintains a state related to the session.

   Service mobility:
        Capability to move function(s) among execution nodes with
        maintaining the ongoing service.

   Node ID:
        Uniquely identifies the execution node, which provided and
        managed by the manager node.

   Function ID:
        Uniquely identifies the function, which is provided and managed
        by the manager node.

   The reference model for service mobility is shown in Figure 1.  The
   service user on the upper layer utilizes service units provided by
   the service provider via the service access point (SAP).  By
   interacting with the management plane, the service unit may move its
   physical or topological location.  This movement must be transparent
   to the service user meaning that the on-going service must be
   continued.  Existing protocols and interfaces should not be affected
   by this capability.

                         Figure 1: Reference model

   Service mobility in the virtual environment is depicted in Figure 2.
   The virtual environment provides the capability to move execution
   nodes among physical hardware.  An execution node can run on one
   physical hardware unit (e.g., a server machine) or on multiple
   hardware units.  How the virtual environment is provided is outside
   the scope of this document.  Functions run on the execution nodes and
   one or more session(s) may be established with the corresponding
   status information.  When functions and/or sessions move from one
   execution node to another, consistency in the status information must
   be maintained to continue the sessions.

   The roles of the manager node and execution nodes and their
   relationship are depicted in Figure 3.  The manager node communicates
   with the execution nodes to control the mobility of functions.  The
   manger node can be deployed in a centralized or distributed fashion;
   however, that must be transparent to the execution nodes.  The
   execution nodes communicate with each other to move functions between
   the nodes.  An external information server or repository may be
   involved to support those nodes to discover other nodes.  The main
   focus of this document is the control protocol between the manager
   node and execution nodes.

4.  Protocol Operations

   Figure 4 shows the signaling flow between the manager and execution
   nodes.  When the execution node boots up, it registers itself with
   the manger node by sending the Registration message.  The manager
   node may periodically check the status of each registered execution
   node by sending the Keep-Alive message.  According to the situation
   on the execution nodes, the manager node sends various types of
   operation commands to the execution node.  If the status of the
   execution node changes, it sends the Status-Update message to the
   manager node.  Finally, if the execution node goes out of the scope
   of the management by the manager node or is going to be shut down, it
   sends the De-registration message to the manager node.  For each
   message, the recipient MUST send back the ACK message.

   In this document, the following control messages are defined:

   Registration:
        Used for the execution node to register itself with the manager
        node, by which the execution node goes under the control of the
        manager node.

   Keep-Alive:
        Used for the manager node to check the status of the managed
        execution node.

   Operation:
        Used for the manager node to indicate the execution node to do a
        specific action to the function or sessions on that execution
        node.

   Status-Update:
        Used for the execution node to notify the manager node on the
        updated status.

   De-registration:
        Used for the execution node to release the registration from the
        manager node.  The manager node can also send this message to
        the execution node to force de-registration.

   Ack:
        Used to respond to the above messages for acknowledgment and
        returning requested information and/or status code (success or
        failure).

   Further, the following operations are defined:

   GET operation:
        Used for the manager node to obtain specific information from
        the target execution node.

   ADD operation:
        Used to instruct the target execution node to run a new
        function.

   DELETE operation:
        Used to instruct the target execution node to terminate a
        running function.

   MOVE operation:
        Combination of ADD and DELETE operation, but the status
        information on the related function is also passed to a new
        execution node.

   COPY operation:
        Similar to ADD operation, but the status information on the
        related function is also passed to a new execution node.

   MOVE_SESSION operation:
        Used to instruct the target execution node to move sessions to
        another execution node.
