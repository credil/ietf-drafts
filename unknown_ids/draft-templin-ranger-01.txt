Abstract

   Enterprise networks will require support for both Internet protocol
   versions (IPv4 and IPv6) for an indeterminant period; perhaps even
   indefinitely.  This is particularly true for existing enterprise
   networks that must introduce IPv6 without disruption of IPv4
   services, but the same principles apply also to clean-slate
   deployments in new enterprises.  Next-generation enterprises
   therefore require an architected solution for coordination of their
   internal routing and addressing plans for both IPv6 and IPv4.  The
   RANGER architecture addresses these requirements.

1.  Introduction

   Enterprise networks will require support for both Internet protocol
   versions (IPv4 and IPv6) for an indeterminant period; perhaps even
   indefinitely.  This is particularly true for existing enterprise
   networks that must introduce IPv6 without disruption of IPv4
   services, but the same principles apply also to clean-slate
   deployments in new enterprises.  Next-generation enterprises
   therefore require an architected solution for coordination of their
   internal routing and addressing plans for both IPv6 and IPv4.  The
   RANGER architecture addresses these requirements, and provides a
   framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence [I-D.arkko-townsley-coexistence].

   RANGER is a scalable architecture for routing and addressing in next-
   generation enterprise networks that may contain many disjoint
   interior addressing domains.  Each of these domains may coordinate
   their own internal addressing plans independently of one another such
   that limited-scope addresses (e.g., [RFC1918] private-use IPv4
   addresses) may be reused with impunity to provide unlimited scaling
   through spatial reuse.  These disjoint domains therefore appear as
   enterprises unto themselves, such that a model of recursively nested
   "enterprises-within-enterprises" is enabled.

   Without an architected approach, routing and addressing within such a
   framework would be fragmented due to limited-scope address/prefix
   reuse between disjoint addressing domains.  However, the entire
   enterprise can be unified via a virtual overlay architecture
   mainfested by automatic tunneling over disjoint domains
   interconnected via border routers.

   RANGER provides an architecture for operation of virtual overlay
   networks within a diverse range of enterprise network scenarios, as
   outlined in the following sections.  While RANGER discusses the
   specific instance of IPv6 as a virtual overlay for connecting
   disjoint IPv4 domains, it is important to note that the same
   architectural principles apply to any combination of IP virtual
   overlays over disjoint IP addressing spaces.


2.  Terminology

   commons
      a routing region within an enterprise that provides a subnetwork
      for cooperative peering between the border routers of diverse
      organizations that may have competing interests.  A prime example
      of a commons is the Default Free Zone (DFZ) of the global
      Internet.

Internet-Draft                   RANGER                     October 2008


   enterprise
      the same as defined in [RFC4852], where the enterprise deploys a
      unified IPv4 routing and addressing plan but may internally
      contain many disjoint addressing domains and/or organizational
      groupings that can be considered as enterprises/sites unto
      themselves.  An enterprise therefore need not be "one big happy
      family", but instead provides a commons for the cooperative
      interconnection of diverse organizations that may have competing
      interests (e.g., such as the case within the global Internet
      default free zone).

      Enterprise networks are typically associated with large
      corporations or academic campuses, however the RANGER
      architectural principles apply to any network that has some degree
      of cooperative active management.  This definition can therefore
      be extended to home networks, small office networks, a wide
      variety of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), and even to the global
      Internet itself.

   site
      a logical and/or physical grouping of interfaces within an
      enterprise, where the site may be less than or equal to an
      enterprise in scope.  A site may contain many interior
      enterprises/sites, which may themselves contain many interior
      enterprises/sites in a recursive fashion.  At the lowest level of
      decomposition, a singleton Border Router can be considered as an
      enterprise/site unto itself.

   enterprise/site  Throughout the remainder of this document, the term
      "enterprise" is used to collectively refer to either enterprise or
      site, i.e., the RANGER principles apply equally to enterprises and
      sites of any size or shape.

   Border Router (BR)
      an IPv6/IPv4 dual-stack node at the edge of an enterprise and that
      is also configured as an IPv6 router in an overlay network.  BRs
      connect their directly-attached IPv6 networks to the overlay
      network, and connect to other IPv6 networks via IPv6-in-IPv4
      tunneling across the commons to other BRs.

   Border Gateway (BG)
      a BR that also connects the enterprise to provider networks and/or
      to the global Internet.  BGs are typically configured as default
      IPv6 routers, and provide forwarding services for accessing IPv6
      networks not reachable via a BR within the commons.

   overlay network
      a virtual network manifested by IPv6 routing and addressing over
      virtual links formed through automatic IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling.  An
      IPv6 overlay network may span many underlying IPv4 enterprises/
      sites.

   6over4
      Transmission of IPv6 over IPv4 Domains without Explicit Tunnels
      [RFC2529]; functional specifications and operational practices for
      automatic tunneling of unicast/multicast IPv6 packets over
      multicast-capable IPv4 enterprises/sites.

   ISATAP
      Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)
      [RFC5214]; functional specifications and operational practices for
      automatic tunneling of unicast IPv6 packets over unicast-only IPv4
      enterprises/sites.

   VET
      Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) [I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp];
      functional specifications and operational practices that provide a
      functional superset of 6over4 and ISATAP.  In addition to both
      unicast and multicast tunneling, VET also supports address/prefix
      autoconfiguration as well as extra encapsulations such as IPSec,
      SEAL, LISP, etc.

   SEAL
      Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)
      [I-D.templin-seal]; a functional specification for robust and
      authenticated path MTU assurance over IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels.  Also
      provides authentication for other ICMP error messages, and adapts
      to subnetworks with diverse link characteristics.


3.  The RANGER Architecture

   The RANGER architecture enables scalable IPv6 routing and addressing
   in next-generation enterprise networks, while sustaining support for
   legacy IPv4 networks and services.  Key to this approach is a
   framework that accommodates interconnection of diverse organizations
   with a mutual spirit of cooperation, but with the potential for
   competing interests.  The following sections outline the RANGER
   architecture within the context of anticipated use cases:

3.1.  The Enterprise-within-Enterprise Framework

   Enterprise networks traditionally distribute routing information via
   Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as Open Shortest Path First

   (OSPF), while large enterprises may even use an Exterior Gateway
   Protocol (EGP) internally in place of an IGP.  In particular, it is
   becoming increasingly commonplace for large enterprises to use the
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) internally and independently from the
   BGP instance that maintains the routing information base within the
   global Internet Default Free Zone (DFZ).

   As such, large enterprises may run an internal instance of BGP across
   many internal Autonomous Systems (ASs).  Such a large enterprise can
   therefore appear as an Internet unto itself, albeit with default
   routes leading to the true global Internet.  Additionally, each
   internal AS within such an enterprise may itself run BGP internally
   in place of an IGP, and can therefore also appear as an independent
   enterprise unto itself.  This enterprise-within-enterprise (or,
   "site-within-site") framework can be extended in an hierarchical
   fashion as broadly and as deeply as desired to acheive scaling
   factors as well as organizational and/or functional
   compartmentalization, as shown in Figure 1.

   Internet via routers 'R1' through 'Rn' and additional enterprises
   'E2' through 'EN' that also connect to the global Internet.  Within
   the 'E1' commons, there may be arbitrarily-many IPv4 hosts, routers
   and networks (not shown in the diagram) over which IPv4 packets can
   be forwarded and IPv6 packets can be tunneled.  There may also be
   many internal enterprises/sites 'E1.1' through 'E1.m' (shown in the
   diagram) that interconnect within the 'E1' commons via Border Routers
   (BRs) depicted as 'X1' through 'X9' (where 'X1' through 'X9' see 'R1'
   through 'Rn' as Border Gateways (BGs)).  Within each 'E1.*'
   enterprise, there may also be arbitrarily-many IPv4 networks/nodes as
   well as lower layer enterprises/sites that interconnect within the
   'E1.*' commons via BRs depicted as 'Y1' through 'Y9' in the diagram
   (where 'Y1' through 'Y9' see 'X1' through 'X9' as BGs).  This
   hierarchical decomposition can be recursively nested as deeply as
   desired, and ultimately terminates at singleton IPv6/IPv4 dual-stack
   systems such as those depicted as 'V', 'W' and 'Z' in the diagram.

   It is important to note that dual-stack systems such as 'V', 'W' and
   'Z' may be simple IPv6/IPv4 hosts, or they may be BRs that attach
   arbitrarily-complex IPv6-only edge networks.  Such IPv6-only edge
   networks could be as simple as a home network behind a residential
   gateway, or as complex as a major corporate/academic campus, a large
   service provider network, etc.

   Again, this enterprise-within-enterprise framework can be recursively
   nested as broadly and deeply as desired.  From the ultimate level of
   the hierarchy, consider now that the global Internet itself can be
   viewed as an "enterprise" that interconnects E1 through EN such that
   all RANGER architectural principles apply equally within the global
   Internet context.

   As a specific case in point, the future global Aeronautical
   Telecommuncations Network (ATN) under development within the civil
   aviation industry [I-D.bauer-mext-aero-topology] will take the form
   of a large enterprise network that appears as an Internet unto
   itself, i.e., exactly as depicted for 'E1' in Figure 1.  Within the
   ATN, there will be many Air Communications Service Provider (ACSP)
   and Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) networks organized as
   autonomous systems internal to the ATN, i.e., exactly as depicted for
   'E1.*' in the diagram.  The ACSP/ANSP network BGs will participate in
   a BGP instance internal to the ATN, and may themselves run
   independent BGP instances internally and be further sub-divided into
   enterprises/sites organized as regional, organizational, functional,
   etc. compartments.  It is important to note that, while ACSPs/ANSPs
   within the ATN share a common objective of safety-of-flight for civil
   aviation services, there may be competing business/social/political
   interests between them such that the ATN is not necessarily "one big
   happy family".  Therefore, the model parallels that of the global

   Internet itself.

   Such an operational framework may indeed be the case for many next-
   generation enterprises.  In particular, although the inner-workings
   of all enterprises will require a mutual level of cooperative active
   management at some level, free market forces, business objectives,
   political alliances, etc. may drive internal competition.

3.2.  Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)

   Within the enterprise-within-enterprise framework outlined in
   Section 3.1, the RANGER architecture is based on an overlay network
   approach that uses IPv6 routing and addressing to span an enterprise
   via automatic IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling over a hierarchy of child
   enterprises that use enterprise-local-scope IPv4 routing and
   addressing internally.  These logically and/or physically disjoint
   IPv4 child enterprises are "glued together" by IPv6 BRs/BGs, with
   each BR requesting an IPv6 prefix delegation from a delegating BG.
   Additionally, multihoming is naturally afforded through configuration
   of multiple BGs per child enterprise.

   Figure 2 below depits a vertical slice (albeit represented
   horizontally) from the enterprise-within-enterprise framework shown
   in Figure 1, where an IPv6 host 'H' that is deeply nested within
   Enterprise 'E1' connects to IPv6 server 'S1' located somewhere on the
   IPv6 Internet:

   'vet1' through 'vet3' manifested through Virtual Enterprise Traversal
   (VET) [I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp].  Each 'vet*' interface within this
   framework is Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA), and connects all
   BRs within the same enterprise.  Each enterprise within the 'E1'
   hierarchy may configure an independent routing and addressing plan
   from a common (but spatially reused) limited-scope IPv4 prefix, e.g.,
   depicted as '10/8' in the diagram.  The BR for each 'E1*' enterprise
   receives an IPv6 prefix delegation from a delegating BG, depicted
   above as sub-delegations of the prefix '2001:DB8::/40'.

   Along with the Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL -
   see: Section 3.4), VET specifies the necessary mechanisms and
   operational practices to manifest the RANGER architecture as depicted
   in the example above as well as in any such similar example.  In
   particular, VET allows 'V', 'Y1', 'X2' and 'R2' to configure separate
   'vet*' interfaces for each enterprise they connect to, and to
   discover BGs through a static name service resolution (or, mapping)
   as specified in [I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp].  After tunnels 'vet1'
   through 'vet3' are established and BG's discovered, the BRs connected
   to a 'vet*' interface can run an IPv6 routing protocol such as
   OSPVFv3 [RFC5340] and form adjacencies between themselves while
   treating the 'vet*' interface as an ordinary IPv6 link.  This allows
   an IPv6 overlay network that spans 'E1' to automatically form and
   dynamically adapt to changing conditions within the enterprise.

   In the example shown in Figure 2, a simple IPv6 host 'H' is attached
   to a shared link with IPv6/IPv4 dual stack node 'V'.  IPv6 host 'H'
   uses standard IPv6 neighbor discovery mechanisms to discover 'V' as a
   default IPv6 router that can forward its packets off the local link,
   while 'V' sees node 'Y1' as a BG that can be reached via 'vet1' and
   that can forward packets toward IPv6 server 'S1'.  Similarly, node
   'Y1' is a BR for the enterprise spanned by 'vet2' that sees 'X2' as a
   BG, and node 'X2' is a BR for 'vet3' that sees 'R2' as a BG that
   connects 'E1' to the global IPv6 Internet.

   In a second example, Figure 3 depicts an instance of on-demand
   discovery of more-specific routes in which an IPv6 host 'H' connects
   to an IPv6 server 'J' located in a different organizational entity
   within 'E1':

       Figure 3: On-Demand Discovery within the RANGER Architecture

   In this scenario, tunnel interfaces 'vet1' through 'vet4' as well as
   IPv6 prefix delegations have been established through the enterprise
   autoconfiguration procedures specified in
   [I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp].  When IPv6 host 'H' sends IPv6 packets
   to server 'J', however, unless IPv6 routing information is available
   BR 'X2' must determine that 'J' can be reached using a more direct
   route via 'X7' across the 'E1' commons.  To do so, 'X2' can perform
   an on-demand mapping lookup, or 'R2' can send an ICMPv6 redirect
   message indicating that 'J' can be reached via a more direct route
   through 'X7'.

   It is specifically worth noting that, in both of the previous
   examples, a BR may have potentially many VET interfaces over which it
   can connect to the BRs/BGs of potentially many "sibling" enterprises/
   sites across the commons.

3.3.  Support for IPv4 Services

   While the IPv6 overlay network that spans 'E1' provides a fully-
   connected routing and addressing capability for IPv6 services, access
   to legacy IPv4 services will still be required for an extended (and

         Figure 4: IPv4 Service Access in the RANGER Architecture

   In a first instance, an IPv4 client 'K' within enterprise 'E1.1.1'
   can access IPv4 service 'L' within the same enterprise as-normal and
   without the need for any IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation.  Instead, a
   "mapping" is done through a simple name lookup within the enterprise-
   local name service deployed in 'E1.1.1', and enterprise-local native
   IPv4 services are used.  In many instances, this may indeed be the
   preferred service access model even when IPv6 services are widely
   deployed due to factors such as inability to replace legacy IPv4
   applications, IPv6 header overhead avoidance, etc.

   In a second instance, IPv4 client 'K' can access IPv4 server 'S2' on
   the global IPv4 Internet in a number of ways.  First, all routers
   'Y1', 'X2' and 'R2' can provide an IPv4 Network Address Translation
   (NAT) capability, however this approach requires multiple instances
   of stateful NAT devices on the path which can lead to an overall
   degree of brittleness and intolerance to routing changes.  As a
   second alternative, 'E1' could instead deploy a "Carrier-Grade NAT
   (CGN)" at 'R2' (i.e., at the enterprise border with the global
   Internet) and E1.1.1 could configure 'Y1' as an IPv4 default router.
   'Y1' could then use the "dual-stack-lite" approach in which it uses
   IPv4-in-IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling to convey the IPv4 packets from 'K' to
   the CGN at 'R2', which then decapsulates and translates the inner
   IPv4 packets before sending them on to 'S2'.  As a third alternative,
   'K' could be configured as an IPv6-only node and use standard IPv6
   routing to reach an IPv6/IPv4 translator located at 'R2'.  The

Internet-Draft                   RANGER                     October 2008


   translator would then use IPv6-to-IPv4 translation before sending
   packets onwards toward 'S2'.  These and other alternatives are
   discussed in [I-D.wing-nat-pt-replacement-comparison].

   In a final instance, the RANGER architecture currently makes no
   provisions for an IPv4 client 'K' to use IPv4-only services to access
   an IPv4 server 'M' in a different enterprise within 'E1' that
   configures a disjoint addressing domain.  Until an architected
   approach is devised, 'K' would only be able to access 'M' using IPv6-
   only services.

3.4.  Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)

   Whenever the BRs of disjoint enterprises/sites are joined across a
   commons, mechanisms that rely on ICMP feedback from routers within
   the network may become brittle or susceptible to spoofing attacks.
   This is due to the fact that ICMP messages can be lost due to
   congestion or packet filtering gateways, and that network middleboxes
   are essentially "anonymous" and may include insufficient information
   in ICMPs that can be used to authenticate their source.  ICMP
   messages can therefore be forged by anonymous attackers, e.g., from a
   rogue node within an enterprise that has malicious intent toward
   another enterprise.

   The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Encapsulation Layer (SEAL) provides
   effective means for BRs to avoid these shortcomings by accepting only
   authenticated feedback from correspondent BRs that can be validated
   as Potential Routers within the commons (i.e., the subnetwork) using
   the mechanisms of [I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp].  Moreover, SEAL does
   not require reliable delivery of all ICMPs, but rather supports
   continued operation even if some/many ICMPs are lost.  Finally, SEAL
   adapts to subnetworks that contain links with diverse bandwidth and
   MTU size properties, and indeed allows for discovery and eradication
   of marginal links.

   The advantages of using SEAL within the RANGER enterprise-within-
   enterprise framework are tangible, and compare favorably with the
   alternative of deploying an all-IPv6 infrastructure even for clean-
   slate deployments.  This is especially true within enterprises that
   provide a commons for joining organizational/political/functional
   entities with a spirit of mutual cooperation but with competing
   interests or objectives.


4.  Initiatives Related to RANGER/VET/SEAL

Internet-Draft                   RANGER                     October 2008


4.1.  6over4 and ISATAP

   Long before the RANGER architecture and VET/SEAL specifications were
   published, 6over4 [RFC2529] specified a means for automatic tunneling
   of unicast/multicast IPv6 packets over multicast-capable IPv4
   enterprises, however it was unable to function in enterprises that
   did not support a full deployment of IPv4 multicast services.

   To address these shortcomings, ISATAP (a unicast-only variant of
   6over4) [RFC5214] was specified and widely implemented among major
   software and equipment vendor products.  ISATAP provides unicast-only
   neighbor discovery mechanisms and also adds a means for determining
   whether a node on an ISATAP interface is authorized to act as an IPv6
   router; namely, the Potential Router List (PRL).

   VET provides a functional superset of the 6over4 and ISATAP
   mechanisms; VET further combines with SEAL to provide the functional
   elements of the RANGER architecture.

4.2.  The Locator Identifier Split Protocol (LISP)

   The Locator-Identifier Split Protocol (LISP) [I-D.farinacci-lisp]
   proposes a map-and-encaps architecture for scalable routing and
   addressing within the global Internet Default Free Zone (DFZ).  LISP
   is in essence a specific manifestation of the RANGER architecture
   applied to the global Internetworking use case.  All RANGER
   architectural principles therefore apply equally to LISP.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   Communications between endpoints within different enterprise networks
   are carried across a commons that joins organizational entities with
   a mutual spirit of cooperation, but between which there may be
   competing business/sociological/political interests.  As a result,
   mechanisms that rely on feedback from routers on the path may become
   brittle or susceptible to spoofing attacks.  This is due to the fact
   that IP packets can be lost due to congestion or packet filtering
   gateways, and that the source addresses of IP packets can be forged.
   IP packets can therefore be generated by anonymous attackers, e.g.,
   from a rogue node within a third-party enterprise that has malicious
   intent toward a victim.

Internet-Draft                   RANGER                     October 2008


   Path MTU discovery is an example of a mechanism that relies on ICMP
   feedback from routers on the path, and as such is susceptible to
   these issues.  For IPv4, a common workaround is to disable Path MTU
   Discovery and let fragmentation occur in the network if it must.  For
   IPv6, lack of fragmentation support in the network precludes this
   option such that the mitigation typically recommended is to discard
   ICMP messages that contain insufficient information and/or to operate
   with the minimum IPv6 path MTU.  This example extends also to other
   mechanisms that either rely on or are enhanced by feedback from
   network devices, however attack vectors based on non-ICMP messages
   are also subject for concern.

   The RANGER architecture supports effective mitigations for attacks
   such as distributed denial-of-service, traffic amplification, etc.
   In particular, when VETand SEAL are is used, enterprise BGs can use
   the identification encoded in the SEAL header as well as ingress
   filtering to determine if a message has come from a topologically-
   correct enterprise located across the commons.  This allows
   enterprises to employ effective mitigations at their borders without
   the requirement for mutual cooperation from other enterprises.  When
   source address spoofing by nodes located within the commons is also
   subject for concern, additional securing mechanisms such as tunnel-
   mode IPsec between enterprise BGs can also be used.

   While the RANGER architecture does not in itself address security
   considerations, it proposes an architectural framework for functional
   specifications that do.  Security concerns with tunneling along with
   recommendations that are compatible with the RANGER architecture are
   found in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-tunnel-security-concerns].


7.  Related Work

   The RANGER architecture principles can be traced to the deliberations
   of the ROAD group in January 1992 [RFC1380], and likely also to other
   early works including Nimrod [RFC1753].  [RFC1955] captures the high-
   level architectural aspects of the ROAD group deliberations in a "New
   Scheme for Internet Routing and Addressing [ENCAPS] for IPNG".
