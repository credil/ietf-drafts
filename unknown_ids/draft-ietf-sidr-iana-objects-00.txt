2.  Introduction

   An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch] directs IANA [RFC2860] to issue RPKI objects for
   which it is authoritative.  This document describes the objects IANA
   will issue.

   The signed objects described here that IANA will issue are the
   unallocated, reserved, special use IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks, and
   reserved Autonomous System numbers.  These number resources are
   managed by IANA for the IETF, and thus IANA bears the responsibility
   of issuing the corresponding RPKI objects.  The reader is encouraged
   to consider the technical effects on the public routing system of the
   signed object issuance proposed for IANA in this document.

   This document does not deal with localized BGP [RFC4271] routing
   systems as those are under the policy controls of the organizations
   that operate them.  Readers are directed to Local Trust Anchor
   Management for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-ltamgmt] for a description od how to locally override
   IANA issued objects, e.g. to enable use of unallocated, reserved, and
   special use IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks in a local context.

   The direction to IANA contained herein follows the ideal that it
   should represent the perfect technical behavior in registry, and
   related registry, actions.

Internet-Draft              IANA RPKI Objects              February 2011


4.  Definitions

   Internet Number Resources (INR): The number identifiers for IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses, and for Autonomous Systems.

   IANA: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (a traditional name, used
   here to refer to the technical team making and publishing the
   assignments of Internet protocol technical parameters).  The
   technical team of IANA is currently a part of ICANN [RFC2860].

   RPKI: Resource Public Key Infrastructure.  A Public Key
   Infrastructure designed to provide a secure basis for assertions
   about holdings of Internet numeric resources.  Certificates issued
   under the RPKI contain additional attributes that identify IPv4,
   IPv6, and Autonomous System Number (ASN) resources.

   ROA: Route Origination Authorization.  A ROA is an RPKI object that
   enables the holder of the address prefix to specify an AS that is
   permitted to originate (in BGP) routes for that prefix.

   AS0 ROA: Validation of Route Origination using the Resource
   Certificate PKI and ROAs [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation] states "A ROA
   with a subject of AS0 (AS0-ROA) is an attestation by the holder of a
   prefix that the prefix described in the ROA, and any more specific
   prefix, should not be used in a routing context."

   "Not intended to be (publicly) routed": This phrase refers to
   prefixes that are not meant to be represented in the global Internet
   routing table (for example 192.168/16, [RFC1918]).

Internet-Draft              IANA RPKI Objects              February 2011


5.  Reserved Resources

   Reserved IPv4 and IPv6 resources are held back for various reasons by
   IETF action.  Generally such resources are not intended to be
   globally routed.  An example of such a reservation is 127.0.0.0/8
   [RFC5735]

   IANA should issue an AS0 ROA for all reserved IPv4 and IPv6 resources
   not intended to be routed

   There are a small number of reserved resources which are intended to
   be routed, for example 192.88.99.0/24 [RFC3068]

   IANA MUST refrain from issuing any ROAs (AS0 or otherwise) for
   reserved resources that are expected to be globally routed.

6.  Unallocated Resources

   Internet Number Resources that have not yet been allocated for
   special purposes [RFC5736], to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs),
   or to others are considered as not intended to be globally routed.

   IANA MUST issue an AS0 ROA for all Unallocated Resources.

7.  Special Purpose Registry Resources

   Special Registry Resources [RFC5736] fall into one of two categories
   in terms of routing.  Either the resource is intended to be seen in
   the global Internet routing table in some fashion, or it isn't.  An
   example of a special purpose registry INR that is intended for global
   routing is 2001:0000::/32 [RFC4380].  An example of an INR not
   intended to be seen would be 2001:002::/48 [RFC5180]

   IANA MUST refrain from issuing any ROAs (AS0 or otherwise) for
   Special Purpose Registry Resources that are intended to be globally
   routed.

   IANA MUST issue an AS0 ROA for Special Purpose Registry Resources
   that are not intended to be globally routed.

8.  Multicast

   Within the IPv4 Multicast [RFC5771] and IPv6 Multicast [RFC4291]
   registries there are a number of Multicast registrations that are not
   intended to be globally routed.

   IANA MUST issue an AS0 ROA covering the following IPv4 and IPv6
   multicast INRs:


   IPv4:
           - Local Network Control Block
              224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255 (224.0.0/24)
           - IANA Reserved portions of RESERVED
              224.1.0.0-224.1.255.255 (224.1/16)
           - RESERVED
              224.5.0.0-224.251.255.255 (251 /16s)
              225.0.0.0-231.255.255.255 (7 /8s)

   IPv6:
           - Node-Local Scope Multicast Addresses
           - Link-Local Scope Multicast Addresses

   IANA MUST refrain from issuing any ROAs (AS0 or otherwise) for any
   other multicast addresses unless directed.

9.  Informational Objects

   One informational object that can exist at a publication point of an
   RPKI repository is the Ghostbusters Record
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-ghostbusters].

   IANA MUST issue a ghostbusters object appropriate in content for the
   resources IANA maintains.

10.  Certificates and CRLs

   Before IANA can issue a ROA it MUST first establish a RPKI
   Certificate Authority (CA) that covers unallocated, reserved, and
   special use INRs by containing RFC 3379 extensions [RFC3779] for
   those corresponding number resources in the CA Certificate.  This CA
   MUST issue single use End Entity (EE) certificates for each ROA.  The
   EE certificate will conform to the Resource Certificate Profile
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] and the additional constraints specified in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format].  IANA MUST maintain a publication point
   for this CA's use and publish manifests
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-manifests] (with its corresponding EE
   certificate).  A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) will be issued
   under this CA certificate.  All objects issued by this CA will
   conform to a published Certificate Policy [I-D.ietf-sidr-cp].

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document directs IANA to issue, or refrain from issuing, the
   specific objects described here for the current set of reserved,
   unallocated, and special registry Internet Number Resources.  Further
   it MUST notify all other INR registries that RPKI objects have been
   issued for specific Internet Number Resources to avoid duplicates
   being issued thus reducing the burden on any relying party.

   This document does not alter the security profile of the RPKI from
   that already discussed in SIDR-WG documents.
