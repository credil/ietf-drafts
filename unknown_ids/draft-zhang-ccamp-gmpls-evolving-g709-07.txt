   recent documents have proposed ways to modify GMPLS signaling 
   protocols to support these new OTN features.  

   It is important that a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS 
   signaling and routing protocols. This solution must support ODUk 
   multiplexing capabilities, address all of the new features, be 
   acceptable to all equipment vendors, and be extensible considering 
   continued OTN evolution.  

   This document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) addressing ODUk multiplexing and new 
   features including ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to include Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex 
   (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and ODU), Wavelength (OCh, Lambdas) Switching, 
   and Spatial Switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port 
   or fiber). [RFC3471] presents a functional description of the 
   extensions to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling 
   required to support Generalized MPLS.  RSVP-TE-specific formats and 
   mechanisms and technology specific details are defined in [RFC3473]. 

   With the evolution and deployment of G.709 technology, it is 
   necessary that appropriate enhanced control technology support be 
   provided for G.709. [RFC4328] describes the control technology 
   details that are specific to foundation G.709 Optical Transport 
   Networks (OTN), as specified in the ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G709-
   V1], for ODUk deployments without multiplexing. 

   In addition to increasing need to support ODUk multiplexing, the 
   evolution of OTN has introduced additional containers and new 
   flexibility. For example, ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 containers and ODUflex 
   are developed in [G709-V3]. 

   In addition, the following issues require consideration: 

      -  Support for hitless adjustment of ODUflex, which is to be 
         specified in ITU-T G.hao. 

      -  Support for Tributary Port Number. The Tributary Port Number 
         has to be negotiated on each link for flexible assignment of 
         tributary ports to tributary slots in case of LO-ODU over HO-
         ODU (e.g., ODU2 into ODU3).  

   Therefore, it is clear that [RFC4328] has to be updated or superceded 
   in order to support ODUk multiplexing, as well as other ODU 
   enhancements introduced by evolution of OTN standards.  

   This document updates [RFC4328] extending the G.709 ODUk traffic 
   parameters and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible and scalable.

3. GMPLS Extensions for the Evolving G.709 - Overview 

   New features for the evolving OTN, for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 
   and ODUflex containers are specified in [G709-V3]. The corresponding 
   new signal types are summarized below: 

      - Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk): 
         . OTU4 

      - Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 
         . ODU0 
         . ODU2e 
         . ODU4 
         . ODUflex 

   A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) is also 
   described in [G709-V3]. Thus, there are now two TS granularities for 
   the foundation OTN ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers. The TS granularity 
   at 2.5 Gbps is used on legacy interfaces while the new 1.25 Gbps will 
   be used for the new interfaces. 

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4), 
   the evolving OTN [G.709-V3] encompasses the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 
   0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k > j), as described in Section 
   3.1.2 of [OTN-frwk]. 

   Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) of OPUk (OPUk-Xv, k = 1/2/3, X = 1...256) 
   are also supported by [OTN-V3]. Note that VCAT of OPU0 / OPU2e / OPU4 
   / OPUflex are not supported per [OTN-V3]. 

   [RFC4328] describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control 
   for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN) [G709-V1]. However, 
   [RFC4328] needs to be updated because it does not provide the means 
   to signal all the new signal types and related mapping and 
   multiplexing functionalities. Moreover, it supports only the 
   deprecated auto-MSI mode which assumes that the Tributary Port Number 
   is automatically assigned in the transmit direction and not checked 
   in the receive direction. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and presents a new OTN label format which is very flexible 
   and scalable. Additionally, procedures about Tributary Port Number 
   assignment through control plane are also provided in this document.

4. Extensions for Traffic Parameters for the Evolving G.709 

   The traffic parameters for G.709 are defined as follows: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |  Signal Type  |   Tolerance   |              NMC              | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |              NVC              |        Multiplier (MT)        | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                            Bit_Rate                           | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The Signal Type should be extended to cover the new Signal Type 
   introduced by the evolving OTN. The new Signal Type is extended as 
   follows: 

      Value    Type 
      -----    ---- 
      0        Not significant 
      1        ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps) 
      2        ODU2 (i.e., 10 Gbps) 
      3        ODU3 (i.e., 40 Gbps) 
      4        ODU4 (i.e., 100 Gbps) 
      5        Reserved (for future use) 
      6        OCh at 2.5 Gbps 
      7        OCh at 10 Gbps 
      8        OCh at 40 Gbps 
      9        OCh at 100 Gbps 
      10~19    Reserved (for future use) 
      20       ODU0 (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 
      21~30    Reserved (for future use) 
      31       ODU2e (i.e., 10Gbps for FC1200 and GE LAN) 
      32       ODUflex(GFP) (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      33       ODUflex(CBR) (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      34~255   Reserved (for future use) 

    

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields are used 
   together to represent the actual bandwidth of ODUflex, where:

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-07.txt                 March 2011 


   -  The Bit_Rate field indicates the nominal bit rate of ODUflex(CBR) 
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number 
      (referring to [RFC4506] and [IEEE]). 

   -  The Tolerance field indicates the bit rate tolerance (part per 
      million, ppm) of the ODUflex(CBR) encoded as an unsigned integer, 
      which is bounded in 0~100ppm. 

   For example, for an ODUflex(CBR) service with Bit_Rate = 2.5Gbps and 
   Tolerance = 100ppm, the actual bandwidth of the ODUflex is: 

              2.5Gbps * (1 - 100ppm) ~ 2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) 

   In case of other ODUk signal types, the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields 
   are not necessary and MUST be filled with 0. 

   The usage of the NMC, NVC and Multiplier (MT) fields are the same as 
   [RFC4328]. 

4.1. Usage of ODUflex(CBR) Traffic Parameter 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the information of Bit_Rate and Tolerance in 
   the ODUflex traffic parameter is used to determine the total number 
   of tributary slots N in the HO ODUk link to be reserved. Here:  

         N = Ceiling of 

   ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate * (1 + ODUflex(CBR) bit rate tolerance) 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
       ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

    
   Therefore, a node receiving a Path message containing ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter can allocate precise number of tributary slots and 
   set up the cross-connection for the ODUflex service. 

   The table below shows the actual bandwidth of the tributary slot of 
   ODUk (in Gbps), referring to [G709-V3]. 

      ODUk       Minimum          Nominal          Maximum 
      ------------------------------------------------------- 
      ODU2    1.249 384 632    1.249 409 620    1.249 434 608 
      ODU3    1.254 678 635    1.254 703 729    1.254 728 823 
      ODU4    1.301 683 217    1.301 709 251    1.301 735 285

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-07.txt                 March 2011 


      Note that: 

      Minimum bandwidth of ODUTk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

    
      Maximum bandwidth of ODTUk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 + HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

      Where: HO OPUk bit rate tolerance = 20ppm 

   For different ODUk, the bandwidths of the tributary slot are 
   different, and so the total number of tributary slots to be reserved 
   for the ODUflex(CBR) may not be the same on different HO ODUk links. 
   This is why the traffic parameter should bring the actual bandwidth 
   information other than the NMC field. 

    

4.2. Example of ODUflex(CBR) Traffic Parameter 

   This section gives an example to illustrate the usage of ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter. 

   As shown in Figure 1, assume there is an ODUflex(CBR) service 
   requesting a bandwidth of (2.5Gbps, +/-100ppm) from node A to node C. 
   In other words, the ODUflex traffic parameter indicates that Signal 
   Type is 33 (ODUflex(CBR)), Bit_Rate is 2.5Gbps and Tolerance is 
   100ppm.

   -  On the HO ODU4 link between node A and B: 

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 
      100ppm), and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU4 
      equals 1.301 683 217Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots 
      N1 to be reserved on this link is: 

      N1 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.301 683 217) = 2 

   -  On the HO ODU2 link between node B and C: 

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 
      100ppm), and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU2 
      equals 1.249 384 632Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots 
      N2 to be reserved on this link is: 

      N2 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.249 384 632) = 3 

    

5. Generalized Label 

   [RFC3471] has defined the Generalized Label which extends the 
   traditional label by allowing the representation of not only labels 
   which travel in-band with associated data packets, but also labels 
   which identify time-slots, wavelengths, or space division multiplexed 
   positions. The format of the corresponding RSVP-TE Generalized Label   
   object is defined in the Section 2.3 of [RFC3473]. 

   However, for different technologies, we usually need use specific 
   label rather than the Generalized Label. For example, the label 
   format described in [RFC4606] could be used for SDH/SONET, the label 
   format in [RFC4328] for G.709. 

   In this document, a new ODUk label format is defined, the information 
   model of which is described in Section 4.10 of [OTN-info]. 

5.1. New definition of ODUk Label  

   In order to be compatible with new types of ODU signal and new types 
   of tributary slot, the following new ODUk label format is defined:

   In case of LO ODUj mapped into OTUk (j=k), this field is not 
   necessary and should be ignored. 

   TPN (16 bits): indicates the Tributary Port Number (TPN) for the 
   assigned Tributary Slot(s).  

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, only the 
         lower 6 bits of TPN field is significant and the other bits of 
         TPN MUST be set to 0. 

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU4, only the lower 7 
         bits of TPN field is significant and the other bits of TPN MUST 
         be set to 0.  

      -  In case of ODUj mapped into OTUk (j=k), the TPN is not needed 
         and this field MUST be set to 0. 

   As per [G709-V3], The TPN is used to allow for correct demultiplexing 
   in the data plane. When an LO ODUj is multiplexed into HO ODUk 
   occupying one or more TSs, a new TPN value is configured at the two 
   end of the HO ODUk link and is put into the related MSI byte(s) in 
   the OPUk overhead at the (traffic) ingress end of the link, so that 
   the other end of the link can learn which TS(s) is/are used by the LO 
   ODUj in the data plane. 

   According to [G709-V3], the rules of TPN assignment should be as the 
   following tables:

   Note that in the case of "Flexible", the value of TPN is not relevant 
   to the TS number as per [G709-V3].  

   Bit Map (variable): indicates which tributary slots in HO ODUk that 
   the LO ODUj will be multiplexed into. The sequence of the Bit Map is 
   consistent with the sequence of the tributary slots in HO ODUk. Each 
   bit in the bit map represents the corresponding tributary slot in HO 
   ODUk with a value of 1 or 0 indicating whether the tributary slot 
   will be used by LO ODUj or not. 

   The size of the bit map equals to the total number of the tributary 
   slots of HO ODUk, which is deduced by the ODU(T)k and T fields. 

   In case of an ODUk mapped into OTUk, it's no need to indicate which 
   tributary slots will be used, so the size of Bit Map is 0. 

   Padded bits are added behind the Bit Map to make the whole label a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary. Padded bit MUST be set to 0 and 
   MUST be ignored.

5.2. Examples  

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the label 
   format described in the previous sections of this document. 

   (1) ODUk into OTUk mapping:  

   In such conditions, the downstream node along an LSP returns a label 
   indicating that the ODU1 (ODU2 or ODU3 or ODU4) is directly mapped 
   into the corresponding OTU1 (OTU2 or OTU3 or ODU4). The following 
   example label indicates an ODU1 mapped into OTU1.

   (2) ODUj into ODUk multiplexing:  

   In such conditions, this label indicates that an ODUj is multiplexed 
   into several tributary slots of OPUk and then mapped into OTUk. Some 
   instances are shown as follow: 

   -  ODU0 into ODU2 Multiplexing: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   This above label indicates an ODU0 multiplexed into the second 
   tributary slot of ODU2, wherein the type of the tributary slot is 
   1.25Gbps, and the TPN value is 2. 

   -  ODU1 into ODU2 Multiplexing with 1.25Gbps TS granularity:

   This above label indicates an ODU2 multiplexed into the 2nd, 3rd, 5th 
   and 7th tributary slot of ODU3, wherein the type of the tributary 
   slot is 2.5Gbps, and the TPN value is 1. 

5.3. Label Distribution Procedure 

   This document does not change the existing label distribution 
   procedures [RFC4328] for GMPLS except that the new ODUk label should 
   be processed as follows. 

   When a node receives a generalized label request for setting up an 
   ODUj LSP from its upstream neighbor node, the node should generate an 
   ODU label according to the signal type of the requested LSP and the 
   free resources (i.e., free tributary slots of ODUk) that will be 
   reserved for the LSP, and send the label to its upstream neighbor 
   node.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then set the bits to 1 in 
   the Bit Map field corresponding to the reserved tributary slots. The 
   node should also assign a valid TPN, which does not collided with 
   other TPN value used by existing LO ODU connections in the selected 
   HO ODU link, and configure the expected multiplex structure 
   identifier (ExMSI) using this TPN. Then, the assigned TPN is filled 
   into the label. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the node only needs to fill the ODUj 
   and the ODUk fields with corresponding values in the label. Other 
   bits are reserved and MUST be set to 0.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-07.txt                 March 2011 


   When receiving an ODU label from its downstream neighbor node, the 
   node should learn which ODU signal type is multiplexed or mapped into 
   which ODU signal type by analyzing the ODUj and the ODUk fields.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then obtain which tributary 
   slots in ODUk are reserved by its downstream neighbor node according 
   to the position of the bits that are set to 1 in the Bit Map field, 
   so that the node can multiplex the ODUj into the reserved tributary 
   slots of ODUk after the LSP is established. The node should also get 
   the TPN value assigned by its downstream neighbor node from the label, 
   and fill the TPN into the related MSI byte(s) in the OPUk overhead in 
   the data plane, so that the downstream neighbor node can check 
   whether the TPN received from the data plane is consistent with the 
   ExMSI and determine whether there is any mismatch defect. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the size of Bit Map field is 0 and 
   no additional procedure is needed. 

   Note that the procedures of other label related objects (e.g., 
   Upstream Label, Label Set) are similar as described above. 

   Note also that the TPN in the label_ERO may not be assigned (i.e., 
   TPN field = 0) if the TPN is requested to be assigned locally.  

5.3.1. Notification on Label Error 

   When receiving an ODUk label from the neighbor node, the node should 
   check the integrity of the label. An error message containing an 
   "Unacceptable label value" indication ([RFC3209]) should be sent if 
   one of the following cases occurs: 

   -  The ODUj field does not match with the Traffic Parameters; 

   -  The OD(T)Uk field does not match with the type of the selected 
      link;  

   -  The selected link only supports 2.5Gbps TS granularity while the T 
      field in the label indicates the 1.25Gbps TS granularity; 

   -  The label includes an invalid TPN value that breaks the TPN 
      assignment rules; 

   -  Not enough bits of Bit Map, or Bit Map with non-zero padding bits;

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-07.txt                 March 2011 


   -  The reserved resources (i.e., the number of "1" in the Bit Map 
      field) do not match with the Traffic Parameters. 

5.4. Supporting Virtual Concatenation and Multiplication 

   As per [VCAT], the VCGs can be created using Co-Signaled style or 
   Multiple LSPs style. 

   In case of Co-Signaled style, the explicit ordered list of all labels 
   reflects the order of VCG members, which is similar to [RFC4328]. In 
   case of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (NVC > 1), the 
   first label indicates the components of the first virtually 
   concatenated signal; the second label indicates the components of the 
   second virtually concatenated signal; and so on. In case of 
   multiplication of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (MT > 1), 
   the first label indicates the components of the first multiplexed 
   virtually concatenated signal; the second label indicates components 
   of the second multiplexed virtually concatenated signal; and so on. 

   In case of Multiple LSPs style, multiple control plane LSPs are 
   created with a single VCG and the VCAT Call can be used to associate 
   the control plane LSPs. The procedures are similar to section 6 of 
   [VCAT]. 

5.5. Supporting Multiplexing Hierarchy 

   As described in [OTN-FRWK], one ODUj connection can be nested into 
   another ODUk (j<k) connection, which forms the multiplexing hierarchy 
   in the ODU layer. This is useful if there are some intermediate nodes 
   in the network which only support ODUk but not ODUj switching. 

   For example, in Figure 2, assume that N3 is a legacy node which only 
   supports [G709-V1] and does not support ODU0 switching. If an ODU0 
   connection between N1 and N5 is required, then we can create an ODU2 
   connection between N2 and N4 (or ODU1 / ODU3 connection, depending on 
   policies and the capabilities of the two ends of the connection), and 
   nest the ODU0 into the ODU2 connection. In this way, N3 only needs to 
   perform ODU2 switching and does not need to be aware of the inner 
   ODU0.

               Figure 2 - Example of multiplexing hierarchy 

   The control plane signaling should support the provisioning of 
   hierarchical multiplexing. Two methods are provided below (taking 
   Figure 2 as example): 

   -  The outer ODU2 connection is created in advance based on network 
      planning, which is treated as a Forwarding Adjacency (FA). Then 
      the inner ODU0 can be created using the resource of the ODU2 FA. 
      In this case, the outer ODU2 and inner ODU0 connections are 
      created separately, and the normal ODU connection creation 
      procedure described in this document can be used. 

   -  Using the multi-layer network signaling described in [RFC4206], 
      [RFC6107] and [RFC6001] (including related modifications, if 
      needed). That is, when the signaling message for ODUO connection 
      arrives at N2, a new RSVP session between N2 and N4 is triggered 
      to create the ODU2 connection. This ODU2 connection is treated as 
      an FA after it is created. And then the signaling procedure for 
      the ODU0 connection can be continued using the resource of the 
      ODU2 FA. 

    

5.6. Control Plane Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   Since the [RFC4328] has been deployed in the network for the nodes 
   that support [G709-V1] (herein we call them "legacy nodes"), backward 
   compatibility SHOULD be taken into consideration when the new nodes 
   (i.e., nodes that support [G709-V3]) and the legacy nodes are 
   interworking. 

   For backward compatibility consideration, the new node SHOULD have 
   the ability to generate and parse legacy labels.

   o  For the legacy node, it always generates and sends legacy label to 
      its upstream node, no matter the upstream node is new or legacy, 
      as described in [RFC4328]. 

   o  For the new node, it will generate and send legacy label if its 
      upstream node is a legacy one, and generate and send new label if 
      its upstream node is a new one. 

   One backwards compatibility example is shown in Figure 3:

                Figure 3 - Backwards compatibility example 

   As described above, for backward compatibility considerations, it is 
   necessary for a new node to know whether the neighbor node is new or 
   legacy. 

   One optional method is manual configuration. But it is recommended to 
   use LMP to discover the capability of the neighbor node automatically, 
   as described in [OTN-LMP].  

   When performing the HO ODU link capability negotiation: 

   o  If the neighbor node only support the 2.5Gbps TS and only support 
      ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, the neighbor node should be treated as a legacy 
      node. 

   o  If the neighbor node can support the 1.25Gbps TS, or can support 
      other LO ODU types defined in [G709-V3]), the neighbor node should 
      be treated as new node. 

   o  If the neighbor node returns a LinkSummaryNack message including 
      an ERROR_CODE indicating nonsupport of HO ODU link capability 
      negotiation, the neighbor node should be treated as a legacy node.

6. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations to the 
   existing GMPLS signaling protocols. Referring to [RFC3473], further 
   details of the specific security measures are provided. Additionally, 
   [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and 
   protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control plane. 

    

7. IANA Considerations 

   -  G.709 SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects: 

       The traffic parameters, which are carried in the G.709 
       SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects, do not require any new object 
       class and type based on [RFC4328]: 

       o  G.709 SENDER_TSPEC Object: Class = 12, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

       o  G.709 FLOWSPEC Object: Class = 9, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

   -  Generalized Label Object: 

       The new defined ODU label (session 5) is a kind of generalized 
       label. Therefore, the Class-Num and C-Type of the ODU label is 
       the same as that of generalized label described in [RFC3473], 
       i.e., Class-Num = 16, C-Type = 2.
