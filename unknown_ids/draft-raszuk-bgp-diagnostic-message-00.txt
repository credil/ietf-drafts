Abstract

   BGP protocol lacks self diagnostic tools which would allow for
   monitoring and detection of any possible bgp state database
   differences between BGP_RIB_Out of the sender and BGP_RIB_In of the
   receiver over BGP peering session.  It also lacks of build in
   mechanism to inform peer about subset of prefixes received over
   session which experienced some errors and which per protocol
   specification either resulted in attribute drop or "treat-as-
   withdraw" action.

   The intention of this document is to start a new class of work which
   will make BGP protocol and therefor assuring services constructed
   with the help of BGP protocol to become much more reliable and
   robust.

Internet-Draft           bgp-diagnostic-message             October 2010


1.  Introduction

   In this document we will first define a new diagnostic communication
   channel in the form of new BGP message then construct the set of
   basic message encoding to be used for simple diagnostic self test
   routines periodically exchanged between BGP speakers.  We will also
   define set of other TLVs which can be very useful in precise
   description of prefixes affected by various cases of BGP session
   malfunctions.

   The goal of this document is to provide the background which will in
   turn allow for very easy extensibility once new needs and new BGP
   diagnostic ideas surface.


2.  Applications

   Authors would like to propose four main applications which BGP
   Diagnostic TLVs are designed to address.  New TLVs can be easily
   added to enhance further current applications or to propose new
   applications.

   The set of TLVs is organized in the following application groups:

      General TLVs used for operational purposes of the described
      mechanism.

      Set of TLVs designed to carry information about BGP state across
      BGP peers that include per neighbor counters and global counters.
      There are two modes this functionality can be used - on demand by
      explicit query as well as periodic in an automated mode.  The
      scope of messages is to be able to operate both on the iBGP as
      well as eBGP boundaries.  It is in the control of the operator to
      decide which set of information would be send to a given set of
      peers.

      Messages which operate in an automated push mode (as long as peer
      negotiated listen capability for them) and are designed to inform
      BGP peer on the list of impacted NLRIs which were received along
      with malformed attribute or within malformed update message.

      Following recommendation from MP-BGP4 RFC4760 next group of
      messages are used to indicate which AFI/SAFIs were disabled for
      any further processing by BGP peer due to detection of an
      incorrect attribute present in the BGP Update message.

      In number of troubleshooting efforts in real networks it is often
      very helpful to verify state of a given prefix in the neighboring

      router's BGP database.  This is particularly useful on the EBGP
      boundaries where there is no CLI/SNMP access to the router.
      Authors define a new way of query peer's BGP for the state of
      particular prefix.

      Last set of messages is an attempt to allow for intra-domain
      better analysis of the BGP best path selection tie break
      decisions.


3.  BGP diagnostic message

   When defining any self test tool the critical element is to find a
   right separation balance between the test object and testing
   instruments.

   For the vast majority of real BGP issues found in the life production
   networks authors believe that the right balance is the definition of
   new BGP message which could be exchanged along with any negotiated
   AFI/SAFI between those BGP speakers which will during initial OPEN
   message exchange new BGP diagnostic message capability.

   The two extreme alternatives which were considered were the
   definition of new BGP attribute which may inherit and share potential
   issues of given BGP address family it is designed to diagnose and on
   the other extreme to build a separate and independent network
   diagnostic protocol.  The use of BGP message seems to provide
   sufficient isolation from any service address family and is much
   easier to deploy then enabling an entire new intra and inter-domain
   protocol.  Another very important issue with using any other protocol
   for detection of potential differences of BGP databases state is lack
   of synchronization with BGP UPDATE messages.  This alone in the
   continuously churning BGP environment would not allow for any
   benefit.

3.1.  BGP DIAGNOSTIC Message Encoding

   BGP message as defined in RFC 4271 consists of a fixed-size header
   followed by two octet length field and one octet of type value.  RFC
   4271 limits maximum message size to 4096 octets.  As one of the
   applications of BGP Diagnostic message is to be able to carry entire
   potentially malformed BGP message this specification extends the
   maximum size of BGP Diagnostic message to be always 128 octets bigger
   then any other BGP Message.  Considering the current RFC 4271 maximum
   BGP message size to be 4096 octets maximum size of BGP diagnostic
   message would be 4224 octets.

   For the purpose of diagnostic message information encoding we will

   use one or more Type-Length-Value containers where each TLV will have
   the following format:



      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |             Type              |             Length            |

     |                     Variable size TLV value                   |

   Type  -  2 octet value indicating the TLV type
   Length - 2 octet value indicating the TLV length in octets
   Value -  Variable length value field depending on the type of
            the TLVs carried.

   To work around continued BGP churn issue some types of TLVs will need
   to contain a sequence number to correlate request with associated to
   it replies.  The sequence number will consist of 8 octets and will be
   of form: 4 octet bgp_router_id + local 4 octet number.  When local 4
   octet number reaches 0xFFFF it should restart from 0x0000.

   Typical application scenario for use of sequence number is to include
   it in the diagnostic request message and during reply to copy it into
   reply messages triggered by such request message.

     Use: Allows for troubleshooting purposes to share list of
          route targets installed for a given AFI/SAFI towards
          indicated BGP peer. In the event that RT filtering
          table size will not fit in single BGP Diagnostic
          Message reply the subsequent reply should include
          the same sequence number.


4.  Operation

   BGP implementation which supports DIAGNOSTIC message can support all
   or subset of defined diagnostic types.  The range of supported TLV
   types will be signaled in the new BGP capability message during BGP
   connection establishment phase.

   The operation of this extension can be realized on a pool/query based
   or push based principles.  An implementation may provide, a timer to
   periodically send selected Diagnostic types TLVs to the peer or to
   the management station.




Raszuk, et al.           Expires April 20, 2011                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           bgp-diagnostic-message             October 2010


   Similarly BGP peer may periodically or by manual cli request the
   reception of selected or all of the defined diagnostic TLV types.

   The received values are then compared against local counters.  When
   discrepancy is found operator is alarmed and further analysis should
   follow.  The repair actions is out of scope of this document.

   Example:

   Under some situations when determined that the discrepancy is
   detected an automated or manual Route Refresh message can be
   triggered with it's extension for Start_of_Refresh and End_of_Refresh
   markers .  That would allow for purge of any stalled data across two
   BGP databases.

   An important point which needs to be discussed is the exchange of
   counter's values in light of continued BGP churn presence.  As BGP is
   never stable it is expected that any sort of described counters will
   also be subject to continues value change making any comparison of
   their values questionable.

   There are three classes of counters defined in this document: sent
   counters, received counters and current table state counters.

   Only "sent" counters can be used for not correlated comparison and
   problem detection between any two BGP speakers.  They are not subject
   to BGP churn issue due to the fact that DIAGNOSTIC messages would be
   exchanged inline with BGP UPDATE messages on a given session.  An
   implementation must be able to freeze the received counters when
   comparing or displaying the received "sent" counters from BGP peer.

   Received counters send in the Diagnostic messages are only meaningful
   in the context of explicit request trigger situation generated by the
   BGP speaker.  BGP speaker should stop transmitting any BGP message of
   a given AFI/SAFI or freeze corresponding counter after sending
   diagnostic message request to the peer and before reception of actual
   diagnostic message reply.  In order to correlate diagnostic message
   requests with associated replies use of build in sequence numbers is
   provided.

   Table state counters (for example number of BGP RIB entries) are
   exchanged only for informational reasons and they should not be
   subject to comparison with any local counter values.


5.  Capability negotiation

   A BGP speaker that is willing to send or receive the BGP DIAGNOSTIC

   Messages from its peer should advertise the new DIAGNOSTIC Messages
   Capability to the peer using BGP Capabilities advertisement [BGP-
   CAP].  A BGP speaker may send a DIAGNOSTIC message to its peer only
   if it has received the DIAGNOSTIC message capability from its peer.

   The Capability Code for this capability is specified in the IANA
   Considerations section of this document.

   The Capability Length field of this capability is 2 octets.  The
   Capability Value field consists of reserved flags field.



                      +------------------------------+
                      | Capability Code (1 octet)    |
                      +------------------------------+
                      | Capability Length (1 octet)  |

6.  Security considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a type code for the DIAGNOSTIC message
   from the BGP Message Types registry, as well as requesting a type
   code for the new Diagnostic Message Capability negotiation from BGP
   Capability Codes registry.

   This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   named: "DIAGNOSTIC Message Type Values".  The reserved types are:
   0x0000 0xFFFF.  The allocation policy is on a first come first served
   basis.

   This document makes the following assignments for the DIAGNOSTIC
   Message Type Values:
