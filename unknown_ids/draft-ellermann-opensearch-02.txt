          The application/opensearchdescription+xml media type
                     draft-ellermann-opensearch-02

Abstract

   This draft suggests to register the
   application/opensearchdescription+xml media type for OpenSearch
   descriptions.  Atom and XHTML <link rel="search" .../> elements are
   examples where this media type is used.

Internet-Draft           OpenSearch Description             October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft suggests to register the
   application/opensearchdescription+xml media type for OpenSearch
   descriptions.  Atom and XHTML <link rel="search" .../> elements are
   examples where this media type is used.

   It can be discussed in <http://groups.google.com/group/opensearch> or
   on the <mailto:ietf-types@iana.org> mailing list.  Because this draft
   is not (more) intended to be published as RFC the normative and
   informative references are actually only "further readings".

2.  Security Considerations

   See below (Section 3).  There used to be a way to create "not for
   RFC" Internet drafts with xml2rfc, this section is required for
   strict="yes" processing.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Below you find the [RFC4288] registraton template for the subtype
   "opensearchdescription+xml" of the "application" media type under
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/>:

   Type name:        application

   Subtype name:     opensearchdescription+xml

   Required parameters:
                     There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:
                     charset (defaults to "UTF-8")

   Encoding considerations:
                     Identical to those of "application/xml" as
                     described in [RFC3023]; especially "UTF-8"
                     [RFC3629] and its proper subset "US-ASCII" are
                     supposed to work.

                     For non-ASCII documents served as "text/xml" the
                     "charset" parameter is required; this might be
                     relevant when authors are unable to configure the
                     server hosting their OSD (OpenSearch Description
                     document).

   Security considerations:
                     All general security and privacy considerations for
                     sending queries to servers specified in an URL are
                     applicable.

                     Where clients support the optional update feature
                     in OSDs it affects the privacy of users.

                     The EcmaScript API AddSearchProvider() typically
                     enforces a "same origin" policy for the OSD; the
                     URL element within the OSD can designate a third
                     party as search provider.

                     An OSD can claim to be a search description for X,
                     but actually do something else.

   Interoperability considerations:
                     OpenSearch descriptions use the
                     <http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/> XML name
                     space, optionally in conjunction with other XML
                     name spaces for extensions or for application
                     specific purposes.

   Published specification:
                     <http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/1.1/>

   Applications that use this media type:
                     Various Web browsers, search engines, and software
                     libraries support OSDs.  The "search" link relation
                     is used on many Web pages with this media type.

                     The EcmaScript API AddSearchProvider() documented
                     for WhatWG HTML uses this media type.

   Additional information:
                     OSDs have no "magic numbers" as defined in RFC
                     4288.  There are no special "common file name
                     extensions" for OSDs, OSDs are XML documents.  If
                     specific extensions are desired the conventional
                     ".osdx" or ".a9.xml" might do the trick.

4.  Acknowledgments

   As always John Klensin is an inspiration for all kinds of "process
   experiments" not limited to [RFC3933] and [RFC4897].  Thanks to Mark
   Nottingham for registering the "search" link relation, to Ian Hickson
   for documenting window.external.AddSearchProvider() in [WhatWG] HTML,
   to Sam Ruby for validating OSDs at <http://feedvalidator.org/>, and
   to DeWitt Clinton for specifying [OpenSearch] with the OpenSearch
   community.

   Thanks also to Henrik Levkowetz, Julian Reschke, and the "happy IANA"
   folks.

Appendix A.  Document History

   Changes in version 02 (2011):

   *  Plan B:  Nobody is going to write an RFC for this media type;
      especially nobody is going to create a formal XML DTD or similar
      definition above what is already documented in the OpenSearch 1.1
      specification.

   *  [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header] replaced by [RFC5988].  Removed
      the registration of link relation "search", because that already
      happened based on [RFC5988].

   *  Removed everything related to RFCXXXX, this draft is not more
      intended to be published as RFC.

   *  Updated the credits.  Populated the "TBD" placeholders in the
      template Section 3.

   Changes in version 01 (2008):

Internet-Draft           OpenSearch Description             October 2011


   *  Move registry cleanup from Section 5 to the (hopefully) next
      [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].

   *  Adopt registration template in [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header]
      replacing the similar [RFC4287] template.

   *  Some background info with examples parked in the introduction.

   Initial version:

   *  This is a kind of template that could be extended to register
      rel="search" and application/opensearchdescription+xml if the
      OpenSearch community likes this approach.

   *  The change controller for a media type in the standards tree has
      to be a SDO (Standards Development Organization) recognized by the
      IESG or IAB on behalf of the IETF community, not necessarily the
      IETF itself.

   *  For atom:link relations IESG review is good enough.  Informational
      IETF RFCs are approved by the IESG in a "document action", this
      would trigger the IANA considerations in Section 3.
