Abstract

   When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP then
   problems occur with E.164 number ownership.  Additionally, there are
   security challenges when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticate

   and authorize the calling party.  Without addressing these two
   aspects the overall security story is weak or non-existent.  This
   document aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however, not
   investigate current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 ("SIP
   Identity").  Such an analysis is provided by other documents already.

Internet-Draft      E.164 Ownership Problem Statement      February 2008


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4474 [3] defines a mechanism whereby an authentication service
   asserts the identity of a SIP UAC and determines whether he or she is
   authorized to use that identity.  The authentication service then
   computes a hash over some particular headers, including the From
   header field and the bodies in the message.  This hash is signed with
   the certificate for the domain and inserted in the 'Identity' header
   field in the SIP message.  The proxy also inserts a companion header
   field, Identity-Info, that tells the verifying party how to acquire
   its certificate, in case it is not yet known already.

   When the verifier receives the SIP message, it verifies the signature
   provided in the Identity header, and thus can determine whether the
   domain indicated by the host portion of the AoR in the From header
   field authenticated the user, and permitted the user to assert that
   From header field value.

   The use of phone numbers with SIP was introduced with the TEL URL
   scheme [5] whereby domain names were not used with the phone numbers.
   SIP URIs always have domain names.  In SIP [2], a translation between
   SIP URIs and TEL URLs is described: when translating from a SIP URI
   to a TEL URL, the domain name from the SIP URI is simply dropped.
   When translating in the other direction (or simply generating a SIP
   URI from an E.164 number [13]) it is not clear how to populate the
   domain name.

   When SIP Identity [3] is applied to E.164 numbers then there is the
   question what the identity assertion actually means.  Additionally,
   the usage of the domain for an E.164 number causes problems, as
   described in [7].  This document will, however, not focus on this
   aspect.  Instead, we investigate the overall end-to-end security
   story and the ownership problem for E.164 numbers.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  The End-to-End Picture

   Consider Figure 1 where two end points, Bob and Joe, initiate calls
   to Alice.  Alice is using an IP-based phone and the same is true for

   Joe. The call of Joe and Bob towards Alice traverse the PSTN; Bob is
   using a PSTN phone and the call enters the Internet via a PSTN/VoIP
   gateway.  Joe's call traverses the PSTN, for example, because Joe's
   VoIP provider does not have a peering agreement with the called party
   domain and uses the PSTN as a way to interconnect VoIP networks.
   This is a common way of interacting between VoIP providers today.

   Figure 1 raises two important questions:

   1.  How does the authentication service (for example an entity that
       is co-located with the PSTN/VoIP gateway) authenticate and
       authorize the calling party?
   2.  How does the verification service determine ownership of an E.164
       number?

   Section 4 investigates the first question in more detail whereas
   Section 5 addresses the second question.


4.  Authenticating and Authorizing the Calling Party Identity

   RFC 4474 rightfully makes some important assumptions about the
   behavior of the authentication service that contribute significantly
   to the security of the overall system.  While some assumptions seem
   to be obvious for SIP usage, they are less obvious when considering
   them in relationship with a PSTN interworking.  Section 4 of [3]
   says:

      "The authentication service authenticates Alice (possibly by
      sending a Digest authentication challenge) and validates that she
      is authorized to assert the identity that is populated in the From
      header field.  This value may be Alice's AoR, or it may be some
      other value that the policy of the proxy server permits her to
      use.

      ...

      The proxy, as the holder of the private key of its domain, is
      asserting that the originator of this request has been
      authenticated and that she is authorized to claim the identity
      (the SIP address- of-record) that appears in the From header
      field.  "

   The crutial question therefore is: In the generic case is the
   authentication service able to authenticate the caller-ID used in the
   PSTN and to authorize it's usage?

   There are problems with this step:

   1.  The PSTN builds on a walled garden with a chain-of-trust security
       model.  This is "nice" as long as the participating parties are
       indeed honest.  Unfortunately, this is not true anymore (and has
       not been the case for a long time already) [add-references-to-
       examples].  Caller-ID spoofing is common and even transit
       providers are not trustworthy either.

Internet-Draft      E.164 Ownership Problem Statement      February 2008


   2.  A call originated on the PSTN is often times routed to a PSTN/
       VoIP gateway.  That PSTN gateway is operated by the owner of the
       called number, rather than the owner of the calling number.


5.  Verifying Ownership: What does it mean?

   Imagine a verification service at Alice's VoIP provider network
   receives a SIP message with an 'Identity' and an 'Identity-Info'
   header.

   How would this verification service determine whether the signer of
   the message is indeed authorized to claim ownership?

   Ownership is an artificial construct but one could compare it with an
   oracle that returns the name of a domain when asked who is
   authoritative for using a particular E.164 number.

   There are various owership verification steps that got used in the
   IETF within other protocols.  RFC 4474 [3], for example, uses the
   following verification step for SIP URIs:

      "6.  Verifier Behavior

      Step 2:


      The verifier MUST follow the process described in Section 13.4 to
      determine if the signer is authoritative for the URI in the From
      header field.

      13.4.  Domain Names and Subordination


      When a verifier processes a request containing an Identity-Info
      header, it must compare the domain portion of the URI in the From
      header field of the request with the domain name that is the
      subject of the certificate acquired from the Identity-Info
      header."

   This is a concept of referential integrity where information of the
   protocol (in this case the identity) is matched against information
   from the certificate.  Still, the signer and the verifier need to
   have a trust anchor in common.  There are additional aspects about
   the detailed matching procedure that are described in Section 13.4 of
   [3].

   Unfortunately, this simple authorization check cannot be used with



Schwartz, et al.         Expires August 21, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      E.164 Ownership Problem Statement      February 2008


   E.164 numbers because of the missing domain concept in the identifier
   itself and because of number portability.

   A couple of other ownership approaches have been used in IETF
   protocols.  A few examples below:

   Return Routability Check:  A form of check is to exploit the
      topological properties of identifier routing and the possible
      placements of adversaries with respect to a certain message
      interaction.  RRT and various other forms fall into that category.
      An example can be found in [9].

   Authorization Certificates:

      A form of check is to use authorization certificates.  The basic
      idea is that one would trust the entity that creates the
      authorization certificate (most likely in a hierarchical form)
      then you also trust its content.  SIP-SAML (see [8]) and [12]
      belong to this category.  When the identity of the certificate is
      constructed in a suitable way then together with a delegated
      signing the same effect could be accomplished.

   Distributed Databases:

      Another form of mechanism is to use an out-of-band database
      lookup, for example using the DNS, in order to verify that the
      entity which uses the private key for creating the SIP Identity
      header is authorized to attach the corresponding public key to the
      this distributed database.  The identity would be used for the
      lookup to the database and the security of the system relies on
      ensuring that only those entities add the public key that are also
      owner of the corresponding E.164 number.  An example of such an
      approach can be found in [15].  The usage of TRIP [11] (with
      extensions with information about E.164 numbers that are
      authorized for usage by a specific provider) has been discussed as
      well.

   Cryptographic Addresses and Hash Chains:

      These mechanisms utilize a temporal property by creating a binding
      between the public key (or values from a hash chain) and the
      identity be verified by re-computing the hash value and by
      comparing the hash with the identifier.  These mechanisms have
      found some excitment with protocol work at lower layers (see, for
      example, [10]).

   It is quite obvious that each mechanism has different scalability,
   security and deployment properties.

6.  Security Considerations

   With the work on this subject it is important to keep two quotes in
   mind:

   o  "The security of a system is as good as the weakest link."
   o  "If you think cryptography is the solution to your problem, you
      don't know what your problem is." --- Roger Needham

   We are still in an early phase to properly understand the problem
   domain even though there are a couple of TECHNICAL solution proposals
   available to address the ownership question.  These technical
   approaches do, however, not help when there is no deployment
   incentives.  These approaches also do not help with the security of
   the overall system when the identity of the calling party cannot be
   verified by the authentication service.

   As such, it is too early to conclusively argue that an RFC 4474 alike
   authentication service should actually attempt to offer a solution
   for E.164 numbers even though they are heavily used in today's
   networks.
