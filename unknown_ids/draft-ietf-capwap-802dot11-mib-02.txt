Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB          October 2008


1.  Introduction

   The CAPWAP Protocol [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-specification] defines
   a standard, interoperable protocol, which enables an Access
   Controller (AC) to manage a collection of Wireless Termination
   Points(WTPs).  CAPWAP supports the use of various wireless
   technologies by the WTPs, with one being specified in the 802.11
   binding document [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].

   This document defines a MIB module that can be used to manage CAPWAP
   implementations for IEEE 802.11 wireless binding.  This MIB module
   covers both configuration for WLAN and a way to reuse the MIBs
   defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   CAPWAP Protocol specification for 802.11 binding
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].  Besides terminology
   defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard and CAPWAP specification, an
   important conception is WLAN service.  In the document, WLAN service
   refers to a logical component instantiated on a WTP device.  A single
   physical WTP may operate a number of WLAN services, and the way is
   called as virtual AP.  Each Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) and
   its constituent wireless terminal radios are denoted as a distinct
   WLAN on a physical WTP.  To support physical WTP with multiple WLANs
   is an important feature for CAPWAP protocol's 802.11 binding, and it
   is also for MIB design.

4.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

5.  Overview

   The [I-D.ietf-capwap-base-mib] provides a way to configure and manage
   WTP and radio objects through SNMP.  It's a basis for manage and
   control a IEEE 802.11 binding.

   The CAPWAP Protocol's IEEE 802.11 binding MIB module (CAPWAP-DOT11-
   MIB) provides a way to configure WLAN service, and it also allows to
   easily reuse current and future MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard
   and its amendments.

   It is designed to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

   - The MIB module could easily reuse current and future MIBs defined
   in IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments, and not require to
   redefine them.

   - From AC to centrally manage and configure WLAN service;

   - Operators could configure MAC type and tunnel mode for a specific
   WLAN service by SNMP;

   - The MIB module supports virtual AP;

   Before coming to details of CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB module, it will
   introduce how it is able to reuse IEEE MIB standard.  According to
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211], each WLAN service is
   identified by WLAN Id.  In the MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard
   and its amendments, the MIB tables such as
   Dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable are able to support wireless
   configuration (such as authentication algorithm), and these tables
   use ifIndex as index.  To support 802.11 parameters for a specific
   WLAN service, and consider that the operator has to prepare
   configurations for each WLAN service on the AC before WTPs connect to
   AC, a wireless service could be abstracted as a 'WLAN Service
   Interface' on the AC, and which could be identified by ifIndex.  On
   the AC, the MIB table CapwapDot11WlanConfigTable will indicate the
   mapping relation between a 'WLAN Id" and ifIndex of a 'WLAN Service
   Interface'.  With ifIndex of a 'WLAN Service Interface', system is
   able to reuse the MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its
   amendments.

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB          October 2008


6.1.  The capwapDot11Objects Subtree

   The subtree provides information for configuration parameters of WLAN
   service and binding WLAN service to a specific radio.

6.2.  The capwapDot11Conformance Subtree

   The subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.

6.3.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   The MIB objects were derived from the CAPWAP protocol binding for
   802.11 document [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].

   1) capwapDot11WlanConfigTable

   The table is used for providing configuration such as MAC type and so
   on for WLANs.  For a specific WLAN service which is identified by
   capwapDot11WlanId, an interface of 'WLAN Service Interface' ifType
   will be created.  By the ifIndex of interface, it provides a way to
   reuse the MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.
   For example, according to
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211], Auth Type needs to be
   configured for a WLAN.  In IEEE 802.11 MIB, the MIB object
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm in the
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable is corresponding to Auth Type.
   Considering both capwapDot11WlanConfigTable and
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable use ifIndex as index, CAPWAP-
   DOT11-MIB are able to easily reuse dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm
   object in IEEE 802.11 MIB.  It is same for other objects in the MIBs
   defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.

   2) capwapDot11WlanBindTable

   The table provides a way to bind WLAN service to a radio, then
   supports virtual AP.  The binding operation will dynamically create
   'WLAN BSS Interface', and this logical interface is used for data
   forwarding function.

7.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

7.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB does
   not duplicate those objects.

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB          October 2008


7.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces Group [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing WLAN service that are
   modeled as interfaces.

   For each WLAN, it will have a logical interface of 'WLAN Service
   Interface' responding to it on the AC.  The interface SHOULD be
   modeled as an ifEntry and provide appropriate interface information.
   'WLAN Service Interface' provides a way to configure IEEE 802.11
   parameters for a specific WLAN service, and reuse the MIBs defined in
   IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.

   To provide data forwarding service, system will dynamically create
   logical interface of 'WLAN BSS Interface'.  The interface SHOULD be
   modeled as an ifEntry and provide appropriate interface information.
   The interface enables the virtual AP function.

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB are as
   follow.

   ifOutErrors     The number of outbound IEEE 802.11 frames dropped due
                   to uncorrectable errors.

7.3.  Relationship to CAPWAP-BASE-MIB

   The CAPWAP-BASE-MIB provides a way to manage and control WTP and
   radio objects.  Especially, CAPWAP-BASE-MIB has a mechanism of 'WTP
   Virtual Radio Interface' which enable system to reuse the MIBs
   defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.  With it,
   administrator could configure an IEEE 802.11 AP radio's parameter and
   query radio's traffic statistics.  Based on CAPWAP-BASE-MIB, CAPWAP-
   DOT11-MIB provides more information from WLAN service perspective.

7.4.  Relationship to the MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its
      amendments

   Through ifIndex of 'WLAN Service Interface' and 'WLAN BSS Interface'
   ifType, the MIB module is able to reuse MIB objects in the MIBs
   defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.

   In the 802.11 binding document [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-
   ieee80211], it involves a part of MIB objects defined by IEEE 802.11
   standard and its amendments.  Although CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB uses the
   802.11 binding document as a reference, it could reuse all the MIB
   objects defined by IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments , and not
   limited by the scope of the 802.11 binding document.

7.5.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB modules are required for IMPORTS: SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863] and CAPWAP-BASE-MIB [I-D.ietf-capwap-base-mib].

8.  Example of CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB Usage

   In the CAPWAP-BASE-MIB, each PHY radio is identified by WTP Id and
   radio ID, and which has a corresponding 'WTP Virtual Radio Interface'
   on the AC. The IEEE 802.11 MIB associated with this interface
   can be used to configure IEEE 802.11 wireless binding parameters for
   radio such as RTS Threshold.

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB          October 2008


   In the CAPWAP 802.11 Binding MIB, each WLAN service is identified
   by WLAN Id, and which has a corresponding 'WLAN Service Interface'
   on the AC. The MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its
   amendments associated with this interface can be used to configure
   WLAN parameters for a WLAN service, such as Authentication Algorithm.

   The 'WLAN BSS Interface', created by binding 'WTP Virtual Radio
   Interface' and 'WLAN Service Interface', is used for data forwarding.
   Combining the example provided in the [I-D.ietf-capwap-base-mib],
   the following is a whole example for configuration and management of
   WTP, radio and WLAN service for IEEE 802.11 binding.

   1) Identify each PHY radio by 'WTP Virtual Radio Interface'
   According to [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-specification], each radio on
   a WTP will be identified by a radio Id. Each WTP could be identified
   by its serial number.
   When configuration for a WTP is prepared before a WTP connects to AC,
   the following information is available in the
   CapwapBaseRadioBindTable.

   In CapwapBaseRadioBindTable
   {
     capwapBaseWTPId                     = 12345678,
     capwapBaseRadioId                   = 1,
     capwapBaseWtpVirtualRadioifIndex    = 10,
     capwapBaseWirelessBinding           = dot11(2)
   }

   Suppose WTP's serial number is 12345678, and first PHY radio's id
   is 1. On the AC, the ifIndex of 'WTP Virtual Radio Interface' is
   10 which represents the PHY radio 1.
   By the mechanism of 'WTP Virtual Radio Interface', it seemed that WTP
   PHY radios are located on the AC.
   The interface of 'WTP Virtual Radio Interface' is modeled by ifTable.

   In ifTable
   {
     ifIndex              = 10,
     ifDescr              = 'WTP Virtual Radio Interface',
     ifType               = IANAifType of 'WTP Virtual Radio
                            Interface',
     ifMtu                = 0,
     ifSpeed              = 0,
     ifPhysAddress        = 0.0.0.0.0.0,
     ifAdminStatus        = true,
     ifOperStatus         = false,
     ifLastChange         = 0,
     ifInOctets           = 0,

     ifInUcastPkts        = 0,
     ifInDiscards         = 0,
     ifInErrors           = 0,
     ifInUnknownProtos    = 0,
     ifOutOctets          = 0,
     ifOutUcastPkts       = 0,
     ifOutDiscards        = 0,
     ifOutErrors          = 0
   }

   2) Configure IEEE 802.11 wireless binding parameters for 'WTP Virtual
   Radio Interface'
   It will be done on the AC through the MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11
   standard and its amendments.
   For example, to configure parameter for 'WTP Virtual Radio Interface'
   by IEEE 802.11 Dot11OperationTable.

   In Dot11OperationTable
   {
     ifIndex                         = 10,
     dot11MACAddress                 = 0.0.0.0.0.0,
     dot11RTSThreshold               = 2347,
     dot11ShortRetryLimit            = 7,
     dot11LongRetryLimit             = 4,
     dot11FragmentationThreshold     = 256,
     dot11MaxTransmitMSDULifetime    = 512,
     dot11MaxReceiveLifetime         = 512,
     dot11ManufacturerID             = 'capwap',
     dot11ProductID                  = 'capwap'
   }

   In the example, it supposes ifIndex of a 'WTP Virtual Radio
   Interface' is 10.

   3) Configure WLAN service

   WLAN service configuration will be done through CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB,
   and the MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.

   First step is to create a 'WLAN Service Interface' through
   CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB on the AC.

   In CapwapDot11WlanConfigTable
   {
     capwapDot11WlanId                 = 1,
     capwapDot11WlanServiceIfIndex     = 20,
     capwapDot11WlanMacType            = splitMAC(2),
     capwapDot11WlanTunnelMode         = dot3Tunnel(2),

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB          October 2008


     capwapDot11WlanConfigRowStatus    = create
   }

   Here supposes to configure a WLAN service which is identified by
   capwapDot11WlanId 1. A 'WLAN Service Interface' is created
   for it and identified by ifIndex 20.
   Corresponding to 'WLAN Service Interface', it SHOULD be modeled as an
   ifEntry on the AC and provide appropriate interface information.

   In ifTable
   {
     ifIndex              = 20,
     ifDescr              = 'WLAN Service Interface',
     ifType               = IANAifType of 'WLAN Service Interface',
     ifMtu                = 0,
     ifSpeed              = 0,
     ifPhysAddress        = 0.0.0.0.0.0,
     ifAdminStatus        = true,
     ifOperStatus         = true,
     ifLastChange         = 0,
     ifInOctets           = 0,
     ifInUcastPkts        = 0,
     ifInDiscards         = 0,
     ifInErrors           = 0,
     ifInUnknownProtos    = 0,
     ifOutOctets          = 0,
     ifOutUcastPkts       = 0,
     ifOutDiscards        = 0,
     ifOutErrors          = 0
   }

   Second step is to configure WLAN parameters of 'WLAN Service
   Interface' through the MIBs defined in IEEE 802.11 standard and
   its amendments on the AC.

   In Dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable
   {
     ifIndex                                = 20,
     dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsIndex     = 1,
     dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm           = Shared Key,
     dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsEnable    = true
   }

   Here ifIndex 20 is for interface of 'WLAN Service Interface'
   ifType. Suppose the index of authentication algorithm is 1.

   4) Bind WLAN service to WTP radio
   On the AC, through CapwapDot11WlanBindTable, it configures which

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB          October 2008


   WLAN service (identified by capwapDot11WlanId) will be provided
   on which radio (identified by ifIndex).
   Suppose capwapDot11WlanMacType of WLAN service is splitMAC(2),
   the interface of 'WLAN BSS Interface' will be created on the AC.
   The AC will use it for split data forwarding. Here supposes ifIndex
   of interface in 'WLAN BSS Interface' ifType is 30.

   In CapwapDot11WlanBindTable
   {
     ifIndex                        = 10,
     capwapDot11WlanId              = 1,
     capwapDot11WlanBssIfIndex      = 30,
     capwapDot11WlanBssRowStatus    = create
   }

   5) WTP reports its current configuration status

   After join phase and before WTP get configuration from AC, it will
   report its current configuration status to AC through configuration
   status request message. The MIB data will be updated on the AC.
   As an example, for ifIndex 10 (which identifies an interface of 'WLAN
   Virtual Radio Interface' ifType), its ifOperStatus in ifTable will
   be updated with current radio operational status.

   6) Query WTP and radio statistics data
   After WTPs come to run status, administrator could query WTP and
   radio statistics data through CAPWAP-BASE-MIB and CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB.
   For example, through dot11CountersTable in the IEEE 802.11 MIB,
   administrator could query counter data for radio which is identified
   by ifIndex of a 'WLAN Virtual Radio Interface'.

   7) Query other statistics data

   For example, administrator could query the configuration of
   WLAN service through Dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable and statistic
   data of 'WLAN BSS Interface' through ifTable;

         Before WTPs connect to AC and get configuration, administrator
         will prepare configuration for them. For a specific WLAN
         service, a logical interface of 'WLAN Service Interface'
         ifType will be created, and administrator could configure WLAN
         parameter through it. For example, according to IEEE 802.11
         '6.1. IEEE 802.11 Add WLAN' in the
         [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211], administrator
         could configure Auth Type for a WLAN. The 'WLAN
         Service Interface' provides a way to uniquely identify each
         WLAN by logical on the AC. As most MIBs use ifIndex to
         identify an interface for configuration and statistic data,
         for example, dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable in IEEE 802.11
         MIB use ifIndex as index, and dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm
         object is for Auth Type mentioned in the CAPWAP '6.1. IEEE
         802.11 Add WLAN', With the way of 'WLAN Service Interface',
         it will easily reuse MIB table like
         dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable, while only care for other
         configurations like capwapDot11WlanTunnelMode."

10.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  The followings are the tables and objects and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  - Unauthorized changes to the capwapDot11WlanConfigTable and
      capwapDot11WlanBindTable may disrupt allocation of resources in
      the network, also change the behavior of WLAN system such as MAC
      type.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  IANA Considerations for CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        capwapDot11MIB  { mib-2 XXX }

11.2.  IANA Considerations for ifType

   Require IANA to assign a ifType for 'WLAN Service Interface' type.

   Require IANA to assign a ifType for 'WLAN BSS Interface' type.
