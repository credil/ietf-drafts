Internet-Draft               Suite B for TLS                  April 2011


1.  Introduction

   The United States government has posted the Fact Sheet on National
   Security Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography [NSA], and at the time of
   writing, it states:

      A Cryptographic Interoperability Strategy (CIS) was developed to
      find ways to increase assured rapid sharing of information both
      within the U.S. and between the U.S. and her partners through
      the use of a common suite of public standards, protocols,
      algorithms and modes referred to as the "Secure Sharing Suite"
      or S.3. The implementation of CIS will facilitate the development
      of a broader range of secure cryptographic products which will
      be available to a wide customer base.  The use of selected
      public cryptographic standards and protocols and Suite B is the
      core of CIS.

      In 2005, NSA announced Suite B Cryptography which built upon the
      National Policy on the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard
      (AES) to Protect National Security Systems and National Security
      Information.  In addition to the AES algorithm, Suite B includes 
      cryptographic algorithms for key exchanges, digital signatures 
      and hashing.  Suite B cryptography has been selected from 
      cryptography that has been approved by NIST for use by the U.S. 
      Government and specified in NIST standards or recommendations.
      
   This document does not define any new cipher suites; instead, it 
   defines a Suite B compliant profile for use with TLS version 1.2 
   [RFC5246] or DTLS version 1.2 [4347bis] and the cipher suites defined
   in [RFC5289].  This profile uses only Suite B algorithms.

   RFC 5430 defined an additional transitional profile for use with TLS 
   versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1 [RFC4346] or DTLS version 1.0 
   [RFC4347] and the cipher suites defined in [RFC4492].  When either
   the client or the server does not support TLS version 1.2 and DTLS
   version 1.2, the transitional profile can be used to achieve
   non-Suite-B-compliant interoperability.  The description for the
   transitional profile appears in the Annex of this document.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We will use the notation "ECDSA-256" to represent the use of the
   ECDSA algorithm with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function.
   Similarly, "ECDSA-384" will represent the use of the ECDSA
   algorithm with the P-384 curve and the SHA-384 hash function.

3.  Suite B Requirements

   The Fact Sheet on Suite B Cryptography requires key establishment
   and authentication algorithms based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography
   and encryption using AES [AES].  Suite B algorithms are defined to
   support two minimum levels of security: 128 and 192 bits.

   In particular, Suite B includes:

       Encryption:         Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [AES] --
                           FIPS 197 (with key sizes of 128 and 256 bits)

       Digital Signature:  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
                           (ECDSA) [DSS] - FIPS 186-3 (using the
                           curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli)

       Key Exchange:       Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) - NIST
                           Special Publication 800-56A [PWKE] (using the
                           curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli)

   The two elliptic curves used in Suite B each appear in the literature 
   under two different names.  For sake of clarity, we list both names 
   below:

      Curve    NIST name   [SECG] name
      --------------------------------
      P-256    nistp256    secp256r1
      P-384    nistp384    secp384r1

   The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for a
   Suite B Compliant implementation of TLS (hereafter referred to as
   Suite B TLS).

3.1. Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS) for Suite B TLS 

   Suite B provides two levels of cryptographic security, namely a 
   128-bit minimum level of security (minLOS_128) and a 192-bit minimum 
   level of security (minLOS_192).  Each level defines a minimum 
   strength that all cryptographic algorithms must provide.  

   The following combination of algorithms and key sizes are used in
   Suite B TLS: 

   Suite B Combination 1                 Suite B Combination 2 
   --------------------------------   ---------------------------------
   AES with 128-bit key in GCM mode    AES with 256-bit key in GCM mode
   ECDH using the 256-bit prime        ECDH using the 384-bit prime
      modulus curve P-256 [DSS]           modulus curve P-384 [DSS]
   TLS PRF with SHA-256 [SHS]          TLS PRF with SHA-384 [SHS]

Internet-Draft               Suite B for TLS                  April 2011


   Suite B TLS configured at a minimum level of security of
   128 bits MUST use a TLS cipher suite satisfying either
   
   SuiteB_Combination_1 in its entirety or 
   SuiteB_Combination_2 in its entirety.  

   Suite B TLS configured at a minimum level of security
   of 192 bits MUST use a TLS cipher suite satisfying 
   SuiteB_Combination_2 in its entirety.  

   The specific Suite B compliant cipher suites for each combination
   are listed in Section 4.

   For Suite B TLS, ECDH uses the Ephemeral Unified Model Scheme with 
   cofactor set to 1 (see Section 6.1.2.2 in [PWKE]). 

   To accommodate backward compatibility, a Suite B TLS client or
   server MAY be configured to accept a cipher suite that is not part of
   Suite B. However, whenever a Suite B TLS client and a Suite B
   TLS server establish a TLS version 1.2 session, Suite B
   algorithms MUST be employed.

3.2 Suite B TLS Authentication

   Suite B TLS MUST use ECDSA for digital signatures;
   authentication methods other than ECDSA-256 and
   ECDSA-384 MUST NOT be used for TLS authentication.  If a relying
   party receives a signature based on any other authentication
   method, it MUST return a TLS error and stop the TLS handshake. 

   A system compliant with the Suite B TLS and configured at a 
   minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST use either ECDSA-256 or 
   ECDSA-384 for client or server authentication.  One party can
   authenticate with ECDSA-256 when the other party authenticates with
   ECDSA-384.  This flexibility allows interoperation between a client
   and a server that have ECDSA authentication keys of different
   sizes. 

   Clients and servers in a system configured at a minimum level of
   security of 128 bits MUST be able to verify ECDSA-256 signatures
   and SHOULD be able to verify ECDSA-384 signatures unless it is
   absolutely certain that the implementation will never need to
   verify certificates originating from an authority which uses an
   ECDSA-384 signing key.

   A system compliant with the Suite B TLS and configured at a
   minimum level of security of 192 bits MUST use ECDSA-384 for client
   and server authentication.

Internet-Draft               Suite B for TLS                  April 2011


   Clients and servers in a system configured at a minimum level of
   security of 192 bits MUST be able to verify ECDSA-384 signatures. 
   
   In all cases, the client MUST authenticate the server.  The server
   MAY authenticate the client, as needed by the specific application. 
 
4.  Suite B Compliance and Interoperability Requirements

   TLS versions 1.1 [RFC4346] and earlier do not support Galois
   CounterMode (GCM) cipher suites [RFC5289].  However, TLS version
   1.2 [RFC5246] and later do support GCM.  For Suite B TLS, GCM cipher
   suites MUST be used, therefore a Suite B TLS client MUST implement
   TLS version 1.2 or later. 

   A Suite B TLS client configured at a minimum level of security of
   128 bits MUST offer the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 or
   the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 ciphersuite in the
   ClientHello message.  The TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   ciphersuite is preferred and if offered, MUST appear before the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 ciphersuite. 

   If configured at a minimum level of security of 192 bits, the
   client MUST offer the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   ciphersuite and MUST NOT offer the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 ciphersuite. 

   One of these two cipher suites MUST be the first (most preferred)
   cipher suites in the ClientHello message.  A Suite B TLS client
   that offers interoperability with non-Suite B compliant servers MAY 
   offer additional cipher suites, but any additional cipher suites
   MUST appear after the two Suite B compliant cipher suites in the
   ClientHello message. 

   A Suite B TLS server MUST implement TLS version 1.2 or later.  

   A Suite B TLS server configured at a minimum level of security of
   128 bits MUST accept either the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite or the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher suite if it
   is offered in the ClientHellomessage, with the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite being
   preferred. 

   A Suite B TLS server configured at a minimum security level of 192
   bits MUST accept the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher 
   suite if it is offered in the ClientHello message. 

   If the server is not offered either of the Suite B cipher suites
   and interoperability with non-Suite B compliant clients is desired,

Internet-Draft               Suite B for TLS                  April 2011


   then the Suite B TLS server MAY accept another offered cipher
   suite that is considered acceptable by the server administrator. 

4.1.  Acceptable Curves

   RFC 4492 defines a variety of elliptic curves.  Suite B TLS
   connections MUST use secp256r1(23) or secp384r1(24).  These are
   the same curves that appear in FIPS 186-3 [DSS] as P-256 and P-384,  
   respectively.  Secp256r1 MUST be used for the key exchange in all 
   cipher suites in this specification using AES-128; secp384r1 MUST be 
   used for the key exchange in all cipher suites in this specification 
   using AES-256.  RFC 4492 requires that the uncompressed(0) form be 
   supported.  The ansiX962_compressed_prime(1) point format MAY also be
   supported.

   Clients desiring to negotiate only a Suite B TLS connection MUST
   generate a "Supported Elliptic Curves Extension" containing only 
   the allowed curves.  Clients operating at a minimum level of security 
   of 128 bits MUST include secp256r1 and SHOULD include secp384r1 in 
   the extension.  Clients operating at a minimum level of security of 
   192 bits MUST include secp384r1 in the extension. In order to be able 
   to verify ECDSA signatures, a client and server in a system
   configured at a minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST support
   secp256r1 and  SHOULD support secp384r1 unless it is absolutely
   certain that the client and server will never need to use or verify
   certificates originating from an authority which uses an ECDSA-384
   signing key.  A client and server in a system configured at a minimum
   level of 192 bits MUST support secp384r1.   

   TLS connections that offer both Suite B and non-Suite B compliant  
   options MAY omit the extension or they MAY send the extension but
   offer other curves as well as the appropriate Suite B ones.

   Servers desiring to negotiate a Suite B TLS connection SHOULD
   check for the presence of the extension, but MUST NOT select a
   non-Suite B curve even if it is offered by the client.  This allows
   a client that is willing to do either Suite B or non-Suite B TLS 
   connections to interoperate with a server that will only do 
   Suite B TLS.  If the client does not advertise an acceptable curve,
   the server MUST generate a fatal "handshake_failure" alert and 
   terminate the connection.  Clients MUST check the chosen curve to
   make sure that it is one of the Suite B curves.

4.2.  Certificates

   Server and client certificates used to establish a Suite B TLS
   connection MUST be signed with ECDSA and MUST be compliant with the
   "Suite B  Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   Profile", [RFC5759].

4.3.  signature_algorithms Extension

   The signature_algorithms extension is defined in Section 7.4.1.4.1
   of TLS version 1.2 [RFC5246].  A Suite B TLS version 1.2 or later
   client MUST include the signature_algorithms extension. A
   Suite B TLS client configured at a minimum level of security of 128 
   bits MUST offer SHA-256 with ECDSA and SHOULD offer ECDSA with
   SHA-384 in the signature_algorithms extension unless it is absolutely
   certain that a client will never need to use or verify certificates
   originating from an authority which uses an ECDSA-384 signing key.
   A Suite B TLS client configured at a minimum level of 192 bits MUST
   offer ECDSA with SHA-384 in the signature_algorithms extension.

   Following the guidance in [RFC5759], Suite B TLS connections MUST
   only accept signature algorithms ECDSA with either
   SHA-256 or SHA-384 for certification path validation.  (Note
   that this is a change from [RFC5430].) 

   Other offerings MAY be included to indicate the signature
   algorithms that are acceptable in cipher suites that are offered
   for interoperability with servers that are not compliant with Suite
   B and to indicate the signature algorithms that are acceptable for 
   certification path validation in non-compliant Suite B TLS
   connections. 
  
4.4.  CertificateRequest Message

   A Suite B TLS server configured at a minimum level of security of
   128 bits MUST include ECDSA with SHA-256 and SHOULD include
   ECDSA with SHA-384 in the supported_signature_algorithms field of
   the CertificateRequest message unless it is absolutely
   certain that a server will never need to verify certificates
   originating from an authority which uses an ECDSA-384 signing key.
   A Suite B TLS server configured at a minimum level of security of
   192 bits MUST include ECDSA with SHA-384 in the
   supported_signature_algorithms field.

4.5.  CertificateVerify Message

   Using the definitions found in section 3.2, a Suite B TLS client
   MUST use ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384 for the signature in
   the CertificateVerify message.  A Suite B TLS client configured
   at a minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST use ECDSA-256 or
   ECDSA-384. A Suite B TLS client configured at a minimum level of
   security of 192 bits MUST use ECDSA-384. 

4.6.  ServerKeyExchange Message Signature

   In the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA-collection of cipher suites, the server

Internet-Draft               Suite B for TLS                  April 2011


   sends its ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification of the
   corresponding curve in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These
   parameters MUST be signed with ECDSA using the server's private
   key, which corresponds to the public key in the server's
   certificate. 

   A Suite B TLS server MUST sign the ServerKeyExchange message using
   either ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384.  A system configured at a minimum
   level of security of 128 bits MUST use either ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384.
   A system configured at a minimum level of security of 192-bits MUST
   use ECDSA-384. 

5.  Security Considerations

   Most of the security considerations for this document are described
   in "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"
   [RFC5246], "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites for
   Transport Layer Security (TLS)" [RFC4492], "AES Galois Counter Mode 
   (GCM) Cipher Suites for TLS" [RFC5288], and "TLS Elliptic Curve
   Cipher Suites with SHA-256/384 and AES Galois Counter Mode (GCM)"
   [RFC5289].  Readers should consult those documents.
   
   In order to meet the goal of a consistent security level for the
   entire cipher suite, Suite B TLS implementations MUST ONLY
   use the curves defined in Section 4.2.  Otherwise, it is possible to
   have a set of symmetric algorithms with much weaker or stronger
   security properties than the asymmetric (ECC) algorithms.

9.  Annex: A Transitional Suite B Profile for TLS 1.1 and 1.0

   A transitional profile is described for use with TLS version 1.0
   [RFC2246], TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346], or DTLS version 1.0 [RFC4347]
   and the cipher suites defined in [RFC4492].  This profile uses the
   Suite B cryptographic algorithms to the greatest extent possible
   and provides backward compatibility.  While the transitional
   profile is not a Suite B Compliant implementation of TLS, it provides
   a transitional path towards the Suite B compliant Profile.  

   The following combination of algorithms and key sizes are defined
   for use with the Suite B TLS transitional profile: 

   Transitional Suite B Combination 1 Transitional Suite B Combination 2
   ----------------------------------  ---------------------------------
   AES with 128-bit key in CBC mode    AES with 256-bit key in CBC mode
   ECDH using the 256-bit prime        ECDH using the 384-bit prime
      modulus curve P-256 [DSS]           modulus curve P-384 [DSS]
   Standard TLS PRF                    Standard TLS PRF 
      (with SHA-1 and MD5)                (with SHA-1 and MD5)
   HMAC with SHA-1 for message         HMAC with SHA-1 for message
      authentication                      authentication    

   A Transitional Suite B TLS system configured at a minimum level of
   security of 128 bits MUST use a TLS cipher suite satisfying either
   Transitional Suite B Combination 1 in its entirety or
   Transitional Suite B Combination 2 in its entirety. 

   A Transitional Suite B TLS system configured at a minimum level of
   security of 192 bits MUST use a TLS cipher suite satisfying
   Transitional Suite B Combination 2 in its entirety. 

   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA satisfy the requirements of
   Transitional Suite B Combination 1 and Transitional Suite B 
   Combination 2, respectively.

Internet-Draft               Suite B for TLS                  April 2011


   A Transitional Suite B TLS client MUST implement TLS version 1.1 or 
   earlier. 

   A Transitional Suite B TLS system configured at a minimum level of
   security of 128 bits, MUST offer the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite and/or the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite in the

   ClientHello message.  The TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
   cipher suite is preferred, and if it is offered, it MUST appear
   before the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite (if
   present).   

   A Transitional Suite B TLS system configured at a minimum level of
   security of 192 bits MUST offer the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite in the
   ClientHello message.   

   One of these Transitional Suite B cipher suites MUST be the
   first (most preferred) in the ClientHello message. 

   A Transitional Suite B client that offers interoperability with
   non-Suite B transitional servers MAY offer additional cipher
   suites.  If any additional cipher suites are offered, they MUST
   appear after the Transitional Suite B cipher suites in the
   ClientHello message. 

   A Transitional Suite B TLS server MUST implement TLS version 1.1 or
   earlier. 

   A Transitional Suite B TLS server configured at aminimum level of
   security of 128 bits MUST accept the
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite (preferred) or
   the TLS_ECHDE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite if offered in
   the ClientHello message.  

   A Transitional Suite B TLS server configured at a minimum level of
   security of 192 bits MUST accept the
   TLS_ECHDE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite if offered in the
   ClientHello message.  

   If a Transitional Suite B TLS server is not offered the Transitional
   Suite B cipher suites and interoperability with non-Transitional
   Suite B clients is desired, then the server MAY accept another
   offered cipher suite that is considered acceptable by the server
   administrator. 

   A Transitional Suite B TLS server MUST sign the ServerKeyExchange
   message using ECDSA with SHA-1.  The Transitional Suite B profile

   does not impose any additional restrictions on the server
   certificate signature or the signature schemes used elsewhere in
   the certification path.  Likewise, the Transitional Suite B Profile
   does not impose restrictions on signature schemes used in the
   certification path for the client's certificate when mutual
   authentication is employed.
