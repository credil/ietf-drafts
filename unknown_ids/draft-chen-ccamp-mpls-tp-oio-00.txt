  Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Operator
                           Identifier Object
                  draft-chen-ccamp-mpls-tp-oio-00.txt

Abstract

   Two formats of Operator Identifier (Opr_ID) are specified in Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks, to
   uniquely identify an operator.  One is Global Identifier (Global_ID),
   the other is ITU Carrier Code (ICC).  In MPLS-TP networks, Opr_ID as
   part of the global identifier of an MPLS-TP LSP may be required to be
   carried in the Path message when setting up the LSP.

   This document defines two types of Operator Identifier Object:
   Global_ID Object and ICC Object, which could be carried in the Path
   message to comunicate the Operator Identifiers (Opr_IDs) that the two
   ends of an LSP in use.  At the same time, it makes sure all the nodes
   that the LSP traverses to use the same format of Opr_ID.

Internet-Draft         Operator Identifier Object               May 2011


1.  Introduction

   [I.D.draft-ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers][I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers]
   specifies two formats of Operator Identifier (Opr_ID), uniquely
   identifying an operator in Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport
   Profile (MPLS-TP) networks.  One format is Global Identifier
   (Global_ID) which could be derived from the provider's Autonomous
   System Number (ASN).  The other one is ITU Carrier Code (ICC) which
   is defined in M.1400 and maintained by the ITU-T Telecommunication
   Standardization Bureau (TSB).  ICC is a string of one to six
   characters.

   Resource ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engnieering (RSVP-TE) signaling
   [RFC3209][RFC3471] does not exchange Opr_ID when setup an LSP.  It is
   because in the traditional MPLS network the use of Opr_ID is not
   necessay.  A Traffic Engnieering (TE) LSP could be uniquely
   identified by the soure IP address, destionation IP address, Tunnel
   ID and Label Swiching Path (LSP) ID of the LSP when the IP addresses
   is globally unique.  But in MPLS-TP networks, the Node Identifier
   (Node_ID) is unique within the scope of the Opr_ID.  In situations
   where a Node_ID needs to be globally unique, this is accomplished by
   prefixing the identifier with the operator's Opr_ID.  That means the
   Opr_ID as part of the global identifier of an MPLS-TP LSP may be
   required to be carried in the Path message when setting up the LSP.

   In addition, since two formats of Opr_ID are defined, when setting up
   a LSP, two things need to be determined.  One is that which format
   should be used, the other is that how to make sure that all the nodes
   that the LSP traverses using the same format.  The former could be
   achieved by the configration of the operators.  The later may need
   some signaling exchange.

   This document defines two types of Operator Identifier Object:
   Global_ID Object and ICC Object, which could be carried in the Path
   message to comunicate the Operator Identifiers (Opr_IDs) that the two
   ends of an LSP in use.  At the same time, it makes sure all the nodes
   that the LSP traverses to use the same format of Opr_ID.


2.  Operator Identifier Object

   Two types of Operator Identifier Objects (OIO) are defined in this
   document for two formats of Opr_ID respectively: Global_ID Object and
   ICC Object.  Both Global_ID and ICC Object are OPTIONAL.  When
   setting up an MPLS-TP LSP, one and only one type of the OIO MUST be
   included in the Path message if the Opr_ID is required.

Internet-Draft         Operator Identifier Object               May 2011


2.1.  Global_ID Object

   The encoding of the Global_ID Object including the common object
   header is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (TBA)|   C-Type (1) |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                         East-Global_ID                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                         West-Global_ID                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                               Figure 1. ASN Object

   Class-Num: To be allocated by IANA.

   C-Type: To be allocated by IANA (0x01 is recommended).

   Global_ID is 4 octets in length.  If the global ID is derived from a
   2-octet AS number, then the two high-order octets of this 4-octet
   field MUST be set to zero.

2.2.  ICC Object

   The encoding of the ICC Object including the common object header is
   as follows:
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (TBA)|   C-Type (2) |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           East-ICC                            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     East-ICC (contd.)         |           West-ICC            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           West-ICC (contd.)                   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                         Figure 2. ICC Object

   Class-Num: To be allocated by IANA.

   C-Type: To be allocated by IANA (0x02 is recommended).

   ICC is 6 octets in length.  When the length of a ICC string is less
   than 6, the higher-order unused octets of the ICC field MUST be set
   to zero.

2.3.  Procedures

   When signaling an MPLS-TP LSP, if the Opr_ID is needed, either the
   Global_ID or ICC Object MUST be carried in the Path message.  When
   receiveing such a Path message, the node MUST check C-Type to see
   whether it agree to use that format of Opr_ID.  If the node agrees to
   use it, it MUST use that format of Opr_ID.  Otherwise it MUST send a
   PathError message with "Wrong Opr_ID Format" error.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document request IANA to assign new Class-Num, C-Types as
   follows:

   Class-Num     Class Name              Class Types or C-Types:
   ---------     -------------------     ------------------------
         TBD     Operator Identifier     0x01(TBD)   Global_ID
                                         0x02(TBD)   ICC


4.  Security Considerations

   When Operator Identifier Object is in use, a form of source-
   validation checking may be enabled to ensure that the Global_ID or
   ICC originated from a legitimate source, especially in the inter-
   provider case.
