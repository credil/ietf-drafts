    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a
      certain computational and communication overhead with respect
      to the number of round-trips required and the cryptographic
      operations involved. In particular the Extensible
      Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication in
      remote access cases, which increases latency.</t>
      <t>To re-establish security associations (SA) upon a failure
      recovery condition is time-consuming, especially when an
      IPsec peer, such as a VPN gateway, needs to re-establish a
      large number of SAs with various end points. A high number of
      concurrent sessions might cause additional problems for an
      IPsec responder.</t>
      <t>In many failure cases it would be useful to provide an
      efficient way to resume an interrupted IKE/IPsec session.
      This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a
      client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly
      efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE
      SA.</t>
      <t>A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was
      disconnected. One way to ensure that the IKEv2 responder is
      able to recreate the state information is by maintaining
      IKEv2 state (or a reference into a state store) in a
      "ticket", an opaque data structure. This ticket is created by
      the server and forwarded to the client. The IKEv2 protocol is
      extended to allow a client to request and present a ticket.
      This document does not mandate the format of the ticket
      structure but a recommendation is provided. In
      <xref target="format" /> a ticket by value and a ticket by
      reference format is proposed.</t>
      <t>This approach is similar to the one taken by TLS session
      resumption
      <xref target="RFC5077" /> with the required adaptations for
      IKEv2, e.g., to accommodate the two-phase protocol structure.
      We have borrowed heavily from that specification.</t>
      <t>The proposed solution should additionally meet the
      following goals:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Using only symmetric cryptography to minimize CPU
          consumption.</t>
          <t>Providing cryptographic agility.</t>
          <t>Having no negative impact on IKEv2 security
          features.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The following are non-goals of this solution:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Failover from one gateway to another. This use case may
        be added in a future specification.</t>
        <t>Providing load balancing among gateways.</t>
        <t>Specifying how a client detects the need for
        resumption.</t>
      </list></t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
      and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in
      <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
      <t>This document uses terminology defined in
      <xref target="RFC4301" /> and
      <xref target="RFC4306" />.
      In addition, this document uses the following terms:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Ticket:">An IKEv2 ticket is a data structure
          that contains all the necessary information that allows
          an IKEv2 responder to re-establish an IKEv2 security
          association.
          <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In this document we use the term "ticket" and thereby refer
      to an opaque data structure that may either contain IKEv2
      state as described above or a reference pointing to such
      state.</t>
    </section>
    <!-- ************************************************************************************ -->
    <section title="Usage Scenario" anchor="usage">
      <t>This specification envisions two usage scenarios for
      efficient IKEv2 and IPsec SA session re-establishment.</t>
      <t>The first is similar to the use case specified in Section
      1.1.3 of the IKEv2 specification
      <xref target="RFC4306" />, where the IPsec tunnel mode is
      used to establish a secure channel between a remote access
      client and a gateway; the traffic flow may be between the
      client and entities beyond the gateway. This scenario is
      further discussed below.</t>
      <t>The second use case focuses on the usage of transport (or
      tunnel) mode to secure the communicate between two end points
      (e.g., two servers). The two endpoints have a client-server
      relationship with respect to a protocol that runs using the
      protections afforded by the IPsec SA.</t>

      <t>In the first use case above,
      an end host (an entity with a host
      implementation of IPsec
      <xref target="RFC4301" />) establishes a tunnel mode IPsec SA
      with a gateway in a remote network using IKEv2. The end host
      in this scenario is sometimes referred to as a remote access
      client. At a later stage when a client needs to re-establish
      the IKEv2 session it may choose to establish IPsec SAs using
      a full IKEv2 exchange or the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange
      (shown in

    <section title="Protocol Details">
      <t>This section provides protocol details and contains the
      normative parts. This document defines two protocol
      exchanges, namely requesting a ticket, see
      <xref target="request-ticket" />, and presenting a ticket,
      see
      <xref target="present-ticket" />.</t>
      <section anchor="request-ticket" title="Requesting a Ticket">
        <t>A client MAY request a ticket in the following
        exchanges:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>In an IKE_AUTH exchange, as shown in the example
            message exchange in
            <xref target="request-ticket-example" /> below.</t>
            <t>In a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, when an IKE SA is
            rekeyed (and only when this exchange is initiated
            by the client).</t>
            <t>In an Informational exchange at any time, e.g. if
            the gateway previously replied with an N(TICKET_ACK)
            instead of providing a ticket, or when the ticket
            lifetime is about to expire. All such
            Informational exchanges MUST be initiated by the client.</t>
            <t>While resuming an IKE session, i.e. in the IKE_AUTH exchange that follows
            an IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange, see
            <xref target="request-resume" />.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Normally, a client requests a ticket in the third
        message of an IKEv2 exchange (the first of IKE_AUTH).

          grant a ticket for some reason.</t>
          <t>it returns an N(TICKET_ACK), if it cannot grant a
          ticket immediately, e.g., due to packet size limitations.
          In this case the client MAY request a ticket later using
          an Informational exchange, at any time during the
          lifetime of the IKE SA.</t>
        </list>
        Regardless of this choice, there is no change to the behavior of the responder with respect
        to the IKE exchange, and the proper IKE response (e.g. an IKE_AUTH response or an error
        notification) MUST be sent.

            In that case, the initiator should re-initiate a

            which may indicate inconsistent state between the IKEv2

        <t>Again, the exchange type in HDR is set to
        'IKE_SESSION_RESUME'. The responder copies the SPIi value
        from the request, and the SPIr value is set to a new random
        value .</t>
        <t>At this point the client MUST initiate an IKE_AUTH
        exchange, as per
        <xref target="RFC4306" />. See
        <xref target="auth-values" /> for guidelines on computing
        the AUTH payloads.
        The IDi value sent in this exchange MUST
        be identical to the value included in the ticket.
        Following this exchange, a new IKE SA is
        created by both parties, see
        <xref target="ike-sa" />, and a child SA is derived, per Section 2.17 of
        <xref target="RFC4306" />.</t>
        <t>When the responder receives a ticket for an IKE SA that
        is still active and if the responder accepts it, then the
        old SA SHOULD be silently deleted without sending a DELETE
        informational exchange. Consequently, all the dependent
        IPsec child SAs are also deleted. This happens after both

        <t>When resuming a session, a client will typically request
        a new ticket immediately, so it is able to resume the
        session again in the case of a second failure.
        The N(TICKET_REQUEST) and N(TICKET_LT_OPAQUE) notifications
        will be included in the
        IKE_AUTH exchange that follows the IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange, with
        similar behavior to a ticket request during a regular IKE exchange,
        <xref target="request-ticket" />.</t>
        <t>The returned ticket (if any) will correspond to the IKE
        SA created per the rules described in
        <xref target="ike-sa" />.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="IP Address Change and NAT">
      <t>
      The client MAY resume the IKE exchange from an IP address different from its original
      address. The gateway MAY reject the resumed exchange if its policy depends on the client's
      address (although this rarely makes sense).
      </t>
      <t>
      The client's NAT traversal status SHOULD be determined anew upon session resumption, by
      using the appropriate notifications. This status is explicitly not part of the session
      resumption state.

        <t>When a ticket is presented, the gateway needs to obtain

        the client has already provided a ticket per value, the gateway can
        parse the ticket to obtain the state directly. In either case, the gateway needs to
        process the ticket state in order to restore the state
        of the old IKE SA, and the client retrieves the same state from
        its local store. Both peers now create state for the new

        <t>When passing a ticket by value to the client, the ticket

        <t>A ticket

        contain any sensitive material, such as keying material.
        However, access to the storage where that sensitive
        material is stored MUST be protected so that only
        unauthorized access is not allowed. We note that such a
        ticket is analogous to the concept of 'stub', as defined in

        <t>Although not strictly required for cryptographic protection,
        it is RECOMMENDED to integrity-protect the ticket by reference. Failing to do so

        particular, when an IKE SA is deleted, the client MUST
        delete its stored ticket. Similarly, when credentials associated
        with the IKE SA are invalidated (e.g. when a user logs out),
        the ticket MUST be deleted. When the IKE SA is rekeyed the
        ticket is invalidated, and the client SHOULD request a new
        ticket.</t>
        <t>The lifetime of the ticket sent by the gateway SHOULD be the minimum of
        the IKE SA lifetime (per the gateway's local policy) and
        its re-authentication time, according to
        <xref target="RFC4478" />. Even if neither of these are
        enforced by the gateway, a finite lifetime MUST be
        specified for the ticket.</t>
        <t>
        The key that is used to protect the ticket MUST have a
        lifetime that is significantly longer than the lifetime of
        an IKE SA.</t>
        <t>In normal operation, the client will request a ticket when establishing the initial
        IKE SA, and then every time the SA is rekeyed or re-established
        because of re-authentication.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>This section addresses security issues related to the
      usage of a ticket.</t>
      <section title="Stolen Tickets">
        <t>An man-in-the-middle may try to eavesdrop on an exchange
        to obtain a ticket by value and use it to establish a
        session with the IKEv2 responder. This can happen in
        different ways: by eavesdropping on the initial
        communication and copying the ticket when it is granted and
        before it is used, or by listening in on a client's use of
        the ticket to resume a session. However, since the ticket's
        contents is encrypted and the attacker does not know the
        corresponding secret key, a stolen ticket cannot be used by
        an attacker to successfully resume a session. An IKEv2
        responder MUST use strong encryption and integrity
        protection of the ticket to prevent an attacker from
        obtaining the ticket's contents, e.g., by using a brute
        force attack.</t>
        <t>A ticket by reference does not need to be encrypted.
        When an adversary is able to eavesdrop on an exchange, as
        described in the previous paragraph, then the ticket by
        reference may be obtained. A ticket by reference cannot be used by
        an attacker to successfully resume a session, for the
        same reasons as for a ticket by value.
        Moreover, the adversary MUST NOT be able
        to resolve the ticket via the reference, i.e., access
        control MUST be enforced to ensure disclosure only to
        authorized entities.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Forged Tickets">
        <t>A malicious user could forge or alter a ticket by value
        in order to resume a session, to extend its lifetime, to
        impersonate as another user, or to gain additional
        privileges. This attack is not possible if the content of
        the ticket by value is protected using a strong integrity
        protection algorithm.</t>
        <t>In case of a ticket by reference an adversary may
        attempt to construct a fake ticket by reference to point to
        state information stored by the IKEv2 responder. This
        attack will fail because the adversary is not in possession
        of the keying material associated with the IKEv2 SA. As noted in
        <xref target="content"/>, it is often useful to integrity-protect
        the ticket by reference, too.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Denial of Service Attacks">
        <t>An adversary could generate and send a large number of
        tickets by value to a gateway for verification. To minimize
        the possibility of such denial of service, ticket
        verification should be lightweight (e.g., using efficient
        symmetric key cryptographic algorithms).</t>
        <t>When an adversary chooses to send a large number of
        tickets by reference then this may lead to an amplification
        attack as the IKEv2 responder is forced to resolve the reference to a
        ticket in order to determine that the adversary is not in
        possession of the keying material corresponding to the
        stored state or that the reference is void. To minimize
        this attack, the protocol to resolve the reference should be
        as lightweight as possible. and should not generate a large
        number of messages.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Key Management for Tickets By Value ">
        <t>A full description of the management of the keys used to
        protect the ticket by value is beyond the scope of this
        document. A list of RECOMMENDED practices is given below.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The keys should be generated securely following the
          randomness recommendations in
          <xref target="RFC4086" />.</t>
          <t>The keys and cryptographic protection algorithms
          should be at least 128 bits in strength.</t>
          <t>The keys should not be used for any other purpose than
          generating and verifying tickets.</t>
          <t>The keys should be changed regularly.</t>
          <t>The keys should be changed if the ticket format or
          cryptographic protection algorithms change.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>
      <section title="Ticket Lifetime">
        <t>An IKEv2 responder controls the validity period of the
        state information by attaching a lifetime to a ticket. The
        chosen lifetime is based on the operational and security
        requirements of the environment in which this IKEv2
        extension is deployed. The responder provides information
        about the ticket lifetime to the IKEv2 initiator, allowing
        it to manage its tickets.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Ticket by Value Format">
        <t>Great care must be taken when defining a ticket format
        such that the requirements outlined in
        <xref target="content" /> are met. In particular, if
        confidential information, such as a secret key, is
        transferred to the client it MUST be done using channel
        security to prevent attackers from obtaining or modifying
        the ticket. Also, the ticket by value MUST have its
        integrity and confidentiality protected with strong
        cryptographic techniques to prevent a breach in the
        security of the system.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Identity Privacy, Anonymity, and Unlinkability">

        <t>Since opaque state information is passed around between
        the IKEv2 initiator and the IKEv2 responder it is important
        that leakage of information, such as the identities of an
        IKEv2 initiator and a responder, MUST be avoided.</t>
        <t>When an IKEv2 initiator presents a ticket as part of the
        IKE_SESSION_RESUME exchange, confidentiality is not
        provided for the exchange. There is thereby the possibility
        for an on-path adversary to observe multiple exchange
        handshakes where the same state information is used and
        therefore to conclude that they belong to the same
        communication end points.</t>
        <t>This document therefore requires that the ticket be
        presented to the IKEv2 responder only once; under normal circumstances
        (e.g. no active attacker), there should be no multiple use
        of the same ticket.</t>
      </section>
      <!-- <t>DOS resistance.</t>
      <t>Authentication of identities.</t>
      <t>Reuse of ticket from a terminated session.</t>
      <t>Strength of the ticket protection stronger than the protected data.</t>
      <t>Time synchronization between gateways.</t>
