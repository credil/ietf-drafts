Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases                    May 2010


1.  Introduction

   The need for documenting the OAuth use cases was discussed at the
   oauth WG virtual meetings, on the group's mailing list, and at the
   IETF 77.  This Internet-Draft describes such use cases.  The
   objective of the draft is to initiate discussion that will lead to
   defining a set of the use cases that the OAuth specifications should
   support.  The following section provides the abbreviated descriptions
   of the use cases.  The descriptions include the pointers to the
   sources of the use cases.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  OAuth use cases

   This section lists the major use cases that have been discussed by
   the oauth WG.

3.1.  Use cases of the draft The OAuth 2.0 Protocol

   [draft-ietf-oauth-v2]

3.1.1.  User-Agent Flow

   Description:
   A Client application residing in a user-agent accesses protected
   resource on user's behalf

   (This use case covers the one specified in section Rich App Profile
   of [draft-hardt-oauth])

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Client is an application residing in a user-agent, typically
      implemented in a browser using a scripting language such a
      JavaScript

   o  Client is capable of interacting with the user-agent

   o  Client provides redirection URL to authorization server for
      redirecting the user-agent after authorization by the end user

Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases                    May 2010


   o  Client's authentication by authorization server is based on the
      user-agent's same origin policy (client cannot keep client secret
      confidential)

   o  Client does not need to be an HTTP server

   o  End user's registration with authorization Server for
      identification and authentication is required

   o  End user's authentication to authorization server is required but
      not specified

   o  User-agent is a web browser capable of executing a server-provided
      script to extract an access token from the response of the
      authorization server.  User-agent passes the access token to the
      client

   o  Authorization server

   o  Client

   o  User-agent

   protected resource on user's behalf.  User does not need to share
   authentication credentials with the client.

   (This use case covers the one specified in section Web App Profile of
   [draft-hardt-oauth] and in [RFC5849])

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Client is a Web application capable of interacting with the user-
      agent (typically a browser) and receiving requests from the
      authorization server (i.e., capable of acting as HTTP server)

   o  Client's registration with authorization server for identification
      and authentication is required

      entry method (e.g. game consoles or media server).  The client is
      able to poll the authorization server until the end user completes
      the authorization process

   o  Client's registration with authorization server for identification
      is required

   o  Client's interaction with user-agent requires end user's
      involvement (i.e., manual data entry by the end user)

   Password Profile of [draft-hardt-oauth])

3.2.  Use case of the draft Using OAuth for Recursive Delegation

   [draft-vrancken-oauth-redelegation]

3.2.1.  Content sharing

   Description:
   Enable organizing and sharing information among the end users.
   For example, a Web user (resource owner) can grant data access to a
   pre-defined set of users.  This can be done with the use of a special
   OAuth client - content manager - which serves as a proxy between the
   end-users and the Web servers that host the resources related to the
   project.  The content manager allows a user (the owner of the
   resources) to specify a set of the resources related to a project
   (e.g., by tagging) and a set of the clients and their access rights
   in respect to the resources.  The content manager may also enable
   searching of the related materials.

   Pre-conditions:
