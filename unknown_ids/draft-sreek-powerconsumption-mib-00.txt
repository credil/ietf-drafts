       MIB for Energy, Efficiency, Throughput and Carbon Emission
                draft-sreek-powerconsumption-mib-00.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a portion of Management Information Base (MIB)
   for the Energy consumption, Throughput, Efficiency and Carbon
   emission in a Network Element.  Energy,Throughput and Efficiency are
   required to calculate the carbon emission of the network element.

1.  Introduction

   The carbon emission for a device is calculated as a function of
   Energy Consumed (Power in Watts) and efficiency (which is dependent
   on throughput).  Mathematically the carbon emission is directly
   proportional to Energy Consumption Rate (ECR).  Again, depending on
   the utilization of the device, meaning fully utilized, half or idle
   the ECR will change.  For all practical purpose, the carbon emission
   from a device is calculated considering how much percentage of time
   the device has been utilized full, half and idle.  This document
   suggests MIb structures for all the parameters required for
   calculating the carbon emission of a device successfully.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410[RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Overview

   The global MIB variables defined are for the system as a whole and a
   table of MIBs are being defined for the indpendent devices within the
   system.  The table is meant for the systems whose independent module
   energy consumption and throughput can be measured.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the objects and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   o  powerGlobalEffeciencyPercentageFull,
      powerGlobalEffeciencyPercentageHalf,
      powerGlobalEffeciencyPercentageIdle - Changing these values will
      impact the calculations of carbon footprint of the whole device.

   o  powerGlobalEffeciencyPercentageFull,
      powerGlobalEffeciencyPercentageHalf,
      powerGlobalEffeciencyPercentageIdle - Changing these values will
      impact the calculation of carbon footprint of the individual
      resource in the device.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by GET
   and/or NOTIFY operations include:

   o  powerGlobalResourceType - This information will give the type of
      device.

   o  powerResourceType - This information will give the type of the
      individual resource in the device.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
   to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT

   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.


7.  IANA Considerations

   POWERCONSUMPTION-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA
   is requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the POWERCONSUMPTION-MIB
   module specified in this document.
