Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2007


1.  Introduction

   The scope of this document is to analyse security threats concerning
   a P2PSIP overlay architecture as described in the concepts and
   terminology for Peer-to-Peer SIP (P2PSIP) document [1] and list
   security requirements for the architecture and its components.  This
   document does not intend to propose solutions to overcome security
   threats, but it is more intended to list the security requirements
   that must be addressed in forthcoming P2PSIP specifications.  This
   document complements the P2PSIP protocol framework and requirements
   document [3].

2.  Definitions

   This section defines a number of concepts that are key to understand
   the rest of the document.

2.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

2.2.  A P2PSIP network entity

   A P2PSIP network entity is a user, peer, client, or other operative
   function or node that may become a part of a P2PSIP overlay.

2.3.  A P2PSIP system

   A P2PSIP system consists of a P2PSIP overlay as defined in [1] and
   one or more enrolment servers that issues unique identities and
   credentials that are used to authenticate and admit a P2PSIP network
   entity to the overlay and may provide an initial set of bootstrap
   nodes.

3.  Security threats

   This section analyses security threats in the Peer-to-Peer SIP
   reference model.

3.1.  Replay Attacks

   Replay attacks are a form of network attacks where a valid data
   transmission is repeated or delayed.  A badly behaving node may take
   an older message sent by another node, resend it to the overlay, and
   thus replace any newer data with the old information present in this
   message.  During those procedures, an attacker may be able to enroll
   credentials for himself, or replace existing entry in the P2PSIP
   overlay by an older entry.  Thus, the architecture must consider this
   issue in the process of both enrollment and modification of P2PSIP
   resource (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

3.2.  Message Insertion, Modification, Deletion

   The message insertion, modification, and deletion attacks are where
   an attacker is able to alter the messages being exchanged between two
   end points.  A badly behaving node may:

   o  change the data record in the overlay by changing incoming
      message,

   o  discard query messages by discarding incoming messages,

   o  generate incorrect responses to requests received from a legimite
      node that are directed to some other nodes.

   For example, the attack described in the last bullet above may lead
   to a lookup process being redirected to a malicious node or a
   requestor receiving corrupted data pointing to some other node.  This
   would cause the overlay to contain unauthorized or outdated
   information about a resource or corrupted data being returned to the
   requestor.  With these types of attacks the integrity of the P2PSIP
   system becomes compromised.  This includes both the enrollment
   procedure and data stored in the P2PSIP overlay.

   This means that an attacker not only can prevent access to P2PSIP
   resource (user) records, but can also degradate the performance of
   the P2PSIP system making it useless from the end-user perspective.
   The second problem is of high importance in P2PSIP overlays that
   store user's reachability data which is much more time-critical than
   content stored in file sharing networks.

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2007


3.3.  Man-In-The-Middle

   Man-in-the middle (m-i-m) attacks are prevalent in pairing and
   authentication procedures.  Thus, the architecture must consider this
   issue in the process of enrollment, as well as during modification of
   P2PSIP resource (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.  During
   communication m-i-m attacks may lead to data leakage and
   modification.  A badly behaving node can hijack a connection
   established between two legimite nodes, or just listen and/or modify
   messages exchanged between two nodes (as described in sections 3.1
   and 3.2).  For example an attacker may place two malicious nodes in
   the overlay.  One of the nodes would redirect/proxy queries to the
   second malicious node that would appear as a target node.

   The issue is prevailing in a deployment scenario where some peers act
   as SIP registrars or/and SIP proxies that allow a conventional SIP UA
   to access resources of the overlay.  In a distributed environment
   such as the P2PSIP overlay it is very difficult to trust all of peers
   in the overlay.  An unmodified SIP UA sends an SIP Invite request
   towards an unknown peer that acts as a SIP proxy.  If the SIP
   messages are not cryptographically protected, this peer may act
   maliciously and proxy a request to other than intended node or modify
   SDP messages in order to stay on the media path.  Similarly a peer
   that acts as SIP Registrar may modify registration information before
   it sends it to a peer that is responsible for storing the P2PSIP user
   record of a registering SIP UA.

   In a similar way if a bootstrap process is fully decentralised and a
   bootstrap node is not trusted or authentication of the bootstrap node
   is not possible, then the joining node can easily be attacked, e.g.
   it may be redirected to another overlay controlled by the attacker.

   However, by using well-established authentication protocols, the
   m-i-m threat can be mitigated.

3.4.  Offline Cryptographic Attacks

   The incentive to break a secure system dominates the effort to do so.
   It is likely that P2PSIP systems do not pose a likely target for
   attacks, and if state-of-the art security methods are used, the
   needed effort to break the system by breaking cryptography is very
   likely to be higher than by finding and exploiting software errors
   and vulnerabilities.

3.5.  Unauthorized Usage

   The basic notions of authentication and authorization, when
   implemented correctly and consistently SHOULD protect against



Matuszewski, et al.     Expires January 10, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2007


   unauthorized usage of the P2PSIP system.  However, the
   trustworthiness of an identity may be weak i.e. the enrollment system
   might be fairly open and allow devices and persons that wish to
   attack the system.  Thus, there is a significant threat of attacks
   from within the system.

   A peer may do a multitude of attacks towards the overlay including:

   o  ignoring, changing, and deleting records in DHT that is it
      responsible for,

   o  misbehaving during data lookups (ie, giving wrong node addresses,
      discarding queries)

   These attacks would cause DHT to contain unauthorized, outdated,
   and/or missing information about a resource as well as might cause
   lookups to fail.

3.6.  Inappropriate Usage

   As the lookup and routing in the P2PSIP essentially provides a
   distributed storage for P2PSIP resource (user) records, this can be
   used in an inappropriate manner.  If there is no access control to a
   resources stored in the overlay and any node can retrieve information
   stored in the overlay, an attacker may request data stored in the the
   P2PSIP resource (user) records and perform inappropriate usage
   attacks.  Definitely the individual services provided by P2PSIP
   (messaging, real-time communication) have their respective threat
   models regarding inappropriate use (Spam, viruses, ...) but these can
   be considered out of scope for this document.

3.7.  Denial of Service

   In the proposed P2PSIP architecture, the P2PSIP resource (user)
   records are not maintained in a central, trustworthy storage system,
   rather it is distributed among peers participating in the system.
   This implies that the presence of malicious peers can be considered
   to be probable rather than possible.  In cases where authentication
   in the overlay is weak or where the system is fairly open to new
   participants the "infiltration" is trivial (e.g., Sybil attack).

   If nodes in the overlay can freely choose peer IDs and easily modify
   previously selected peer IDs the attacker may use join-leave attacks
   to place a malicious peer intentionally at any location in overlay
   and obtain control of the location in the overlay where the attacked
   user or resource (e.g.  TURN@overlay.net) is registered.  A malicious
   peer may discard, modify the data it is supposed to store and may
   discard lookup requests or reply with incorrect entries to the



Matuszewski, et al.     Expires January 10, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2007


   incoming requests.

   However, DHTs typically distribute the the P2PSIP resource (user)
   records among its nodes in a fashion where the outcome (the storage
   node) is hard to predict and also copying of the P2PSIP resource
   (user) records to several nodes for increased robustness is the norm.
   Thus the infiltration, if done in a trivial manner, typically must be
   done with a fairly big number of nodes to achieve a probability of
   success in bringing down the system or at least denying service
   regarding selected peers and clients.

   The attacker may also try to register large number of resources to
   the P2PSIP overlay increasing processing load on the nodes that are
   responsible for storing the resources and limiting the overall
   capacity of the P2PSIP overlay network.  It may also try to register
   all popular names preventing the name holders from registering their
   prefered URIs.

   Another critical point where a D-o-S attack can be mounted is the
   enrollment system.  This is probably quite monolithic, and typical
   "network" D-o-S attacks (like SYN flooding) are probably possible in
   this domain.

3.8.  Communication security threats

   This document assumes that the actual SIP service implementation
   provides its own communication security, and that P2PSIP adds to that
   only in providing a means for the communication endpoints to
   establish a shared key for further security needs.  Otherwise, the
   communication security threats in that domain is out-of-scope for
   this discussion.

   As the intention is to modify the base P2P algorithm (e.g., DHT
   implementations) as little as possible, it can be assumed that the
   "storage facility and its communication" i.e. the DHT is unprotected.
   Instead, data stored there is protected independently of
   communication and where it is stored.

   The main places where communication security becomes an issue in the
   P2PSIP context is the enrollment process (where the actual
   communication mechanism may be out of scope) and the communication
   between a client and the corresponding peer or between peers.  The
   last ones are subject to all typical threats in this domain, however
   they have been individually considered in the earlier sections of
   this chapter.

4.  Security requirements

   This section describes requirements related to the security of a
   P2PSIP system.  We divided the requirements into user requirements
   and system requirements.

4.1.  User requirements

   The user wants available and reliable service that enables him to
   interact with other users and resources in a secure way.  This means
   that the P2PSIP system MUST provide:

   o  lookup and discovery of users and resources that is secure and
      reliable,

   o  certainty of user and resource identity,

   o  confidentiality and integrity of end-to-end multimedia
      communication,

   o  easy and secure enrolment to the P2PSIP system,

   o  privacy.

4.2.  System requirements

   In order for a P2PSIP system to function properly and that the end
   user gets a proper service, there are several aspects that the P2PSIP
   system must take in to account.

4.2.1.  Dependence of reachability of a centralized server

   Considering the nature of P2P in general, the dependence of
   reachability of a centralized server should be minimized.  There may
   be unavoidable situations such as the enrollment process, where this
   is not possible.  However, the normal functioning of connecting to as
   well as inserting, modifying, retrieving, and deleting of P2PSIP
   resource (user) records from the P2PSIP system should not depend on
   the reachability of a centralised server.

4.2.2.  Scalability

   P2PSIP security should scale from a small ad-hoc network to a network
   with hundred millions of network nodes and users.

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2007


4.2.3.  Preference of existing security mechanisms

   Although P2PSIP defines a new architecture, and thereby new
   interfaces and protocols, for security there are several standardized
   solutions for access control and communication security.  Using
   established protocols minimizes potential security loopholes that
   need to be patched later, and implementation is eased if chosen
   security protocols already are widely implemented and used.

4.2.4.  Requirements on a base P2P algorithm

   All of security operations should be specified in such a way that
   they do not impose new unnecessary requirements on a base P2P
   algorithm (e.g., DHT implementations) and limit its scalability.

4.2.5.  Node and user identification

   The P2PSIP system must preserve user and resource identities.  It
   must not be possible to steal a P2PSIP identity from another user.

   In order to prevent so-called Sybil attacks the attacker should not
   be able to easily register a unlimited number of IDs of his choice in
   the P2SIP overlay.  The P2PSIP system should be able to control ID
   assignment.  Once assigned, an ID or a set of IDs should be difficult
   to change.

   Because some attackers may try to use identities of another P2PSIP
   network entities it must be possible to verify the identity of
   another party.

4.2.6.  Enrollment

   The ease for users to enroll to a P2PSIP system should be ensured as
   said in the section 4.1.  The enrollment process defines the set of
   users and P2PSIP network entities that may participate in a P2PSIP
   system and issues them credentials.  This process is defined by the
   P2PSIP system, and the policy who can participate to is done during
   this process.  The enrolment process policy may define:

   o  how many and what user IDs and peer IDs an user or a network node
      may register,

   o  whether users are charged for the usage of the P2PSIP system,

   o  and how often they must re-new their subscription to the P2PSIP
      system.

   As it was indicated in [3] the enrollment process may take several

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2007


   measures in admitting a user or a network node to the P2PSIP system,
   for example:

   o  may require strong identity such as employment or provided by a
      trusted 3rd party or by the P2P operator,

   o  may charge for the enrollment,

   o  may apply reputation mechnisms.

   Although the user probably is the entity that enrolls to the P2PSIP
   system, the credentials that are the result of the enrollment are
   used to grant a device the right to function as a peer, client or any
   other operative function possible in the system.  Thus the security
   of enrollment also translates to the security of the device itself
   where the credentials are stored, and threats related to device
   security in general.

   OPEN ISSUES: Who enrols to the P2PSIP system only a user or also
   peers?  Do we need separate credentials for peers and users?  What
   happens if a user is an owner of two or more nodes e.g. two peer
   nodes or two clients?  Does each node requires a separate credential
   or only one credential is needed for all nodes that belong to a user?
   Can two devices be "logged on" at the same time?

4.2.7.  Replay attacks

   An attacker should not be able to repeat or delay valid data
   transmission during enrollment and modification of P2PSIP resource
   (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

4.2.8.  Data access

   An attacker should not be able to easily corrupt, delete, or
   overwrite data stored in P2PSIP resource (user) records as well as
   routing tables.  Only authorized users should be able to modify,
   delete or overwrite their P2PSIP resource (user) records in the
   P2PSIP system.  P2PSIP security should allow users and P2PSIP network
   entities to register the same resources (e.g.  TURN@overlay.net),
   however each entity should have rights only to its own part of a
   resource record.  In other words each entity should be able to
   perform the same operations on its own part of a resource record as
   in the case when a particular resurce belongs to only one user.

   The owner of the P2PSIP resource (user) records should be able to
   authorize other users and network entities to modify, delete their
   P2PSIP resource (user) records.

4.2.9.  Data validation

   First and foremost it should be possible to verify that the data
   stored in or retrieved from the P2PSIP overlay is authentic, i.e. was
   not tampered by unauthorized P2PSIP network entities.

   The peer that stores a P2PSIP resource (user) records should be able
   to validate the data received in the process of P2PSIP resource
   (user) record insertion and modification.

4.2.10.  Denial of Service (DOS) attacks

   It should not be possible to obtain control of the location in the
   overlay where the attacked user or resource is registered.  The
   P2PSIP architecture should make sure that data stored in a P2PSIP
   overlay is persistent, meaning that even if a number of nodes (but
   not all of nodes in the overlay) fails the data stored by those nodes
   should not be lost.  In addition the attacker should not be able to
   register unlimited number of resources in the overlay.

4.2.11.  Privacy

   The security of P2PSIP systems must guarantee privacy of the P2PSIP
   network participants.  The P2PSIP security should make an option for
   the users to indicate which other P2PSIP network entities can
   retrieve data stored in their P2PSIP resource (user) records.  This
   means that the owner of a P2PSIP resource (user) record or an
   authorised P2PSIP network entity should be able to limit the access
   to his own records, and this feature should be enforced by the P2P
   network.

   It should also be difficult to monitor who is communicating with a
   particular user, or retreieve any contextual data about the user
   without the user's explicit consent.  The P2PSIP network entities
   should be provided with option to encrypt data exchanged with other
   P2PSIP network entities.

4.2.12.  Detection and rejection of badly behaving nodes

   It should be possible to limit potential damage caused by
   malfunctioning and badly behaving nodes in a P2PSIP system.  As the
   policy taken by the P2PSIP system operator/community may be very
   liberal, any user can obtain the right to be a user of a P2PSIP
   system.  It may be that some users behave badly intentionally in
   which case it should be possible limit the impact of the badly
   behaving nodes on the overall system security.  It should be possible
   to identify badly behaving nodes, and exclude or reject them from the
   P2PSIP system.

4.2.13.  Summary of the system requirements

   P2PSIP system requirements related to security issues are summarized
   below:

   Req. 1: Dependence of reachability of a centralized server SHOULD be
   minimized.

   Req. 2: P2PSIP security SHOULD scale from a small ad-hoc network to a
   network with hundred millions of network nodes and users.

   Req. 3: Existing security mechanisms SHOULD be used as much as
   possible to protect P2PSIP functions, and avoid the need for
   standardizing new mechanisms.

   Req. 4: Security requirements on the base P2P algorithm (e.g., DHT
   implementations) used in P2PSIP SHOULD be minimized and SHOULD NOT
   limit its scalability.

   Req. 5: An enrollment process MUST be secured.

   Req. 6: The registered identities in a P2PSIP overlay MUST be
   preserved.  The attacker should not be able to steal identity from
   another user.

   Req. 7: The enrollment process SHOULD make it difficult for an
   attacker to register many identites in a P2PSIP overlay and easily
   modify the registered identities.

   Req. 8: It should be difficult to select a particular peer ID e.g.
   peer ID assignment process SHOULD introduce some degree of randomness
   to peer identites.

   Req. 9: It MUST be possible to authenticate P2PSIP network entities.

   Req. 10: It MUST NOT be possible to repeat or delay valid data
   transmission during enrollment and modification of P2PSIP resource
   (user) records.

   Req. 11: The P2PSIP security MUST support integrity protection of the
   data being inserted or retrieved to/from an overlay.

   Req. 12: The P2PSIP network entities MUST be provided with an option
   to encrypt data exchanged with other P2PSIP network entities.

   Req. 13: Only authorized users and P2PSIP network entities MUST be
   able to join the P2PSIP system and insert, modify, delete or
   overwrite P2PSIP resource (user) records in the P2PSIP system.

   Req. 14: If many users or P2PSIP network entities register the same
   resource in the P2PSIP overlay, each entity MUST have only rights to
   its own part of a resource record.

   Req. 15: An owner of P2PSIP resource (user) record MAY indicate which
   users or network entities can retrieve, modify, and delete data
   stored in their P2PSIP resource (user) records.  P2PSIP peer SHOULD
   support access control set by the owner of P2PSIP resource (user)
   record.

   Req. 16: P2PSIP overlay protocols MUST be designed such a way so that
   the effect of DOS attacks on the P2PSIP overlay are being minimized.

   Req. 17: It SHOULD be possible to limit the impact of the badly
   behaving P2PSIP nodes on the overall system security.  There SHOULD
   be an option to identify malfunctioning or badly behaving nodes, and
   exclude or reject them from the P2PSIP system.
