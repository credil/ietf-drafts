     Security on Demand for Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6
                        draft-bajko-mext-sod-02

Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols require the
   signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent to be
   secured.  However security for the user plane/traffic is optional and
   is a choice left to the mobile node.  This document proposes
   extensions to Mobile IPv6 signaling which enables the user plane
   traffic to be secured on a need or on-demand basis.  The mobile node
   or the home agent can request at any time security for the user plane
   traffic.  Security for user plane traffic can be triggered as a
   result of policy or, mobility or, at the user's choice.

Internet-Draft       Mobile IPv6: Security on demand           July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 [RFC5555] provide
   the option to secure the user plane data between the Mobile Node (MN)
   and and the Home Agent (HA) when needed.  The user plane traffic
   between the MN and HA is secured via an IPsec security association
   (SA) which is established between them specifically for the purpose
   of user plane data.  IPsec is used for securing the user plane
   traffic when the security between the MN and HA is based on IPsec.
   However security between the MN and HA could also be enabled via
   other protocols.  The MEXT WG is evaluating on an experimental basis
   various alternatives to IPsec such as the one specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls].

   As per the current specifications for MIP6 and DSMIP6, security of
   the user plane traffic is optional.  When the MN is attached to 3G/4G
   network such as HSPA, LTE or EV-DO, the MN may not require security
   for the user plane traffic since these networks already provide
   ciphering over the air-interface and deploy hop-by-hop security,
   which makes these networks secure.  However the MN may attach to less
   secure or unsecured accesses such as wireless lan (WLAN) or it may
   roam in countries where the user may prefer the data between the MN
   and the HA to be encrypted (even when using cellular accesses).
   There is no solution in the protocol specification today which
   provides the capability to trigger the security for the user plane
   traffic on a need basis.

   The problem that is being addressed is the triggering of security for
   user plane traffic between the MN and HA on a need basis.  Policy
   information at the MN or information provided to the MN via other
   means at the time of attachment may assist the MN to determine if
   security needs to be enabled for user plane traffic.  The user may
   also consciously decide to enable security when attached to certain
   networks.  Furthermore, the operator of HA may have policies that
   define when user plane security is to be used.  This document
   describes a mechanism which can enable security for user plane
   traffic on-demand or need.

   An obvious implementation alternative would be to encrypt user plane
   traffic always (as is commonly done with VPN use-cases), but that
   would unnecessarily consume resources on the HA.  For the HA operator
   there is clear economic incentive to encrypt user-plane data only
   when necessary.  The MIP6/DSMIP6 protocols only provide a means to
   secure the user plane traffic but do not provide any mechanisms by
   which the security is triggered as a result of mobility or the MN
   attaching via different access networks.

   As per the current MIP6 [RFC3775] specification, only the MN has the

   ability to enable security for user-plane traffic.  The HA has no
   ability to force the MN to secure user traffic.


2.  When to apply Security to user plane traffic

   An MN MUST have security for the control plane messages.  Hence all
   signaling between the MN and HA are secured.  The MN establishes an
   IPsec SA between itself and the assigned HA prior to sending a
   Binding Update.  However, the MN is not required to establish an SA
   for securing the user plane traffic.  It is up to the MN whether it
   establishes SAs for the control plane and user plane at the same time
   or if it only establishes the control plane SA.  The MN may choose to
   establish the SA for user plane traffic at any time [RFC4877].

   When the MN attaches to an access network, it is usually able to
   determine if the access network is viewed as trusted or untrusted.
   The MN can make this determination, for example, based on the PLMN ID
   of the cellular network; or wifi_SSID/MAC_address of a wifi network;
   or location information provided by the MN, or user input.  The MN
   has either a stored policy about trusted and untrusted access
   networks or it may be provided with such information from policy
   stores such as the ANDSF [23.402] or AAA server at the time of
   network attachment.  An interface exists generally between the policy
   store such as AAA or ANDSF and the Home Agent (HA).  If the MN is
   attached to an access network which is viewed as trusted or where
   encryption is not allowed, the MN chooses not to secure the user
   plane traffic.

   If the MN is attached to an access network which is not trusted, the
   MN may want to secure its user plane traffic.  The HA may also be
   able to determine from the source address of the binding update (BU)
   message the access network to which the MN is currently attached.
   Based on this information, the HA may require that the user plane
   traffic be encrypted on the MN-HA link.

   The MN or HA can determine when to use security for the user plane
   traffic using static policies or dynamic policies which can be
   obtained at the time of network attachment; or e.g. which are
   provisioned and maintained on a smartcard (eg, a UICC or SIM). 3GPP
   policy stores such as the ANDSF can also provide information about
   the access networks to which an MN is attached.  Location of the MN
   can also be used as input.


3.  Triggering user plane traffic security

   This document proposes extensions to MIPv6/DSMIPv6 protocol, allowing

   the MN to signal to the HA its preference for user plane traffic
   security, and for the HA to override that preference based on the
   policy settings.

   One of the reserved bits of the Binding Update [RFC3775] message is
   defined to be the 'Security' flag "S", and one of the reserved bits
   of the Binding Acknowledgement [RFC3775] message is also defined to
   be the 'Security' flag "S".

   The MN sends a binding update with the "S" flag set to 0, when
   indicating that the user plane traffic will not be encrypted.  The HA
   processes the binding update message from the MN and sends a response
   acknowledging the request and setting the flag for user plane traffic
   security to Null indicating to the MN that the traffic on the link
   between the MN and HA will not be encrypted.

   The MN sends a binding update with the "S" flag set to 1, when
   indicating that prefers the user plane traffic be encrypted.  The HA
   processes the binding update message from the MN and sends a response
   acknowledging the request and setting the flag for user plane traffic
   security to 1, indicating to the MN that the traffic on the link
   between the MN and HA will be encrypted.

   The HA MAY always overwrite the MN's security preference on the user
   plane traffic indicated in the Binding Update message, by setting the
   "S" flag in the Binding Acknowledgement to a different value.  The MN
   SHALL always follow the indication in the Binding Acknowledgement to
   set the security of the MN to HA user plane traffic.


4.  Extensions to Mobile IPv6

4.1.  Extensions to Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement

   corresponding Binding Acknowledgement message:

4.2.  New binding Update Mobility Options

   A new mobility Options for carrying location of the MN is defined to
   be used in a Binding Update message with the following format:



        0                   1                   2                   3

                           Figure 3: MN location

   Type: tbd

   N set to 1 indicates that the data contains a location in XML format
   as defined in RFC5139, N set to zero indicates that the data part
   contains an http URI pointing to a resource where the MN uploaded its
   location


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document will require actions on the part of IANA to assign
   values for the new binding update mobility option.


6.  Security Considerations

   This I-D introduces extensions to Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.
   There is no impact to the security model and architecture that is
   currently specified for MIP6 [RFC3775].  The extensions specified in
   this document do not introduce any new vulnerabilities of threats to
   the security architecture of Mobile IPv6.


7.  Summary

   Security for the user plane traffic between the MN and Home agent can
   be switched on or off as a result of policy, location or, request by
   the user.  The ability to control and trigger the security for the
   user plane traffic rests with the MN as well as the HA with the HA
   having the final say.
