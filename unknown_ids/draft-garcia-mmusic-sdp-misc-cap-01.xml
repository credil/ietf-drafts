      <t>
	SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism
	framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport
	protocols and attributes. This framework has been extended with
	a Media capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows
	endpoints to negotiate additional media-related
	capabilities. This negotiation is embedded into the
	widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
	This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to
	allow endpoints to negotiate a number of miscellaneous SDP
	capabilities. In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to
	negotiate media titles ("i=" line for each media), connection
	data ("c=" line), and media bandwidth ("b=" line).
      </t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The <xref target="RFC4566">Session Description Protocol
	(SDP)</xref> is intended for describing multimedia sessions
	for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation,
	and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP has been
	extended with a <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation">capability
	negotiation mechanism framework </xref> that allows the
	endpoints to negotiate capabilities, such as support for <xref
	target="RFC3550">Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) </xref> and
	<xref target="RFC3711">Secure Realtime Transport Protocol
	(SRTP) </xref>. The <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities"> SDP media
	capabilities </xref> provides negotiation capabilities to
	media lines as well.
      </t>
      <t>
	This negotiation is embedded into the widely used <xref
	target="RFC3264"> SDP offer/answer procedures </xref>. This
	memo provides the means to negotiate further capabilities than
	those specified in the <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation"> SDP
	capability negotiation mechanism framework </xref> and the
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities"> SDP
	media capabilities </xref>. In particular, this memo provides
	a mechanism to negotiate media titles ("i="), connection data
	("c="), and media bandwidth ("b="). It would have been
	possible to define a mechanism to negotiate media encryption
	keys ("k="). However, the usage of the media encryption keys
	("k=") is highly discouraged in favour of other existing more
	sophisticated mechanisms. Therefore, we are not providing a 
	mechanism to provide capabilities for media encryption keys
	("k=") at this stage.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	Since the three added capabilities are highly unconnected, it
	is not expected that implementations will  
	support all three at the same time. Instead, it is expected
	that applications will choose their needed capability for
	their specific purpose. Due to this, we are writing the
	normative part pertaining to each capability in a
	self-contained section. In particular, <xref
	target="sec-bw-cap"/> describes the bandwidth capability
	extension, <xref target="sec-conn-cap"/> describes the
	connection data capability extension, and <xref
	target="sec-info-cap"/> describes the information capability
	extension.  Separate option tags are defined for each capability.

	  The <xref

	  Capability Negotiation Framework </xref> and the <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities"> SDP media
	  capabilities </xref> specify attributes for negotiating SDP
	  capabilities. These documents specify new attributes (e.g.,
	  'acap', 'tcap', 'mcap') for achieving their purpose. In this
	  document we define a number of new additional capability
	  attributes for SDP lines of the the general form:
	</t>
        <t><list>
          <t>type=value</t>
	</list></t>
        
	<t>
	  for types "i", "c", and "b".  The corresponding
	  capability attributes are defined as "icap", "ccap", and
	  "bcap", respectively.
	</t>
        <t>
	  From the sub-rules of "a=" line in <xref
	  target="RFC4566">SDP</xref>, SDP attributes are of the
	  form:</t>

<figure><artwork type="abnf">
attribute          = (att-field ":" att-value) / att-field
att-field          = token

          </artwork></figure>

        <t>
	  Capability attributes use only the 'att-field:att-value'
	  form.
	</t>
        <t>
        The new attributes may be referenced in potential configurations
        ("a=pcfg") or in latent configurations ("a=lcfg"), as productions
        conforming to the extension-config-list as defined in <xref

        <t>The optional "+" is used to indicate that the entire
        configuration, not just the parameter, must be ignored if the
        parameter is not supported.
        The attributes may be referenced in actual configurations as
        productions conforming to the sel-extension-config defined in

        <t>
	  It is not the intention of this work to negotiate these new
	  capabilities at the session level, rather only at the media
	  level.  Therefore, capabilities referenced by any
	  configuration attribute MUST appear at the media level when
	  a configuration is "converted" to a corresponding media
	  block.  For this reason, the "icap" attribute is called the
	  "media information capability". Specific values for each new
	  attribute are described below.

          <t>
	    According to <xref target="RFC4566">RFC 4566</xref> the
	    bandwidth field denotes the proposed bandwidth to be used
	    by the session or media. For what it concerns this memo,
	    we focus on the bandwidth at the media level. This
	    bandwidth field is specified in <xref target="RFC4566">RFC
	    4566</xref>  according to the following syntax:
	  </t>

	  <t><list>
	    <t>b=&lt;bwtype&gt;:&lt;bandwidth&gt;</t>
	  </list></t>

	  <t>
	    where &lt;bwtype&gt; is an alphanumeric modifier giving
	    the meaning of the &lt;bandwidth&gt; figure. 
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    In this document, we define a new capability attribute:
	    the bandwidth capability attribute "bcap". This attribute
	    lists bandwidth as capabilities according to
	    the following definition:
	  </t>

          <t><list>

	    of the bandwidth capability, and the other elements are as
	    defined for the "b=" field in <xref
	    target="RFC4566"></xref>.
	  </t>

          <t>
	    This format satisfies the general attribute production rules in
	    <xref target="RFC4566"></xref> according to the following <xref target="RFC5234">

	  <t>
	    <xref target="RFC4566">RFC 4566</xref> provides for the
	    existence of an information field expressed in the format
	    of the "i=" line, which can appear either at the
	    session level or at the media level. An "i=" line that is
	    present at the session level is known as the "session
	    name", and its purpose is to convey a human-readable
	    textual information about the session. We don't see much
	    usage of capabilities related to the "i=" line at the
	    session level.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    The "i=" line in SDP can also appear at the media level,
	    in which case it is used to provide human-readable information
          about the media stream to which it is
	    related, e.g., it may indicate the purpose of the media
	    stream.  The information field is not to be confused
          with the label attribute ("a=label:...), <xref target="RFC4574">
          </xref>) which provides a machine-readable tag.
          It is foreseen that applications
	    declaring capabilities related to different configurations
          of a media stream may need to provide different identifying
          information for each of those configurations.
	    That is, a party might offer alternative media configurations
          for a stream, each of which represents a different presentation of
          the same or similar information.  For example, an audio stream
          might offer English or Spanish configurations, or a video stream
          might offer a choice of video source such as speaker camera, group
          camera, or document viewer.
          The information capability is needed to inform
          the answering user in order to select the proper choice, and the label
          is used to inform the offering machine which choice the answerer
          has selected. Hence,
	    there is value in defining a mechanism to provide information
	    of media streams as capabilities.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    According to <xref target="RFC4566">SDP </xref>, the
	    media label has the following syntax:
	  </t>
          <t><list>
            <t>"i="text</t>
	  </list></t>
	  <t>
	    where "text" represents a human-readable text indicating
	    the purpose of the media stream.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    In this document we define a new capability attribute: the
	    information media capability, "icap". This attribute
	    lists information media labels as capabilities, according
	    to the following definition:
	  </t>
	  <t><list>
            <t>"a=icap:" info-cap-num 1*WSP text</t> 
	  </list></t> 

	  <t> where &lt;info-cap-num&gt; is the ordinal identifier of
	  the particular media information capability and &lt;text&gt;
	  is a human-readable text that indicates the purpose of the
	  media stream it is supposed to characterize.</t>

          <t>As an example, one might use:</t>
          <t><list>
            <t>a=icap:1 Document Camera</t>
            </list></t>
          <t>to represent a purpose of a media stream identified with
	  the capability number 1.</t>
	  <t>
	    The media information capability attribute satisfies the
	    general attribute production rules in <xref
	    target="RFC4566"></xref> according to the following <xref target="RFC5234">
	    Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) </xref> syntax:
	  </t>
          <figure><artwork type="abnf">
att-field       = "icap"
att-value       = info-cap-num 1*WSP text
                            ; text is defined in RFC 4566
info-cap-num    = 1*DIGIT   ; integer between 1 and 2^31-1

	    <t>
	      The <xref
	      target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation">SDP
	      Capability Negotiation Framework</xref> provides for the
	      existence of the "pcfg" and "acfg" attributes, which can
	      carry one or more potential configurations to be
	      negotiated. The concept is extended by the the <xref
	      target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities"> Media
	      Capabilities Negotiation</xref> with an "lcfg" attribute
	      that conveys latent configurations.
	    </t>
	    <t> 
	      In this document, we define an &lt;info-config-list&gt;
            parameter to be used to convey  information capabilities in
            a potential or latent configuration.  This parameter is
            defined as an &lt;extension-config-list&gt; with the following
            associations:</t>
           <t><list>
              <t>ext-cap-name          = "i"</t>
              <t>ext-cap-list          = info-cap-list</t>
              </list></t>
           <t>
             This leads to the following definition for the information capability
             parameter:
	    </t>
	    <figure anchor="fig-info-cfg-syntax"
		    title="Syntax of the information capability parameter in lcfg and pcfg attributes">
	   <artwork type="abnf">
extension-config-list = info-config-list
info-config-list      = "i=" info-cap-list
info-cap-list         = info-cap-num *(BAR info-cap-num)
info-cap-num          = 1*DIGIT   ; 1 to 2^32-1 inclusive
                         ; BAR defined in SDP capabilities

	 </figure>

	    <t>
	      Each potential capability configuration contains a
	      single information capability attribute number where
	      'info-cap-num' is the information
	      capability number defined explicitly earlier in this
	      document, and hence must be between 1 and 2^31-1 (both
	      included).  The information capability allows the
	      expression of only a single capability in each alternative,
	      since no more than a
	      single information field is permitted per media
	      block. Nevertheless, it is still allowed to express
	      alternative potential information configurations
	      separated by a vertical bar ("|").

	  <section title="Option Tag">
          <t>
            At present, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which
            the 'icap' attribute must be supported or the offer must be
            rejected.  In most cases, if the icap attribute or its contents
            were to be ignored,
            an offered configuration could still be chosen based on other
            criteria such as configuration numbering.  However, one might
            imagine an SDP offer that contained English and Spanish potential
            configurations for an audio stream.  The session might be 
            unintelligible if the choice is based on configuration numbering,
            rather than informed user selection.
            Based on such considerations,
            it may well prove useful to announce the ability to use the
            icap attribute and its contents to select media configurations,
            or to inform the user about the selected configuration(s).
            Therefore,  we define a new option tag of
	      "icap-v0" that identifies support for the media information
	      capability. This option tag SHOULD be added to
	      other existing option tags present in the "csup" and/or
	      "creq" attributes in SDP, according to the procedures
	      defined in the <xref
	      target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation">SDP
	      Capability Negotiation Framework </xref>.  The discusion
            above suggests that "icap-v0" will typically appear in a
            "csup" attribute, but rarely in a "creq" attribute.

	    The icap, ccap, and bcap attributes can appear at
	    the session level and/or at the media level, but MUST be
	    interpreted as a media-level capability.  To avoid
	    confusion, the &lt;type-attr-num&gt; for each line must be
	    unique across all capability attributes of the same type
	    within the entire session description.  As described
	    below, these capability attributes may be referenced by
	    acfg, pcfg and/or lcfg attributes.

	     To simplify the construction of SDP records, given the

	     that do not support capabilities negotiation, we define
	     some simple field-replacement rules for those fields
	     invoked by potential or latent configurations.  In
	     particular, any i-field or c-field invoked by a
	     configuration MUST replace the corresponding field, if
	     present at the base media level.  Any b-field invoked by
	     a configuration MUST replace any b-field of the same
	     bandwidth type at the media level.
