Internet-Draft    Framework for Region Boundary Control       March 2010


1.  Introduction

   PCE can determine regions' boundaries.  Without cooperating with VNTM
   or policy configuration, a intermediate LSR has to determine regions'
   boundaries by using the IGP database and ERO as described in
   [RFC4206] in order to trigger the lower layer signaling.  A
   centralized routing and distributed signaling application is foreseen
   in the PCE architecture.  Without any or enough TED within the
   intermediate LSR, it could not determine regions' boundaries during
   the signaling.

   This document defines the framework for explicit control of region
   boundary in PCE-based inter-layer architecture.


2.  Explicit Control of Region Boundary

   PCE can determine regions' boundaries.  After PCE compute an end-to-
   end paths across multi-layer, multi-layer EROs must be carried in
   PCRep and Path message in terms of RFC5623.  In order to explicit
   control of regions' boundaries, a new object (ERBO- Explicit Region
   Boundary Object) could be introduced to be carried in PCRep and Path
   message.  Regions' boundaries should be carried in ERBO.
   [draft-fuxh-ccamp-region-boundary-explicit-control-rsvp-ext-00]
   defines the RSVP-TE signaling extension for explicit control of
   region boundary during the signaling procedure.
   [draft-fuxh-pce-region-boundary-explicit-control-pcep-ext-00] deinfes
   the PCEP protocol extension for explicit control of region boundary
   in PCE-based inter-layer architecture.


3.  Explicit Control Model of Region Boundary

3.1.  Explicit Region Control in Single PCE Inter-Layer

   The process of creating a LSP from H1 to H6 is as follows:

   1.  H1 sends a route request to PCE,and PCE responses to H1 with ERO
       = {H1,H2,L3,L4,H5, H6} and ERBO = {H2,H5}.

   2.  H1 Sends Path to H2 with ERO = {H2,L3,L4,H5,H6} and ERBO = {H2,
       H5}.

   3.  After H2 receivs the Path message, H2 confirm that it is the
       initiator of lower layer LSP in terms of the ERBO, and extracts
       the complete route of the lower layer LSP in terms of the other
       end of the region.

   4.  Then H2 starts the creation of lower layer LSP, the route is
       H2,L3,L4,H5.

   5.  After the creation of the lower layer LSP, the Higher-Layer LSP's
       creation is to be continued.  And the ERO and ERBO in the Path
       message is cut out.

3.2.  Explicit Region Control in Multiple PCE Inter-Layer

   The process of creating a LSP from H1 to H10 is as follows:

   1.   H1 sends a route request to PCE Ho.  PCE Ho computes a multi-
        layer path with inter-communication with PCE Lo, and responses
        to H1 with ERO = {H1,H2,L3,M1,M2,L4,H5,H6,L7,L8,H9,H10} and ERBO
        ={H2,H5,L3,L4,H6,H9}.

   2.   H1 Sends Path to H2 with ERO =
        {H2,L3,M1,M2,L4,H5,H6,L7,L8,H9,H10}, ERBO = {H2,H5,L3,L4,H6,H9}

   3.   After H2 receives the Path, H2 is to create lower layer LSP with
        ERO = {H2,L3,M1,M2,L4,H5}.

   4.   H2 Sends Path to L3 with ERO = {L3,M1,M2,L4,H5} and ERBO =
        {L3,L4}.

   5.   After L3 receives the Path, L3 is to create lower layer LSP with
        ERO = {L3,M1,M2,L4}.

   6.   L3 Sends Path to M1 with ERO = {M1,M2,L4} and ERBO = NULL.

   7.   After the creation of the lower layer LSP between L3 and L4, L3
        continues to send Path to L4 with ERO = {L4,H5} and ERBO = NULL.

   8.   After the creation of the lower layer LSP between H2 and H5, H2
        continues to send Path to H5 with ERO = {H5,H6,L7,L8,H9,H10} and
        ERBO = {H6,H9}.

   9.   After H6 receives the Path, H6 create the lower layer LSP with
        ERO = {H6,L7,L8,H9} and ERBO = NULL.

   10.  After the creation of the lower layer LSP between H6 and H9, the
        higher layer LSP's creation is to be continued.

   The process of creating a LSP from H1 to H10 is as follows:

   1.   H1 sends a route request to PCE Ho.  PCE Ho computes a multi-
        layer path without inter-communication with PCE Lo, and
        responses to H1 with ERO = {H1,H2,M3,M8,H9,H10} and ERBO
        ={H2,H9}.

   2.   H1 Sends Path to H2 with ERO = {H2,M3,M8,H9,H10} and ERBO =
        {H2,H9}.

   3.   After H2 receives the Path, H2 is to create lower layer LSP with
        ERO = {H2,M3,M8,H9}.

   4.   H2 Sends Path to M3,with ERO = {M3,M8,H9} and ERBO = NULL.

   5.   M3 consults the PCE Lo with responsibility for the lower-layers
        network.  PCE Lo computes the route to expand the loose hop
        route (i.e., M3 and M8) in the higher-layer LSP and responses to
        M3 with ERO = {M3,L4,L5,L6,L7,M8}, ERBO ={L4,L7}.

   6.   M3 Sends Path to L4, with ERO = {L4,L5,L6,L7,M8}, ERBO =
        {L4,L7}.

   7.   L4 Sends Path to L5, with ERO = {L5,L6,L7} and ERBO = NULL.

   8.   After the creation of the lower layer LSP between L4 and L7, L4
        continues to send Path to L7 with ERO = {L7,M8} and ERBO = NULL.

   9.   After the creation of the lower layer LSP between M3 and M8, M3
