1. Introduction

   When RBridges are deployed in a real network, a number of tools are
   necessary for error detection/reporting and diagnostic purpose.
   [RBridgeOAM] has already defined traceroute, unicast ping, and error
   reporting tools. This document describes multi-destination ping tool
   in detail.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The same terminology and acronyms are used in this document as in
   [RF6325].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Multi-destination RBridge Ping

   In an RBridge campus, it is not necessary that unicast and multi-
   destination traffic following the same path between same ingress and
   egress RBridges. Section 4.1.2 of [RBridgeOAM] specified Ping tools
   for connectivity check between two RBridges along unicast path. For
   diagnostic purpose it is desirable to check the connectivity between
   two RBridges along a particular distribution tree.

   It may be interesting to inspect who are the egressing nodes of a
   distribution tree especially when the tree is pruned by VLAN ID.
   Egressing node here refers to an RBridge that is appointed forwarder
   for the Inner.VLAN ID of the frame. Instead of checking the
   connectivity of all egressing nodes of the tree, checking can be
   constraint on a specified list of nicknames. If some specified nodes
   do not reply for a multi-destination ping, we may use per hop
   traceroute to diagnose the fault further.

   Though it would be mostly desirable to check on the egressing nodes
   as they are the ending point of the TRILL data frame along a
   distribution tree pruned by VLAN ID, we still want to give the
   flexibility that checking on transit nodes allows.

3.1. Sending echo request for multi-destination ping

   The originating RBridge sends an Echo Request with Long Format (see
   Section 5.1). The inner frame header and TRILL header fields are as
   follows,

   o Inner.MacSA: MAC address of RBridge originating the echo request
   o Inner.MacDA: All-Egress-RBridges
   o Inner.VLAN ID: default to 1. It can be any valid VLAN ID number.
   o Ingress RBridge Nickname: nickname of RBridge originating the Echo
   Request with Long Format
   o Egress RBridge Nickname: nickname of a distribution tree

Internet-Draft        Rbridges: OAM more tools             August 2011


   o M bit: 1
   o Hop Count: default to maximum value 0x3F. It can be any value which
   is believed to be larger than the number of hops from ingress RBridge
   to the most distant RBridge in the tree.

   The RBridge Channel Header fields is as follows,

   o CHV (Channel Header Version):  zero.
   o Channel Protocol: 0x004 (Echo) (following [RBridgeOAM])
   o Flags: The SL and NA bits SHOULD be zero, the MH bit SHOULD be one
   o ERR: zero.

   Echo Request with Long Format sent by originating RBridge MUST
   include a Target RBridges TLV (see section 6.1). If the ping needs to
   be performed on every egressing RBridge, "Number of Target RBridges"
   field MUST set to zero which means unspecified target and 'E' flag in
   Echo Request with Long format MUST be one. Otherwise "Number of
   Target RBridges" fields should be set properly according to the
   number of real targets that originating RBridge wants to ping and 'E'
   flag can be one or zero depending on if originating RBridge wants to
   make sure the target RBridge is an egressing RBridge or just a
   transit RBridge for Inner.VLAN ID.

   Originating RBridge MAY include Jitter TLV (see section 6.2) in the
   echo request in order to randomize the delay of the replying echo
   message from multiple RBridges.

3.2. Receiving echo request for multi-destination ping

   RBridges are expected to receive the Echo Request with Long Format
   for multi-destination RBridge ping application. The 'M' bit is one
   and Hop Count should be large enough to avoid the Hop Count Error. It
   is like a normal multi-destination data frame.

   If 'Reply Mode' field is zero, RBridge will not generate any echo
   reply.

   Target RBridges TLV MUST be examined. If there is one or more
   specified Target RBridge Nickname in the TLV, RBridge should scan
   through the list. If it owns any one of the specified nicknames or
   the target is unspecified (i.e. Number of Target RBridges is zero),
   the following is performed.

Internet-Draft        Rbridges: OAM more tools             August 2011


   o If 'E' flag is zero, RBridge generates echo reply described in
   section 3.3

   o If 'E' flag is one and RBridge is the appointed forwarder of
   Inner.VLAN ID, RBridge generates echo reply described in section 3.3

   o If 'E' flag is one and RBridge is not the appointed forwarder of
   Inner.VLAN ID, RBridge does nothing if the target is unspecified
   otherwise RBridge should send an Error Report described in section 7.

3.3. Sending echo reply for multi-destination ping

   After receiving Echo Request with Long Format for multi-destination
   RBridge ping, an RBridge will generate an Echo Reply with Long Format
   when it meets the criteria of section 3.2.

   The inner frame header and TRILL header fields are as follows,

   o Inner.MacSA: MAC address of RBridge generating echo reply
   o Inner.MacDA: All-Egress-RBridges
   o Inner.VLAN ID: same as Inner.VLAN ID in received echo request to
   which the echo reply responds
   o Ingress RB Nickname: nickname of RBridge generating the echo reply.
   o Egress RBridge Nickname: ingress RBridge nickname in received frame
   containing the echo request to which the echo reply responds
   o M bit: 0
   o Hop Count: default to maximum value 0x3F. It can be any value which
   is believed to be larger than the number of hops from ingress to
   egress RBridge.

   The RBridge Channel Header fields is as follows,

   o CHV (Channel Header Version):  zero.
   o Channel Protocol: 0x004 (Echo) (defined by [RBridgeOAM])
   o Flags: The SL and NA bits SHOULD be zero, the MH bit SHOULD be one
   o ERR: zero.

   Sequence Number, Reply Mode, Flags and TimeStamp Sent fields in Echo
   Reply with Long Format are same values as those in corresponding
   fields of echo request to which the echo reply responds. TimeStamp
   Received field should be set as specified in section 5.2. Incoming
   Port ID TLV and Outgoing Port ID TLV MUST be included [RBridgeOAM].

Internet-Draft        Rbridges: OAM more tools             August 2011


   If Jitter TLV is present, echo reply MUST be delayed for transmission
   for a random number between zero and jitter time in milliseconds. It
   should be noted that when jitter is used the round trip time should
   not be calculated based on the difference between the arriving time
   of echo reply and the value of "TimeStamp sent" in the replying frame.

4. Unicast RBridge Ping with Long Format

   Though it is not always necessary, we may also use Echo Request/Reply
   with Long Format for unicast RBridge ping tool. When it is used for
   unicast RBridge Ping, egress nickname should be the target nickname
   that the originating RBridge wants to ping. M bit in TRILL header
   must be zero. Target RBridges TLV and Jitter TLV SHOULD not be
   included.

      o  Sequence Number: An arbitrary 28-bit unsigned integer used to
   aid in matching reply messages to echo requests.  It MAY be zero.
      o  Reply Mode: Default is 2. It can take one of the following
   values.
            1 - Do not reply
            2 - Reply with TRILL Echo Reply with Long Format
      o  Flags: A bit vector with the following format. Now only E flag
   is defined (E means egress). When E flag is set, it indicates that
   only the egressing RBridges of the distribution tree should give echo
   reply. Egressing RBridge means it is an appointed forwarder for the
   Inner.VLAN ID.

             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+



      o  Number of Target RBridges: number of nicknames specified in the
   following fields, the maximum number is 127. If it is 0, it implies
   the unspecified target, i.e. all receiving RBridges are potential
   target RBridges. Note it does not simply mean all the receiving
   RBridges should respond with an echo reply. Other constraints may
   apply.

      o  Target RBridge Nickname: Nickname of an Target RBridge. Owner
   of the nickname is expected to respond with an Echo Reply but other
   constraints may apply.

6.2. Jitter

             | 0| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|13|14|15|
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


      o  Jitter time: Set to the upper bound of the jitter period in
   milliseconds. A responding node SHOULD wait a random amount of time
   between zero milliseconds and the value specified.

   This TLV MAY appear in an Echo Request with Long format. It SHOULD
   NOT be present in echo reply messages.

7. Error Notification

   A new error sub-code should be defined. When a RBridge receives an
   Echo Request with Long Format, if it finds 'E' Flag is set and its
   nickname is listed in "Target RBridges" TLV while it is not the
   appointed forwarder of the Inner.VLAN ID, an error notification
   should be generated containing 'Target is not an egress' error sub-
   code. No echo reply SHOULD be generated in this case.

   It is a Warning error with error type 2. Sequence Number of 'Target
   is not an egress' error notification MUST be same as sequence number
   of Echo Request with Long Format causing this error. It sub-code is
   suggested below.

   97(TBD): Target is not an egress. 'E' Flag is set but target node is
   not an appointed forwarder for Inner.VLAN ID.

   Ingress nickname of this error notification is the nickname of the
   RBridge generating the error and egress nickname is same as the
   ingress nickname in echo request causing the error. Incoming port ID
   and outgoing port ID TLVs may be included. Target RBridges TLV copied
   from Echo Request with Long Format causing the error MUST be included.
   The payload MUST also include the TRILL header of the frame causing
   the error.

8. Security Considerations

   Security vulnerabilities raised in [RBridgeOAM] also applies in
   multi-destination RBridge ping in this document. Same mechanism can
   be used to prevent or alleviate the security issues.

9. IANA Considerations

   New error notification sub-code needs to be allocated by IANA as
   specified in Section 7.
