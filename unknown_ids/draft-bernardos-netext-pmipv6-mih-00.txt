Abstract

   The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6
   enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across
   gateways without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides
   limited multi-homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.

   While the basic scenario addressed by PMIPv6 considers MNs with just
   one interface, PMIPv6 also allows an MN to connect to the same PMIPv6
   domain through different interfaces.  This limited support of multi-
   interfaced MNs is not fully specified, since the MAG needs to obtain/
   guess additional information from the MN, in order to decide whether
   to treat an MN's interface attachment as a handover or as new
   interface attachment (i.e. meaning the creation of a new mobility
   session and, therefore, the allocation of new home network prefixes
   to the MN).  The use of IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH)
   Services may help in obtaining this additional information.  This I-D
   describes how PMIPv6 would work in an 802.21-enabled scenario, and in
   particular, analyzes how MIH primitives can be used to help the MAG
   deal with multi-technology scenarios.

Internet-Draft            PMIPv6 & IEEE 802.21              October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provides network
   based mobility management to hosts connecting to a PMIPv6 domain.
   PMIPv6 introduces two new functional entities, the Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) and the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).  The MAG is the
   first layer three hop detecting Mobile Node's (MN) attachment and
   providing IP connectivity.  The LMA is the entity assigning one or
   more Home Network Prefixes (HNPs) to the MN and is the topological
   anchor for all traffic from/to the MN.

   While the basic scenario addressed by PMIPv6 considers MNs with just
   one interface, [RFC5213] also allows an MN to connect to the same
   PMIPv6 domain through different interfaces.  This limited support of
   multi-interfaced MNs is not fully specified, since the MAG needs to
   obtain/guess additional information from the MN, in order to decide
   whether to treat an MN's interface attachment as a handover or as new
   interface attachment (i.e. meaning the creation of a new mobility
   session and, therefore, the allocation of new home network prefixes
   to the MN).  The use of IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH)
   Services [IEEE.802.21] may help in obtaining this additional
   information.  This I-D describes how PMIPv6 would work in an 802.21-
   enabled scenario, and in particular, analyzes how MIH primitives can
   be used to help the MAG deal with multi-technology scenarios.


2.  Terminology

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms defined in the
   [RFC5213].  In addition, the following acronyms and terminology
   (related to the IEEE 802.21 standard) are used in this document:

   MIH (Media Independent Handover)

      The handover support architecture defined by the IEEE 802.21
      working group that consists of the MIH Function (MIHF), MIH
      Network Entities and MIH protocol messages.

   MIHF (Media Independent Handover Function)

      A switching function that provides handover services including the
      Event Service (ES), Information Service (IS), and Command Service
      (CS), through service access points (SAPs) defined by the IEEE
      802.21 working group.

   MIH User

Internet-Draft            PMIPv6 & IEEE 802.21              October 2009


      An entity that uses the MIH SAPs to access MIHF services, and
      which is responsible for initiating and terminating MIH signaling.

   MIHF_ID (MIHF Identifier)

      The MIHF_ID is a network access identifier (NAI).  NAI shall be
      unique as per IETF RFC 4282 [RFC5164].

   MoS (Mobility Services)

      Those services, as defined in the MIH problem statement document
      [RFC5164], which includes the MIH IS, CS, and ES services defined
      by the IEEE 802.21 standard.

   ES (Event Service)

      A MoS that originates at a remote MIHF or the lower layers of the
      local protocol stack and sends information to the local MIHF or
      local higher layers.  The purpose of the ES is to report changes
      in link status (e.g., Link Going Down messages) and various lower
      layer events.

   CS (Command Service)

      MoS that sends commands from the remote MIHF or local upper layers
      to the remote or local lower layers of the protocol stack to
      switch links or to get link status.

   PoS (Point of Service)

      A network-side MIHF instance that exchanges MIH messages with a
      MN-based MIHF.

   PoA (Point of attachment)

      Endpoint of a layer 2 link that includes the MN as the other
      endpoint.

   PMIPv6 client

      From an IEEE 802.21 viewpoint, a mobility protocol making use of
      the MIH Services (i.e. an MIH User) is called client.  Therefore,
      a PMIPv6 client on a given node (e.g., a MAG) is the PMIPv6
      mobility stack of that node, which makes use of the MIH Services.

3.  PMIPv6 (RFC 5213) and IEEE 802.21 operation

   This section describes how Proxy Mobile IPv6 works in an IEEE 802.21-
   enabled network.  We use a multiple-interface/access technology
   scenario, although the use of IEEE 802.21 would also be helpful in
   single technology access network deployments.  In this version of the
   draft, we only consider mobile-initiated handovers.

   Figure 1 shows an example of a multiple-access technology PMIPv6
   deployment scenario (in this example WLAN and Cellular 3GPP Evolved
   Packet Core -- EPC -- are the access networks considered).  In this
   scenario, MNs can attach and roam using one or multiple interfaces.
   Note that we also depict layer-2 entities (WLAN Access Points -- APs
   -- and enhanced Nodes B -- eNBs) in the figure for completeness.

   The equivalent IEEE 802.21 enabled scenario of Figure 1 is shown in
   Figure 2.  The PoS entitiy resides in the MAG, while the PoA entity
   resides in the layer-2 access points.  The PMIPv6 client on the MAG
   plays the role of MIHF user.  We next focus on the signaling for the
   two main PMIPv6 procedures: bootstrapping (or initial MN attachment)
   and MN handover.

                              PMIPv6 scenario

   For both the initial MN's attachment and handover cases, the
   candidate MAG needs to detect that a new MN is on its access link,
   and then obtain all the parameters that are required to be included
   in the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message.  We only list below those
   where IEEE 802.21 may help:

   o  MN-Identifier: this is a stable identifier of the MN that
      identifies it in the PMIPv6 domain.  In an IEEE 802.21-enabled
      scenario, the PMIPv6 client in the MAG receives an
      MIH_N2N_HO_Commit.indication message, informing about the
      intention of the MN to perform a handover to the target network.
      This message contains -- among other information -- the
      MNIdentifier, which is the MIHF_ID of the MN that commits to
      perform a handover (and therefore attach to the candidate/new
      MAG).  The MIHF_ID can be used as MN-Identifier for PMIPv6
      management and signaling purposes.  According to [RFC5213], the
      new MAG, after detecting an MN's attachement, has to identify the
      MN, acquire its MN-Identifier and determine whether the network-
      based mobility management service needs to be offered to the MN.
      If so, the MAG will send a PBU message to the LMA.

   o  Handover Indicator (HI) option.  This handoff hint is required for
      the network to find out if the MN is performing a handover (and
      which type of handover) or not (just attaching a new interface).
      The OldAccessRouter and IPRenewalFlag parameters contained in the
      MIH_Link_Up.indication message may be used to help the MAG guess
      the correct value to be included in the HI option.  The
      OldAccessRouter parameter is optional and contains the Link
      address of old Access Router.  The IPRenewalFlag parameter is also
      optional and indicates whether the MN needs to change IP Address
      in the new PoA.  Based on the presence and values of these two
      options, the HI can be chosen by the MAG as follows:

      *  (OldAccessRouter and NewAccessRouter parameters are different)
         AND (IPRenewalFlag == TRUE) ==> HI=1 (Attachment over a new
         interface).  If OldAccessRouter and NewAccessRouter parameters
         are different and IPRenewalFlag is TRUE, it indicates a new
         interface attachment.  Therefore, the MAG has to request the
         LMA to create a new mobility session for the MN.

      *  (no OldAccessRouter parameter present) AND (IPRenewalFlag ==
         FALSE) ==> HI=2 (Handoff between two different interfaces of
         the mobile node).  Again, the MN is not performing a handover
         over the same interface (the layer-2 address of the old AR is
         not provided) and the MN indicates that it wants to keep using
         the same IP address(es).  This means that the MN is performing
         a vertical handover between two different interfaces.

      *  (OldAccessRouter parameter present) AND (IPRenewalFlag ==
         FALSE) ==> HI=3 (Handoff between mobile access gateways for the
         same interface).  The MN is performing a handover from a
         previous PoS (the layer-2 address of the old AR is available)
         and the MN wants to keep using the same IP address(es).  This
         means that the MN is performing a horizontal handover.

      *  Any other combination ==> HI=4 (Handoff state unknown).

   o  Mobile Node Link-layer Identifier option.  This identifies the
      attached interface of a mobile node and can be obtained from the
      LinkIdentifier parameter included in the MIH_Link_Up.indication
      message received by the PMIPv6 client on the MAG.

   o  Access Technology Type (ATT) option.  This option indicates the
      type of access technology by which the MN is currently attached to
      the MAG.  This information may be obtained by the PMIPv6 client
      from the LinkIdentifier parameter included in the
      MIH_Link_Up.indication message.
