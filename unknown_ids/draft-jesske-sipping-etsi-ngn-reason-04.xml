		<section title="Terminology">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
			<t>This document uses terms from <xref target="RFC3261"/>.  
</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Overview ">
			<t>The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is defining a Next Generation Network (NGN) 
where a substantial part of it is based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) defined by the Third-Generation 
Partnership Project (3GPP). IMS is largely based on the Session Initiation Protocol 
 <xref target="RFC3261"/>. </t>
			<t>ETSI has developed a number of requirements to support the usage of SIP in Next Generation 
Networks that interoperate, at the service level, with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), 
the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), and SIP networks 
and terminals that implement the service logic. </t>
			<t>In order to provide full support in SIP of existing services, extensions to SIP are needed.</t>
			<t>This document proposes the use of the Reason header field in responses. This is needed for creating 
services that must be interoperable with the PSTN/ISDN network and the interoperability of traversing 
communications through SIP not using SIP-I. </t>
			<t>The main used case for reason header within responses are interworking situations with PSTN/ISDN 
networks where the ISUP cause In many cases the mapping of specific cause values will result in 
a generic SIP Response like it is shown below. </t>
			<t>
				<xref target="RFC3398"/> and other Interworking specifications like <xref target="3GPP.29.163"/> are describing 
the mapping of ISUP Cause Values to SIP and vice versa. Looking on the specific mapping shows that 
information will be lost when the call traverses ISUP without using SIP-T.</t>
			<t> Example:</t>
			<t>
				<xref target="RFC3398"/>  describes the mapping of following ISUP Causes to 503 and 408 like follows.

			</t>
			<t>The Example with 503 shows that a couple of different ISUP Cause values are interworked to 
only one SIP response. With 408 the meaning of the release cause is changed when interworked back 
to ISUP. Also Services built on Cause 18 (e.G. a 2nd call attempt on an other number, this service 
is like a sequential forking) will not work.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Requirements">
			<t>REQ-1:</t>
			<t>It should be possible to support PSTN-SIP-PSTN scenarios where the reason of a call release can be transferred though the SIP domain without any loss of information and no change of reason.  </t>
			<t>REQ-2: </t>
			<t>It should be possible to provide correct announcements to a SIP user based on the reason for call clearing within the PSTN network or the PSTN user. The PSTN does normally not provide announcements to originating user when clearing the call.</t>
			<t>REQ-3:</t>
			<t>A UA may have the ability to display ISUP specific release causes or show a equivalent text. A inclusion of Q.850 causes is out of scope. </t>
			<t>REQ-4:</t>
			<t>A application server providing specific PSTN like services may have the possibility to include ISUP specific release causes </t>
			<section title="Used Cases for the requirements">
<t>REQ-1 shows the scenario between two ISUP Gateways where SIP-I is not a solution to be used. A IMS network defined by 3GPP where SIP-I is not part of the framework is such an example. A used case is shown in Figure 2.</t>
<t>REQ-2 identifies the scenario the gateway passes on the cause and some announcement server translates the cause into the appropriate announcement.</t>
<t>REQ-3 excludes that a SIP UA includes Q.850 cause values because that is not needed due to the different context of a SIP UA and of course the existing SIP response codes. Also the possibility of displaying Q.850 causes should be used very restrictive and is not recommended. A used case could be a Integrated Access Device where a POTS Phone is connected to. It is recommended to ignore the cause value if received be a UA.</t>
<t>REQ-4 allows an application server that is providing specific Services simulating PSTN services to include Q.850 Causes. This is needed specific for IMS operartors which are substituting their PSTN to IMS. These operators may run Services in the SIP domain that are provided to PSTN end users. </t>
			
</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Overall Applicability">
			<t>The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen for networks providing simulation 
services and/or interworking to the PSTN/ISDN.  </t>
			<t>The document is describing the use of the Reason header in SIP responses. 
These procedures are only valuable if the reason contained in the element "protocol" is "Q.850". 
A inclusion of a SIP reason (protocol="SIP") is not helpful due to the fact that the response 
already provides the SIP reason. The Release Causes are described within <xref target="ETSI_EN300_485"/>. 
(Note: The ETSI specifications can be downloaded under http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp free of charge.)</t>
		</section>
		
		<section title="Procedures">

		<section title="Procedures at the UA">
			<t>A UA that supports the Reason header field can process the Q.850 Cause Value and display it 
or an equivalent text. The inclusion of a Reason header field by UA is only for B2B UA interworking 
with the PSTN/ISDN or providing services foreseen. </t>
		</section>
		<section title="Procedures at a SIP proxy">
			<t>SIP proxies that receive a response containing a Reason header field is forwarding the response 
without changing the reason. </t>
			<t>A SIP proxy receiving a request that includes a Reason header field can route the request to an 
application server for further analysis and base services on it. </t>
			<t>Based on network policy a Proxy can remove a Reason header field send from a UAC.  </t>
		</section>
		<section title="Procedures at an application server">
			<t> An application server that receives a SIP request that contains a response including a 
Reason header MAY analyze the SIP Reason and base further procedures on this analyses. </t>
			<t>For Example the application server could use the reason for sending a announcement
towards the originating entity of the session.  </t>
			<t>As an example the Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service defined by ETSI 
Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking 
(TISPAN)</t>
		</section></section>
		<section title="Procedures at an interworking point with ISUP">
			<t>For interoperability reasons the Q.850 Cause Value of a Release shall be mapped to the Reason Header. </t>

sent back to the UA A and closes all open transactions. With this possibility the SIP user

		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<t>The presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the 
treatment of the response. </t>
			<t>Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the 
reactions of the originating entities. E.G. sending back a cause value 
"87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that the 
call was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.  </t>
			<t>Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header information in Responses 
only by trusted entities as it is described within <xref target="RFC3325"/>.  
 </t>
		</section>
		<section title="IANA Considerations  ">
			<t>This document describes the use of the Reason header field described
within  <xref target="RFC3326"/> . No additional SIP elements are defined within
this document. Therefore, this document does not provide any action
to IANA.</t>
