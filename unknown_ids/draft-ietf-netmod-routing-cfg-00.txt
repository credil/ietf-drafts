              A YANG Data Model for Routing Configuration
                    draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-00

Abstract

   This document contains a specification of two YANG modules that
   together provide a data model for essential configuration of a
   routing subsystem.  It is expected that this module will serve as a
   basis for further development of data models for individual routing
   protocols and other related functions.  The present data model
   defines the building blocks for such configurations - routing
   processes, routes and routing tables, routing protocol instances and
   route filters.

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration             April 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document contains an initial specification of two YANG modules,
   "ietf-routing" and "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing", that together define
   the so-called core routing data model.  This data model will serve as
   a basis for the development of data models for more sophisticated
   routing configurations.  While these two modules can be directly used
   for simple IPv4-only devices with static routing, their main purpose
   is to provide basic building blocks for more complicated setups
   involving other address families such as IPv6, multiple routing
   protocols, and advanced functions, for example route filtering and
   policy routing.  To this end, it is expected that this module will be
   augmented by numerous modules developed by other IETF working groups.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC4741]:

   o  client

   o  message

   o  operation

   o  server

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020]:

   o  augment

2.1.  Glossary of New Terms

   o  active route: a route which is actually used for packet
      forwarding.  If there are multiple candidate routes with the same
      destination prefix, then it is up to the routing algorithm to
      select the active route.

3.  Objectives

   The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by the
   following main objectives:

   o  The data model should be suitable for the common address families,
      in particular IPv4 and IPv6, and for unicast and multicast routing
      as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS).

   o  Simple routing setups, such as static routing, should be
      configurable in a simple way, ideally without any need to develop
      additional YANG modules.

   o  On the other hand, the core routing framework must allow for
      complicated setups involving multiple routing tables and multiple
      routing protocols, as well as controlled redistributions of
      routing information.

   o  Device vendors will want to map the data models built on this
      generic framework to their proprietary data models and
      configuration interfaces.  Therefore, the framework should be
      flexible enough to facilitate such a mapping and accommodate data
      models with different logic.

4.  The Design of the Core Routing Data Model

   The core routing data model consists of two YANG modules.  The first
   module, "ietf-routing", is rather minimal and provides only a top-
   level container ("routing") and a list of routing processes.  Each
   routing process represents an instance of a (virtual) router with a
   separate forwarding table (FIB, forwarding information base).  For a
   given address family, specified by an Address Family Identifier (AFI)
   [IANA-AFI] and Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI)
   [IANA-SAFI], several independent routing processes may be configured.

   The second YANG module, "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing", provides a data
   modeling framework for IPv4 unicast routing with several essential
   components: routes, routing tables, routing protocol instances, route
   filters and RPC operations.  The following subsections provide
   further details about these components.

   By combining the components in various ways, and possibly filling
   them with appropriate contents defined in other modules, a broad
   range of routing setups can be covered.

             Figure 1: Example setup of the routing subsystem

   Figure 1 shows an example of a more complicated setup:

   o  Along with the main routing table, which must always be present,
      an additional routing table is defined.

   o  Each routing protocol instance, including the "static" and
      "direct" pseudo-protocol instances, is connected to exactly one
      routing table with which it can exchange routes (in both
      directions, except for the "static" and "direct" pseudo-
      protocols).

   o  Routing tables may also be connected to each other and exchange
      routes in one or both directions.

   o  The forwarding information base (FIB) is a special routing table
      which must always be present.  Typically, the FIB receives the
      active routes from the main routing table and the operating system

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration             April 2011


      kernel uses this information for packet forwarding.

   o  Route exchanges along all connections may be controlled by means
      of route filters, denoted by "F" in the figure.

4.1.  Route

   Routes are basic units of information in a routing system.  The
   "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" module defines only the following minimal
   set of route attributes:

   o  destination-prefix - IP prefix specifying the set of destination
      addresses for which the route may be used.  This attribute is
      mandatory.

   o  next-hop - IP address of the adjacent router or host to which
      packets with destination addresses belonging to destination-prefix
      should be sent.

   o  outgoing-interface - network interface that should be used for
      sending packets with destination addresses belonging to
      destination-prefix.

   The above list of route attributes is sufficient for a simple static
   routing configuration.  It is expected that future modules defining
   routing protocols will add other route attributes such as metrics or
   preferences.

   Routes and their attributes are used in both configuration data, for
   example as manually configured static routes, as well as in
   operational state data, for example as entries in routing tables.

4.2.  Routing Tables

   Routing tables are lists of routes complemented with administrative
   data, namely:

   o  source-protocol - name of the routing protocol from which the
      route was originally obtained.

   o  last-modified - date and time of last modification, or
      installation, of the route.

   In the core routing data model, the list of routes in routing tables
   is represented as operational state data.  Routing protocol
   operations result in route additions, removals and modifications.
   This also includes manipulations via the "static" pseudo-protocol.

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration             April 2011


   The "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" module requires that at least the
   following two routing tables MUST be configured for each routing
   process:

   o  The "ipv4-unicast-fib" table is the forwarding information base
      used by the operating system kernel for forwarding IPv4 unicast
      datagrams.

   o  The "ipv4-unicast-main" table is the main routing table.  By
      default, all IPv4 unicast routing protocols exchange routes with
      this table, and active routes from the "ipv4-unicast-main" routing
      table are installed in the "ipv4-unicast-fib" table and used for
      packet forwarding.

   Additional routing tables MAY be configured.

   Every routing table MAY serve as a source of routes for other routing
   tables.  To achieve this, one or more recipient routing tables MAY be
   specified in the configuration of the source routing table.  In
   addition, a route filter may be configured for each recipient routing
   table, which selects and/or manipulates the routes that are passed on
   between the source and recipient routing table.

4.3.  Routing Protocol Instances

   The "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" module provides an open-ended
   framework for defining multiple routing protocol instances.  Each of
   them is identified by a name, which is unique within a routing
   process, and MUST be assigned a type from a selection which includes
   all routing protocol types supported by the server, such as RIP, OSPF
   or BGP.

   Each routing protocol instance is connected to exactly one routing
   table.  By default, every routing protocol instance is connected to
   the main routing table, but any routing protocol instance can be
   configured to use a different routing table, provided such an extra
   table is configured.

   Routes learned from the network by a routing protocol instance are
   passed to the connected routing table and vice versa - routes
   appearing in a routing table are passed to all routing protocol
   connected to the table and advertised by that protocol to the
   network.

   Two independent route filters (see Section 4.4) may be defined for a
   routing protocol instance to control the exchange of routes in both
   directions between the routing protocol instance and the connected
   routing table:

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration             April 2011


   o  import filter controls which routes are passed from a routing
      protocol instance to the routing table,

   o  export filter controls which routes the routing protocol instance
      may receive from the connected routing table.

   Note that, for historical reasons, the terms import and export are
   used from the viewpoint of a routing table.

   The "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" module defines two special routing
   protocols - "direct" and "static".  Both are in fact pseudo-
   protocols, which means that they are confined to the local device and
   do not exchange any routing information with neighboring routers.
   Routes from both "direct" and "static" protocol instances are passed
   to the connected routing table (subject to route filters, if any),
   but an exchange in the opposite direction is not allowed.

   Every routing process MUST contain exactly one instance of the
   "direct" pseudo-protocol.  It is the source of routes to directly
   connected networks (so-called direct routes).  Such routes are
   supplied by the operating system kernel based on the detected and
   configured network interfaces, and they usually appear in the main
   routing table.  However, using the framework defined in this
   document, the target routing table for direct routes can be changed
   by connecting the "direct" protocol instance to a non-default routing
   table, and the direct routes can also be filtered before they appear
   in the routing table.

   The "static" routing pseudo-protocol allows for specifying routes
   manually.  It can be configured in zero or more instances, although
   typically one instance suffices.

4.3.1.  Defining New Routing Protocols

   It is expected that future YANG modules will create data models for
   additional routing protocol types.  In order to do so, the new module
   has to define the protocol-specific information and fit it to the
   core routing framework in the following way:

   o  A new identity MUST be defined for the routing protocol and its
      base identity set to "rt:routing-protocol", or to an identity
      derived from "rt:routing-protocol".

   o  Additional route attributes MAY be defined.  Their definitions
      have to be inserted as operational state data by augmenting the
      definition of "v4ur:route" inside "v4ur:routing-table".
      Naturally, route attributes (including the extra attributes) may
      be used in configuration data, too, as demonstrated by the



Lhotka                  Expires October 29, 2011               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration             April 2011


      "static" pseudo-protocol.

   o  The recommended way of defining configuration data specific to the
      new protocol is to augment the "routing-protocol-instance" list
      entry with a container that encapsulates the configuration
      hierarchy of the new protocol.  The "augment" statement SHOULD be
      made conditional by using a "when" substatement requiring that the
      new nodes be used only if the "type" leaf node is equal to the new
      protocol's identity.

   The above steps are implemented by the example YANG module for the
   RIP routing protocol in Appendix A.  First, the module defines a new
   identity for the RIP protocol:

   identity rip {
     base rt:routing-protocol;
     description "Identity for the RIP routing protocol.";
   }

   Second, new route attributes specific for the RIP protocol ("metric"

     leaf metric { ... }
     leaf tag { ... }
   }

   The "when" statement is used to make sure that the new route
   attributes are only valid when the source protocol is RIP.

   Finally, RIP-specific configuration data are integrated into the
   "v4ur:routing-protocol-instance" node by using the following
   "augment" statement, which applies only to routing protocol instances
   whose type is "rip:rip", and which is a part of a routing process
   whose address family is "ipV4" and subsequent address family
   identifier is "nlri-unicast":

4.4.  Route Filters

   The "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" module provides a skeleton for
   defining route filters that can be used to restrict the set of routes
   being exchanged between a routing protocol instance and a routing
   table, or between a source and a recipient routing table.  Route
   filters may also manipulate routes, i.e., add, delete, or modify
   their properties.

   By itself, the route filtering framework defined in the "ietf-ipv4-
   unicast-routing" module allows to establish only the two extreme
   routing policies in which either all routes are allowed or all routes
   are denied.  It is expected that a real route filtering framework (or
   several alternative frameworks) will be developed separately.

   Each route filter is identified by a name which is unique within a
   routing process.  Its type MUST be specified by the "type" identity
   reference - this opens the space for multiple route filtering
   framework implementations.  The default value for route filter type
   is the identity "deny-all-route-filter" defined in the "ietf-routing"
   module, which represents the "deny all" route filtering policy.

4.5.  RPC Operations

   The "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing-module" defines two RPC operations:

   o  "delete-route" operations allows the client to immediately delete
      specific route(s) from a routing table within a routing process.
      The first input parameter of this operation is the name of the
      routing process, the second parameter is the routing table to act
      upon, and the third (optional) parameter is the "route" container
      with zero or more of the following route attributes: "destination-
      prefix", "next-hop" and "outgoing-interface".  All routes that
      match these attributes MUST be deleted from the selected routing
      table.  If the "route" container is missing or empty, all routes
      from the selected routing table MUST be deleted.

   o  "get-route" is used for querying the forwarding information base
      of a routing process.  The first input parameter is the name of a
      routing process whose FIB is to be queried, and the second
      parameter is an IPv4 destination address.  The server replies with
      an active route which is used for forwarding datagrams to the
      destination address within the selected routing process.

       "This module augments the 'ietf-routing' module with YANG
        definitions for basic configuration of IPv4 unicast routing.

        It is immediately usable for a device that needs just a single
        routing table populated with static routes.

        On the other hand, the framework is designed to handle
        arbitrarily complex configurations with any number of routing
        tables and various routing protocols (in multiple instances).";

Appendix A.  Example - Adding a New Routing Protocol

   This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model can be
   extended to support a new routing protocol.  Appendix A.1 contains a
   YANG module which is used for this purpose.  It is intended only as
   an illustration and not as a real definition of a data model for the
   RIP routing protocol.  Also, for the sake of brevity, we do not
   follow all the guidelines specified in [RFC6087].

   Appendix A.2 then contains a complete instance XML document - a reply
   to the NETCONF <get> message from a server that uses the RIP protocol
   as well as static routing.

A.1.  Example YANG Module for Routing Information Protocol

   module example-rip {
     namespace "http://example.com/rip";
     prefix rip;

     import ietf-interfaces {
       prefix if;
     }
     import ietf-routing {
       prefix rt;
     }

     identity rip {
       base rt:routing-protocol;
       description
         "Identity for the RIP routing protocol.";
     }

     typedef rip-metric {
       type uint8 {
         range "0..16";
       }
     }

     augment "/rt:routing/rt:routing-protocol-instances/" +
             "rt:routing-protocol-instance" {
       when "rt:type='rip:rip'";
       container rip-configuration {
         container rip-interfaces {
           list rip-interface {
             key "name";
             leaf name {
               type if:interface-ref;
             }

           }
           units "seconds";
           default "30";
           description
             "Time interval between periodic updates.";
         }
         /* Additional RIP configuration */
       }
     }
     augment "/rt:routing/rt:routing-tables/rt:routing-table/rt:route" {
         when "../../../rt:routing-protocol-instances/" +
              "rt:routing-protocol-instance[rt:name=" +
              "current()/rt:source-protocol]/rt:type='rip:rip'";
       description
         "RIP-specific route components.";
       leaf metric {
         type rip-metric;
       }
       leaf tag {
         type uint16;
         default "0";

           "This leaf may be used to carry additional info, e.g. AS
            number.";
       }
     }
   }

A.2.  Sample Reply to the NETCONF <get> Message

   This section contains a sample reply to the NETCONF <get> message,
   which could be sent by a server supporting (and advertizing in
   <hello>) the following YANG modules:

   o  ietf-interfaces [YANG-IF],

   o  ex-ethernet [YANG-IF],

   o  ex-ip [YANG-IF],

   o  ietf-routing (Section 5),

   o  ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing (Section 6),

   o  example-rip (Appendix A.1).

   We assume a simple network setup as shown in Figure 2: routers "ISP"
   and "A" use RIP for exchanging routing information whereas static
   routing is used in the private network.  In order to avoid the
   redistribution of the routes to the private subnetworks
   192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 in RIP, an export filter is used in
   the RIP protocol configuration preventing the routes from the main
   routing table from appearing in RIP updates.
