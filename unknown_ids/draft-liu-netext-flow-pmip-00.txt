                Flow control policies provision of PMIPv6
                     draft-liu-netext-flow-pmip-00

Abstract

   PMIPv6 is designed to provide network based mobility, it requrie no
   changes to the UE.  There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support
   flow mobility.  Flow mobility requries the UE and the network should
   have communication protocol to carry the flow control policies.  This
   paper proposes to use the IKE protocol to carry the flow control
   information between the UE and network.

Internet-Draft  Flow Policy Provision Solution of PMIPv6      March 2010


1.  Introduction

   There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support flow mobility.  But
   there is currently no protocol is specified between the UE and
   network which could be used for carry the flow control policies.
   Since PMIPv6 is aimed to provide network based mobility solution and
   no UE changes is required, it is not practical to define new protocol
   between the UE and network that used for carry the flow information.
   this document proposes to use IKE protocol to carry the flow
   information.

4. Use IKE to carry flow control information

   IKE is a protocol use for security parameter negotiation.  There are
   options in IKE that There are configuration payloads which could be
   used for IP address allocation and other configuration purpose.  This
   document proposes to use the configuration payloads to carry the
   police control information.  The detail of how the flow control
   information shoud be need to be further indentified
