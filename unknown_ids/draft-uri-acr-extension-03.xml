    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme "acr".
        The "acr" URI describes an anonymous reference, that can be mapped to a resource or user.
        There are multiple situations where the true identity of a user or a resources can not be disclosed.
        The "acr" URI is a globally unique identifier ( "name" ) only;
        it does not describe the steps necessary to reach the user or the device.
        However it can contain a parameter indication what body or organisation that could resolve it.
        It is intended for privacy protection, where a user trusts a translating party,
        that can route or forward the request or message to the true user or resource.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>
      and indicate the requirements levels for compliant implementations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="URI syntax">

      <t>The URI is defined using AB-NF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form)
        as described in <xref target="RFC5234">RFC 5234</xref>
      and uses elements from the core definitions (appendix A of RFC 5234).</t>

    <t>The syntax definition follows <xref target="RFC3986">RFC 3986</xref>, indicating the
    actual characters contained in the URI.  If the reserved characters
    "+", ";", "=", and "?" are used as delimiters between components of
    the "tel" URI, they MUST NOT be percent encoded.  These characters
  MUST be percent encoded if they appear in tel URI parameter values.</t>

  <t>Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
    <xref target="RFC3986">RFC 3986</xref> ) are equivalent to their "% HEX HEX" percent
  encoding.</t>

  <t>The "acr" URI has the following syntax:</t>

  <t>The "anonymous-subscriber-identifier" can be created from some suitable user or customer
    data such as, phone number, and validation date.
    In order to provide anonymisation, this data MUST not be included unchanged within the ACR.
    Rather it MUST be encrypted, hashed, represented by a look-up reference or otherwise obfuscated.
    The issuing provider is responsible for unreferencing the ACR to the user or resource.
  For example the SHA-256 algorithm can hash the sensitive data:</t>

  <t>SHA256("")= e3b0c442 98fc1c14 9afbf4c8 996fb924 27ae41e4 649b934c a495991b 7852b855</t>

  <t>In order to know who issued the identifier, the Network Code or domain name MUST be included,
    for cross-operator identification and to ensure it is known which entity can deference the ACR.
    In addition a network country identifier MUST be provided (either as part of the network code,
    or separately) to avoid confusion where networks operate in multiple countries.
    A URI for ACR documentation MAY be included; for example, to discover further meta-data,
  or to list the service endpoints which can consume the ACR. </t>

  <t>The "network code" (ncc) is for mobile networks a concatenation of "mobile country code" (MCC)
  and "mobile network code" (MNC) as defined in ITU-T RECOMMENDATION E.212</t>
  <t>As an example of ncc for Vodafone in UK, consists of MCC=234 and MNC=15 would concatenate to ncc=23415</t>

  <t>The acr-type indicates if the ACR is a static type or a temporary type.</t>

<section anchor="Examples" title="Examples">

  <t>acr:0123456890123456789 This URI points to a user. for network internal use only since the network code is not provided</t>
  <t>acr:0123456890123456789;ncc=123  This URI points to a user belonging to network 123</t>
  <t>acr:0123456890123456789;ncc=23415;type=DYNA This temporal URI points to a user or group of users and can be resolved by the Vodafone mobile network in UK. </t>

  <t>acr:0123456890123456789;ncc=123 This URI points to a group of users belonging to network 123. </t>
  <t>   Note that the fact that more than one user is represented is not intrinsic to the acr but only known to the issuing network.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="Rationale" title="Rationale">
  <section title="Privacy policies">
    <t>Existing privacy policies and legislation restrict the sharing of certain user identifiers,
      such as the MSISDN, since it may be used to breach a user&apos;s privacy (unauthorized location lookup,
    cold calling, SMS Spam etc.). An ACR prevents such identifiers from being circulated.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Cookie support">
    <t>Cookie support is inconsistent across mobile devices. An ACR can help identify a returning mobile user to a Website,
    and hence facilitate the provisioning of a personalized service based on previous preferences and activity.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Sharing identity">
    <t>Mobile, broadband and other access networks do not typically share a user identifier.
    The ACR is not bound to a particular access network and can hence be used to provision user identifiers between networks.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Relation to SIP">
    <t>The ACR can help the implementation of SIP privacy considerations, as detailed in
      <xref target="RFC3323">RFC3323</xref>,
      &#8216;A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol&#8217;.
      Specifically the ACR can be used as the value for the &#8216;anonymous from&#8217; header field [section 4.1],
      and is consistent with the recommendation to remove Subject, Call-info, Organization, User Agent,
    Reply-To, In-Reply-To in [section 5.3].</t>

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
  <t>This document includes a request to IANA.</t>

  <t>The editors of this draft request the protocol scheme name "acr" to be reserved for this RFC.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>Since the "acr" is used to protect the identity of a user or a device the
    forwarding party must not disclose information that would or can be used to reveal the
    identity of the user. However the network code or domain name will reveal some information
  of the the "acr" affiliation.</t>

  <t>The security considerations parallel those for the tel URI
  <xref target="RFC3966">RFC3966</xref>.</t>

  <t>Web clients and similar tools MUST NOT use the "acr" URI to place
    telephone calls or send messages without the explicit consent of the user of that
    client.  Placing calls or sending messages automatically without appropriate user
    confirmation may incur a number of risks, such as those described
  below:</t>

  <t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Calls or messages may incur costs.</t>
  <t>The URI may be used to place malicious or annoying calls.</t>
  <t>A call will take the user's phone line off-hook, thus preventing
  its use.</t>
  <t>A call may reveal the user's possibly unlisted phone number to the
    remote host in the caller identification data and may allow the
    attacker to correlate the user's phone number with other
  information, such as an e-mail or IP address.</t>
</list></t>



<t>This is particularly important for "acr" URIs embedded in HTML links,
  as a malicious party may hide the true nature of the URI in the link
text, as in</t>

<t>"acr" URIs may reveal private information, similar to including phone
  numbers as text.  However, the presence of the acr: schema identifier
  may make it easier for an adversary using a search engine to discover
  these numbers, and hence search engines should avoid indexing these identifiers.

Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

                      A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
                      that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
                      defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
                      that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
                      considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
                      The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
                      allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
                      reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
                      possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
                      grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
                      specifications of each URI scheme.
