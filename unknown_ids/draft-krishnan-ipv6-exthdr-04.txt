Abstract

   In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate
   headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the transport
   layer header.  There are a small number of such extension headers
   currently defined.  This document defines a format for defining a new
   family of IPv6 extension headers.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 extension headers           September 2008


1.  Introduction

   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines extension headers as an
   expansion mechanism to carry optional internet layer information.
   Extension headers, with the exception of the hop-by-hop options
   header, are not usually processed on intermediate nodes.  However,
   some intermediate nodes such as firewalls, may need to look at the
   transport layer header fields in order to make a decision to allow or
   deny the packet.  If new extension headers are defined and the
   intermediate node is not aware of them, the intermediate node cannot
   proceed further in the header chain since it does not know where the
   unknown header ends and the next header begins.  The main issue is
   that the extension header format is not standard and hence it is not
   possible to skip past the unknown header.  This document intends to
   define a standard format for a new family of IPv6 extension headers.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Proposed format

   This document proposes a new family of IPv6 extension headers that
   will be encoded in a consistent format so that it is possible for
   intermediate nodes to skip over unknown extension headers and
   continue to further process the header chain if they so desire.  The
   intention of the base IPv6 Specification [RFC2460] that destination
   hosts not be permitted to skip unknown extension headers continues to
   apply.  One key advantage of using such a generic IPv6 extension
   header is that it allows nodes to distinguish between unknown
   extension headers and unknown upper layer protocols, which was not
   possible earlier.  Another one is that this generic extension header
   conserves values in the IPv4 protocol numbers registry.

   This documents requires the allocation of a single IP protocol number
   for the Generic IPv6 extension header (GIEH), say TBA1.  All new
   extension headers need to use this generic extension header format.
   The generic extension header will be identified by the value TBA1
   occuring in the Next Header field of the preceding extension header.
   The second octet contains the length of the extension header.  The
   third octet of the GIEH contains a specific extension header type
   (that identifies the actual extension header).  All other data in the
   GIEH is type-specific.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  | Specific Type |               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+               +
   |                                                               |
   .                                                               .
   .                  Header Specific Data                         .
   .                                                               .
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Next Header          8-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                        immediately following this Extension header.
                        Uses the same values as the IPv4 Protocol
                        field.
   Hdr Ext Len          8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
                        Extension header in 8-octet units, not
                        including the first 8 octets.
   Specific Type        8-bit unsigned integer. The actual IPv6
                        extension header type. This will be allocated
                        from a new IANA registry.
   Header Specific      Variable length. Fields specific to the
   Data                 extension header

3.  Backward Compatibility

   The scheme proposed in this document is not backward compatible with
   all the currently defined IPv6 extension headers.  It only applies to
   newly defined extension headers.  Specifically, the following
   extension headers predate this document and will not follow the
   format proposed in this document.

   o  IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Header
   o  IPv6 Routing Header
   o  IPv6 Fragment Header
   o  IPv6 Destination Options Header


4.  Exceptions

   The the Generic IPv6 extension header is generic enough that it is
   suitable to use for most applications.  However, it is possible that
   the GIEH does not satisfy the requirements in all cases where new
   extension headers are required.  Hence, the existence of this generic
   header does not necessarily preclude the definition of new
   independent IPv6 extension headers.


5.  Future work

   This document proposes one step in easing the inspection of extension
   headers by middleboxes.  There is further work required in this area.
   Some issues that are left unresolved beyond this document include

   o  There can be an arbitrary number of extension headers
   o  Extension headers must be processed in the order they appear.
   o  Extension headers may alter the processing of the payload itself,
      and hence the packet may not be processed properly without
      knowledge of said header


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a single allocation from the IANA for this
   generic IPv6 extension header type (TBA1) from the Assigned Internet
   Protocol Numbers registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers.

   This document also requests the creation of a new registry for GIEH
   sub-types.  The allocation policy for these subtypes is Standards
   Action.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes a standard format for the IPv6 extension
   headers so that intermediate nodes, such as firewalls, that do not
   understand the contents of these headers can look past them.
   Intermediate nodes,such as firewalls, skipping over unknown headers
   might end up allowing the setup of a covert channel from the outside
   of the firewall to the inside using the data field(s) of the unknown
   extension headers.
