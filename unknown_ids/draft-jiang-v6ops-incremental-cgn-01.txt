Abstract 

   Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected in the 
   last ten years. As IPv4 address exhaustion gets closer, the IPv4/IPv6 
   transition issues become more critical and complicated. Host-based 
   transition mechanisms are not able to meet the requirements while 
   most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain 
   these transition mechanisms. Carrier Grade NAT with integrated 
   transition mechanisms can simplify the operation of end users during 
   the IPv4/IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes 
   an incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) solution for IPv6 transition. 
   It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled end hosts and 
   IPv4 access services for IPv4 end hosts while remaining most of 
   legacy IPv4 ISP networks unchanged. It is suitable for the initial 
   stage of IPv4/IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, it also supports and 
   encourages transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks.

1. Introduction 

   Up to now, global IPv6 deployment does not happen as was expected 10 
   years ago. The progress was much slower than originally expected. 
   Network providers were hesitant to take the first move while IPv4 was 
   and is still working well. However, IPv4 address exhaustion is now 
   confirmed to happen soon. The dynamically-updated IPv4 Address Report 
   [IPUSAGE] has analyzed this issue. It predicts early 2011 for IANA 
   unallocated address pool exhaustion and middle 2012 for RIR 
   unallocated address pool exhaustion. Based on this fact, the Internet 
   industry appears to have reached consensus that global IPv6 
   deployment is inevitable and has to be done quite quickly. 

   IPv4/IPv6 transition issues therefore become more critical and 
   complicated for the soon-coming global IPv6 deployment. Host-based 
   transition mechanisms alone are not able to meet the requirements. 
   They are too complicated for most end users who do not have enough 
   technical knowledge to configure or maintain these transition 
   mechanisms. New transition mechanisms with simple user-side operation 
   are needed. 

   Carried Grade NAT (CGN) alone creates operational problems, but does 
   nothing to help IPv4/IPv6 transition. In fact it allows ISPs to delay 
   the transition, and therefore causes double transition costs (once to 
   add CGN, and again to support IPv6). 

   Carrier-Grade NAT that integrates multiple transition mechanisms can 
   simplify the operation of end user services during the IPv4/IPv6 
   migration or coexistence period. CGNs are deployed on the network 
   side and managed/maintained by professionals. On the user side, new 
   CPE devices may be needed too. They may be provided by network 
   providers, depending on the specific business model. Dual-stack lite 
   [DSLite] is a CGN-based solution that supports transition, but it 
   requires the ISP to upgrade its network to IPv6 immediately. Many 
   ISPs hesitate to do this as the first step. 

   This document proposes an incremental CGN solution for IPv6 
   transition. The solution is similar to DSLite, but the other way 
   around. Technically, it mainly combines v4-v4 NAT with v6-over-v4 
   tunnelling functions along with some minor adjustment. It can provide 
   IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled end hosts and IPv4 access 
   services for IPv4 end hosts, while leaving most of legacy IPv4 ISP 
   networks unchanged. The deployment of this solution does not affect 
   legacy IPv4 hosts with global IPv4 addresses at all. It is suitable 
   for the initial stage of IPv4/IPv6 migration. It also supports 
   transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. An Incremental CGN Solution 

   Most ISP networks are still IPv4. Network providers are starting to 
   provide IPv6 access services for end users. However, at the initial 
   stage of IPv4/IPv6 migration, IPv4 connectivity and traffic would be 
   the majority for most ISP networks. ISPs would like to minimize the 
   changes on their IPv4 networks. Switching the whole ISP network into 
   IPv6-only would be considered as a radical strategy. Switching the 
   whole ISP network to dual stack is less radical, but introduces 
   operational costs and complications. Although some ISPs have 
   successfully deployed dual stack routers, others prefer not to do 
   this as their first step in IPv6. However, they currently face two 
   urgent pressures - to compensate for an immediate shortage of IPv4 
   addresses by deploying some method of address sharing, and to prepare 
   actively for the deployment of IPv6 address space and services. The 
   solution described in this draft addresses both of these pressures by 
   proceeding in two phases. 

        3.1. Incremental CGN Solution Overview 

   The incremental CGN solution we propose is illustrated as the 
   following figure.  

                                 +-------------+ 
                                 |IPv6 Internet|

   The above figure shows only Phase 1, in which the ISP has not 
   significantly changed its IPv4 network. This solution enables IPv4 
   hosts to access the IPv4 Internet and IPv6 hosts to access the IPv6 
   Internet. A dual stack host can be treated as an IPv4 host when it 
   uses IPv4 access service and as an IPv6 host when it uses IPv6 access 
   service. In order to enable IPv4 hosts to access IPv6 Internet and 
   IPv6 hosts to access IPv4 Internet, NAT-PT [RFC2766, RFC4966] (or its 
   replacement) can be integrated with CGN. The integration of NAT-PT is 
   out of scope for this document 

   Two new types of devices need to be deployed in this solution: a 
   dual-stack home gateway, which MAY follow the requirements of [6CPE], 
   and dual-stack Carrier-Grade NAT. The dual-stack home gateway 
   integrates IPv4 forwarding and v6-over-v4 tunnelling functions. It 
   MAY integrate v4-v4 NAT function, too. The dual-stack CGN integrates 
   v6-over-v4 tunnelling and carrier-grade v4-v4 NAT functions. 

        3.2. Choice of tunnelling technology 

   In principle, this model will work with any form of tunnel between 
   the DS HG and the dual-stack CGN. However, tunnels that require 
   individual configuration are clearly undesirable because of their 
   operational cost. Configured tunnels based directly on [RFC4213] are 
   therefore not suitable. A tunnel broker according to [RFC3053] would 
   also have high operational costs. 

   Modified 6RD [6RD] technology appears suitable to support v6-over-v4 
   tunnelling with low operational cost. 6RD was designed for an IPv4 
   ISP scenario and allows re-use of slightly modified existing support 
   for 6to4 [RFC3056]. 6RD using a 32-bit IPv6 prefix from the ISP's 
   address space will allow each CPE to receive a 64-bit prefix 
   corresponding to its IPv4 address. If it is desired to delegate 56-
   bit prefixes to each customer, the 6RD prefix MUST be of 24 bits, as 
   illustrated below. In that case, the ISP MUST have a general IPv6 
   prefix shorter than /24. 

        +----------------------.------------------------------+ 
        | 6RD-relay IPv6 prefix|         IPv4 address         | 
        |        of the ISP    |     of the customer site     | 
        +----------------------'------------------------------+ 
        <-----  24 bits  -----><---------  32 bits  ----------> 

             Figure 2: format of a 56-bit 6RD prefix 

   Modified GRE [RFC2784] with additional auto-configuration mechanism 
   is also suitable to support v6-over-v4 tunnelling. In order to auto-
   configure GRE tunnel, an interactive mechanism between tunnel

   initiator and tunnel concentrator is needed. The parameters that 
   tunnel configuration requires can be obtained through DHCPv6. 

   Other tunnelling mechanisms such as Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel 
   Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214] or Virtual Enterprise 
   Traversal (VET) [VET] could also be considered. ISATAP is an IPv6 
   transition mechanism meant to transmit IPv6 packets between dual-
   stack nodes on top of an IPv4 network. VET represents a functional 
   superset of 6over4 [RFC2529] and ISATAP. It support tunnel 
   autoconfiguration. 

   If the ISP has an entirely MPLS infrastructure between the CPE and 
   the dual-stack CGN, it would also be possible to consider a 6PE 
   [RFC4798] tunnel directly over MPLS. This would, however, only be 
   suitable for an advanced CPE that is unlikely to be found as a home 
   gateway, and is not further discussed here. 

        3.3. Behaviour of Dual-stack Home Gateway 

   When a dual-stack home gateway receives a data packet from an end 
   host, it firstly checks whether the packet is IPv4 or IPv6. For IPv4 
   data, the HG can directly forward it if there is no v4-v4 NAT running 
   on the HG. Or the HG translates packet source address from a HG-scope 
   private IPv4 address into a CGN-scope private IPv4 address. The HG 
   SHOULD record the v4-v4 address mapping information for inbound 
   packets, just like normal NAT does. 

   For IPv6 data, the HG needs to encapsulate the data into an IPv4 
   tunnel, which has the dual-stack CGN as the other end. Then the HG 
   sends the new IPv4 packet towards CGN. 

   The HG SHOULD record the mapping information between the tunnel and 
   the source IPv6 address for inbound packets if HG uplinks to more 
   than one CGN. Detailed considerations for the use of multiple CGNs by 
   one HG are for further study. 

        3.4. Behaviour of Dual-stack Carrier-Grade NAT 

   When a dual-stack CGN receives a data packet from a dual-stack home 
   gateway, it firstly checks whether the packet is a normal IPv4 packet 
   or a v6-over-v4 tunnel packet. For a normal IPv4 packet, the CGN 
   translates packet source address from a CGN-scope private IPv4 
   address into a public IPv4 address, and then send it to IPv4 Internet. 
   The CGN SHOULD record the v4-v4 address mapping information for 
   inbound packets, just like normal NAT does. For a v6-over-v4 tunnel 
   packet, the CGN needs to decapsulate it into the original IPv6 packet 
   and then send it to IPv6 Internet. The CGN SHOULD record the mapping

   information between the tunnel and the source IPv6 address for 
   inbound packets. 

   Depending on the deployed location of the CGN, it MAY use v6-over-v4 
   tunnels to connect to the IPv6 Internet. 

3.5. Impact for end hosts and remaining networks 

   This solution does not affect the remaining networks at all. Legacy 
   IPv4 ISP networks and their IPv4 devices remain in use. The existing 
   IPv4 hosts, shown as the right box in Figure 1, either having global 
   IPv4 addresses or behind v4-v4 NAT can connect to IPv4 Internet as it 
   is now. Of course, these hosts can access IPv6 Internet through IPv4 
   ISP network by using IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel technologies. 

3.6. Discussion 

   It SHOULD be noted that for IPv4 traffic, this solution inherits all 
   the problems of CGN (e.g., scaling, and the difficulty of supporting 
   well-known ports for inbound traffic). Application layer problems 
   created by double NAT are for further study. 

   If a different solution than v4-v4 NAT is chosen for IPv4 address 
   sharing, for example [APLUSP], the present solution could be suitably 
   modified, for example replacing the v4-v4 NAT function by the A+P 
   gateway function. 

   However, for IPv6 traffic, a user behind the DS HG will see normal 
   IPv6 service. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that all IPv6 tunnels 
   support an MTU of at least 1500 bytes, to ensure that the mechanism 
   usually does not cause fragmentation of IPv6 traffic. This, and the 
   absence of NAT problems for IPv6, will create an incentive for users 
   and application service providers to prefer IPv6. 

   ICMP filtering function MAY be included as part of CGN functions. Any 
   firewall included in the CGN SHOULD follow the recommendations in 
   [RFC4890]. 

4. Migration towards IPv6 Core Network 

   When the core network starts transition to IPv6, this solution can 
   easily be transited into Phase 2, in which the ISP network is either 
   dual-stack or IPv6-only. 

   For dual-stack ISP networks, dual-stack home gateways can simply 
   switch off the v6-over-v4 function and forward both IPv6 and IPv4 
   traffic directly; the dual-stack CGN SHOULD only keep its v4-v4 NAT

   function. However, this is considered an unlikely choice, since we 
   expect ISPs to choose the approach described here because they want 
   to avoid dual-stack deployment completely. 

   For IPv6-only ISP networks, the dual-stack lite solution [DSLite], 
   which also needs dual-stack home gateway and CGN devices, can be 
   adopted for Phase 2. The best business model for this solution is 
   that CPE has integrated the functions for both Phase 1 and 2, and can 
   automatically detect the change. For example, the DS HG can use the 
   appearance of IPv6 Route Advertisement messages or DHCPv6 messages as 
   a signal that Phase 2 has started. Then when ISPs decide to switch 
   from Phase 1 to Phase 2, it may be that only a configuration change 
   or a minor software update is needed on the CGNs. The DS HG will then 
   switch automatically to DSLite mode. The only impact on the home user 
   will be to receive a different IPv6 prefix.  

   Note that if the 6RD mechanism is used in Phase 1, the user may have 
   a /64 prefix during Phase 1, but could get a shorter prefix such as 
   /56 in Phase 2. This would be an improved service offering available 
   as a result of the Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition.  

   It will not be necessary for all customers of a given ISP to switch 
   from Phase 1 to Phase 2 simultaneously; in fact it will be 
   operationally better to switch small groups of customers (e.g. all 
   those connected to a single point of presence). This is a matter of 
   planning and scheduling. 

4.1. Legacy communication in Phase 2 

   We do not expect to see IPv6-only public services as long as there is 
   an IPv4-only customer base in the world, for obvious commercial 
   reasons. However, especially in Phase 2, IPv4/IPv6 intercommunication 
   may become issues. [DSLInter] describes a proposal to enhance DS-lite 
   solution with an additional feature to ease interconnection between 
   IPv4 and IPv6 realms. Furthermore, home users may encounter the 
   problem of reaching legacy IPv4-only public services from IPv6-only 
   clients. This problem could already exist in Phase 1, but will become 
   more serious as time goes on. It is proposed that each ISP should 
   provide its IPv6-only customers with a network-layer translation 
   service to satisfy this need. Such a service is not fully defined at 
   this time, so we refer to it non-specifically as NAT64.  

   We propose that the NAT64 service should be provided as a common 
   service located at the border between the ISP and the IPv4 Internet, 
   beyond the dual stack CGN from the customer's viewpoint. It MAY be 
   integrated into CGN devices too. The question has been asked why it 
   is better to do this than to distribute the NAT64 function by

   locating it in (or near) the home gateway, so that relevant 
   translation state resides only in the HG. While this might be 
   suitable in Phase 1, when the ISP still provides full IPv4 
   connectivity, it would force all translated traffic into DSLite 
   tunnels in Phase 2. This seems undesirable. 

5. Security Considerations 

   Security issues associated with NAT have been documented in [RFC2663] 
   and [RFC2993]. 

   Further security analysis will be needed to understand double NAT 
   security issues and tunnel security issues. However, since the tunnel 
   proposed here exists entirely within a single ISP network, between 
   the CPE and the CGN, the threat model is relatively simple. [RFC4891] 
   describes how to protect tunnels using IPSec, but it is not clear 
   whether this would be an important requirement. An ISP could deem its 
   infrastructure to have sufficient security without additional 
   protection of the tunnels. 

   The dual-stack home gateway will need to provide basic security for 
   IPv6 [6CPESec]. Other aspects are described in [RFC4864].

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
