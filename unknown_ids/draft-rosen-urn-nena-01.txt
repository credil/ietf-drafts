     URN Namespace for National Emergency Number Association (NENA)
                        draft-rosen-urn-nena-01

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'nena' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URN) resources published by National
   Emergency Number Association (NENA).  NENA defines and manages
   resources that utilize this URN name model.  Management activities
   for these and other resource types are provided by the National
   Emergency Number Association (NENA) Registry System (NRS).

1.  Introduction

   NENA is the "Voice of 9-1-1" in North America.  NENA's mission is to
   foster the technological advancement, availability and implementation
   of a universal emergency telephone number system (9-1-1).  In
   carrying out its mission, NENA promotes research, planning, training
   and education.  The protection of human life, the preservation of
   property, and the maintenance of general community security are among
   NENA's objectives.  NENA serves as a link in the delivery of
   emergency services. 9-1-1 has, throughout its evolution, become
   recognized as an asset of the North American public.

   NENA is currently in the process of setting standards, processes and
   procedures for the use of an IP-based Emergency Services IP Network
   (ESInet) for all public safety entities in North America.  This
   activity is supported by a membership composed of private and public
   sector entities that have an interest in 9-1-1 and public safety.
   This effort, dubbed "Next Generation 9-1-1" (NG9-1-1) is based in
   large part on IETF standards for interactive media session
   establishment and emergency calling.

   Some of the solutions being developed by NENA need XML namespaces
   that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific
   Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141] Namespace ID (NID) for use by
   NENA was deemed appropriate.  Therefore, a full and complete
   registration will follow the namespace specification process as
   defined in [RFC3406].

2.  URN Specification for "nena" NID

  Namespace ID: nena

  Registration Information:
    registration version number: 1
    registration date: YYYY-MM-DD  [RFC Editor, please replace with the
            date of approval of this document for publication as an RFC]

  Declared registrant of the namespace:
    Registering organization
      Name:       National Emergency Number Association (NENA)
      Address:    4350 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 750
                  Arlington, VA 22203-1695

  Designated contact:
    Role:    NENA Registry Services Administrator
    Email:   nrs-admin@nena.org

  Declaration of syntactic structure:
  The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "nena"
  NID will have the following structure:
      {NENAclass}:ClassSpecificString}

   The "NENAclass" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN syntax
   requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of resource type.
   Each class will have a specific labeling scheme that is covered by
   "ClassSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming requirements
   of [RFC2141].

   NENA maintains a naming authority, the National Emergency Number
   Association (NENA) Registration System (NRS) that will manage the
   assignment of "NENAclass" and the specific registration values
   assigned for each class.  Other NENA Standards documents will define
   the "ClassSpecificStrings" for a given "NENAclass".

   Relevant ancillary documentation:
   The National Emergency Number Association Registration System (NRS)
   provides information on the registered resources and the
   registrations for each.  More information about NRS and the
   registration activities and procedures to be followed are defined in
   "Managing Registries for NENA Next Generation Data Elements Technical
   Standard Document", NENA 70-001, which is available at:
   http://www.nena.org/standard/nena-registry-system.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:
   The NRS will manage resources using the "nena" NID and will be the
   authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings

   associated.  In the associated procedures, NRS will ensure the
   uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary
   responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.

   NENA may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
   registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
   same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only intended
   for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.

   Identifier persistence considerations:
   NRS will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of the
   "nena" NID.  NRS will establish a registry for NENAclass.  Each
   NENAclass will have a separate description in the registry and may
   have its own sub-registry.

   The registries and information will be published and maintained by
   NRS on its web site.

   Process of identifier assignment:
   NRS will provide procedures for registration of each class that it
   maintains.  Each such resource may have three types of registration
   activities:
   1.  Registered values associated with NENA specifications or services
   2.  Registration of values or sub-registries to other entities
   3.  Name models for use in experimental purposes

   Process for identifier resolution:
   The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:
   No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
   [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:
   No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:
   None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
   implemented in support of NENA activities.

   Scope:
   Global


3.  Examples

   The following examples are representative urns that could be assigned
   by NRS.  They may not be the actual strings that would be assigned.

   NENAresource "psaproute"
   Syntax: "urn:nena.emergencyresponders:<responder name>"
   ResourceSpecificString: simple string with name of responder,
                           defined in a sub-registry
   Use: Defines the urn to be used for queries to an NG9-1-1 Emergency
   Call Routing Function that provides URIs for responding agencies.

   Examples:
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:ambulance
   urn:neon:emergencyresponders:fire
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:police
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:poison
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:coastguard
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:marine


4.  Namespace Considerations

   The National Emergency Number Association is developing a variety of
   applications and services.  Some of these services require that
   supporting information (e.g., data descriptions, attributes, etc.) be
   fully specified.  For proper operation, descriptions of the needed
   supporting information must exist and be available in a unique,
   reliable, and persistent manner.  These dependencies provide the
   basis of need for namespaces, in one form or another.

   As the National Emergency Number Association work is ongoing and
   covers many technical areas, the possibility of binding to various
   other namespace repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each
   object or description, as defined in NENA, could possibly be related
   to multiple different other namespaces, so further conflicts of
   association could occur.  Thus the intent is to utilize the National
   Emergency Number Association Registration System, operated by NENA,
   as the naming authority for NENA-defined objects and descriptions.


5.  Community Considerations

   The objects and descriptions required for services defined by NENA
   are generally available for use by other organizations.  The National
   Emergency Number Association will provide access and support for name
   requests by these organizations.  This support can be enabled in a
   timely and responsive fashion as new objects and descriptions are
   produced.  These will be enabled in a fashion similar to current IANA
   processes.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry in the urn-namespaces registry.  The
   namespace should be "nena".  The defining document is this RFC.  The
   entry can be found at: http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces
   and any associated mirrors.
