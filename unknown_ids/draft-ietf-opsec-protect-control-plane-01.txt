Abstract

   This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane
   from undesired or malicious traffic.  In this approach, all
   legitimate router control plane traffic is identified.  Once
   legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed in the
   router's forwarding plane.  That filter prevents traffic not
   specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's
   control plane or rate limited to an acceptable level.

1.  Introduction

   Modern router architecture design maintains a strict separation of
   forwarding and routing control plane hardware and software.  The
   router control plane supports routing and management functions, and
   is generally described as router architecture hardware and software
   components for handling packets destined to the device itself as well
   as building and sending packets originated locally on the device.
   Forwarding plane is typically described as router architecture
   hardware and software components responsible for taking a packet
   coming in one interface, performing a lookup to identify the packet's
   IP next hop and determine the outgoing interface towards the
   destination, and forwarding the packet through the correct outgoing
   interface.

   Visually it can be represented as the router's control plane hardware
   sitting on top of and interfacing with the forwarding plane hardware,
   with interfaces connecting to other network devices.  See Figure 1.

   Typically, forwarding plane functionality is realized in high-
   performance Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are
   capable of handling very high packet rates.  By contrast, the router
   control plane is generally realized in software on general purpose
   processors.  While software instructions run on both planes, the
   router control plane software is usually not optimized for high speed
   packet handling.  Given their differences in packet handling
   capabilities, the router's control plane hardware is more susceptible
   to be overwhelmed by a DoS attack than forwarding plane ASICs.  It is
   imperative that the router control plane remain stable regardless of
   traffic load to and from the device because the router control plane
   is what drives the programming of the forwarding plane.

   The router control plane processes traffic destined to the router,

   and because of the wider range of functionality is more susceptible
   to security vulnerabilities and a more likely target for a DoS attack
   than the forwarding plane.

   It is advisable to protect the router control plane by implementing
   mechanisms to filter completely or rate limit traffic not required at
   the control plane level (i.e., unwanted traffic).  Router Control
   Plane Protection is the concept of filtering or rate limiting
   unwanted traffic which would be diverted out of the forwarding plane
   up to the router control plane.  The closer to the forwarding plane
   and line-rate hardware the filters and rate-limiters are, the more
   effective the protection is and the more resistant the system is to
   DoS attacks.  This memo demonstrates how to deploy an example policy
   filter that satisfies a set of example traffic matching, filtering
   and rate limiting criteria.


2.  Applicability Statement

   The method described in Section 3 and depicted in Figure 1
   illustrates how to protect the router control plane from unwanted
   traffic.  Recognizing that deployment scenarios will vary, the exact
   implementation is not generally applicable in all situations.  The
   categorization of legitimate router control plane traffic is
   critically important in a successful implementation.

   The examples given in this memo are simplified and minimalistic,
   designed to illustrate the concept of protecting the router's control
   plane.  From them, operators can extrapolate specifics based on their
   unique configuration and environment.

   Additionally, there may be other vendor or implementation specific
   protection mechanisms that are on-by-default or always-on.  Those
   approaches may apply in conjunction with or in addition to the method
   described in Section 3 and illustrated in Appendices A and B. Those
   implementations should be considered as part of an overall traffic
   management plan but are outside the scope of this document.

   This method is applicable for IPv4 as well as IPv6 address families.


3.  Method

   In this memo, the authors demonstrate how a filter protecting the
   router control plane can be deployed.  In Section 3.1, a sample
   router is introduced and all traffic that its control plane must
   process is identified.  In Section 3.2, filter design concepts are
   discussed.  Cisco (Cisco IOS software) and Juniper (JUNOS)

   implementations are provided in Appendices A and B, respectively.

3.1.  Legitimate Traffic

   In this example, the router control plane must process traffic per
   the following criteria:

   o  Drop all IP packets that are fragments

   o  Permit ICMP traffic from any source, rate-limited to 500 kbps

   o  Permit OSPF traffic from routers within the local network
      (192.0.2.0/24)

   o  Permit iBGP traffic from routers within the local network
      (192.0.2.0/24)

   o  Permit eBGP traffic from known eBGP peers (198.51.100.25,
      198.51.100.27, 198.51.100.29, and 198.51.100.31)

   o  Permit DNS traffic from local DNS resolvers (198.51.100.0/30)

   o  Permit NTP traffic from local NTP servers (198.51.100.4/30)

   o  Permit SSH traffic from network management stations
      (198.51.100.128/25)

   o  Permit SNMP traffic from network management stations
      (198.51.100.128/25)

   o  Permit RADIUS authentication and accounting replies from RADIUS
      servers (198.51.100.9 and 198.51.100.10) that are listening on UDP
      ports 1645 and 1646.  Note that this doesn't account for a server
      using Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) ports 1812 and
      1813 for RADIUS.

   o  Permit all other IP traffic that was not explicitly matched in a
      class above, rate-limited to 500 kbps, and drop above that rate

   o  Permit non-IP traffic, rate-limited to rate of 250 kbps, and drop
      all remaining traffic above that rate

   The characteristics of legitimate traffic will vary from network to
   network.  The list provided above is for example only.

3.2.  Filter Design

   A filter is installed on the forwarding plane.  This filter counts
   and applies the actions to the categories of traffic described in
   Section 3.1.  Because the filter is enforced in the forwarding plane,
   it prevents traffic from consuming bandwidth on the interface that
   connects the forwarding plane to the router control plane.  The
   counters serve as an important forensic tool for the analysis of
   potential attacks, and as an invaluable debugging and troubleshooting
   aid.  By adjusting the granularity and order of the filters more
   granular forensics can be performed (i.e., create a filter that
   matches only on traffic allowed from a group of IP addresses for a
   given protocol followed by a filter that denies all traffic for that
   protocol).  This would allow for counters to be monitored for the
   allowed protocol filter as well as any traffic matching traffic for
   the specific protocol that didn't originate from the explicitly
   allowed hosts.

   In addition to the filters, rate-limiters for certain classes of
   traffic are also installed in the forwarding plane as defined in
   Section 3.1.  These rate limiters help futher control the traffic
   that will reach the control plane for each filtered class as well as
   all traffic not matching an explicit class.  The actual rates
   selected for various classes is network deployment specific and
   analysis of required rates for stability should be done periodically.

   Syntactically, these filters explicitly define "allowed" traffic
   (including IP addresses, protocols, and ports), define acceptable
   actions for these acceptable traffic profiles (e.g., rate-limit or
   simply permit the traffic), and then drop to the bit bucket all
   traffic destined to the router control plane that is not within the
   specifications of the policy definition.

   In an actual production environment, predicting a complete and
   exhaustive list of traffic necessary to reach the router's control
   plane for day-to-day operation may not be this obvious.  One
   recommended method to gauge this set of traffic is to allow all
   traffic initially, and audit what hits the router control plane
   before applying any explicit filters or rate limits.  See the
   Section 3.3 section below for more discussion of this topic.

   The filter design provided in this document is intentionally limited
   to attachment at the local router in question (e.g., a 'service-
   policy' attached to the 'control-plane' in Cisco IOS, or a firewall
   filter attached to the 'lo0' interface in JUNOS).  While virtually
   all production environments utilize and rely heavily upon edge
   protection or interface filtering, these methods of router protection
   are beyond the intended scope of this document.  Additionally, the

Internet-Draft        Protect Router Control Plane             July 2010


   protocols themselves that are allowed to reach the control plane
   (e.g., OSPF, RSVP, TCP, SNMP, DNS, NTP, and inherently, SSH, TLS,
   ESP, etc.) may have cryptographic security methods applied to them,
   and the method of router control plane protection herein provided is
   not a replacement for these cryptographic methods.

3.3.  Design Trade-offs

   In designing the protection method, there are two independent parts
   to consider: the classification of traffic (i.e., which traffic is
   matched by the filters), and the policy actions taken on the
   classified traffic.

   There are different levels of granularity utilized for traffic
   classification.  For example, allowing all traffic from specific
   source IP addresses versus allowing only a specific set of protocols
   from those specific source IP addresses will each affect a different
   set of traffic.

   Similarly, the policy actions taken on the classified traffic have
   degrees of impact that may not become immediately obvious.  For
   example, discarding all ICMP traffic may have a negative impact on
   the operational use of ICMP tools such as ping or traceroute to debug
   network issues or to test turn up of a new circuit.  Expanding on
   this, in a real production network, an astute operator could define
   varying rate limits for ICMP such that internal traffic is granted
   uninhibited access to the router control plane, while traffic from
   external addresses is rate limited.

   It is important to note that both classification and policy action
   decisions are accompanied by respective trade-offs.  Two examples of
   these trade-off decisions are, operational complexity at the expense
   of policy (and statistics gathering) detail, and tighter protection
   at the expense of network supportability and troubleshooting ability.

   Two types of traffic that need special consideration are IP fragments
   and IP optioned packets.  For network deployments where IP
   fragmentation is necessary, a blanket policy of dropping all
   fragments may not be possible.  However, many deployments allow
   network configurations such that the router control plane should
   never see a fragmented datagram.  Since many attacks rely on ip
   fragmentation the example policy referenced here drops all fragments.
   Similarly, some deployments may chose to drop all IP Optioned
   Packets.  Others may need to losen the constraint to allow for
   protocols that require IP Optioned packets such as RSVP.

   The goal of the method for protecting the router control plane is to
   minimize potential disruptions.  The granularity of the filter design



Dugal, et al.            Expires January 8, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Protect Router Control Plane             July 2010


   inversely correlates to the scope of the potential disruption.  The
   finer the granularity of the filter design (e.g., isolating a more
   targeted subset of traffic from the rest of the policed traffic, or
   isolating valid source addresses into a different class or classes)
   the smaller the scope of disruption.

   Additionally, the baselining and monitoring of traffic flows to the
   router's control plane are critical in determining both the rates and
   granularity of the policies being applied.  This is important to
   validate the existing policies and rules or update them as the
   network evolves and its traffic dynamics change.  Some possible ways
   to achieve this include individual policy counters that can be
   exported or retrieved for example via SNMP, and logging of filtering
   actions.

   Finally, the use of flow-based behavioral analysis or CLI functions
   to identify what client/server functions a given router's control
   plane handles would be very useful during initial policy development
   phases, and certainly for forensic analysis afterwards.


4.  Security Considerations

   The filter above leaves the router susceptible to discovery from any
   host on the Internet.  If network operators find this risk
   objectionable, they can mitigate it by restricting the sub-networks
   from which ICMP Echo requests or traceroute packets are accepted.
   Moreover, different rate-limiting policies may be defined for
   internally (e.g., from the NOC) versus externally sourced traffic.

   The filter above also leaves the router exposed to port scans from
   hosts spoofing the source addresses found in Section 3.1.  Network
   operators can mitigate this risk by preventing source address
   spoofing with filters applied at the network edge.  Refer to Section
   5.3.8 of [RFC1812] for more information regarding source address
   validation.  Other methods also exist for limiting exposure to packet
   spoofing such as the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)
   [RFC5082] and Ingress Filtering [RFC2827] [RFC3704].

   The ICMP rate limiter specified in this filter protects the router
   from floods of ICMP traffic.  However, during an ICMP flood, some
   legitimate ICMP traffic may be dropped.  Because of this, when
   operators discover a flood of ICMP traffic, they are highly motivated
   to cut it off at its source.

   Additional considerations pertaining to the usage and handling of
   traffic that utilizes the IP Router Alert Options can be found at
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-router-alert-considerations], and additional IP

   Options filtering explanations can be found at
   [I-D.gont-opsec-ip-options-filtering].

   The treatment of exception traffic in the forwarding plane, and the
   generation of specific messages by the router control plane also
   requires protection from a DoS attack.  Specifically, the generation
   of ICMP Unreachable messages by the router control plane needs to be
   rate-limited, either implicitly within the router's architecture or
   explicitly through configuration.  See Section 4.3.2.8 of [RFC1812].

   Additionally, the handling of TTL / Hop Limit expired traffic needs
   protection.  This traffic is not necessarily addressed to the device,
   but it can get sent to the control plane to process the TTL / Hop
   Limit expiration.  For example, rate limiting the TTL / Hop Limit
   expired traffic before sending the packets to the router control
   plane component that will generate the ICMP error, and distributing
   the sending of ICMP errors to Line Card CPUs are protection
   mechanisms that mitigate attacks before they can negatively affect a
   rate-limited router control plane component.
