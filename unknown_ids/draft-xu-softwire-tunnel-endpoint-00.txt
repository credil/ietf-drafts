Abstract 

   The Softwire Mesh Framework [RFC5565] provides a solution for intra-
   AS softwires, but not inter-AS softwires.  The ability to provide 
   inter-AS softwires extends the benefits of softwires to a larger 
   scale.  Indeed, [RFC5565] discusses the possibility of inter-AS 
   softwires, but does not provide a solution.  This document defines a 
   specific Extended Community attribute called the Tunnel Endpoint 
   attribute, which allows for inter-AS softwires.

1. Introduction 

   This document uses the terms "I-IP" (Internal IP) and "E-IP" 
   (External IP) as they are used in [RFC5565].  The I-IP is the 
   internally used IP (i.e. IPv4 in Figure 2 and Figure 3), and the E-
   IP is the externally supported IP (i.e. IPv6 in Figure 2 and Figure 
   3). 

   The Softwire Mesh Framework [RFC5565] mainly discusses softwire mesh 
   solution for intra-AS scenario, where a "transit core" consists of a 
   single Autonomous System (AS).  The inter-AS deployment scenario is 
   mentioned as well, but no solution is provided.  The benefits of 
   intra-AS softwires, namely that I-IP P routers do not need to 
   operate the E-IP protocol (routing and forwarding), applies to the 
   inter-AS case as well.  In the context of the RFC5565 problem, 
   consider the following scenario (Figure 1):

   Here, the packet from one IPv6 client network is tunneled over IPv4 
   in the first transit from the ingress AFBR to the egress AFBR.  The 
   packet is de-tunneled at the egress AFBR, and then re-tunneled by

   the next AFBR, i.e., the ingress AFBR of the second transit.  If the 
   IPv4 tunnel could extend its end point and last from the ingress 
   AFBR of the first transit to the egress AFBR of the second transit 
   (Figure 2), the de-tunneling and re-tunneling in the middle could be 
   avoided.  In fact, the two routers connecting the two transits (R52 
   and R61) need not have AFBR tunneling capabilities at all (though 
   they must still have extended MP-BGP capability to transmit E-IP 
   routes and tunnel signaling parameters, we'll refer to it as MP-BGP 
   control plane in this draft).

   all border routers still require MP-BGP control planes).  Note that 
   this could also be an IPv6 transit supporting IPv4 client networks. 

    

   Now consider the scenario of Figure 3 below.  Here, there is a 
   transit network between two AFBR-capable transits that does not 
   operate any AFBR.  RFC5565 points out the critical difference 
   between intra-AS and inter-AS scenario like Figure 3. For inter-AS 
   softwire, the AFBR at the remote endpoint of a softwire is not the 
   BGP next hop for packets that need to be sent on the softwire. Since 
   the intra-AS softwire solution require the remote softwire endpoint 
   address to be the same as the BGP next hop, it does not fit the 
   inter-AS situation.

   these could also be IPv6 transits supporting IPv4 client networks. 

    

   RFC5565 suggests three ways to deal with inter-AS scenarios: 

         1. Don't do it; require AFBRs to be deployed at the edge of 
   each AS so that a transit core does not extend to more than one AS. 

         2. Use multi-hop eBGP to allow AFBRs to send BGP routes to 
   each other, even if the ABFRs are not in the same or in neighboring         
   ASes.

Internet-Draft    Simple Tunnel Endpoint Signaling in BGP  October 2009 
 
         3. Ensure that an ASBR that is not an AFBR does not change the         
   next hop field of the routes for which encapsulation is needed. 

   This first approach results in reduced forwarding performance for 
   many routers.  This is both because of the extra tunneling 
   operations, and because IPv6 forwarding is slower than IPv4 
   forwarding (for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario).  What's more, it does not 
   apply to the scenario in Figure 3.  

   The second approach is not scalable:  routers cannot afford to have 
   the number of BGP neighbors implied by inter-AS full mesh. 

   The third approach is a substantial departure from the existing BGP 
   control plane.  In fact, since BGP requires that the IGP have routes 
   to all possible Next Hops, this approach increases the load on the 
   IGP in unpredictable ways, and weakens the separation between IGP 
   and BGP. 

   By contrast, the vast majority of routers today have both IPv4 and 
   IPv6 (MP-BGP) control planes even if they do not have AFBR 
   functionality.  This suggests that a solution that exploits this 
   existing functionality is preferred to the three approaches of 
   RFC5565. 

   This draft suggests such a fourth approach.  It follows the "spirit" 
   of approach 3 in which it does not require tunneling operations on 
   every AS edge.  However, this approach fits much better into current 
   BGP operation.  Namely, this draft proposes the Tunnel Endpoint 
   attribute: an attribute that carries the address of the tunnel 
   endpoint and is transitive across ASes. 

   In the context of Figure 3, the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute works as 
   follows.  Note that the labels of the routers in Figure 3 refer only 
   to the data plane operation.  The control plane of all border 
   routers must be dual-stack and support extended MP-BGP for softwire 
   (non-border routers can be IPv4 or IPv6 only).  AFBR R11 for 
   instance would advertise an IPv6 prefix for Client Network CN1 in a 
   BGP update, and attach a Tunnel Endpoint Attribute conveying its own 
   IPv4 address.  This attribute would be carried along BGP until it 
   reaches AFBR R32.  AFBR R32 would then learn to tunnel IPv6 packets 
   destined for CN1 to AFBR R11 using an IPv4 tunnel. 

   Given that the "IPv4" border routers never actually forward IPv6 
   packets, however, it is entirely possible to upgrade them to operate 
   with a "crippled" IPv6 data plane.  This could be done by FIB-
   suppressing the IPv6 prefixes, thus isolating FIB size from growth 
   in IPv6.  It could also be done for instance by implementing IPv6

Internet-Draft    Simple Tunnel Endpoint Signaling in BGP  October 2009 
 
   forwarding in software only, or by having no IPv6 forwarding 
   capability at all.  This mode of operation reduces the hardware 
   costs of "IPv4" border routers, since they do not need to 
   accommodate high-performance IPv6 forwarding in hardware, or 
   accommodate IPv6 forwarding at all.  (Or vice versa:  the transit 
   networks could be IPv6 networks with crippled IPv4 data planes 
   interconnecting IPv4 client networks.) 

2. Syntax of the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute 

   This draft describes a mechanism for advertising the tunnel endpoint 
   address across ASes in BGP.  This draft uses both the Address 
   Specific BGP Extended Communities Attribute for IPv4 and IPv6 
   ([RFC4360] and [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-v6-ext-communities]) to carry the 
   tunnel endpoint address respectively. Where the tunnel type and/or 
   additional tunnel parameters (i.e. for GRE or L2TP) must be signaled, 
   this draft uses the mechanisms (e.g., Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute 
   (TEncap-Attribute)) defined in [RFC5512] to encode these parameters. 

   A new IPv4 or IPv6 Address Specific BGP Extended Communities 
   Attribute is used as the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute. The value of the 
   high-order octet for the IPv4 type field is 0x01 as defined in 
   [RFC4360] and for the IPv6 type field it is 0x00 as defined in [I-
   D.ietf-l3vpn-v6-ext-communities]. The value of the low-order octet 
   for the type field (i.e. the Sub-Type) is (TBD by IANA) for IPv4 and 
   (TBD by IANA) for IPv6. The Global Administrator field is set to the 
   Tunnel Endpoint address (i.e., one of the egress AFBR's I-IP 
   addresses which are routable in the transit network). The Local 
   Administrator field is set to zero and ignored upon receipt. The 
   attribute is transitive across ASes. 

3. Usage of the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute 

3.1. Cooperate with other BGP extensions for softwire 

   Since the existing BGP extensions for softwire (RFC4798, RFC5549, 
   RFC5512) are all defined under the scope of RFC5565, or we say, 
   these extensions are mainly well-considered for the intra-AS 
   scenario, it's necessary that we verify them for inter-AS scenario, 
   to see that if they works as well, with the Tunnel Endpoint 
   Attribute. 

   The extensions for softwire routing E-IP prefix in I-IP network are 
   defined in RFC4798 and RFC5549, for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario and 
   IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario respectively. In both extensions, routes are 
   carried in MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes. Since the 
   two attributes are non-transitive as defined, the non-AFBR border

Internet-Draft    Simple Tunnel Endpoint Signaling in BGP  October 2009 
 
   BGP routers (e.g. routers labeled "IPv4" in Figure 3) must support 
   these MP-BGP extensions, or the routes will just be dropped with 
   MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes. The corresponding 
   capability advertisement procedure is needed, as described in 
   RFC4798 and RFC5549. 

   RFC5512 provide two approaches to do tunnel signaling. The first one 
   is to use Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute. Tunnel Encapsulation 
   Attribute is already defined as a transitive attribute so as to be 
   passed through the intermediate BGP routers.  The second approach is 
   to use BGP Encapsulation Extended Community (for the situation where 
   only tunnel type rather than along with other encapsulation 
   information is required). This extended community is transitive as 
   Tunnel Endpoint Attribute, so it works well in inter-AS scenario. 

3.2. Inter-AS and Intra-AS mixed scenario 

   The approach using Tunnel Endpoint Attribute works well in the 
   complicated scenario where both inter-AS softwire and intra-AS 
   softwire exist. Figure 4 shows a typical example of this situation. 
   There is a collection of ASes and two client networks CN8 and CN9 in 
   this example.  The client networks operate only the E-IP.  There are 
   three ASes that operate as an inter-AS softwire "cloud": S-AS1, S-
   AS2, and S-AS3 (S-AS means Softwire-AS, that is an AS which supports 
   softwire functionality by using AFBRs or ASBRs that support MP-BGP 
   for E-IP).  In addition, there is a dual stack AS which is running 
   full dual-stack services (both control and data planes).  The dual-
   stack AS, however, is by agreement not considered part of the 
   softwires cloud.  There is an AS that operates only the I-IP:  it 
   offers no E-IP services at all (either data plane or control plane). 
   Finally, there is an AS that operates only the E-IP:  it offers no 
   I-IP services at all.

   Figure 4:  Example inter-AS softwires deployment with other types of 
   networks.  S-AS1, S-AS2, and S-AS3 form the softwires cloud. 

    
   What does it mean to be "part of the softwires cloud"?  It means 
   that all E-IP packets that traverse the cloud must be transmitted 
   over I-IP softwires, because there are routers in the participating 
   ASes that cannot forward E-IP packets.  This in turn implies that 
   every S-AS participating in the cloud must deploy an AFBR with all 
   ASes that operate the E-IP and are not in the cloud.  As such, in 
   Figure 4, S-AS1 must deploy AFBRs at the interface with the Dual 
   Stack AS and the E-IP Only AS (as well as with the Client Network).   

   Note that the Dual Stack AS in principle could join the softwires 
   cloud, since it is capable of carrying packets tunneled in the I-IP.  
   If it did, however, then either there would still have to be an AFBR 
   at the edge of S-AS1 and the Dual Stack AS, or the Dual Stack AS 
   would have to deploy an AFBR at the border with every AS operating 
   the E-IP and not in the cloud.  Otherwise, one of those ASes could 
   send a native E-IP packet with a destination address in CN8 into the

   Dual Stack AS, which would not be able to forward it to S-AS1 even 
   though S-AS1 advertised the prefix for CN8.   

   Let's consider an example of BGP using Tunnel Endpoint Attribute in 
   Figure 4.  Suppose that CN8 advertises an E-IP prefix to S-AS1.  
   AFBR R11 in S-AS1 attaches the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute with its 
   own I-IP address to the update, and forwards it to R12, R13, R14 and 
   R15 via iBGP.  Because S-AS2 is part of the softwires cloud, R12 
   advertises the CN8 prefix to S-AS2, even though R12 is not capable 
   of forwarding E-IP packets.  As AFBRs, R13 and R15 advertise the CN8 
   prefix to the Dual Stack and E-IP Only ASes, but without the Tunnel 
   Endpoint Attribute.  The prefix for CN8 is not advertised to the I-
   IP Only AS since it doesn't support E-IP control plane.  R14 does, 
   however, advertise I-IP BGP prefixes to the I-IP Only AS so as to 
   allow I-IP packets to reach S-AS1. 

   The prefix for CN8 reaches S-AS3 at three points, R32, R33, and R35.  
   The latter two attach the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute with themselves 
   as the tunnel endpoint since they are AFBRs, while R32 still keeps 
   Tunnel Endpoint Attribute to be the I-IP address of R11.  R31 will 
   receive prefix for CN8 from R32, R33, and R35 respectively. Finally, 
   the prefix for CN8 is advertised to CN9 from R31.  Note now that 
   packets from CN9 to CN8 may traverse any of the four intervening 
   ASes.  If R31 chooses to use intra-AS softwire, then the packet 
   encapsulated by R31 will either reach R33, get decapsulated and go 
   through the Dual Stack AS to reach S-AS1 at R13 for the second-time 
   tunneling from R13 to R11, or get decapsulated at R35, and reach S-
   AS1 through the E-IP Only AS and then tunneled from R15 to R11. If 
   R31 chooses to use inter-AS softwire, the packets will be 
   encapsulated at R31 and decapsulated at R11.  This tunneled packet, 
   however, may traverse any of S-AS2, the Dual Stack AS, or the I-IP 
   Only AS, depending on which best path was selected for the prefix 
   holding the tunnel address for R11.  Note in particular that the AS 
   path taken by the tunneled packet from ingress AFBR to egress AFBR 
   may not be the AS path indicated in the E-IP BGP update, because BGP 
   decision process for I-IP and E-IP routes are independent. 

   In any event, this example illustrates that inter-AS softwires is 
   quite robust.  As long as there is any E-IP BGP control-plane path 
   between two E-IP Client Networks, any path to the tunnel endpoint 
   address can be used to transmit the tunneled packets. 

3.3. Aggregation consideration 

   When multiple routes with different tunnel endpoint addresses are 
   aggregated, the aggregating router must attach a Tunnel Endpoint

   Figure 5:  Example of Aggregation 

    

   Here, S-AS2 wishes to aggregate its customer Client Networks 
   3.3.3.0/25 and 3.3.3.128/25 into a single aggregated 3.3.3.0/24.  In 
   order to do this, its border router with S-AS1 (i.e. AFBR3) replace 
   the two different received tunnel endpoint addresses (2.2.2.1 and 
   2.2.2.2) with its own (2.2.2.5) and then advertise the aggregated 
   route to S-AS1.  There are two important things to notice here.  
   First, whereas in previous examples (i.e. Figure 4), the border 
   routers between two S-ASes were not AFBRs.  Aggregating routers, 
   however, must be AFBRs because they advertise themselves as tunnel 
   endpoints.

3.4. Summary of Inter-AS softwires rules 

   1. Inter-AS softwires deployment consists of a contiguous set of two 
      or more participating ASes (S-ASes) called a softwire cloud.  All 
      ASes in the softwires cloud must deploy AFBRs at the border of 
      all E-IP capable ASes that are not part of the softwires cloud.  
      All other AS border routers must be able to process both E-IP and 
      I-IP BGP (i.e. must be support extended MP-BGP to do E-IP prefix 
      routing besides native I-IP BGP), but only need I-IP capability 
      in the data plane. 

   2. All AFBRs must attach the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute to E-IP 
      routes that enters the softwire cloud. 

   3. All AFBRs must remove the Tunnel Endpoint Attribute on E-IP 
      routes that leaves the softwire cloud. 

   4. If an AFBR selects as its best path a route with an associated 
      Tunnel Endpoint Attribute, then the AFBR must use the tunnel to 
      forward packets on that route. 

   5. Routers within an S-AS must not remove a Tunnel Endpoint 
      Attribute from an update. 

   6. When aggregating two or more routes with different Tunnel 
      Endpoint Attributes, the aggregating router must strip the 
      original Tunnel Endpoint Attributes, and add its own Tunnel 
      Endpoint Attribute to the aggregated route. 

4. Security Considerations 

   If an AFBR chooses to disregard the I-IP tunnel route when selecting 
   the E-IP route, then the AS path taken by a packet may be different 
   from the AS path used to select the route.  This, however, should 
   rarely if ever result in a security violation per se.  It would 
   require that for some reason the security policy for selecting I-IP 
   paths and E-IP paths to be different and incompatible.  An AS can 
   avoid this security issue either by having compatible security 
   policies for both E-IP and I-IP routes, or by taking into account 
   the I-IP tunnel route when selecting the E-IP route. 

   The mechanisms described in the security considerations of the  
   Softwire Mesh Framework [RFC5565] apply to the inter-domain 
   softwires described here.  The difference is, where the RFC5565 
   security considerations apply to an "administrative domain", here 
   they must apply to the entire softwires cloud (i.e. the set of ASes 
   participating in the establishment of inter-domain softwires).  In

   particular, the security mechanisms in RFC5565 require 
   administrative coordination between the ingress border router and 
   the tunnel endpoint.  In the case of RFC5565 softwires, these two 
   routers are in the same administrative domain.  In the case of 
   inter-domain softwires, they are in different domains.  That mere 
   fact that two or more domains choose to cooperate to form a 
   softwires cloud in the first place, however, suggests that there is 
   some administrative cooperation between them.  This cooperation may 
   be leveraged to provide the administrative coordination needed to 
   deploy the security techniques described in RFC5565.  

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA must issue a new Sub-Type for the Address Specific BGP Extended   
   Communities Attribute.

7. Document Changes 

7.1. Changes from draft-xu-idr-tunnel-00.txt 

   1. The document is renamed as draft-xu-tunnel-00.txt. 

   2. The need for a new sub-TLV definition in [I-D.ietf-softwire-
   encaps-safi] has been eliminated (in favor of the Address Specific 
   BGP Extended Communities Attribute). 

   3. The need to carry the AS number of the originating AS separate 
   from the AS-Path attribute has been eliminated. 

   4. The requirement that the AS-path to the tunnel endpoint address 
   and the AS-path to the destination prefix be the same was       
   dropped.  As a result, however, legacy ASes may believe that       
   packets take a different AS-path than the one they actually take. 

   5. The mechanism to avoid transient loops between providers of       
   multi-homed sites has been made optional rather than required. 

7.2. Changes from draft-xu-tunnel-00.txt 

   1. The document is renamed as draft-xu-softwire-tunnel-endpoint-
      00.txt.
