1.  Introduction

   This is an implementation report of the Internet X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   Profile [RFC5280].  It follows the outline suggested by [RFC5657].

2.  Summary

   RFC 5280 specifies a profile of the X.509 certificate and CRL formats
   [X.509].  The X.509 certificate and CRL formats are in widespread use
   and there are many different certification authority (CA) products
   that can issue X.509 certificates and CRLs and many different path
   validation implementations that can process X.509 certificates and
   CRLs.  Most CAs use the RFC 5280 profile as the basis for defining
   the profiles under which they issue certificates and CRLs.

   X.509, and thus RFC 5280, certificate and CRL validation is
   implemented in Web browsers, to support server authenticated TLS
   [RFC5246], email clients, to support S/MIME [RFC3850], IPsec clients
   [RFC4306], and in many other types of applications.  In addition to
   the many different vendors who issue TLS-server certificates,
   millions of certificates have been issued by corporations and
   government agencies to their employees to support authentication.

   Interoperability of RFC 5280 clients and servers has been
   demonstrated in practice through the successful, widespread use of
   X.509 certificates to support server authentication in HTTP over TLS.
   TLS server certificates that are in widespread use have been issued
   by many different vendors, using different CA products, and these
   certificates are validated by several different Web browsers that use
   different certification path validation libraries.

Internet-Draft       RFC 5280 Implementation Report     November 9, 2009


3.  Methodology

   In order to verify that the requirements for advancing RFC 5280 to
   Draft Standard have been satisfied, efforts were made to find
   certificates and CRLs, issued by different CAs, that included each of
   the features described in RFC 5280 and path validation libraries were
   tested to verify that they could process each of the features
   described in RFC 5280.

   For CAs, the goal was to ensure that the certificates and CRLs were
   issued in conformance with the RFC 5280 profile.  Whenever possible,
   certificates that were in actual deployment were used.  These
   certificates were found by visiting TLS protected web sites and
   downloading the certificates and CRLs needed to authenticate the web
   server and by extracting certificates from signed emails.  When no
   such certificates or CRLs could be found that included a certain
   feature, certificates or CRLs including the feature were created
   using two different CA products.

   The Public Key Interoperability Test Suite [PKITS] was used to verify
   that certification path validation libraries correctly implemented
   the features of RFC 5280.  For features of RFC 5280 that were not
   covered by PKITS, new certification paths were created and were
   tested against at least two independent implementations.

4.  Exceptions

   While interoperable implementations of almost every feature in RFC
   5280 were identified, there were a few features for which no
   implementations could be found.

   The main feature for which implementations could not be found was the
   processing rules for internationalized names in Section 7 of RFC
   5280.  These processing rules are new in RFC 5280.  The predecessors
   to RFC 5280, RFC 2459 and RFC 3280, did not require implementations
   to be able to process internationalized names, and interoperable
   implementations have been found for the more limited name processing
   rules specified in RFC 3280.  In practice, the inability of clients
   to normalize internationalized names before comparison has not
   created any interoperability problems since CAs follow the RFC 5280
   requirement to encode names in exactly the same way wherever they
   appear, allowing clients to obtain the correct results even if they
   use a simple binary comparison rule rather than normalizing the names
   before comparison.

   None of the production CAs whose certificates were obtained were
   issuing indirect CRLs, and an inquiry to the PKIX mail list only
   identified one CA implementation that is capable of issuing indirect

   CRLs.  However, two independently implemented path validation
   libraries were found that can correctly process indirect CRLs.  Since
   indirect CRLs are a feature of X.509, and RFC 5280 merely describes
   how indirect CRLs should be issued and processed, without encouraging
   their use, it is believed that the description of indirect CRLs
   should remain in the certificate and CRL profile even though multiple
   independent CA implementations of indirect CRLs were not identified.

   The user notice certificate policy qualifier allows for user notice
   text to be encoded using one of four string types: IA5String,
   VisibleString, BMPString, and UTF8String.  While RFC 2459 and RFC
   3280 provided no guidance on the selection of an encoding, RFC 5280
   requires that user notice text be encoded in either UTF8String or
   IA5String.  During the search for interoperable implementations,
   several Web server and email client certificates were located that
   included user notices, but they all encoded the user notices using
   the VisibleString type.  There is, therefore, a plan to write an
   update to RFC 5280 that permits user notices to be encoded as
   VisibleString.

5.  Details

5.1.  Certificate and CRL Issuers

   The ability of CAs to issue certificates and CRLs in conformance with
   RFC 5280 was determined primarily by examining certificates that were
   issued for use in production environments.  By connecting to Web
   sites using HTTPS [RFC2818], intermediate certificates, end entity
   certificates, and CRLs were obtained from America Online, beTRUSTed,
   Entrust, Microsoft, Starfield Technologies, and VeriSign.  From
   signed S/MIME [RFC3850] messages sent to the PKIX and S/MIME mail
   lists, certificates and CRLs were obtained from America Online,
   Ascertia, Dartmouth College, EdelWeb, Entrust, Izecom, Microsoft,
   MITRE, TC TrustCenter, Thawte, the U.S. Department of Defense, and
   VeriSign.  Finally, CA certificates and CRLs were also obtained from
   the online directory of the U.S. Federal Public Key Infrastructure. 
   While the CA product used to issue these certificates could not
   always be determined, it is known that at least five different CA
   products were used to issue these certificates: Entrust, Microsoft,
   Red Hat, RSA, and VeriSign.

   Through this method, independent implementations of most of the
   certificate and CRL extensions profiled in RFC 5280 were located. 
   Other than the exceptions mentioned in Section 4, the primary feature
   for which implementations were not located using this method was
   delta-CRLs.  However, a survey of the PKIX working group led to the
   identification of two CAs, EJCBA and OpenSSL, that are capable of
   issuing delta-CRLs.  The CA that is part of Microsoft Windows Server

Internet-Draft       RFC 5280 Implementation Report     November 9, 2009


   can also issue delta-CRLs.

   As would be expected, no production certificates or CRLs were found
   with dates encoded in GeneralizedTime, since RFC 5280 requires all
   dates between 1950 and 2049 to be encoded in UTCTime.  However,
   certificates and CRLs were generated using both Network Security
   Services (NSS) and OpenSSL with dates after 2049 that were encoded in
   GeneralizedTime.

5.2.  Certificate and CRL Processing

   The Public Key Interoperability Test Suite [PKITS] was designed to
   provide test coverage for most of the features described in RFC 3280,
   the predecessor to RFC 5280.  Thus, PKITS covers most of the features
   of RFC 5280, with the exception of Section 7, Processing Rules for
   Internationalized Names.  PKITS contains over 200 test, prospective
   certification paths designed to verify that certification path
   validation libraries can correctly process the different fields that
   may appear in a certificate or CRL.  PKITS includes several tests
   designed to verify that path validation libraries can correctly
   process the basic fields in certificates and CRLs, such as the issuer
   and subject fields and the validity dates, but most of the tests deal
   with the certificate and CRL extensions that are profiled in RFC 5280
   that must be processed as part of certification path validation.

   In 2005 and 2006, the Path Discovery and Validation Working Group
   (http://www.idmanagement.gov/fpkia/drilldown.cfm?action=pdval_wg)
   tested nine certification path validation products from five
   different vendors using PKITS in accordance with the testing
   procedures specified in the Draft NIST Recommendation for X.509 Path
   Validation [NISTREQ].  The products tested were (1) TrustEnabler from
   Gemini Security Solutions, (2) Webcullis from Orion Security
   Solutions, (3) PathBuilder 1.0 from CoreStreet, (4) Desktop Validator
   5.0 and Validation Authority 5.0 from Tumbleweed Communications, and
   (5) TruePass 8.0 SP1, Java Toolkit 7.1 SP1, GetAccess 7.1 SP2, and
   Verification Server 7.1 from Entrust.  Detailed results from the
   testing of all of these products can be found on the Path Discovery
   and Validation Working Group's Qualified Validation List [QVL].

   For features that were not covered by PKITS or that were not tested
   as part of the process of qualifying for inclusion on the [QVL], new
   certification paths were created and two independent implementations
   of each of the features were located.  For most of these tests,
   Network Security Services (NSS), via either Mozilla Thunderbird or
   Mozilla Firefox, and OpenSSL were used.  However, for a few tests
   either Safari or the Certificate Management Library was used as the
   second implementation of the feature.  Features that were not covered
   by PKITS for which new certification paths were created included

   version 1 and 2 certificates, certificates with names encoded in
   BMPString and UniversalString, certificates with extended key usage
   extensions, certificates with critical certificatePolicies
   extensions, certificates that imposed name constraints on IP
   addresses, certificates with nameConstraints extensions for which the
   minimum and maximum fields were present, certification paths in which
   name constraints were imposed on uniform resource identifiers and end
   entity certificates included URIs that either did not have an
   authority component or had an authority component with an IP address,
   certificates with critical policyConstraints extensions in which only
   the inhibitPolicyMapping field was present, and CRLs with thisUpdate
   and nextUpdate encoded as GeneralizedTime.
