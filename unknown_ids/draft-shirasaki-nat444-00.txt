Abstract

   This document describes one of the network models that are designed
   for smooth transition to IPv6.  It is called NAT444 model.  NAT444
   model is composed of IPv6, and IPv4 with Large Scale NAT (LSN).

   NAT444 is the only scheme not to require replacing Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE) even if IPv4 address exhausted.  But it must be noted
   that NAT444 has serious restrictions i.e. it limits the number of
   sessions per CPE so that rich applications such as AJAX and RSS feed
   cannot work well.

   Therefore, IPv6 which is free from such a difficulty has to be
   introduced into the network at the same time.  In other words, NAT444
   is just a tool to make IPv6 transition easy to be swallowed.  It is
   designed for the days IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence.

1.  Introduction

   The only permanent solution of the IPv4 address exhaustion is to
   deploy IPv6.  Now, just before the exhaustion, it's time to make a
   transition to IPv6.

   After the exhaustion, unless ISP takes any action, end users will not
   be able to get IPv4 address.

   The servers that have only IPv4 address will continue to exist on the
   Internet after the IPv4 address exhaustion.  In this situation, IPv6
   only hosts cannot reach IPv4 only hosts.

   This document explains NAT444 model that bridges the gap between the
   coming IPv6 Internet and the present IPv4 Internet.


2.  Definition of NAT444 Model

   NAT444 Model is a network model that uses two Network Address and
   Port Translators (NAPTs) with three types of IPv4 address blocks.

   The first NAPT is in CPE, and the second NAPT is in Large Scale NAT
   (LSN) [I-D.nishitani-cgn].  LSN is supposed to be installed in the
   ISP's network.

   The first IPv4 address block is Private Address [RFC1918] inside CPE.
   The second one is an IPv4 Address block between CPEs and LSN.  The
   third one is IPv4 Global Addresses that is outside LSN.  The ISPs
   using NAT444 provide IPv6 connectivity by dual stack model.

3.  Behavior of NAT444 Model

   The IPv6 packets from the host reach the IPv6 Internet without using
   NAT functionality.

   The following figure shows the behavior of the IPv4 packet from the
   host to the IPv4 server via two NATs.  The first NAT in CPE
   overwrites the Source IP Address and Source Port from 10.0.0.2:tt to
   w.w.w.w:uu.  Then the second NAT in LSN overwrites them from
   w.w.w.w:uu to y.y.y.y:vv.  Destination IP Address and Port are not
   overwritten.

                +-------------+
   (Port=80)    | IPv4 Server |  ^
      x.x.x.x-> +------+------+  :
                       |         :
   IPv4 Global Address |         :
                       |         :
              (The IPv4 Internet):(Dst=x.x.x.x:80/Src=y.y.y.y:vv)
                       |         :
   IPv4 Global Address |         :
                       |         :
       y.y.y.y->  +----+----+    :
        (Port=vv) |   LSN   |    ^
       z.z.z.z->  +----+----+    :
                       |         :
          IPv4 Address |         :(Dst=x.x.x.x:80/Src=w.w.w.w:uu)
                       |         :
     w.w.w.w-> +-------+-------+ :
     (Port=uu) | IPv4 NAT CPE  | ^
    10.0.0.1-> +-------+-------+ :
                       |         :
   IPv4 Private Address|         :
                       |         :
      10.0.0.2->  +----+----+    :(Dst=x.x.x.x:80/Src=10.0.0.2:tt)
        (Port=tt) |IPv4 Host|
                  +---------+

   The following figure explains the behavior of returning IPv4 packet
   via two NATs.  The first NAT in LSN overwrites the Destination IP
   Address and Port Number from y.y.y.y:vv to w.w.w.w:uu.  Then the
   second NAT in CPE overwrites them from w.w.w.w:u to 10.0.0.2:tt.

4.  Pros and Cons of NAT444 Model

4.1.  Pros of NAT444 Model

   This network model has following advantages.

   - This is the only network model that doesn't require replacing CPEs
   those are owned by customers.
   - This network model is composed of the present technology.
   - This network model doesn't require address family translation.
   - This network model doesn't require DNS rewriting.
   - This network model doesn't require additional fragment for the
   packets because it doesn't use tunneling technology.

4.2.  Cons of NAT444 Model

   This network model has some technical restrictions.

   - Some application such as SIP requires special treatment, because IP
   address is written in the payload of the packet.  Special treatment
   means application itself aware double NAPT or both of two NAPTs

   support inspecting and rewriting the packets.
   - Because both IPv4 route and IPv6 route exist, it doubles the number
   of IGP route inside the LSN.
   - UPnP doesn't work with double NAPTs.

   community members, AP address community members and JPNIC members.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.


7.  Security Considerations

   Each customer inside a LSN looks using the same Global Address from
   outside an ISP.  In case of incidents, the ISP must have the function
   to trace back the record of each customer's access without using only
   IP address.

   If a Global Address of the LSN is listed on the blacklist, other
   customers who share the same address could be affected.

Appendix A.  Example IPv6 Transition Scenario

   The steps of IPv6 transition are as follows.

   Step 1: Enabling softwire client in host

   ISP provides IPv6 connectivity to customers with softwire [RFC4925].
   ISP installs LSN and softwire concentrator in its network.  A
   softwire client in host connects to the IPv6 internet via ISP's
   concentrator.  ISP can use existing IPv4 equipments.  Customers can
   just use existing CPE.
