      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref

    <section title="Overview">

      <t>The Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing protocol <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-manet-dymo" /> is intended for use by mobile
      nodes in wireless, multihop networks.  DYMO determines unicast
      routes among DYMO routers within the network in an on-demand
      fashion, offering improved convergence in dynamic
      topologies.</t>

      <t>A DYMO router's MIB contains DYMO process configuration
      parameters (e.g. interfaces), state information (e.g.  sequence
      number), performance counters (e.g. number of control messages),
      and notifications.</t>


      <section title="DYMO Management Model">
        <t>This section describes the management model for the DYMO
           routing protocol.</t>

        <t>The MIB is comprised of four Groups, i.e., Notifications,
           Configuration, State and Statistics.  The configuration
           of the managed devices is controlled by the objects in the Configuration
           Group.  These are divided into Nodal and Interface objects.
           The bulk of the DYMO configuration is in the Nodal objects
           which control protocol behavior.  The Interface objects
           merely identify/configure interfaces to enable DYMO
           routing over their interface.  The Nodal objects are
           further divided into routing (or protocol) objects and
           Gateway objects.  Gateway objects define other routing prefixes
           for which the node acts as a routing proxy on behalf of these
           non-local prefixes.</t>

        <t>The Configuration Objects drive the behavior of the managed DYMO
           device and hence determines the information in the remaining
           groups, i.e., State, Statistics and Notifications.  The State objects
           primarily present the resulting routing table objects.  The Statistics
           group primarily is comprised of counters for monitoring the
           number of DYMO routing messages received locally, per node and per
           interface.  The Notifications
           group only contains objects which monitor changes to the
           interface configuration and the gateway prefixes configuration.</t>
 
         <t>See the below diagram outlining the DYMO-MIB device management model.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>[TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
      contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
      those modules. This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
      template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).
      Remember that the objective is not to blindly copy text from the
      template, but rather to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and
      then state/document the result of this evaluation.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
      include the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

          if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
      following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
          are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
          be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
          information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
          European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
          sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
      information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs
      should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
      certainly require justification during IESG review.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
      http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
      submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
      Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
      what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
      information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module document.</t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
      MUST use place-holders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
      See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
      MIB module.</t>

      <t>Option #3:</t>

      <!-- If no IANA work is required, an explicit note must be included.-->

      <t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
