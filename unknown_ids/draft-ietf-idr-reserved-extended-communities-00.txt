                   Reserved BGP extended communities
            draft-ietf-idr-reserved-extended-communities-00

Abstract

   This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one
   transitive and one non-transitive.  It also defines two IANA
   registries in order to allow the allocation of reserved transitive
   and non-transitive extended communities.  These are similar to the
   existing reserved (formerly Well-known) BGP communities defined in
   RFC 1997 but provides an easier control of inter-AS community
   advertisement as a community could be chosen as transitive or non-
   transitive across ASes.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC1997] defines the BGP community attribute and some BGP Well known
   communities whose meaning SHALL be understood by all compliant
   implementations.  New reserved communities can be registered in the
   IANA "BGP Well-known Communities" registry but it can't be assumed
   anymore that they will be known by all BGP implementations.
   Implementations or BGP policies which recognize them will behave as
   specified.  Implementation which do not recognize those new reserved
   communities will propagate them from BGP neighbor to BGP neighbor and
   from AS to AS with an unlimited scope.

   There is currently no agreed way to reserve a non transitive well
   known community:

   o  [RFC1997] defines BGP Well-known communities with no structure to
      set their transitiveness across ASes.  Without structure, non
      transitive communities can only be filtered by explicitly
      enumerating all community values that will be denied or allowed to
      BGP speakers in neighboring ASes.  This is not satisfactory as
      this would require upgrading all border routers to understand this
      community before its first usage.

   o  [RFC4360] defines the BGP extended community attribute with a
      structure including a type and a transitive bit "T".  The
      transitive bit, when set, allows to restrict the scope of the
      community within an AS.  But their is no IANA registry to allocate
      a (single) well known extended community.  RFC 4360 [RFC4360]
      defines IANA registries to allocate BGP Extended Communities
      types.  Each type is able to encode 2^48 or 2^56 values depending
      on the type being extended or regular.  Therefore, one needing to
      reserve a single non-transitive extended community would need to
      reserve an extended subtype which represents 2^48 communities,
      while a single value is used.  This would both waste the resources
      and disable the ability to define global policies on reserved
      communities, such as to filter them out.

Internet-Draft        Reserved extended communities        February 2011


   To address this limitation, this document assigns two BGP extended
   community types, one transitive and one non-transitive.  It also
   defines two IANA registries in order to allow the allocation of
   reserved transitive and non-transitive extended communities.  These
   are similar to the existing Well-known BGP communities defined in RFC
   1997 but provides a control on inter-AS community advertisement as a
   community could be chosen as transitive or non-transitive across
   ASes.


2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign, from the registry "BGP Extended
   Communities Type - extended, transitive type", a type value TBD for
   "BGP Reserved transitive extended communities":

    Registry Name: BGP Extended Communities Type - extended, transitive

       Name                                           Type Value
       ----                                           ----------
       BGP Reserved transitive extended communities   TBD (e.g. 0x9000)



   IANA is requested to assign, from the registry "BGP Extended
   Communities Type - extended, non-transitive", a type value TBD for
   "BGP Reserved non-transitive extended communities":

 Registry Name: BGP Extended Communities Type - extended, non-transitive

    Name                                               Type Value
    ----                                               ----------
    BGP Reserved non-transitive extended communities   TBD (e.g. 0xd000)


   Note to the IANA: suggested value for the two reserved BGP Extended
   Communities extended type are 0x9000 and 0xd000.  Otherwise, both
   values should be identical, except for their T - Transitive bit (bit
   1 as defined in [RFC4360]).



   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled "BGP
   Reserved transitive extended communities":

Internet-Draft        Reserved extended communities        February 2011


 Registry Name: BGP Reserved transitive extended communities

    Range                         Registration Procedures
    ---------------------------   -------------------------
    0x000000000000-FFFFFFFEFFFF   Reserved
    0xFFFFFFFF0000-00FFFFFF8000   First Come First Served
    0x00FFFFFF8001-FFFFFFFFFFFF   Standards Action/Early IANA Allocation



   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled "BGP
   Reserved non-transitive extended communities":


 Registry Name: BGP Reserved non-transitive extended communities

    Range                         Registration Procedures
    ---------------------------   -------------------------
    0x000000000000-FFFFFFFEFFFF   Reserved
    0xFFFFFFFF0000-00FFFFFF8000   First Come First Served
    0x00FFFFFF8001-FFFFFFFFFFFF   Standards Action/Early IANA Allocation


   An application may need both a transitive and non-transitive reserved
   community.  It may be beneficial to have the same value for both
   communities.  (Note that both extended community will still be
   different as they will differ from their T bit).  The IANA SHOULD try
   to accommodate such request to have both a transitive and non-
   transitive reserved community with the same value for both.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document defines IANA actions.  In itself, it has no impact on
   the security of the BGP protocol.
