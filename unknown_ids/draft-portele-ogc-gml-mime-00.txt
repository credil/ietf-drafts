Abstract
   This document standardizes a new media type -- application/gml+xml
   -- for use in exchanging geographical models represented in a compliant
   Geography Markup Language.

1. Introduction
   GML (Geography Markup Language) is an international standard
   adopted by both the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
   International Organization for Standardization (ISO). GML is

   An XML grammar for modeling geographic information. The GML
   format is an actual media format.

   The OGC is an international voluntary consensus standards
   organization focused on defining and maintaining standards that
   enable interoperability for using geospatial content and services
   in any application that requires the use of geospatial content or
   services. The OGC website is www.opengeospatial.org.

2. Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms "element" and "document element" in this document are to be
   interpreted as in [XML].

   The term "XML namespace" is to be interpreted as in [NAMESPACES].

3. Media Registration for GML

   MIME media type name: Application
  
   MIME subtype name: Standards Tree -gml+xml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters:
      The charset parameter of application/gml+xml is handled in the
      same fashion as for application/xml, as specified in 
      Section 3.2 of [RFC3023

   Encoding considerations:
      As per Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Published specification:
      The latest version at the time of this writing is 3.2.1 which
      is published by ISO as ISO 19136:2007. The standard can be
      accessed online at http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml.
 
   The OGC GML MIME specification has also been approved by the 
   OGC Membership and is published here:
   http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=37743

   Additional information:

      1. Magic number(s): None.
      2. File extension(s): .xml or .gml
      3. Macintosh file type code: TEXT
      4. Object Identifiers: None

   Intended usage: Common

   Author/Change controlled:
      The GML standard is a work product of the Open Geospatial
      Consortium (OGC). The OGC and the GML Standards Working
      Group have change control over the standard.

      MIME types for use in OGC standards and formats are defined
      by the OGC Members and discussed and approved by the OGC
      Naming Authority (OGC-NA). The function and role of the OGC-NA
      is described in RFC and in the OGC Policies and Procedures
      here: 


4. Interoperability and usage

4.1 Interoperability considerations:

      Different versions of GML specify different XML Schema documents used
      for the validation of GML documents. Starting with version 3.2 the
      GML version information is represented in the namespace. As
      applications may only support a subset of all published GML
      versions, the use of the version parameter is recommended.
 
4.2 Applications which use this media:

   GML is a generic device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral XML
   grammar and is supported by a range of applications creating,
   providing access to and processing geographic information. The use
   of GML is in use internationally with hundreds of deployed
   applications able to create and ingest GML payloads, including all
   of the major GIS vendors, many database providers, earth browzer
   applications, and so forth.
 
5.0 Security considerations:

   The OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) is a generic format for
   exchanging geographic information, but application designers must
   not assume that it provides generic protection against security
   threats.  RFC 3023, section 10, discusses security concerns for
   generic XML, which are applicable to GML.

   Xlink references in GML documents may cause arbitrary URIs to be
   dereferenced. In this case, the security issues of RFC 3986,
   section 7, should be considered.

 
   The OGC is an international voluntary consensus standards
   organization focused on defining and maintaining standards that
   enable interoperability for using geospatial content and services
   in any application that requires the use of geospatial content or
   services. The OGC website is www.opengeospatial.org.

6. IANA Considerarations

   This document specifies a new media type.  If approved, IANA will
   add this media type to their media types registry as specified in [RFC4288].
