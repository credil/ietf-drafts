Abstract

   This document registers a Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) service for
   Internet Calendaring Services.  Specifically, this document focuses
   on provisioning 'mailto:' (iMIP) and 'http:' (CalDAV) URIs in ENUM.

1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that uses DNS
   (Domain Name Service, RFC 1034 [2]) to translate telephone numbers,
   such as '+12025550100', into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers, RFC
   3986 [3]), such as 'mailto:user@example.com'.  ENUM exists primarily
   to facilitate the interconnection of systems that rely on telephone
   numbers with those that use URIs to identify resources.

   The Guide to Internet Calendaring [10] describes the relationship
   between various internet calendaring specifications like this:
   "iCalendar [4] is the language used to describe calendar objects.
   iTIP [5] [Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol] describes
   a way to use the iCalendar language to do scheduling. iMIP [6]
   [Message-Based Interoperability Protocol] describes how to do iTIP
   scheduling via e-mail."

   Recently another standard track protocol for calendar and scheduling
   access has appeared.  CalDAV [7] (Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV)
   is a WebDAV [8] (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
   based mechanism for manipulating internet calendars, viewing free/
   busy lists, and proposing calendar events.

   The existing 'mailto:' URI scheme (defined in RFC 3986 [3]) is
   already used to address iMIP compatible Calendar Services.  Likewise
   the existing 'http:' and 'https:' URI schemes (defined in RFC 2616
   [11] and RFC 2818 [12]) are already used to address CalDAV compatible
   Calendar Services.

   This document registers an enumservice for advertising internet
   calendaring information associated with an E.164 number, using the
   'mailto:', 'http:', or 'https:' schemes.


2.  ENUM Service Registration - ical

   As defined in RFC 3761 [1], the following is a template covering
   information needed for the registration of the enumservice specified
   in this document:
   Enumservice Name:
      "ical"
   Enumservice Type:
      "ical"
   Enumservice Subtypes:

      N/A
   URI scheme(s):
      "mailto:", "http:", "https:"
   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a URI
      used for Internet Calendaring.  Supported URI schemes are the
      'mailto:' URI for the iMIP [6] protocol, and 'http:' or 'https:'
      URIs for the CalDAV [7] protocol.
   Security considerations:
      See section 3.
   Intended usage:
      COMMON

3.  Example of Usage

   Below is a set of sample resource records for this enumservice.

   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.2.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
   @ NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+ical"
     "!^.*$!http://cal.example.com/home/alice/calendars/!" .

   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.2.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
   @ NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+ical"
     "!^.*$!mailto:alice@example.com!" .


4.  Security Considerations

   The Domain Name System (DNS) does not make policy decisions about
   which records it provides to a DNS resolver.  All DNS records must be
   assumed to be available to all inquirers at all times.  The
   information provided within an ENUM record set must therefore be
   considered open to the public -- which is a cause for some privacy
   considerations.

   Revealing a calendaring URI by itself is unlikely to introduce many
   privacy concerns, although, depending on the structure of the URI, it
   might reveal the full name or employer of the target.  The use of
   anonymous URIs mitigates this risk.

   As ENUM uses DNS, which in its current form is an insecure protocol,
   there is no mechanism for ensuring that the answer returned to a
   query is authentic.  An analysis of threats specific to the
   dependence of ENUM on the DNS is provided in RFC 3761 and a thorough
   analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in RFC 3833 [14].

   Many of these problems are prevented when the resolver verifies the
   authenticity of answers to its ENUM queries via DNSSEC [9] in zones
   where it is available.

   More serious security concerns are associated with potential attacks
   against an underlying calendaring system (for example, unauthorized
   modification or viewing).  For this reason, iTIP discusses a number
   of security requirements (detailed in RFC 2446 [5]) that call for
   authentication, integrity and confidentiality properties, and similar
   measures to prevent such attacks.  Any calendaring protocol used in
   conjunction with a URI scheme currently meets these requirements.
   The use of CalDAV with the 'https:' scheme makes use of TLS [13]
   (Transport Layer Security) to provide server authentication,
   confidentiality, and message integrity.

   Unlike a traditional telephone number, the resource identified by an
   calendaring URI is often already guessable and often requires that
   users provide cryptographic credentials for authentication and
   authorization before calendar data can be exchanged.  Despite the
   public availability of ENUM records, the use of this information to
   reveal an unprotected calendaring resource is unlikely in practice.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the "iCal" Enumservice
   according to the definitions in Section 2 of this document and RFC
   3761 [1].
