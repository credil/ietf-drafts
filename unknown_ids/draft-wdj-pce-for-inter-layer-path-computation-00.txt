1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.

   A network may comprise multiple layers.  In [PCE-INTER-LAYER-FRWK],
   there are three inter-layer path computation models defined to
   perform PCE-based inter-layer path computation, namely Single PCE
   Computation, Multiple PCE Computation with inter-PCE communication,
   and Multiple PCE Computation without inter-PCE communication.  Mainly
   by scalability, automation and confidentiality considerations,
   multiple PCE computation instead of single PCE computation is more
   concerned.  In this mode, a PCE has the topology visibility of one or
   more layers (but not all layers, in this document, one layer is only
   considered.).

   This document mainly describes the extensions of multiple PCE inter-
   layer path computation with inter-PCE communication.

   Computation Element (PCE) Discovery [RFC5088], and Multi-Layer
   Networks [RFC5212].


2.  Scenario Statement and Requirements Overview

2.1.  Scenario Statement

   In the model of multiple PCE inter-layer path computation, there is
   at least one PCE per layer.  Each PCE has topology visibility
   restricted to its own layer.  When an ingress LSR tries to set up an
   end-to-end LSP to an egress LSR is set up in the higher-layer
   network, as a PCC it will select a PCE located in its layer and send
   a path computation request to the PCE.  The PCE is confronted with
   such problems.

   o  As absence of TE link in the higher-layer network, no-connected
      graph may occur and the topology is divided into at least two
      independent sub-areas.

   o  The border LSRs of each sub-area will be produced and a lower-
      layer network exists between the pairs of border LSRs belonging to
      two different sub-areas.

   o  The border LSRs may originate TE links connected to the lower-
      layer network.

   o  The ingress LSR and the egress LSR may be located in different
      sub-areas.

   o  There can be at least one PCE in each layer.  Accepting the
      ingress LSR's request, the higher-layer PCE may designate a pair
      of border LSRs and select a lower-layer PCE according to the
      information advertised by it to compute a lower-layer path.

   o  In order to allow for effective PCE selection by PCCs,
      furthermore, a PCC needs to know the layer that the PCE is located
      in and the neighbor layer toward which the PCE can compute paths.
      Here, the neighbor layer is usually lower than its own layer
      according to separations of technologies.

2.2.  Requirements Overview

   The multiple PCE inter-layer path computation mechanism MUST satisfy
   the following requirements.

   For the higher-layer PCE, it MUST identify connectivity of its own
   layer topology by some algorithm.  When the topology is no-connected,
   if the head-end node and the tail-end node lie in two independent
   sub-areas respectively, inter-layer path solution will have to be
   considered.

   As there is no direct TE link between sub-areas in non-connected
   topology, the higher-layer PCE should designate border LSRs.
   Generally in one sub-area, obtainment of border LSR lies in whether
   the LSR has a TE link connected to the lower layer network.  If so,
   this LSR will be considered as a border LSR of the sub-area.  An
   independent sub-area should usually have at least one border LSR.

   In each layer, PCE discovery information should include the layer
   into which the PCE has visibility.

   In each layer, PCE discovery information should include the neighbor
   layer to which the PCE can send path computation request.  In this

   case, the local layer is usually higher, and the neighbor layer is
   lower.  Since a NE receives discovery information of PCEs in the
   local layer, as a PCC, it should know about which PCEs are in the
   same layer and which neighbor layer the PCEs can communicate with.
   When a path computation request is originated from this NE, firstly
   it should estimate the neighbor layer that the path passes through if
   possible.

   A PCE discovery mechanism MUST allow that PCEs in different layers
   know about their discovery information each other, especially their
   local layer and neighbor layer information by flooding mechanism of
   some routing protocol.  This routing protocol instance MUST only run
   in the topology that is composed of the PCEs in different layers.
   According to PCE discovery information, as a PCC, the PCE in a higher
   layer can select a suitable PCE in a lower adjacent layer to compute
   an inter-layer path.  Considering that the discovery scope can be
   controlled, the mechanism MUST permit some PCEs in one layer keeping
   invisible to PCEs in other layers, that is, PCEs' topology scope in
   one layer is partially opened to other layers.

4.  Inter-Layer Optimal Path Computation Procedure

4.1.  Confirmation of The Topology Connectivity

   The PCE in the local layer will compute the optimal path from the
   ingress LSR to the egress LSR according to the information included
   by the PCReq message belonging to PCEP.

   Generally, only when the network topology of the whole layer is
   divided into two or more partitions resulting from lack of TE links,
   and the ingress LSR and the egress LSR are respectively located in
   the different partitions, inter-layer path computation will be
   considered by the PCE.

4.2.  Inter-layer TE Links

   Whether it is higher-layer or lower-layer PCE needs to get the TE
   attribute of inter-layer TE links during the process of inter-layer
   TE LSP computation.

   Between the local port belonging to one inter-layer border LSR in the
   side of higher-layer and the remote port belonging to the other one
   in the side of lower-layer, one-way inter-layer TE links usually
   appear in pairs.  Among them, one is form the local port to the
   remote port, and the other is in the opposite direction.  In other
   words, both of them consist of a bidirectional TE link.  The former
   is originated from an inter-layer border LSR in the higher-layer, and
   it belongs to the scope of higher-layer topology into which only the
   higher-layer PCEs have visibility.  Similarly the latter is
   originated from an inter-layer border LSR in the lower-layer, and it
   belongs to the scope of lower-layer topology into which only the
   lower-layer PCEs have visibility.

   By an inter-layer TE link, an adaptation is completed from one type
   of switch capability to another one(e.g., electrical switching to
   optical switching, etc.).

4.3.  Confirmation of Inter-Layer Border LSR

   Inter-layer border LSRs are respectively located on the boundary of
   the high-layer and lower-layer networks.  Each of them has at least
   one unidirectional TE link connected to the other inter-layer border
   LSR in the adjacent layer.

   Before a higher-layer PCE begins to compute an inter-layer path, it
   SHOULD collect the information about all of inter-layer border LSRs
   in its local layer.  And it MAY combine the inter-layer border LSRs
   belonging to the partition in which the ingress LSR is located with

   the inter-layer border LSRs belonging to the partition in which the
   egress LSR is located into many pairs of inter-layer border LSRs.  By
   this combination, many pairs of inter-layer border LSRs are formed
   and as end LSRs provided for the lower-layer PCE to compute end-to-
   end paths across the lower-layer network.  That is, a PCReq message
   which is sent to lower-layer PCE and is used to do inter-layer path
   computation will include many pairs of ingress and egress LSRs.

4.4.  Discovery of Inter-layer PCEs

   From PCEP's point of view, inter-layer PCE communication is also a
   kind of communication between PCC and PCE.  The requesting entity
   will be looked as a PCC, and the requested entity will be looked as a
   PCE.

   So PCE discovery mechanism permits PCEs belonging to different layers



Wang, et al.             Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     PCEP Ext for Inter-Layer Path Comp       October 2009


   get discovery information each other, especially the information
   about local layer, adjacent layer, and PCE's computing capability
   etc.  Some of PCEs in different layers and with inter-layer computing
   capability can be chosen and consist of a PCE topology.  Then in this
   PCE topology the PCEs' discovery information can be gotten by
   starting an instance of some routing protocol with flooding
   mechanism.  Only in this PCE topology can this routing protocol
   instance run.  Its flooding contents are limited to the discovery
   information of those PCEs that are added to the PCE topology and can
   not be beyond the scope of the PCE topology.  According to the PCEs'
   discovery information, as a PCC, a higher-layer PCE may choose a
   suitable one from many adjacent lower-layer PCEs with inter-layer
   path computing capability in the PCE topology to compute an inter-
   layer path.

4.5.  Communication of Inter-layer PCEs

   If the higher-layer PCE decides to start inter-layer path
   computation, it will confirm as many pairs of end inter-layer LSRs as
   possible firstly.  Then as a PCC, the higher-layer PCE will choose a
   suitable lower layer PCE according to the discovery information
   flooded by the lower layer PCEs and send a request to it for
   computing paths of the pairs of end inter-layer LSRs.

   Since a inter-layer TE link includes the information about inter-
   layer LSRs on the both ends of it, when the lower-layer PCE receives
   the PCReq message, it can find the correspondent inter-layer TE links
   in its local-layer topology according to the message which includes
   many pairs of end inter-layer LSRs in the side of the higher-layer.
   By each inter-layer TE link, pairs of end inter-layer LSRs in the
   side of the lower-layer can be found.

   Thus the lower-layer PCE can compute at least one inter-layer path by
   the above information and respond the computation result to the
   higher-layer PCE.

4.6.  Optimal Inter-layer Path Computation by BRPC

   In [PCE-INTER-LAYER-FRWK], BRPC is recommended to solve the problem
   of multiple PCE inter-layer path computation by considering layers as
   separate domains.  BRPC is always started by the higher-layer PCE
   according to the response of lower-layer PCE about lower-layer path
   computation results.  In addition, if multiple paths about a common
   pair of end LSRs are needed, all the complete paths will be ordered
   in some optimal strategy(e.g., minimum hops number, minimum aggregate
   te-metrics, etc.).

5.  Routing Protocol Extensions for Inter-Layer PCE Discovery

   In a multi-layer network model, multiple PCEs MAY have the function
   of inter-layer path computation.  It may be necessary or desirable
   for a higher-layer PCE to choose a lower-layer PCE by the PCE
   discovery information originated from the lower-layer PCE.

   Since the number of local-layer PCEs may be usually more than one,
   the PCEs' discovery information to which now is added local-layer and
   adjacent layer information needs to be flooded through all the layers
   unless safety is considered.  By this way, as a PCC, when a higher-
   layer PCE needs to send a path computation request to a lower-layer
   PCE, it can dynamically choose a suitable one but not be allocated a
   fixed one according to the flooded layers' information from all the
   PCEs in the lower-layer.  That is, all the PCEs belonging to all
   different layers will form a PCE topology and MAY participate in an
   independent IGP (OSPF or IS-IS) instance.  This PCE topology's
   visibility MUST be opened only for these PCEs.

   In [RFC5088] and [RFC5089], PCE discovery information is referred to.
   It is usually composed of the PCE location, the PCE path computation
   scope, the set of PCE-Domain(s), the set of neighbor PCE-Domain(s),
   and the set of communication capabilities etc.  Here according to the
   above description, for the purpose of layer information automatic
   discovery and dynamically choosing among PCEs from different layers,
   the set of PCE-Layer(s) and the set of neighbor PCE Layer(s) SHOULD
   be added to the PCE discovery information.

   Considering the two new types of PCE discovery information, the sub-
   TLVs that may be carried within the PCED TLV will be extended.  The
   following sections describe the new extended sub-TLVs.

5.1.  Extension of PATH-SCOPE Sub-TLV

   In view of layer information discovery, here PATH-SCOPE Sub-TLV in
   [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] is extended.  Yd bit is added to PATH-SCOPE
   Sub-TLV and the new sub-TLV has the following format:

    The following bits are defined:

       Bit      Path Scope

        0      L bit:  Can compute intra-area paths.
        1      R bit:  Can act as PCE for inter-area TE LSP
                       computation.
        2      Rd bit: Can act as a default PCE for inter-area TE LSP
                       computation.
        3      S bit:  Can act as PCE for inter-AS TE LSP computation.
        4      Sd bit: Can act as a default PCE for inter-AS TE LSP
                       computation.
        5      Y bit:  Can act as PCE for inter-layer TE LSP
                       computation.
        6      Yd bit: Can act as a default PCE for inter-layer TE LSP
                       computation.

       PrefL field: PCE's preference for intra-area TE LSP computation.

       PrefR field: PCE's preference for inter-area TE LSP computation.

       PrefS field: PCE's preference for inter-AS TE LSP computation.

       PrefY field: PCE's preference for inter-layer TE LSP computation.

       Res: Reserved for future use.

    The L, R, S, and Y bits are set when the PCE can act as a PCE for
    intra-area, inter-area, inter-AS, or inter-layer TE LSP computation,
    respectively.  These bits are non-exclusive.

   Similarly, when set, the Yd bit indicates that the PCE can act as a
   default PCE for inter-layer TE LSP computation (that is, the PCE can
   compute a path toward an adjacent layer).  When the Yd bit is set,

   the PCED TLV MUST NOT contain a NEIG-PCE-LAYER sub-TLV.

   When the Y bit is clear, the Yd bit SHOULD be clear on transmission
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.

5.2.  PCE-LAYER Sub-TLV

   The PCE-LAYER sub-TLV specifies a PCE-LAYER into which the PCE has
   topology visibility and through which the PCE can compute paths.  The
   PCE-LAYER sub-TLV SHOULD be present when PCE-Layers for which the PCE
   can operate cannot be inferred by other IGP information: for
   instance, when the PCE is inter-layer capable (i.e., when the Y bit
   is set) and the flooding scope is the entire visible layer topology
   and the entire PCE topology that is composed of all the PCEs from all
   of layers.  A PCED TLV may include multiple PCE-LAYER sub-TLVs when
   the PCE has visibility into multiple PCE-Layers.

   The PCE-LAYER sub-TLV has the following format:


                         1                   2                   3

                         PCE-LAYER sub-TLV format

       Type:     6
       Length:   8
       Current five layer-type values are defined:
                     1  PSC layer
                     2  L2SC layer
                     3  TDM layer
                     4  LSC layer
                     5  FSC layer

       Layer ID: This indicates the 32-bit Layer ID of a layer where the
       PCE has visibility and can compute paths.

5.3.  NEIG-PCE-LAYER Sub-TLV

   The NEIG-PCE-LAYER sub-TLV specifies a neighbor PCE-Layer toward
   which a PCE can compute paths.  It means that the PCE can take part
   in the computation of inter-layer TE LSPs with paths that transit
   this neighbor PCE-Layer.

   For each PCE-LAYER sub-TLV, this neighbor layer usually refers to the
   lower adjacent layer.

   The NEIG-PCE-LAYER sub-TLV has the following format:


                          1                   2                   3

     |                           Layer ID                            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                          NEIG-PCE-LAYER sub-TLV format

        Type:     7
        Length:   8
        Current five layer-type values are defined:
                      1  PSC layer
                      2  L2SC layer
                      3  TDM layer
                      4  LSC layer
                      5  FSC layer

        Layer ID: This indicates the 32-bit Layer ID of a neighbor layer
        toward which the PCE can compute paths.

   The NEIG-PCE-LAYER sub-TLV MUST be present at least once if the Y bit
   is set and the Yd bit is cleared.

7.  Security Considerations

   The inter-layer path computation procedure relies on the use of the
   PCEP and as such is subjected to the potential attacks listed in



Wang, et al.             Expires April 22, 2010                [Page 12]

   Section 10 of [RFC5440].  In addition to the security mechanisms
   described in [RFC5440] with regards to spoofing, snooping,
   falsification, and denial of service, an implementation MAY support a
   policy module governing the conditions under which a PCE should
   participate in the inter-layer path computation.

   In addition, each layer topology's confidentiality should be
   especially considered.

   For the purpose of network topology safety and confidentiality, the
   following points should be paid attention to:

   o  For each PCE in the PCE topology, the flooding scope of its
      discovery information is limited only to the local-layer topology
      and the PCE topology.

   o  For the PCEs outside the PCE topology, the flooding scope of its
      discovery information is limited only to the local-layer topology.

   o  For the PCEs of each layer, not all the PCEs can be added to the
      PCE topology.  Only those which have the capability of inter-layer
      path computation are qualified for being added to the PCE
      topology.

   o  For confidentiality consideration, users can add the PCEs to the
      PCE topology or move them out of it dynamically.  But if inter-
      layer path computation need to be desired, in each layer at least
      a PCE with the capability of inter-layer path computation should
      be add to the PCE topology.  As a result, some of the PCEs in each
      layer are invisible to the PCEs in other layers, that is, the
      PCEs' visibility in one layer is partially opened to other layers.
