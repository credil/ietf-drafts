      <t>Routing and Addressing in Next-Generation EnteRprises (RANGER)
      [I-D.templin-RANGER] provides an architectural framework for scalable
      routing and addressing. It provides for scalability, provider
      independence, mobility, multihoming and security for the next generation
      Internet. This document describes a series of use cases in order to
      showcase RANGER capabilities. It further shows how the RANGER
      architecture restores the network-within-network principles originally
      intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet is continually required to support more users, more
      internetwork connections and increasing complexity due to diverse policy
      requirements. This growth and change strains the infrastructure and
      demands new solutions. Three complimentary approaches to transform
      Internet technology are being pursued concurrently within the IETF:
      translation (including Network Address Translation (NAT)), Tunneling
      (map and encapsulate), and native IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>
      deployment. Routing and Addressing in Next-Generation EnteRprises
      (RANGER) <xref target="I-D.templin-ranger"></xref> describes a method
      for the map and encapsulate approach that also facilitates the other two
      approaches.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.templin-ranger"></xref> provides an architectural
      framework for scalable routing and addressing. It provides for
      scalability, provider independence, mobility, multihoming and security
      for the next generation Internet. The RANGER architectural principles
      are not new. They can be traced to the deliberations of the ROAD group
      <xref target="RFC1380"></xref>, and also to still earlier works
      including NIMROD <xref target="RFC1753"></xref> and the Catenet model
      for internetworking <xref target="CATENET"></xref><xref
      target="IEN48"></xref><xref target="RFC2775"></xref>. <xref
      target="RFC1955"></xref> captures the high-level architectural aspects
      of the ROAD group deliberations in a "New Scheme for Internet Routing
      and Addressing (ENCAPS) for IPNG".</t>

      <t>The Internet has grown tremendously since these architectural
      principles were first developed, and that evolution increases the need
      for these capabilities. The Internet has become a critical resource for
      business, for government, and for individual users throughout the
      developed world. RANGER carries forward these historic architectural
      principles, creating a ubiquitous enterprise structure that can
      represent collections of network elements ranging from the granularity
      of a singleton router all the way up to an entire Internet. This
      enterprise structure uses border routers that configure tunnel endpoints
      to connect potentially recursively-nested enterprises. Each enterprise
      may use completely independent internal Routing Locator (RLOC) address
      spaces, supporting a virtual overlay network connecting edge networks
      and devices that are addressed with globally unique Endpoint Interface
      iDentifiers (EIDs). The RANGER virtual overlay can transcend traditional
      administrative and organizational boundaries. In its purest form, this
      overlay network could therefore span the entire Internet and restore the
      end-to-end transparency envisioned in [RFC 2775].</t>

      <t>The RANGER architecture is built using Virtual Enterprise Traversal
      (VET) <xref target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref>, the Subnetwork
      Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) <xref
      target="I-D.templin-seal"></xref>, Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel
      Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)<xref target="I-D.templin-isatapv4"> </xref>
      <xref target="RFC5214"></xref>, and other mechanisms including IPsec
      <xref target="RFC4301"></xref>. This document describes use cases and
      shows how the RANGER mechanisms apply. Complimentary mechanisms (e.g.,
      DNS, DHCP, NAT, etc.) are included to show how the various pieces can
      work together. It expands on the concepts introduced in IPv6 Enterprise
      Network Scenarios <xref target="RFC4057"></xref> and analysis <xref
      target="RFC4852"></xref>, and shows how the enterprise network model
      generalizes to a broad range of scenarios. These use cases are included
      to provide examples, invite criticism and comment, and explore the
      potential for creating the next-generation Internet using the RANGER
      architecture. Familiarity with RANGER, VET, SEAL, and ISATAP are
      assumed.</t>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Internet Topology Hierarchy"><vspace />The Internet
          Protocol (IP) natively supports a topology hierarchy comprised of
          increasing aggregations of networked elements. Network interfaces of
          devices are grouped into subnetworks and subnetworks are grouped
          into larger aggregations. Subnetworks can be optionally grouped into
          areas and the areas grouped into an autonomous system (AS).
          Alternatively, subnetworks can be directly grouped into an AS. The
          foundation of the IP Topology Hierarchy is the AS, which determines
          the administrative boundaries of a network deployment including its
          routing, addressing, quality of service, security, and management.
          Intra-domain routing occurs within an autonomous system and
          inter-domain routing links autonomous systems into a network of
          networks (Internet).</t>

          <t hangText="Routing Locator (RLOC)"><vspace />an IPv4 or IPv6
          address assigned to an interface in an enterprise-interior routing
          region. Note that RLOC space is local to each enterprise, hence the
          same RLOC space IP addresses may be reused between disjoint
          enterprises.</t>

          <t hangText="">The IPv4 public address space currently in use today
          can be considered as the RLOC space for the global Internet
          &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;.</t>

          <t hangText="Endpoint Interface iDentifier (EID)"><vspace />an IPv4
          and IPv6 address assigned to an edge network interface of an end
          system. Note that EID space is global in scope, and must be separate
          and distinct from any RLOC space.</t>

          <t hangText="commons"><vspace />an enterprise-interior routing
          region that provides a subnetwork for cooperative peering between
          the border routers of diverse organizations that may have competing
          interests. An example of a commons is the Default Free Zone (DFZ) of
          the global Internet. The enterprise-interior routing region within
          the commons uses an addressing plan taken from RLOC space.</t>

          <t hangText="enterprise"><vspace />the same as defined in <xref
          target="RFC4852"></xref>, where the enterprise deploys a unified
          RLOC space addressing plan within the commons, but may also contain
          partitions with disjoint RLOC spaces and/or organizational groupings
          that can be considered as enterprises unto themselves. An enterprise
          therefore need not be "one big happy family", but instead provides a
          commons for the cooperative interconnection of diverse organizations
          that may have competing interests (e.g., such as the case within the
          global Internet default free zone).</t>

          <t>Historically, "Enterprise networks" are associated with large
          corporations or academic campuses. However, in RANGER an
          "enterprise" may exist at any IP Topology Hierarchy level. The
          RANGER architectural principles apply to any networked entity that
          has some degree of cooperative active management. This definition
          therefore extends to home networks, small office networks, a wide
          variety of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), and even to the global
          Internet itself.</t>

          <t hangText="site"><vspace />a logical and/or physical grouping of
          interfaces within an enterprise commons, where the topology of the
          site is a proper subset of the topology of the enterprise. A site
          may contain many interior sites, which may themselves contain many
          interior sites in a recursive fashion.</t>

          <t>Throughout the remainder of this document, the term "enterprise"
          refers to either enterprise or site, i.e., the RANGER principles
          apply equally to enterprises and sites of any size or shape. At the
          lowest level of recursive decomposition, a singleton Enterprise
          Border Router can be considered as an enterprise unto itself.</t>

          <t hangText="Enterprise Border Router (EBR)"><vspace />a node at the
          edge of an enterprise that is also configured as a tunnel endpoint
          in an overlay network. EBRs connect their directly-attached networks
          to the overlay network, and connect to other networks via IP-in-IP
          tunneling across the commons to other EBRs. This definition is
          intended as an architectural equivalent of the functional term "EBR"
          defined in <xref target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref>, and is
          synonymous with the term "xTR" used in other contexts (e.g., <xref
          target="I-D.farinacci-lisp"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="Enterprise Border Gateway (EBG)"><vspace />an EBR that
          also connects the enterprise to provider networks and/or to the
          global Internet. EBGs are typically configured as default routers in
          the overlay, and provide forwarding services for accessing IP
          networks not reachable via an EBR within the commons. This
          definition is intended as an architectural equivalent of the
          functional term "EBG" defined in <xref
          target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref>, and is synonymous with
          the term "default mapper" used in other contexts (e.g., <xref
          target="I-D.jen-apt"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="overlay network"><vspace />a virtual network manifested
          by routing and addressing over virtual links formed through
          automatic tunneling. An overlay network may span many underlying
          enterprises.</t>

          <t hangText="6over4"><vspace />Transmission of IPv6 over IPv4
          Domains without Explicit Tunnels <xref target="RFC2529"></xref>;
          functional specifications and operational practices for automatic
          tunneling of unicast/multicast IPv6 packets over multicast-capable
          IPv4 enterprises.</t>

          <t hangText="ISATAP"><vspace />Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel
          Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) <xref target="RFC5214"></xref><xref
          target="I-D.templin-isatapv4"></xref>; functional specifications and
          operational practices for automatic tunneling over unicast-only
          enterprises.</t>

          <t hangText="VET"><vspace />Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) <xref
          target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref>; functional
          specifications and operational practices that provide a functional
          superset of 6over4 and ISATAP. In addition to both unicast and
          multicast tunneling, VET also supports address/prefix
          autoconfiguration as well as additional encapsulations such as
          IPSec, SEAL, LISP/UDP, Teredo/UDP, etc.</t>

          <t hangText="SEAL"><vspace />Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation
          Layer (SEAL) <xref target="I-D.templin-seal"></xref>; a functional
          specification for robust packet identification and link MTU
          adaptation over tunnels. SEAL supports effective ingress filtering
          and adapts to subnetworks configured over links with diverse
          characteristics.</t>

          <t hangText="">Within the RANGER architecture context, the SEAL
          &ldquo;subnetwork&rdquo; and RANGER &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; should
          be considered as identical abstractions.</t>

          <t hangText="Provider-Independent (PI) prefix"><vspace />an IPv6 or
          IPv4 EID prefix (e.g., 2001:DB8::/48, 192.0.2/24, etc.) that is
          routable within a limited scope and may also appear in enterprise
          mapping tables. PI prefixes that can appear in mapping tables are
          typically delegated to a BR by a registry, but are not aggregated by
          a provider network. Local-use IPv6 and IPv4 prefixes (e.g.,
          FD00::/8, 192.168/16, etc.) are another example of a PI prefix, but
          these typically do not appear in mapping tables.</t>

          <t hangText="Provider-Aggregated (PA) prefix"><vspace />an IPv6 or
          IPv4 EID prefix that is either derived from a PI prefix or delegated
          directly to a provider network by a registry. Although not widely
          discussed, it bears specific mention that a prefix taken from a
          delegating router's PI space becomes a PA prefix from the
          perspective of the requesting router.</t>

          <t hangText="Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) Router"><vspace />a
          residential or small office router that provides IPv4 and/or IPv6
          support. The user or the service provider may manage the router.</t>

          <t hangText="Carrier Grade NAT (CGN)"><vspace />a special (usually
          high capacity) IPv4 to IPv4 NAT deployed within the service provider
          network that serves multiple subnets.</t>

    <section anchor="app" title="Approach">
      <t>The RANGER architecture is described in <xref
      target="I-D.templin-ranger"></xref>. The following is a terse summary of
      some key elements of the architecture.</t>

      <t>The RANGER &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; is a cooperative networked
      collective sharing a common (business, social, political, etc.) goal. An
      enterprise can be simple or complex in composition and can operate at
      any IP Topology Hierarchy level. Although RANGER focuses on
      encapsulation, it is also compatible with both native and translated
      routing and addressing.</t>

      <t>RANGER enables a protocol and/or addressing system to be connected in
      a virtual overlay across an untrusted transit network, or
      &ldquo;commons&rdquo;. While it does not show all possible uses, Figure
      1 illustrates that RANGER supports the creation of a distributed network
      across an intervening commons which could implement a dissimilar IP
      version, routing protocol, or addressing system.</t>

      </figure>

      <t>The RANGER concepts can be applied recursively. They can be
      implemented at any level within the IP Topology Hierarchy to create an
      enterprise-within-enterprise organizational structure extending
      traditional AS, area, or subnetwork boundaries. This structure uses
      border routers that configure tunnel endpoints to enable communications
      between potentially recursively-nested enterprises in a virtual overlay
      network that transcends traditional administrative and organizational
      boundaries. In its purest form, this overlay network could therefore
      span the entire Internet and restore end-to-end transparency (RFC
      2775).</t>

      <t>The RANGER architecture applies the best current practice insights
      from previous encapsulation systems as they are currently articulated
      within the Virtual Enterprise Traversal <xref
      target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref>, and Subnetwork Encapsulation
      and Adaptation Layer <xref target="I-D.templin-seal"></xref> functional
      specifications. The result is an architecture and protocol system that
      can be used to create arbitrarily complex, scalable IP deployments that
      support both unicast and multicast routing and addressing systems.</t>

      <t>RANGER supports scalable routing through a recursively-nested
      enterprise-within-enterprise network capability. The fundamental
      building block is the Enterprise Border Router (EBR) (see Figure 2). The
      EBR is the limiting factor for RANGER recursion, and in certain contexts
      a singleton EBR can be viewed as an enterprise unto itself. Traditional
      network infrastructures can be extended to support complex structures
      solely with the addition of EBRs with no other modification to any
      networked entity.</t>

      <t>An EBR can be a commercial off the shelf router, a tactical military
      radio, an aircraft mobile router, etc., but it can also be an end system
      (e.g., a laptop computer, a soldiers' handheld device, etc.) that may or
      may not enable routing functions such as Internet connection
      sharing.</t>

               Figure 2: Enterprise Border Router (EBR)</artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>EBRs connect networks and end systems to one or more enterprises via
      a repertoire of interface types. Enterprise-interior interfaces attach
      to a commons. Provider-edge interfaces support traditional routing
      relationships up the IP Topology Hierarchy and Enterprise-edge
      Interfaces support traditional relationships down the IP Topology
      Hierarchy. Internal virtual interfaces are typically loopback interfaces
      or VMware-like host-in-host interfaces.</t>

      <t>VET interfaces support RANGER recursion and IP-in-IP encapsulation.
      VET interfaces are configured over provider-edge, enterprise interior,
      or enterprise-edge interfaces to allow recursion horizontally or
      vertically within the IP Topology Hierarchy. A VET interface may be
      configured over several underlying interfaces that all connect to the
      same enterprise. This creates a link-layer multiplexing capability that
      can provide several advantages (see <xref
      target="I-D.templin-intarea-vet"></xref> Appendix B). One important
      advantage is continuous operation across failovers between multiple
      links attached to the same enterprise, without any need for
      readdressing.</t>

      <t>Figure 3 shows two enterprises (each with their own internal
      addressing and routing systems) that communicate over a virtual overlay
      network across a commons. The virtual overlay is manifested by
      tunneling, which links enterprises separated by geographical remoteness,
      protocol incompatibility, or both. An ingress EBR (iEBR) within the left
      enterprise seeks to forward encapsulated packets across the commons to
      the egress EBR (eEBR) within the right enterprise.</t>

      <t>The figure shows that the eEBR assigns a Routing LOCator (RLOC)
      address on its interface to the Commons&rsquo; interior IP routing and
      address space, while the destination host assigns an Endpoint interface
      IDentifier (EID) on its enterprise edge interface. The iEBR uses a
      mapping system to discover the RLOC of an eEBR on the path to the
      destination EID address. A distinct mapping system is maintained within
      each recursively-nested enterprise instance operating at a specific
      level of the IP Topology Hierarchy. RANGER uses the mapping system to
      join peer enterprises via a virtual overlay across a commons.</t>

      <t>EBRs must configure both RLOC and EID addresses and/or prefixes.
      Autoconfiguration is coordinated with Enterprise Border Gateways (EBGs)
      that connect to the next-higher layer in the recursive hierarchy, as
      specified in VET. Standard mechanisms including DHCP <xref
      target="RFC2131"></xref> <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> and Stateless
      Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"></xref> are
      used for this purpose.</t>

      <t>Similarly, EBRs require a means to discover other EBRs and EBGs that
      can be used as enterprise exit points. VET specifies mechanisms for
      border router discovery using both the global DNS and/or
      enterprise-local name services such as LLMNR <xref
      target="RFC4795"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The mapping system is a distributed database that is synchronized
      among a limited set of mapping agents. Database synchronization can be
      achieved by many different protocol alternatives. The most commonly used
      alternatives are either BGP or the domain name system (DNS; RFC1035).
      Mapping system databases can be populated by many different mechanisms
      including administrative configuration and automated prefix
      registrations.</t>

      <t>EBRs either forward initial packets for which they have no mapping to
      an EBG or consult the mapping system to determine the correct next hop
      while delaying or dropping initial packets if necessary. The EBR then
      receives a mapping reply that it can use to populate its Forwarding
      Information Base (FIB). It then encapsulates each forwarded packet in an
      outer IP header for transmission across the commons to the remote RLOC
      address of an eEBR. The eEBR in turn decapsulates the packets and
      forwards them to the destination EID address. The Routing Information
      Base (RIB) within the commons only needs to maintain state regarding
      RLOCs and not EIDs. The synchronized EID-to-RLOC mapping state is not
      subject to oscillations due to link state changes within the commons.
      RANGER supports scalable addressing by selecting a suitably large EID
      addressing range that is distinct from any enterprise-interior RLOC
      addressing ranges.</t>

        <section title="Scaling the Global Interdomain Routing Core">
          <t>Growth in the Internet has created challenges in routing and
          addressing that have been recognized for more than 15 years. IPv4
          <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> address space is limited, and
          Regional Internet Registry (RIR) allocation is passing the
          &ldquo;very painful&rdquo; Host Density (HD) ratio threshold of 86%
          (that is, 192M allocated addresses) <xref target="RFC3194"></xref>.
          As a result, exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is predicted within
          the next two years <xref target="V4pool"></xref>, <xref
          target="Huston-end"></xref>. IPv6 promises to resolve the address
          shortage with a much larger address space, but transition is costly
          and could exacerbate Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) problems
          described below. Richer interconnection, increased multihoming
          (especially with Provider-Independent (PI) addresses), and a desire
          to support traffic engineering via finer control of routing has led
          to super-linear growth of BGP routing tables in the default-free
          zone or &ldquo;DFZ&rdquo; of the Internet. This growth has been
          damped because of the limited number of IPv4 addresses, so the
          larger address space of IPv6 threatens to make the problem
          worse.</t>

          <t>RANGER allows the coordinated reuse of addresses from Enterprise
          to Enterprise by making RLOC address spaces independent of one
          another. Figure 4 shows how the RANGER architecture allows the use
          of separate address spaces for RLOC and EID addressing in the
          Internet. This yields more endpoint address space, especially with
          the use of IPv6, and also reduces the load on BGP in the Internet
          routing core. Note that Figure 4 could represent variants of RFC
          4057 scenarios 1 and 2.</t>

          <t>RLOC address spaces are entirely independent of one another, as
          they are used only within an Enterprise (recall that an Enterprise
          can exist at any level of the IP Topology Hierarchy). Therefore as
          Figure 4 shows, the same RLOC space can be reused freely throughout
          different Enterprises regardless of their level of recursion. EID
          address space can be Provider-Aggregated (PA) or PI, and taken from
          either IPv4, or IPv6. EID addresses (barring use of Network Address
          Translation (NAT)) are globally unique, even when routable only
          within a more limited scope (e.g., in their own edge networks).</t>

          <t>The IRTF routing research group is investigating a Preliminary
          Recommendation for a Routing Architecture <xref

          taxonomy for routing scaling solutions for the global Internet
          interdomain routing core. RANGER is a locator/identifier separation
          architecture within this taxonomy that uniquely shows applicability
          from the core all the way out to edge networks via its recursive
          enterprise-within-enterprise framework. RANGER is further compatible
          with a number of schemes intending to address routing scaling
          issues, including A Practical Transit Mapping Service (APT) <xref

          <t>Each enterprise network operator must be able to manage its
          internal networks and use the Internet infrastructure to achieve its

             Figure 5: Enterprises on the Internet Commons</artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>Figure 5 depicts enterprises E1 through Em connected to the
          global IPv4 Internet via Enterprise Border Routers (EBRs) X1 through
          X9. This same set of border nodes also act as Enterprise Border
          Gateways (EBGs) that provide default routing services for nodes
          within their respective enterprises. The global Internet forms a
          commons across which the various enterprises connect as cooperating
          yet potentially competing entities. Within each enterprise there may
          be arbitrarily many hosts, routers and networks (not shown in the
          diagram) that use addresses taken from that enterprise's RLOC space
          and over which both encapsulated IP packets with (global-scoped) EID
          addresses and unencapsulated IP packets with (enterprise-local) RLOC
          addresses can be forwarded.</t>

          <t>Each enterprise may encompass lower-tier enterprises; for
          instance, the singleton EBR &ldquo;W&rdquo; in enterprise E2 resides
          in a lower-tier enterprise (say E2.1), and (along with any of its
          attached devices) may be considered as an enterprise unto itself. W
          sees Y3 and Y4 as EBGs, which in turn see X5 and X6 as EBGs that
          connect to a common provider network (in this case, the Internet).
          Each enterprise has one or more Endpoint identifier (EID) address
          prefixes used for addressing nodes on edge networks. RANGER&rsquo;s
          map-and-encaps approach separates the mapping of EIDs to RLOCs from
          the Routing Information Base (RIB) in the Internet commons that are
          assigned to EBR router interfaces. Not only does BGP in the Internet
          commons only need to maintain state regarding Routing Locators
          (RLOCs)in the Internet commons, it has fewer unique routes to
          maintain because only routes to EBRs are needed; traffic engineering
          can therefore be accommodated via the mapping database.</t>

          <t>In Figure 5, enterprise E2 represents a corporation that has
          multiple locations and connections to multiple ISPs. The corporation
          has recently merged with another corporation so that its internal
          network has two disjoint RLOC address spaces, but neither of the
          formerly separate entities can bear the burden of address
          renumbering. Enterprise E2 can use a suitably large IPv4 and/or IPv6
          EID addressing range (that is distinct from any enterprise-interior
          RLOC addressing range) to support end systems on enterprise edge
          networks with no disruption to preexisting address numbering.</t>

          <t>As EBRs are deployed to connect enterprises together, ordinary
          routers within the enterprise continue to function as-normal and
          deliver both ordinary and encapsulated packets across the existing
          Internet infrastructure and the enterprise's own RLOC commons.
          Legacy IPv4 services that bind to RLOC addresses continue to be
          supported even as EID-based services are rolled out. Where legacy IP
          client and server are within the same RLOC address space, they
          simply communicate by using RLOC-based routing across the enterprise
          commons. If client and server are not within the same RLOC address
          space, they communicate through some form of network address and/or
          protocol translation (see [I-D.templin-RANGER] Section 3.3.4 for
          details). EBRs from the various enterprises publish their EID
          prefixes to an enterprise-specific mapping system, so that other
          EBRs from the various enterprises can consult the mapping system to
          receive the RLOC address of one or more EBRs that serve the EID
          prefix.</t>

          <t>As an example, when an end system connected to W in E2.1 has a
          packet to send to node Z in enterprise E3, W sends the packet to EBR
          Y4 which encapsulates the packet in an outer IP packet with its own
          source address and the RLOC address of the next-hop EBR as
          destination &ndash; in this case, X6. X6 decapsulates the packet and
          looks up the destination EID prefix, obtaining the RLOC of X7 as
          next-hop. X6 then encapsulates the IPv6 packet in a packet with RLOC
          address X6 as source and X7 as destination. X7 decapsulates the
          packet on receipt and forwards it via its enterprise-edge interface
          to node Z.</t>

          <t>This example uses one thread out of many that are possible using
          RANGER; see <xref target="I-D.templin-ranger"></xref> and <xref
          target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref> for other options and
          details. Many enterprises that use proxies and firewalls at their
          border routers today will wish to maintain that control over their
          enterprise borders, and the use of RANGER does not preclude such
          configurations (for example, see Section 4.3).</t>

        <t>An enterprise such as E2 in Figure 5 above can represent an AS
        within the IP Topology Hierarchy. A possible configuration for
        Enterprise E2 is for each of its enterprise components to also be
        recursive ASs linked together using the RANGER constructs. Such a
        configuration is increasingly commonplace today for the networks of
        very large corporations (e.g., Boeing&rsquo;s corporate enterprise
        network). These networks support an internal instance of the Border
        Gateway Protocol (BGP) linking many corporate-internal ASs and
        independent from the BGP instance which maintains the RIB within the
        global Internet Default Free Zone (DFZ). Such configurations are often
        motivated by scaling or administrative requirements.</t>

        <t>Such a corporate entity is internally an Internet unto itself,
        albeit with separate default routes leading to the true global
        Internet. The enterprise E2 therefore appears to the rest of the
        Internet as if it were a traditional IP Topology Hierarchy AS. Since
        RANGER supports recursion, each AS within such an enterprise may
        itself use BGP internally in place of an IGP, and can therefore also
        internally be composed of a locally-internal Internet in a recursive
        fashion. This enterprise-within-enterprise framework can recursively
        be extended as broadly and as deeply as required in order to achieve
        the specific requirements of the deployment (e.g., scaling, unique
        administration, and/or functional compartmentalization).</t>

      <section title="Small Enterprise Concerns">
        <t>Global enterprises operating at the autonomous system level of the
        IP Topology Hierarchy include multiple geographical regions, multiple
        ISPs, and complex internal structures which naturally benefit from the
        application of RANGER techniques. However, all other enterprise
        network instances (both large and small) can also be served by RANGER.
        For example, Small and Home Office (SOHO) networks may comprise only a
        few computers on a single network segment or extend to larger
        configurations with security islands, internal routers and switches,
        etc.</t>

        <t>An important concern of the small enterprise is the ability to grow
        the network, change ISPs, or expand to more locations without
        readdressing the existing network. Consider a small company that has a
        single location in California. The ISP connection is via a router that
        acts as Network Address Translator and firewall for the company.
        Addresses of the few computers ("Wksta") are taken from the <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> private address space.</t>

        <t>This configuration has been adequate for the few employees
        performing software development work, since there is no need to expose
        services within the site to the outside world. But now a web presence
        is required as product introduction approaches. The network manager
        deploys an EBR either as a co-resident function on the existing
        NAT/firewall platform as depicted below, or on a separate
        platform.</t>

        <t>The EBR has a provider-edge interface connected to the ISP, the
        preexisting workstations, the preexisting enterprise edge interfaces
        connecting workstations, and enterprise-edge interfaces connecting
        several network segments connected by routers that host web servers,
        workstations and other enterprise services. A VET interface is
        configured over the new service network to allow the servers to be
        addressed from the public Internet.</t>

      <section anchor="trans" title="IPv4/IPv6 Transition and Coexistence">
        <t>End systems and networks need to accommodate long-term support for
        both IPv4 and IPv6. Requirements for transition include support for
        IPv4 applications running over IPv4 protocol stacks, IPv4 applications
        over IPv6 stacks, IPv4 applications over dual stacks, IPv6 or
        IPv4/IPv6 capable applications over both IPv6 and dual stacks. Both
        encapsulation and translation will likely be needed to allow
        applications, enterprises and providers to incorporate IPv6, including
        all intermediate states, without global coordination or a &lsquo;flag
        day&rsquo;.</t>

        <t>The RANGER architecture facilitates the addition of IPv6 addressing
        to existing IPv4 end systems and routers (i.e., via dual-stack) as
        well as the addition of IPv6 networks to the existing set of IPv4
        networks. RANGER, with VET <xref
        target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref> and SEAL <xref
        target="I-D.templin-seal"></xref>, makes it possible to carry packets
        originated in one protocol across network infrastructure supporting
        another protocol or routing system. Figure 1 on page 8 shows how
        RANGER supports various combinations of edge (EID) and core (RLOC
        commons) technologies, going beyond IP version differences to include
        mixed security, management, and addressing as well.</t>

        <t>The RANGER architecture supports end-to-end communications across
        arbitrarily-long paths of concatenated enterprises connected by EBRs.
        When IPv6 is used as Endpoint interface Identifier (EID) space, each
        EBR can provision a globally unique set of IPv6 EID prefixes without
        scaling limitations due to the expanded IPv6 address space. For
        example, figure 9 shows a pair of end systems &lsquo;H&rsquo; and
        &lsquo;J&rsquo; separated by an intervening set of enterprises, where
        the path between &lsquo;H&rsquo; and &lsquo;J&rsquo; traverses the EBR
        path &lsquo;V-&gt;Y1-&gt;X2-&gt;X7-&gt;Z&rsquo;:</t>

        </figure>

        <t>When each EBR in the path is assigned a unique set of IPv6 EID
        prefixes (and registers these prefixes in the appropriate
        routing/mapping tables), IPv6 can be used for navigation purposes with
        each EBR in the path seen as a waypoint for navigation. This is true
        even if IPv4 is used as the enterprise-local Routing LOCator (RLOC)
        address space, and there were many IPv4 hops on the path between each
        pair of neighboring EBRs.</t>

        <t>RANGER further provides a compatible framework for incorporating
        supporting mechanisms including protocol translation,
        application-layer aspects of IPv4/IPv6 transition discussed in <xref
        target="RFC4038"></xref> and DNS issues for IPv6 from <xref
        target="RFC4472"></xref>. For instances where IPv4 applications remain
        in use, RANGER supports translation via functional equivalents of
        &ldquo;Network Address Translation, Protocol Translation
        (NAT-PT)&rdquo; <xref target="RFC2766"></xref>, and &ldquo;Bump In the
        Stack (BIS)&rdquo; <xref target="RFC2767"></xref>. Figure 10 shows the
        NAT-PT-equivalent translation in the VET router, and Figure 11 shows
        the BIS-equivalent translation in end systems. These examples address
        scenarios not mentioned in RFC 4852.</t>

        <t>In Figure 10, an IPv4 application on end system A operates normally
        and the end system sends IPv4 packets on the IPv4-only site network.
        The IPv4 packets are received by an Enterprise Border Router (EBR)
        that translates them into IPv6 packets by a NAT-PT-equivalent process.
        The EBR then encapsulates the packets into IPv4 and sends them across
        the RANGER&ndash;enabled Internet to Site 2 where they are received
        and decapsulated by an EBR for Site 2. The EBR uses NAT-PT-equivalent
        translation to translate the resulting IPv6 packet back to an IPv4
        packet that is delivered across the Site 2 IPv4-only network to an
        IPv4 application on end system B.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>Figure 11 shows the simplified approach using a Bump-In the Stack
        (BIS) translation process within dual-stack end systems (<xref
        target="RFC2767"></xref>). In this case, the IPv4 application on
        dual-stack end system A forms an IPv4 payload which is then
        transformed into an IPv6 packet within the end system protocol stack
        itself. The IPv6 packet can then be encapsulated and sent across the
        Internet to be decapsulated and sent to the dual-stack end system
        hosting IPv4 application B. The BIS-equivalent process on end system B
        reverses the translation, yielding an IPv4 packet for consumption by
        the IPv4-only application.</t>

        <t>Other issues besides IP protocol translation may arise during
        IPv4-IPv6 transition; <xref target="RFC4038"></xref> points out issues
        including IPv4/IPv6 capable applications running on IPv4-only protocol
        stacks, DNS responses that include addresses of both IP versions, and
        the difficulty of supporting multiple application versions. It also
        advises that applications be converted to dual support as a preferred
        solution. These issues are outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <t></t>

        <section title="Global Mobility Management">
          <t>Ubiquitous wireless access enables connection to network
          infrastructure nearly anywhere. Vehicles and even persons can host
          networks that move around with them. For example, commercial
          aircraft networks include requirements for nomadic networks, local
          mobility, and global mobility where the connection point between
          airplane and ground station can move from one continent to another.
          Mobile networks need to be able to use Provider-Independent (PI) as
          well as Provider-aggregated (PA) address prefixes. Some applications
          such as voice require rapid or seamless connection handoffs - also
          known as session survivability. Internet routing should not be
          unduly disrupted by mobility, so movement of mobile nodes or edge
          networks should not cause large ripples of routing protocol traffic,
          especially in the DFZ.</t>

          <t>When a RANGER enterprise is overlaid on the Internet, mobile
          nodes or mobile routers (that connect arbitrarily complex edge
          networks or enterprises) can move between different points of
          attachment while remaining reachable and without creating excessive
          routing churn. In a commercial airline scenario, an aircraft with a
          mobile router would move between ground station points of attachment
          (that may be on different continents) without readdressing of its
          onboard networks. Figure 12 shows an aircraft transiting between
          four different access points; two that are part of Air
          Communications Service Provider (ACSP) 1, one in ACSP2 and the last
          directly to the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP). ACSP1 and
          ACSP2 in this example might be on different continents, so a
          traditional Mobile IP Home Agent scheme , <xref
          target="RFC3775"></xref>would result in very inefficient paths for
          one ACSP or the other. The Aero Enterprise is an overlay that spans
          both continents and allows efficient paths by providing multiple
          entry and exit points (only one, R2, is shown).</t>

          <t>When the plane moves between ground stations that are located
          within the ACSP1 enterprise, no routing or mapping changes need be
          made outside ACSP1. Moreover, if link-layer multiplexing (as
          mentioned in section 3 above) is used then the VET interface network
          layer is unaware of the movement. When the point of access moves to
          ACSP2, no changes are made outside the aero Enterprise. When the
          aircraft moves between ground stations of the same parent enterprise
          (as indicated by the two different links from the aircraft to ACSP1
          in Figure 12), the aircraft announces its PI prefixes at its new
          point of attachment and withdraws them from the old. The worldwide
          Internet sees no change, and mapping system churn is confined to
          ACSP1, since the prefixes need not be announced or withdrawn within
          the parent aero Enterprise, i.e., the churn is isolated to lower
          tiers of the recursive hierarchy. This can be contrasted with the
          mobility solution previously fielded by Connexion, which propagated
          BGP changes into the Internet routing system to support mobile
          onboard networks.</t>

        <section title="First-Responder Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs)">
          <t>Many emerging network scenarios require autoconfiguration of
          Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs). Where first responders need
          networking for communications and coordination between teams, RANGER
          allows each team or agency to quickly stand up a network and then
          use the autoconfiguration described in <xref
          target="I-D.templin-autoconf-dhcp"></xref> to coordinate
          address/prefix autoconfiguration and discover border routers needed
          for teams and agencies to interconnect.</t>

          <t>For example, Figure 13 shows how police units arriving on a scene
          with no network infrastructure can create a wireless network using
          vehicle-mounted 802.11 hotspots with one or more cellular, 802.16,
          or satellite links in order to reach the Internet. In this example,
          the California Highway Patrol sets up an incident management center
          with a satellite link to the Internet and vet1 serving Enterprise
          L1. The Los Angeles County Sheriff team sets up Enterprise L1.1 at
          their field headquarters and the Altadena police force creates the
          L1.2 enterprise with their mobile units. R2 is the Enterprise router
          that serves as an EBG for border routers X3 and X4, which connect
          enterprise L1.2 and L1.1 respectively. X3 serves vet3 and X4 serves
          vet2.</t>

          <t>In like manner, the Angeles National Forest creates Enterprise
          F1, with the San Gabriel Ranger District setting up Enterprise F1.1
          and the Fire Response Team Enterprise F1.2. R1 and R2 discover one
          another and become peer EBRs across the Internet by means of manual
          configuration. In Enterprise L1, individual PI address prefixes are
          announced from L1.2 and L1.1 to L1 and R2 advertises them to the
          satellite ISP. R1 receives a PA prefix from its WiMAX provider and
          delegates parts of the prefix to X1 and X2. R2 also runs an IGP with
          R1, advertising the PI prefixes to R1 and learning the PA prefixes
          there.</t>

        <section title="Tactical Military MANETs">
          <t>Military networks reflect well-defined policy requirements that
          differ in many ways from civilian networks. The military's
          information security requirements result in information being
          labeled into specific classifications. The Bell-LaPadula model <xref
          target="Bell-LaPadula"></xref> provides a mechanism to extend
          information security policy into networked environments. This
          extension creates communications security (COMSEC), whose routing
          and addressing elements are cleanly supported by RANGER
          concepts.</t>

          <t>Figure 3 on page 10 shows that RANGER supports creation of a VET
          interface between the Enterprise Interior (network) Interface of two
          Enterprise Border Routers (EBR) located within separate enterprises,
          A and B. When this concept is applied to Enterprises operating above
          the subnetwork level of the IP Topology Hierarchy, then this VET
          interface uses IP-in-IP encapsulation. This corresponds with a
          popular COMSEC approach (IPsec - <xref target="RFC4301"></xref>).
          When this same RANGER concept is applied to Enterprises operating at
          the subnetwork level of the IP Topology Hierarchy then this
          corresponds to an older form of COMSEC (Link Layer Encryption). When
          the same RANGER concept is applied to Enterprises being singleton
          EBR nodes (i.e., the interface level of the IP Topology Hierarchy)
          then this corresponds to a third military COMSEC alternative (Link
          Encryption).</t>

          <t>The previous paragraph shows the flexibility of the RANGER
          architecture to describe COMSEC approaches in terms of IP Topology
          Hierarchy structured relationships. The power of the RANGER
          architecture becomes apparent when one recognizes that each of the
          entities in Figure 3 may themselves be simple or complex network
          structures operating at any specific level of the IP Topology
          Hierarchy. (Complex structures refer to architectures that have been
          extended by RANGER recursion.) For example, the commons in the
          figure may itself be an interface, a subnetwork, an autonomous
          system, or an Internet. Enterprise A and Enterprise B can be a
          single end system, a subnetwork, an autonomous system or an
          Internet.</t>

          <t>Tactical military MANETs differ from traditional networks in many
          ways, the most obvious being the high mobility of tactical
          deployments and self-forming-network attributes of MANETs
          themselves. Because each networked tactical entity supports a
          radio/router, the numbers of routers within military MANETs can be
          orders of magnitude more numerous (denser) than traditional civilian
          networks. This means that even small deployments have comparatively
          large router populations when compared to non-MANET deployments.
          Larger router populations directly create greater sensitivity to
          protocol scalability issues. Router scalability issues are further
          exacerbated because IP protocols react unfavorably to signal
          intermittence, which effectively dampens and constrains router
          scaling even when mitigation techniques are employed. Signal
          intermittence itself is a characteristic of mobility and the radio
          signal propagation attributes of local deployment environments
          (e.g., issues as terrain, foliage, buildings, weather, distance,
          etc.). War fighting also encourages war fighters to locate into more
          defensible terrain features, many of which naturally reduce radio
          signal propagation, further increasing the probability of signal
          intermittence.</t>

          <t>RANGER recursion enables MANET networks to be defined into
          structures that naturally encourage route aggregation and scaling.
          For example, a MANET autonomous system may benefit from RANGER
          recursion by being physically comprised of enterprises that are
          autonomous systems themselves. This relationship can be recursively
          extended vertically as deep as required in order to create route
          aggregation between entities having common mission assignments at
          differing levels of abstraction. Since MANET routing is an active
          research topic, it is helpful to realize that these structures may
          or may not use routing protocols similar to their civilian IP
          Topology Hierarchy peers. For example, because of the behavior of
          BGP within highly mobile environments, the Exterior Gateway Protocol
          (EGP) used to link ASs may or may not be BGP and, if it is BGP, it
          may have unusual timer settings. However, whatever IGP and EGP is
          used, RANGER constructs can increase route aggregation between
          entities sharing common mission assignments to enable route
          scaling.</t>

          <t>Tactical Military MANETs often have requirements to communicate
          with stationary infrastructures. By localizing mobility into an
          enterprise then the specific mobility-friendly protocols can be
          localized and their aggregation results presented to the stationary
          network using a protocol supported by the stable network. This also
          reduces the impact of mobility upon routing and addressing systems
          as reported to the stationary infrastructure. Mobility induced route
          fluctuations (e.g., routing flaps) can still occur but their impact
          can be dampened if RANGER constructs are used to localize them in
          lower tiers of the IP Topology Hierarchy. For example, Enterprise A
          in Figure 3 can be a military MANET and Enterprise B may be a
          stationary military entity. Recall that Enterprise A and B interface
          at a specific IP Topology Hierarchy level but they may be physically
          extended by RANGER mechanisms. For example, Enterprise A can be a
          MANET enterprise that is physically a network-of-networks Internet
          that interfaces to Enterprise B as if it were an Autonomous System.
          This gives Enterprise B a more stable and aggregated view of the
          Enterprise A Internet than would be the case if it were directly
          aware of Enterprise A&rsquo;s various sub-enterprise components.</t>

          <t>Another key distinctive of Tactical Military networks is that,
          because radio networks operate at a different classification level
          than the data they convey, tactical military networks have several
          orders of magnitude more COMSEC devices than do equivalently sized
          stationary military deployments (i.e., the number of COMSEC devices
          is a function of the number of mobile war-fighting entities). This
          can create significant scalability issues within the overlay COMSEC
          network relationships themselves. COMSEC scaling problems are
          manifested in several dimensions. It is important to recognize,
          however, that just as RANGER recursion was used vertically to create
          IP Topology enterprise-within-enterprise structures in order to
          improve routing aggregation and scaling of the peer enterprises, so
          RANGER recursion can be used horizontally (within the same IP
          Topology Hierarchy level) to improve COMSEC aggregation and scaling
          of the network overlay system. The RANGER use of VET also combines
          with the Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) to
          provide robust packet identification and maximum transmission unit
          (MTU) link adaptation services over tunnels. These capabilities
          protect against both source address spoofing and black holes caused
          by MTU limitations.</t>

      <section title="Provider Concerns">
        <t>Network providers must have a way to support the protocol
        transitions and network types mentioned above and still remain
        reliable and financially sound. The RANGER architecture provides ways
        to support general Internet Service Providers (ISPs), cellular
        operator networks, and specialized networks such as the Aeronautical
        Telecommunications Network (ATN).</t>

        <section title="ISP Networks">
          <t>Internet service provider networks provide a commons for the
          connection of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) routers
          [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router] that connect arbitrarily-complex
          customer networks. This is true whether the ISP permits direct
          customer-to-customer communications, or whether all communications
          are forwarded through ISP Provider Edge (PE) equipment.</t>

          <t>The ISP commons must potentially support hundreds of thousands of
          CPE routers (or more), hence the ISP may be obliged to assign
          private IPv4 address allocations (i.e., instead of public) as RLOCs
          for CPE routers. This gives rise to a &ldquo;nested NATs&rdquo;
          scenario, which can increase the overall brittleness brought on by
          NAT traversal.</t>

          <t>To address this brittleness, the ISP can deploy &ldquo;Carrier
          Grade NATs&rdquo; (CGNs) <xref
          target="I-D.jiang-incremental-cgn"></xref> that provide a second
          level of RLOC address translation on the path from the CPE to the
          Internet. When the CGNs are also configured as EBGs, CPE routers can
          discover them as default routers for reaching EID-based services
          using the EBG discovery mechanisms specified in VET.</t>

          <t>Scenarios and Analysis for Introducing IPv6 into ISP Networks
          <xref target="RFC4029"></xref> discusses both ISP backbone network
          and customer connection transition considerations, however this
          document considers router-to-router tunneling use cases. Therefore
          the ISATAP mechanism (which only supports host-to-router or
          host-to-host tunneling) is not mentioned as a candidate technology.
          Early point solutions (e.g., TSP, STEP, etc.) were recommended prior
          to the publication of RANGER, VET and SEAL. This document therefore
          updates RFC4029 to introduce these new technologies that are widely
          applicable to managed network scenarios such as ISP networks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Cellular Operator Networks">
          <t><xref target="RFC4215"></xref> provides an Analysis on IPv6
          Transition in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Networks.
          It envisions an extended period of support for both IPv4 and IPv6
          protocols in the operator network. User Equipment (UE) uses the
          Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context to establish tunnels through the
          operator network to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). RANGER could
          be used in 3GPP transition; when the UE uses IPv6, and the PDP
          context is established across an IPv4 provider network, the UE can
          configure itself as an EBR and contact the GGSN (as a RANGER EBG)
          through VET tunneling.</t>

          <t>Other <xref target="RFC4215"></xref> scenarios examine IPv4-only
          UEs, IPv6-only UEs, and various combinations of IPv4 and IPv6 within
          the operator network. Also to be considered are scenarios in which
          the UE is configured as a router or bridge that connects an end
          system such as a laptop computer. In that case, the UE could be the
          first-hop router/bridge into the cellular provider network, and the
          laptop computer could be configured as an EBR in the RANGER model.
          Again, the GGSN or a device reachable through the GGSN could serve
          as a RANGER EBG.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4215"></xref> was published prior to the
          development of RANGER, VET and SEAL. This document therefore updates
          RFC4215 to introduce these new technologies that are widely

        <section title="Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN)">
          <t>The Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) is currently
          based on the OSI and IPv4 protocols and is deployed only in limited
          areas. The future ATN under consideration within the civil aviation
          industry will be IPv6-based. The IP variant of ATN is expected to
          take the form of a worldwide enterprise that internally comprises an
          aeronautical-only Internet which has additional external interfaces
          to the global Internet. Within the ATN, there may be many Air
          Communications Service Provider (ACSP) and Air Navigation Service
          Provider (ANSP) networks that are internally organized either as
          autonomous systems or internets within the ATN, i.e., as depicted in
          figure 5 on page 13. Each of these entities may themselves be
          further internally sub-divided into lower-tier enterprises organized
          as regional, organizational, or functional compartments. It is
          important to note that while ACSPs and ANSPs within the ATN will
          share a common objective of safety-of-flight for civil aviation
          services, enterprises may have competing business, social, or
          political interests which require that components be distinct ASs.
          The RANGER principles therefore support collaborative objectives
          while allowing very diverse local policy distinctions. In this
          manner entities that do not trust each other can create
          collaborative infrastructures to achieve common goals.</t>

          <t>Operational associations like this will characterize many
          next-generation deployments, including the US Department of
          Defense's Global Information Grid (GIG). In particular, although the
          routing and addressing arrangements of all enterprises require a
          mutual level of cooperative active management at a certain level,
          scaling issues, security policy differences, free market forces,
          organizational differences, political distinctions, or other factors
          may create internal competition among entities that otherwise share
          common goals. This will require different enterprises within that
          association to be separated into distinct ASs that are linked within
          their own functional Internet relationship.</t>

          <t>The ATN illustrates transition from OSI protocols to IPv6. It
          must support mobility (see Section 4.5.1) and it serves many
          government and private entities which cooperate to provide safe and
          efficient air travel while often competing with one another. One
          possible way to meet these needs with RANGER is to create an overlay
          using IP in IP tunneling across the Internet, as illustrated in
          Figure 14. The aero overlay forms an enterprise, so that inner
          packets from ACSP, ANSP, or AOC edge networks that travel between
          VET interfaces on EBRs see their passage across the Internet as only
          one hop.</t>

          <t>Each Aeronautical Communications Service Provider (ACSP), and
          Aeronautical Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) constitute an
          enterprise recursively nested below the aero overlay. Relationships
          between the various enterprises can vary from slight to tight
          integration. In the example, the ACSP and ANSP might choose to
          exchange full routing information for their edge networks using a
          coordinated global-scope RLOC address space across which ACSP and
          ANSP EBRs can route traffic without further mapping lookups or
          re-encapsulation at intermediate EBRs. Other enterprises that have
          the aero enterprise as a common parent may not have any knowledge of
          each other's interior routing but will merely forward packets on a
          default route up to the aero overlay.</t>

          <t>The ATN is currently an OSI network but is projected to
          transition to IPv6 over time. RANGER can bridge OSI networks
          together across the IPv4 (or IPv6) Internet, or bridge IPv4 or IPv6
          networks across an OSI network. A pair of EBRs that have IP
          interfaces on a common enterprise (whether it is the Internet, the
          aero enterprise, or another parent or child enterprise) can support
          communications between their attached OSI edge networks by looking
          up ISO network service access point (NSAP) addresses <xref
          target="IS8348"></xref> instead of IP addresses for RLOC mappings.
          OSI ConnectionLess Network Protocol (CLNP) <xref
          target="IS8473"></xref> packets can therefore be encapsulated within
          IPv4 (or IPv6) headers for transmission across an Internet Protocol
          enterprise. Some OSI networks may transition to IPv6 protocols and
          addressing <xref target="RFC1888"></xref> while applications are
          adapted by using RFC 2126 <xref target="RFC2126"></xref> to carry
          OSI upper layers over TCP/IP, with the resulting IP packets carried
          across and between RANGER enterprises in the normal way. Another
          approach is to put a protocol translation function in the EBRs that
          support OSI protocol edge networks, similar to the protocol
          translation approach shown in Figure 10 on page 20.</t>

          <t>Figure 15 depicts an ACSP and ANSP connected via an IPv4 aero
          overlay. Host H represents a system onboard an aircraft that has a
          wireless link to the ACSP, connected via an enterprise-edge network
          interface on EBR F within the ACSP enterprise. H resides on an IPv6
          edge network, and its EID is taken from the ACSP IPv6 prefix. H
          needs to send a query to server S in the ANSP enterprise. H starts
          by sending a DNS query to the server at G and in return it receives
          the EID of server S. H then creates an IPv6 packet with source
          EID(H) and destination EID(S) and forwards it to its default router,
          F. F consults G for a mapping from EID(S) to the appropriate RLOC.
          In this case, EBR F encapsulates the IPv6 packet in an IPv6 outer
          packet and forwards the packet to its default EBG, A. A decapsulates
          the packet and looks up the destination EID(S) by querying the DNS
          server at EBR B. B returns a mapping with the RLOC of EBR E. A
          encapsulates the IPv6 inner packet in an IPv4 outer packet with
          source RLOC(A) and destination RLOC(E). The packet is forwarded via
          EBRs C and D in the aero overlay until it reaches E, where it is
          decapsulated. E consults its cache of EID/RLOC mappings and finds
          that the EBR for S is N. E encapsulates the packet in an IPv6 packet
          with source RLOC(E) and destination RLOC(N). When the packet reaches
          N, it is decapsulated and the inner IPv6 packet is forwarded on the
          edge network to the server, S.</t>

        <section title="Unmanaged Networks">
          <t>Evaluation of IPv6 Transition Mechanisms for Unmanaged Networks
          <xref target="RFC3904"></xref> considers four cases for support of
          IPv6-enabled routers and end systems connected to an ISP network via
          a gateway:</t>

          <t><list style="letters">
              <t hangText="A)">a gateway which does not provide IPv6 at
              all;</t>

              <t hangText="B)">a dual-stack gateway connected to a dual-stack
              ISP;</t>

              <t hangText="C)">a dual-stack gateway connected to an IPv4-only
              ISP; and</t>

              <t hangText="D)">a gateway connected to an IPv6-only ISP.</t>
            </list>Case a is typified by the widespread practice of customer
          networks using IPv4-only NAT boxes to connect to their service
          providers. RANGER does not address this scenario directly, however
          the TEREDO mechanism <xref target="RFC4380"></xref> can provide a
          sufficient solution in many cases.</t>

          <t>Case d is a scenario that has not yet seen widespread adoption.
          In this scenario, the customer network could be configured as IPv6
          only and the deployment could be considered as an IPv6-only
          extension to a RANGER enterprise-edge network. End systems in this
          scenario would still require support for legacy IPv4-only
          applications, and if the customer network contained IPv4-only
          routers and end systems the RANGER encapsulation mechanisms would
          still apply.</t>

          <t>Cases b and c correspond to the scenario of the customer gateway
          to the ISP becoming an IPv6 router. In that case, the gateway could
          become a RANGER EBR, and the scenario becomes the same as the SOHO
          network use cases discussed in Section 4.3. In particular, when
          traditional home network IPv4 NAT boxes are updated to also support
          IPv6 routing, the NAT box becomes a RANGER EBR.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

    <section title="Summary">
      <t>The Internet today can be considered as a giant enterprise, with
      nodes in the Internet addressed from the public IPv4 address space as
      RLOCs. Due to the 32-bit addressing limitations of IPv4, however,
      continued expansion is coordinated through the widespread deployment of
      IPv4 Network Address Translators (NATs) while IPv6 has yet to see wide
      adoption.</t>

      <t>In many senses, however, this has resulted in a degenerate
      manifestation of the network-of-networks model originally envisaged,
      e.g., in the CATENET model. Indeed, these NATed domains have the
      external appearance of being a simple host within the global Internet
      RLOC space even though they may be proxying for arbitrarily large
      networks of end systems. The end result is a loss of transparency in the
      end-to-end model; it is no longer true that any node in the Internet can
      directly address any other node.</t>

      <t>By adopting the principle of using RLOCs as the local addressing
      range and EIDs as the global addressing range, RANGER enables a true
      network-within-network (or enterprise-within-enterprise) framework. This
      is true even across a wide array of deployment scenarios as documented
      here, and even for networks-within-networks that may be recursively
      nested to an arbitrary depth. RANGER therefore brings a unifying
      architecture applied consistently across all layers of recursion, rather
      than a mixed bag of point solutions that may or may not be mutually
      compatible.</t>

      <t>By restoring the original CATENET vision to the Internet, the next
      generation Internet can be arbitrarily scalable while simultaneously
      supporting provider independence, mobility, multihoming and
      security.</t>
