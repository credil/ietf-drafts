  <abstract> 

    <t>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in <xref target="RFC5070">RFC 5070</xref> to facilitate enriched cybersecurity information exchange among cybersecurity entities by embedding structured information formatted by specifications, including CAPEC&trade;, CEE&trade;, CPE&trade;, CVE&reg;, CVRF, CVSS, CWE&trade;, CWSS&trade;, ISO/IEC 19770-2, OCIL, OVAL&reg;, XCCDF, and XDAS.</t>

  </abstract>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="ext-intro">

<t>
Cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated, and their numbers are increasing day by day.
To cope with such situation, incident information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among organizations.
IODEF is one of the tools enabling such exchange, and is already in use.
</t>

<t>
To efficiently run cybersecurity operations, these exchnaged information needs to be machine-readable.
IODEF provides a structured means to describe the information, but it needs to embed various non-structured such information in order to convery detailed information.
Further strucuture within IODEF increases IODEF documents' machine-readability and thus facilitates streamlining cybersecurity operations.
</t>

<t>
On the other hand, there exist various other activities facilitating detailed and structured description of cybersecurity information, major of which includes <xref target="CAPEC"/>, <xref target="CEE"/>, <xref target="CPE"/>, <xref target="CVE"/>, <xref target="CVRF"/>, <xref target="CVSS"/>, <xref target="CWE"/>, <xref target="CWSS"/>, <xref target="ISO/IEC 19770-2"/>, <xref target="OCIL"/>, <xref target="OVAL"/>, <xref target="XCCDF"/>, and <xref target="XDAS"/>.
Since such structured description facilitates cybersecurity operations, it would be beneficial to embed and convey these information inside IODEF document.
</t>
<t>
To enable that, this document extends the IODEF to embed and convey various structured cybersecurity information, with which cybersecurity operations can be facilitated.
Since IODEF defines a flexible and extensible format and supports a granular level of specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF instead of defining a new report format.
For clarity, and to eliminate duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing the exchange of such structured information are provided.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology" anchor="ext-terminology">

<t>
The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in <xref target="RFC5070"/>. </t>

   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Applicability" anchor="ext-applicability">

    <t>To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange cybersecurity information, which includes the following information: attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness, countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.</t>

    <t>IODEF provides a scheme to exchange such information among interested parties. However, the detailed common format to describe such information is not defined in the IODEF base document.</t>

    <t>On the other hand, to describe those information and to facilitate exchange, a structured format for that is already available. Major of them are CAPEC, CEE, CPE, CVE, CVRF, CVSS, CWE, CWSS, OVAL, and XCCDF.
By embedding them into the IODEF document, the document can convey more detailed contents to the receivers, and the document can be easily reused.</t>

    <t>These structured cybersecurity information facilitates cybersecurity operation at the receiver side. Since the information is machine-readable, the data can be processed by computers. That expedites the automation of cybersecurity operations</t>

    <t>For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited. Then the sender can simply use IODEF, where an CAPEC record is embedded instead of describing everything in free format text. Receiver can also identify the needed details of the attack pattern by looking up some of the xml tags defined by CAPEC. Receiver can accumulate the attack pattern information (CAPEC record) in its database and could distribute it to the interested parties if needed, without needing human interventions.</t>

</section>

<section title="Extension Definition" anchor="ext-definition">

<t>This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity information by introducing new classes, with which these information can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents of AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.
</t>

<section title="Structured Cybersecurity Information Formats">

<t>This extension intends to embed various structured cybersecurity information. The below table describes the initial list of supported specifications and their IDs, versions, and namespaces; future assignments are to be made through Expert Review, as requested in <xref target="ext-iana"/>.</t>

Many of the structured information is already in use in the industry, and thus it is recommended to embed those information inside IODEF document whenever available.
</t>


<section title="System:AdditionalData Class">

<t>
The Method:AdditionalData class SHOULD contain data elements that identify the platforms involved in an event or incident by using CPE.
This is done by using System:AdditionalData with its dtype set as ext-cpe and embedding CPE identifier inside cpe tag.
Note that an instance of System class may contain multiple AdditionalData elements, thus is able to identify multiple platforms involved in the event or incident.

The Expectation:AdditionalData Class SHOULD contain data elements which describe configuration changes, detection heuristics, or [* (legal authorization?)] to assist in executing or implementing the requested action, such as XCCDF, OCIL, OVAL, etc. [Note: Expectation class does not have AdditionalData as it is.

   <t>This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity for the specific environment.</t>

   <t>Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.</t>

<section title="Transport-Specific Concerns">

<!--
   <t>The critical security concerns are that these structured information may
   be falsified or they may become corrupt during transit.
   In areas where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns. One could consider using RID and RID transport to better handle these issues. We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection. </t>
-->

   <t>The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol <xref target="RFC6045"/> and its associated transport
   binding <xref target="RFC6046"/> provide such security.</t>

<section title="Using the iodef:restriction Attribute">
   <t>In some instances, data values in particular elements may contain
   data deemed sensitive by the reporter.  Although there are no
   general-purpose rules on when to mark certain values as "private" or
   "need-to-know" via the iodef:restriction attribute, the reporter is
   cautioned not to apply element-level sensitivity markings unless they
   believe the receiving party (i.e., the party they are exchanging the
   event report data with) has a mechanism to adequately safeguard and
   process the data as marked.</t>
