1.  Introduction
    
    The lemonade work ([LEMONADE-PROFILE] and [LEMONADE-PROFILE-BIS])
    identified a need to provide notification and filtering mechanisms
    for use with IMAP [IMAP].
    
    In addition, external groups which make use of IETF work have
    communicated their requirements (for example, [OMA-LEMONADE-ARCH]).
    
    OMA requirements for within-IMAP ("inband") and out-of-IMAP
    ("outband") server to client notifications are listed in
    [OMA-ME-RD].
    
    
2.  Notifications logical architecture and LEMONADE Profile bis
    
    The target logical architectures involving the LEMONADE Profile and
    notifications are discussed in the revised Lemonade Profile
    ("profile-bis") document [LEMONADE-PROFILE-BIS].

    context of Lemonade profile-bis.

                Figure 1: Filtering mechanism defined in
                  Lemonade Profile bis architecture. 
    
    
    In Figure 1, four categories of filters are defined:
    
    1.   AF:  Administrative Filters:  Created and maintained by mail
    admin.  AF are typically not configured by the user and are used to
    apply policies, content filtering, virus protection, spam filtering,
    etc.
    
    2.   DF:  Deposit Filters:  Executed on deposit of new mail.  Can be
    defined as SIEVE filters [SIEVE].  They can include vacation
    notices.

    3.   VF:  View Filters:  Define which messages are important to a
    client.  May be implemented as pseudo-virtual mailboxes [CONTEXT].
    Clients may use this to restrict which messages they synchronize.
    
    4.   NF:  Notification Filters:  Determines when out-of-IMAP
    ("outband") notifications are sent to the client.  These filters can
    be implemented either in the message store, or in a separate
    notifications engine.
    
    The filters are manageable by the client as follows:
    
    *    NF and DF:  When the NF is internal to the mail store, it's
    implemented using Sieve and hence a Sieve management protocol is
    used for client modifications.  See [IMAP-SIEVE] and [MANAGE-SIEVE]
    for more information.  When the NF is within the notification
    mechanism, it is out of scope of Lemonade.
    
    *    VF: via pseudo-virtual mailboxes as defined in [CONTEXT].
    
    In Figure 1, the NF are shown both as part of the mail store (for
    example, using Sieve) and as an external notification mechanism.
    Either approach can be used.

    For in-IMAP ("inband") notifications, the MUA (client) issues IDLE
    [IDLE], or the successor extension command NOTIFY [NOTIFY]; the
    LEMONADE IMAP server sends notifications as unsolicited responses to
    the client.

    Out-of-IMAP ("outband") notifications are messages (notification
    payloads), and possibly a set of surrounding exchanges, sent in an
    appropriate format to a particular address (such as an IP address
    and port).  This may be the address of the client.  These messages
    are not IMAP messages, and hence conform to the interface of a
    notification server and mechanism which is responsible for
    finalizing the format and sending the notifications to the client
    using an appropriate protocol.
    
    
4.  Push Email
    
    A good user experience of "push email" requires that when
    "interesting" events occur in the mail store, the client is informed
    so that it can connect and resynchronize. [LEMONADE-PROFILE-BIS]
    contains more information, especially in Section 4.1.2.
    
    
5.  Server to server notifications considerations
    
    The following sections focus on considerations and usage of the
    Lemonade notifications for server to server notifications
    
    With server to server notifications, a messaging system (e.g., a
    mail server, voice mail system, etc.) generates event notifications.
    These notifications describe mailbox state change events such as
    arrival of a new message, mailbox full, and so forth.  See
    [MSGEVENT] for a list of such events.
    
    These state change notifications are sent to a notification
    mechanism, which may generate an alert or notifications for delivery
    to one or more clients or the user.
    
    Server to server notifications allow the messaging system to
    generate end user or client notifications without needing to keep
    track of notification settings for users or clients.
    
    The notification mechanisms are the entities which maintain
    notification preferences for clients or users.
    
    Using server to server notifications the messaging system can
    provide the end user with a unified notification experience (the
    same look and feel for all messaging systems' accounts), while
    allowing smooth integration of additional messaging systems.

5.1.  Scope of server to server notifications
    
    The POP3 and IMAP4 Internet mail protocols allow mail clients to
    access and manipulate electronic mail messages on messaging systems.
    By definition and scope, these protocols do not provide off-line
    methods to notify an end user when the mailbox state changes.  Nor
    does either protocol define a way to aggregate the status within the
    end user's various mailboxes.
    
    The desire for this functionality is obvious.  For example, from the
    very early days of electronic mail, various notifications mechanisms
    have been used, including login shell checks, and simple hacks such
    as [BIFF].
    
    To provide an end user with unified notifications and one
    centralized message-waiting indication (MWI), notification
    mechanisms are needed which aggregate the information of all the
    events occurring on the end user's different messaging systems.
    
    Server to server notifications allow the messaging system to send
    state change events to the notification mechanisms when something
    happens in or to an end user's mailbox.
    
    Notification mechanisms can be broadly grouped into three general
    architectures: external smart clients, intrinsic notification, and
    separate notification mechanisms.  External smart clients are agents
    independent of the mail system that periodically check mailbox state
    (or receive notifications, for example via IMAP IDLE) and inform the
    user or the user's mail client.  Many such systems have been used
    over the years, including login shells that check the user's mail
    spool, laptop/desktop tiny clients that periodically poll the user's
    mail servers, etc.  Intrinsic notification is any facility within a
    mail system that generates notifications, for example the server
    component of [BIFF], or, for more modern systems, the recent Sieve
    extensions for notifications [SIEVE-NOTIFY].  Separate notification
    systems are architecturally cleaner in that they separate the state
    change event notification from the end-user or client notification,
    allowing a mail system to do former, and specialized systems (such
    as those which handle presence) to be responsible for the latter.
    This separation also allows notifications to be generated for any
    service, not just electronic mail.
    
    It is important to emphasize that for the purposes of the Lemonade
    work, the scope of server to server notifications is limited to
    communications between messaging systems and notification mechanisms
    (the third architectural type).  Communication between the
    notification mechanisms and the end user or devices (which might use
    SMS, WAP Push, instant messaging, etc.) are out of scope.  Likewise,
    the scope generally presumes a security relationship between the

    messaging system and the notification mechanism; it then becomes the
    responsibility of the notification mechanism.  However, the
    specifics of security, trust relationships, and related issues,
    depend on the specifics of both server to server notifications and
    notification mechanisms.
    
    In addition to an external notification mechanism, Sieve can be used
    for notifications [SIEVE-NOTIFY].  While this is limited to email,
    because many systems already provide Sieve support, it is often a
    fairly easy and quick deployment option to provide some form of
    notifications.
    
    Here is an example of server to server notifications within a
    complete context including the notification mechanism:  A new mail
    message is deposited in a mailbox; the server then sends a "new
    message" notification to the notification service, which then
    notifies the end user by a Short Text Message (SMS).
    
    This process can include other mailbox events that are important to
    the end user or needed by the client to support user preferences,
    such as "mailbox full" and "message rejected" or other mailbox
    status changes.  The notifications might carry additional
    information for the end user, such as the mailbox status, message
    attributes, etc.

5.2.  Basic Operation
    
    The messaging system sends state change event notifications to the
    notification mechanism (which in turn might notify a client or end
    user) for events that occur in the end user's mailboxes.  Each such
    notification, referring to a single mailbox event, is called a state
    change event.

Internet Draft     Lemonade Notifications Architecture     February 2008


    The state change event contains data regarding the mailbox event
    which has occurred.  The state change event describes the change,
    but normally does not specify how or if the end user or client is
    notified; this allows the end user and client notification
    preferences to be maintained only within the notification mechanism.
    
    From the Lemonade viewpoint, out-of-IMAP (outband) notifications are
    usually desired only when the client is not connected to the IMAP
    server (since inband notifications are used when there is an IMAP
    connection).  Thus, it is helpful for the messaging system to be
    able to inform the notification mechanism when the user logs in or
    out, and which client is used (when this information is available).
    
    When Sieve is used, the Sieve engine might have access to this
    information.
    
    
5.3.  Notification payloads
    
    A message is generated by the message store as a result of a state
    change event.  This message may be delivered to the end user, a
    client, or to an external notification mechanism which might deliver
    an equivalent message to the user or to a client.
    
    Within the context of Lemonade profile (Figure 1), the event is
    filtered by NF.  That is, the Notification Filters logically
    determine which state change events cause notification to the user
    or client.
    
    Notifications allow for a rich end user experience.  This might
    include conveying mailbox status, new message attributes, etc., to
    the user or client independent of the client's connection to the
    mail store.
    
    Notifications also allow for different Message Waiting Indicator
    (MWI) behaviors (e.g., turn MWI indication off after all the
    messages in all the end user's mailboxes have been read, should such
    an unlikely thing occur in the real world).
    
    The payload of a notification might include a URL referring to the
    message which caused the event, possibly using URLAUTH [URLAUTH].
    
    
5.4.  Server to server notification protocol details
    
5.4.1.  Generic case

Internet Draft     Lemonade Notifications Architecture     February 2008


    Within the more general case of server to server notification, the
    payload may be an arbitrary text or binary message.
    
    In both cases the interaction model is defined as:
    
    1.   An event takes place in the message store
    2.  The event is filtered.  As a result it may be hidden or result
        in a notification.
    3.  The notification is a message in a particular payload that is
        prepared for the target notification mechanisms.
    4.  The payload is augmented with the necessary information to tell
        the notification mechanism how and where to send the
        notification.
    5.  The augmented payload is then formatted as required by the
        target notification mechanisms (i.e., the right format on the
        right port to be sent to the right address, possibly with an
        appropriate protocol binding, e.g., HTTP PUT) plus the
        information about where and how to send the notification.  This
        last step is imposed by the notification mechanisms and must be
        known by the notification generating filter.
        
    Different interfaces and bindings may be used depending on the
    notification channel.
    
    In the most general case, the mail system sends bulk state change
    events to an external notification mechanism, and it is the
    notification mechanism that filters the events by matching against
    the user's or client's preferences.
    
    In the most mail-specific case, the mail system performs the
    filtering itself, for example using Sieve.
    
    
5.5.  Event orders
    
    For lemonade profile bis, the event order is generally not
    important.  By including information such as the modification
    sequence identifier (called a modseq or mod-sequence) [CONDSTORE] in
    notifications, the receiving client can quickly and easily determine
    if it has already processed the triggering event (for example, if a
    notification arrives out of order, or if the client has
    resynchronized).
    
    For generic server to server notifications, the order is likely to
    matter and the messaging system needs to provide the notifications
    to the notification mechanism in the order that they are generated
    by mailbox events.

Internet Draft     Lemonade Notifications Architecture     February 2008


5.6.  Reliability
    
    For Lemonade profile bis, lost or delayed notifications to the
    client are tolerated.  A client can resynchronize its state
    (including that reported by any missing events) when it connects to
    the server.
    
    For generic server to server notifications, it is assumed that the
    data in a state change event is important, and therefore a high
    level of reliability is needed between the messaging system and any
    external notification mechanisms.
    
    
6.  Security Considerations
    
    Notification content (payload) needs to be protected against
    eavesdropping and alteration when it contains specific information
    from messages, such as the sender.
    
    Even when the content is trivial and does not contain
    privacy-sensitive information, guarding against denial of service
    attacks may require authentication or verification of the
    notification sender.
    
    Protocols which manipulate filters need mechanisms to protect
    against modification by as well as disclosure to unauthorized
    entities.  For example, a malicious entity might try to delete
    notifications the user wants, or try to flood the target device with
    notifications to incur usage charges, or prevent normal use.  In
    addition, the filters themselves might contain sensitive information
    or reveal interpersonal or inter-organizational relationships, as
    well as e-mail addresses.
    
    
7.  IANA Considerations
    
    None.

    version -07:
    o   Fixed bugs in NF arrows in Figure 1.
    o   Edited text following Figure 1 to try and make it more clear
        that NF can be either in the mail store (using Sieve) or in the
        notifications engine (using mechanisms out of scope to
        Lemonade).

    o   Added mention of filter protection to Security Considerations.
        
        
    version -06:
    o   Added pointer to profile-bis 5.4.2 ("External Notifications")
    o   Cleaned up references, split into Normative/Informative
    o   Reworded old Section 4 ("Event-based synchronization"), added
        NOTIFY and IDLE references
    o   Deleted Section 1 ("Conventions Used in this Document") as none
        of it applied any longer.
