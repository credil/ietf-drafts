1. Introduction

   It is no longer uncommon for a data center to have thousands of
   server racks.  Those thousands of server racks could be connected by
   multiple groups of aggregation switches, with each group connecting
   hundreds of ToR switches. For servers supporting virtualization,
   there could be a virtual switch embedded in each server.

   When TRILL is deployed in those data centers, there are issues no
   matter where RBridge domain boundary starts. If RBridge domain
   boundary starts at aggregation switch level, the RBridge's IS/IS
   routing scale well, but with the associated issues of allowing only
   one (AF port) of multiple ports connected to a bridged LAN for
   forwarding traffic and requiring each RBridge edge to maintain a

   very large table of MAC&VLAN<-> RBridgeEdge mapping. If the RBridge
   domain boundary starts closer to hosts, e.g. at the virtual switches
   on servers, the number of MAC&VLAN<->Edge mapping is much smaller
   because each virtual switch only needs to maintain the mapping for
   remote hosts which actually communicate with the embedded VMs. But
   then, the number of nodes in RBridge IS/IS domain is very large,
   making it not scale well especially on aggregation switches which
   need to advertise link state over hundreds of ports.

   [RBridge-directory] introduces a method for RBridge edge to get
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping from directory service in data center
   environment instead of flooding unknown DAs across TRILL domain.
   When directory is used, any nodes, even non-RBridge nodes, can
   perform the TRILL encapsulation. This draft is to demonstrate the
   benefits of non-RBridge nodes performing TRILL encapsulation.

3. Directory assistance on Non-RBridge

   With directory assistance [RBridge-Directory], a non-RBridge can
   determine if a packet should be forwarded across RBridge domain.
   Suppose RBridge domain boundary starts at network switches (i.e. not
   virtual switches embedded on servers), directory can assist Virtual
   Switches embedded in servers to encapsulate proper TRILL header if
   the data frames' targers are attached to different RBridge edges.

   When a TRILL encapsulated data packet reaches an ingress RBridge
   node, the ingress RBridge can simply forward the pre-encapsulated
   packet to the egress RBridge whose nickname is in the DA field of
   the TRILL header. By doing so, ingress RBridge will not receive
   packets with unknown DA, therefore, it won't need to flood received
   data packets to all other ports. That means there is no need to
   designate one AF port and all RBridge edge ports connected to one
   bridged LAN can receive and forward traffic, which greatly improves
   the overall network utilization.

   [RBridge] Section 4.6.2 Bullet 8 specifies that an RBridge port can
   be configured to accept both TRILL encapsulated frames from a
   neighbor that is not an RBridge.

   When data frames do not need to traverse RBridge domain, they are
   switched by all nodes/ports per IEEE802.1Q and RBridge edge will not
   forward native Ethernet frames across RBridge domain.

   When a TRILL frame arrives at an RBridge whose Nickname matches with
   the destination nickname in the frame, the processing is exactly
   same as regular RBridge, i.e. decapsulating the TRILL header of the
   received TRILL frame and forwarding the decapsulated Ethernet frame
   to the host attached to its edge ports.

   We call a node which only performs the TRILL encapsulation but
   doesn't participate in RBridge's IS/IS routing a ''TRILL
   Encapsulating node'' or ''Simplified RBridge''. The TRILL Encapsulating
   Node gets the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table pushed down or
   pulled from directory servers [RBridge-directory]. Upon receiving a
   native Ethernet frame, the TRILL Encapsulating Node checks the
   MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table, and perform the corresponding
   TRILL encapsulation if the entry is found in the mapping table. If
   the destination address and VLAN of the received Ethernet frame
   doesn't exist in the mapping table, the Ethernet frame is forwarded
   per IEEE802.1Q.

4. Source Nickname in frames encapsulated by non-RBridge nodes

   TRILL header includes Source RBridge's Nickname and Destination
   RBridge's Nickname. When a TRILL header is added by a non-RBridge
   node, using the Ingress RBridge edge node's nickname in the source
   address field will make the ingress RBridge node receive TRILL
   frames with its own nickname in the frames' source address field,
   which can be confusing.

   To avoid confusion of edge RBridges receiving TRILL encapsulated
   frames with its own nickname in the frames' source address field
   from neighboring non-RBridge nodes, a new nickname can be given to
   an RBridge edge node, e.g. Phantom Nickname, to represent all the
   TRILL Encapsulating Nodes attached to the RBridge edge node.

   When the Phantom Nickname is used in the Source Address field of a
   TRILL frame, it is understood that the TRILL encapsulation is
   actually done by a non-RBridge node which is attached to an edge
   port of an RBridge Ingress node.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation

    Virtual switches on servers, also known as hypervisors, are becoming
    more popular as server technology advances. It is relatively easier
    for virtual switches, which is usually software based switch, to get
    directory assistance and perform network address encapsulation.
    However, for a data center with very large number of servers, it
    doesn't scale to have all the servers to participate in RBridge's
    IS/IS routing.

    Therefore, we suggest TRILL to consider directory assisted non-
    RBridge encapsulation approach.
