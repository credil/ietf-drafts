    Mechanism to protect OSPFv2 authentication  from IP Layer Issues
             draft-bhatia-karp-ospf-ip-layer-protection-00

Abstract

   The IP header is not covered by the MAC in the cryptographic
   authentication scheme as described in RFC 2328 and RFC 5709, and an
   attack can be made to exploit this omission.  This draft proposes a
   simple change in how the authentication is computed to eliminate most
   of such attacks.

1.  Introduction

   The OSPFv2 [RFC2328] cryptographic authentication as described in
   [RFC2328] and later updated in [RFC5709] does not include the IP
   header.  This can be exploited to launch several attacks as the
   source address in the IP header is no longer protected.  The OSPF
   specification, in certain cases, requires the implementations to look
   at the source address carried in the IP header to determine the
   neighbor the packet was recieved from.  Changing the source address
   of a packet can thus, confuse the reciever which can be exploited to
   produce a number of denial of service attacks.
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-routing-protocols-crypto-issues].  If the packet is
   interpreted as coming from a different neighbor, the sequence number
   received from the neighbor may be updated.  This may disrupt
   communication with the legitimate neighbor.  Hello packets may be
   reflected to cause a neighbor to appear to have one-way
   communication.  Old Database descriptions may be reflected in cases
   where the per-packet sequence numbers are sufficiently divergent in
   order to disrupt an adjacency [I-D.hartman-ospf-analysis].

   [RFC2328] states that implementations MUST offer keyed MD5
   authentication.  It is likely that this will be deprecated in favor
   of the stronger algorithms described in [RFC5709] in future
   deployments.

   This draft proposes a simple change in the cryptographic
   authentication mechanism, as currently described in [RFC5709], to
   prevent such IP layer attacks.

2.  Cryptographic Authentication Mechanism in OSPFv2

   The overall cryptographic authentication process defined in [RFC5709]
   remains unchanged.  To reduce the potential for confusion, this
   section minimises the repetition of text from RFC 5709 and is
   incorporated here by reference [RFC5709].

   RFC 5709, Section 3.3, describes how the cryptographic authentication
   must be computed.  It requires OSPFv2 packet's Authentication Trailer
   (which is the appendage described in RFC 2328, Section D.4.3, Page
   233, items (6)(a) and (6)(d)) to be filled with the value Apad where
   Apad is a hexadecimal constant value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times,
   where L is the length of the hash being used and is measured in
   octets rather than bits.

3.  Proposed Enhancement

   This document updates the definition of Apad which is currently a
   constant defined in [RFC5709] to the source address thats carried in
   the IP header of the OSPFv2 protocol packet.  Routers at the sending
   side must initialize Apad to a value of the source address that would
   be used when sending out the OSPFv2 packet, repeated L/4 times, where
   L is the length of the hash, measured in octets.  The basic idea is
   to incorporate the source address from the IP header in the
   cryptographic authentication computation so that any change there can
   be detected.

   At the recieving end implementations MUST initialize Apad as the
   source address that exists in the IP Header of the incoming OSPFv2
   protocol packet, repeated L/4 times, instead of the constant that's
   currently defined in [RFC5709].  Besides changing the value of Apad
   this document does not introduce any other changes to the
   authentication mechanism described in [RFC5709].

   This would prevent all attacks where a rogue OSPF router changes the
   source address of the protocol packet and reflects it on some other
   interface as the authentication check would fail and all such packets
   would get rejected.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document enhances the security of OSPFv2 and provides a solution
   to prevent certain denial of service attacks that can be launched by
   changing the source address of the OSPFv2 protocol packet.  The
   proposal defined does not introduce any new security concerns.
