   Abstract

   Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and
   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities are MPLS-TP OAM
   requirements listed in [3].

   Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path
   for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors
   the integrity of the routing of the path between sink and source for
   any connectivity issues. RDI enables an End Point to report, to its
   associated End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on
   a PW, LSP or Section.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a protocol solution, meeting one or more
   functional requirement(s), be the same for PWs, LSPs and Sections as
   per [3].

   This document specifies methods for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for
   MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections using
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).

1. Introduction

   In traditional transport networks, circuits are provisioned on
   multiple switches. Service Providers (SP) need OAM tools to detect
   mis-connectivity and loss of continuity of transport circuits. MPLS-
   TP LSPs [11]emulating traditional transport circuits need to provide
   the same CC and proactive CV capabilities as mentioned in [3]. This
   document describes the use of BFD for CC, proactive CV, and RDI of an
   MPLS-TP LSP between two Maintenance End Points (MEPs).

   As described in [9], Continuity Check (CC) and Proactive Connectivity
   Verification (CV) functions are used to detect loss of continuity
   (LOC), unintended connectivity between two MEPs (e.g. mismerging or
   misconnection or unexpected MEP).

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is
   transmitted by a MEP to communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal
   fail condition exists. RDI is only used for bidirectional connections
   and is associated with proactive CC & CV packet generation.

   The main goal here is to specify the BFD extension and behavior to
   satisfy the CC, proactive CV monitoring and the RDI functionality.

   The mechanism specified in this document is restricted only to BFD
   asynchronous mode.

3. MPLS-TP CC, proactive CV and RDI Mechanism using BFD

   This document proposes two modes of BFD operation

   o CC mode: uses the existing ACH code point (0x0007) and BFD ACH
      packet encapsulation (BFD without IP/UDP headers ) as defined in
      [6]. In this mode Continuity Check and RDI functionalities are
      supported.

   o CV/CC mode: defines a new code point in the Associated Channel
      Header (ACH) described in [2]. Under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-
      TP LSP, the ACH with "MPLS-TP Proactive CV/CC" code point
      indicates that the message is an MPLS-TP BFD proactive CV and CC
      message.

   [2].

   MPLS-TP proactive CV/CC code point = 0xHH. [HH to be assigned by IANA
   from the PW Associated Channel Type registry.]

   In this mode Continuity Check, Connectivity Verifications and RDI
   functionalities are supported.

   Editor's Note:

   1) CV/CC mode require extension of CV types, foreseen by [4] and yet
      extended by [5], in order to include the MPLS-TP OAM mechanism
      too for PW Fault Detection only. This is due to the fact that
      VCCV also includes mechanisms for negotiating the control channel
      and connectivity verification (i.e. OAM functions) between PEs.

   2) Does also the CC mode for MPLS-TP require such extension ?

   3) Shall we trace that in this document ?

   EndofEditorNote

   Both CC and CV/CC modes apply to PWs, MPLS LSPs (including tandem
   connection monitoring), and Sections.

   It's possible to run the BFD in CC mode on some transport paths and
   the BFD in CV/CC mode on other transport paths. In any case, only one
   tool for OAM instance at time, configurable by operator, can run.  A
   MEP that is configured to support CC mode and receives CV/CC BFD
   packets, or vice versa, MUST consider them as an unexpected packet,
   i.e. detect a mis-connectivity defect.

   As shown in Figure 3, BFD Control packet as defined in [6] is
   transmitted as MPLS labeled packets along with ACH, ACH TLV Header
   defined in Section 3 of RFC 5586 and one ACH TLV object carrying the
   unique MEP Identifier of the source of the BFD packet defined in [12]

   When GAL label is used, the TTL field of the GAL MUST be set to at
   least 1, and the GAL will be the end of stack label.



3.3. BFD Session in MPLS-TP terminology

   A BFD session corresponds to a CC or a proactive CV/CC OAM instance
   in MPLS-TP terminology.

   A BFD session is enabled when the CC or proactive CV/CC functionality
   is enabled on a configured Maintenance Entity (ME).

   On a Sink MEP, an enabled bidirectional BFD session can be in DOWN,
   INIT or UP state as detailed in [6].

   On a Sink MEP, a unidirectional BFD session can be in UP or DOWN
   state as reported in [10].

   When on a ME the CC or proactive CV/CC functionality is disabled, the
   BFD session transits in the ADMIN DOWN State and the BFD session
   ends.

Internet-Draft     draft-asm-mpls-tp-bfd-cc-cv-02           March 2010


   A new BFD session is initiated when the operator enables or re-
   enables the CC or CV/CC functionality on the same ME.



3.4. BFD Profile for MPLS-TP

   BFD MUST run in asynchronous mode. In this mode, the BFD Control
   packets are periodically sent at configurable time rate.

   When on bidirectional path, associated or co-routed, it is required
   the BFD state be independent from the peer MEP BFD state, two
   unidirectional BFD sessions MUST be configured, one for each
   direction of the bidirectional path to be monitored; each MEP is
   aware of the relationship among the MEP source function and MEP sink
   function of the two unidirectional BFD sessions.

   This applies, for instance, when it is required to transmit the BFD
   control packet at a regular, operator configured rate and to maintain
   this rate at any BFD state in order to manage the 1+1 unidirectional
   protection.

   When it is required that both sessions on peer MEPs go in DOWN state
   if one goes in DOWN state, the bidirectional BFD session MUST be
   configured on the bidirectional using the three state machine and
   following the behavior detailed in [6].

   The unidirectional BFD on the sink MEP uses the two state machine
   defined in [10]. When running the unidirectional state machine the M
   bit MUST be always set to 1.

   On a Sink MEP, a BFD session is declared Down if one of the following
   defects identified by the proactive CC-CV functions occurs:

      - an unexpected globally unique Source MEP identifier is received
         (Mis-connectivity defect),

      - timer negotiation is disabled and the value of the received
         "Desired min TX Interval field" is different from the locally
         configured reception period, or the received value of the
         "DetectMult field" is different from the locally configured one
         (Period Mis-configuration defect);

      - BFD session times out (Loss of Continuity defect).

      - a Mis-connectivity defect SHOULD be also detected if an
      unexpected M bit value is received.

Internet-Draft     draft-asm-mpls-tp-bfd-cc-cv-02           March 2010




   The raising and clearing conditions of defects identified by the
   Continuity Check, proactive Connectivity Verification
   functionality and RDI MUST be as per [9] where a protocol
   constant set to 3,5 is used. This protocol constant corresponds
   to the BFD Detection Time multiplier that is RECOMMENDED to be
   set to value 3.



   Traffic MUST NOT be affected when proactive CV/CC or CC
   monitoring is enabled/disabled by an operator on a configured
   MEP or when a BFD session transits from one state to another;
   the blocking of traffic as consequent action MUST be driven only
   by a defect's consequent action as specified in [9] section
   5.1.2



   The diagram in Figure 4 provides an overview of the three state
   machine as defined in [6].

       Figure 5:  MEP Sink State Machine for unidirectional BFD


   State transitions on MEP Source of unidirectional BFD are
   administratively driven. On a Source MEP, when the CC, CV/CC
   functionality is enabled, the state machine transits from the ADMIN-
   DOWN State to UP State; vice-versa when the functionality is
   disabled.

   In both diagram, each arc represents the state of the remote
   system (as received in the State field in the BFD Control
   packet) or the occurrence of one or more of the following
   defect: Mis-connectivity, Period Misconfiguration, Loss of
   Continuity as previously detailed.

   As reported in [6], another state (AdminDown) exists so that the
   BFD session can be administratively put down indefinitely. In
   the above diagram transitions involving AdminDown state are
   deleted for clarity; further considerations are reported in
   section 3.4.1.



3.4.1. Administrative Down State

   The AdminDown state semantic is equivalent to disabling on a MEP
   the CC-CV proactive function.

   When the MEP source function is disabled, BFD Control packets
   SHOULD be sent in AdminDown state for a period equal
   to(bfd.DesiredMinTxInterval * bfd.DetectMult) in order to ensure
   that the remote system is aware of the state change.

   A MEP Sink receiving a BFD packet with AdminDown State MUST
   transit to the DOWN State and report the event to the operator.

   The MEP Sink receiving the BFD packet with AdminDown State
   SHOULD continue to monitor the path until the operator disables
   the CC or proactive CV monitoring on it.

   On bidirectional path, the MEP source function of the MEP
   receiving BFD packets in AdminDown state SHOULD continue to
   transmit BFD control packet until the operator disables the CC
   or proactive CV monitoring on it.

   Editor's Note: The behavior of the sink MEP needs further review and
will be updated in the next version of this document.


3.4.2. Timer negotiation

   When running unidirectional BFD, on unidirectional or bidirectional
   connection path, the timer negotiation does not apply.
   The configured BFD packet transmission period is carried into the
   ''Desired Min TX Interval field''. In a typical transport application
   today the period is the same in both directions; in this case, for
   Bidirectional BFD on p2p transport path the "Required Min RX Interval
   field" value is the same as "Desired Min TX Interval field" value.

   The source MEP of unidirectional BFD MUST set the "Required Min RX
   Interval field " to 0.

   The default timer values to be used based on what's recommended in
   [9].

3.4.3. Discriminator values

   MPLS labels at peer MEPs are used to provide context for the received
   BFD packets.

   In the BFD control packet the discriminator values have either local
   or no significance.

   My Discriminator field MUST be set to a nonzero value (it can be a
   fixed value), the transmitted your discriminator value MUST reflect
   back the received value of My discriminator field or be set to 0 if
   that value is not known.

   Your discriminator field is always set to 0 on Unidirectional BFD
   control packets.

3.5. Remote Detection Indication (RDI)

   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is an indicator that is transmitted by
   a MEP to communicate to its peer MEP that a signal fail condition
   exists.

   The BFD Diagnostic (Diag) field defined in [6] is used for this
   functionality.

   When a MEP detects mis-connectivity, or loss of continuity, or period
   misconfiguration defect, sends to its peer MEP the proactive CC,
   CV/CC BFD packet with the Diagnostic (Diag) field value set to 1.

   When a MEP receives the proactive CC, CV/CC BFD packet with the
   Diagnostic (Diag) field value set to 1, enters in the RDI defect
   conditions.

   A MEP exits from the RDI defect condition when it receives a
   proactive CC, CV/CC BFD packet with the RDI field clear,
   corresponding to receive Diagnostic(Diag) field with values different
   from 1.



4. Operation on bidirectional p2p connection

   For p2p bidirectional LSPs, both endpoints of the bidirectional MPLS-
   TP LSP MUST send BFD messages in-band in the MPLS-TP LSP using the
   defined code point.

   When on a configured bidirectional transport path the proactive CV/CC
   or CC monitoring is enabled, each MEP sends the BFD Control Packets
   at the rate of the configured transmission period and each MEP
   expects to receive the BFD packets from its peer MEP at the same rate
   as per [9].



4.1. Bidirectional BFD

   When on bidirectional path the bidirectional BFD is enabled, the
   behaviour SHOULD be as detailed in [6] for asynchronous BFD.

   Active role is the default behavior, passive role is optional.

   In Active role both MEPs start sending initial BFD Control Packets
   with the State field set to "Down" value and with "Your
   discriminator" field set to zero.

4.2. Unidirectional BFD

   When on bidirectional path it is required the BFD state be
   independent from the peer MEP BFD state, two unidirectional BFD
   sessions MUST be configured. Considering figure 6 below, an
   unidirectional BFD session is configured to monitor the direction
   from A to B and an unidirectional BFD session is configured to
   monitor the direction from B to A.

   On the unidirectional BFD session monitoring the A to B direction,
   the MEP source function is located on node A while the MEP sink
   function is located on node B.

   On the unidirectional BFD session monitoring the B to A direction,
   the MEP source function is located on node B while the MEP sink
   function is located on node A.



   o When the source function of an unidirectional BFD is enabled, the
      source MEP state machine transits from AdminDown State to UP state
      and starts sending BFD unidirectional control packets at the
      configured transmission rate with the M bit always set to 1, the
      State field set to "UP" and Diagnostic code set to zero (0).

   o If the MEP sink monitoring function, as the one on MEP-B in Figure
      8, detects one of the following faults: mis-connectivity, period
      misconfiguration, or loss of continuity defect it declares that
      the transport path in its receive direction is down and signals it
      to its peer MEP (MEP-A) sending the BFD control packet running on
      the unidirectional BFD from B to A with Diagnostic code set to 1
      (RDI); see figure 9 below. Besides, the MEP Sink SHOULD notify the
      equipment fault management process of the detected defect.

   Timer parameters are configured by the operator and statically
   provisioned or signaled by the control plane; the timer configured
   value are carried inside the BFD packets and this value never change
   unless modified by operator; the new timer configuration must be
   statically provisioned or signaled by the control plane.



 5. Unidirectional p2p or p2mp transport path.

   Unidirectional (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint) transport path
   are monitored through one unidirectional BFD session. The behavior
   and MPLS-TP profile is the same as described in previous section for
   unidirectional BFD except for RDI generation that is not required to
   be sent on unidirectional transport path.

8. Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further
   study.

   Base BFD foresees an optional authentication section (see [6]
   section 6.7); that can be extended also to the tool proposed in
   this document.

   Authentication methods that require checksum calculation on the
   outgoing packet must extend the checksum also on the ME
   Identifier Section. This is possible but seems uncorrelated with
   the solution proposed in this document: it could be better to
   use the simple password authentication method.
