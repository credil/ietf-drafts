Abstract

   This document defines an extension field for the CGA Parameter data
   structure specified in RFC 3972.  This extension field carries a
   Public Key that is used in Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA)
   generation.  This extension enables protocols using CGAs, such as
   SEND, to use multiple Public Key signing algorithms and/or multiple
   Public Keys.

Internet-Draft    Signature Algorithm Agility for CGAs     February 2009


1.  Introduction

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] have been
   designed primarily for securing Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971].  A
   digital signature algorithm is used to provide authentication and
   integrity protection when CGA is used.  CGAs [RFC3972] were defined
   to only use RSA as the associated signature algorithm.  Only one RSA
   public key is associated with a CGA and this public key is carried in
   the Public Key field of the CGA Parameter data structure.

   The secure neighbor discovery usage scenarios have recently been
   extended to include environments with mobile or nomadic nodes.  These
   nodes can often be limited in power and memory capabilities, and thus
   may only be able to support lightweight public key cryptography; that
   is, RSA-based public keys and algorithm support may not be feasible.

   Therefore, support for signature algorithm agility in CGA is desired.
   However, since the CGA specification [RFC3972] states that SEND
   "SHOULD" use an RSA public/private key pair, backward compatibility
   is preserved herein.

   A logical place for extending the CGA Parameter data structure to
   include other types of public keys is its "extension fields".  Some
   guidance on the format of these extensions is provided in [RFC4581].
   One type of CGA Parameter data structure extension is defined in
   Section 2 and this type of extension is able to carry public keys, in
   addition to the RSA public key defined in the Public Key field of CGA
   Parameters data structure.

   These extensions allows new functionnalities on CGA based protocols,
   such as the Signature Algorithm Agility in SEND
   [cheneau-send-sig-agility].

2.  Public Key extension

   This section describes an extension field that conforms to the
   guidelines of [RFC4581].

   This extension allows a CGA Parameters data structure to carry public
   keys in addition to the key in the Public Key field.  This approach
   paves the way for one CGA to possibly be associated with multiple
   public keys.

   This extension allows a node to select a Public Key value that is
   different from the one in the Public Key field of the CGA Parameters
   data structure option.  This Public Key is placed in an extension
   embedded in the Extension field of the CGA Parameters data structure,
   described in [RFC3972].

   Extension Type

      TBA. (16-bit unsigned integer.  See Section 5.)

   Extension Length

      The length of the Public Key field to follow, in octets. 16-bit
      unsigned integer.

   Public Key

      This is a variable-length field containing the public key of the
      sender.  The public key MUST be formatted as a DER-encoded
      [ITU.X690.2002] ASN.1 structure of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
      defined in the Internet X.509 certificate profile [RFC5280].  When
      RSA is used, the algorithm identifier MUST be rsaEncryption, which
      is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1, and the RSA public key MUST be formatted
      by using the RSAPublicKey type as specified in Section 2.3.1 of

      [RFC3279].  The RSA key length SHOULD be at least 384 bits.

      When ECC is used, the algorithm identifier MUST be of type id-
      ecPublicKey (OID 1.2.840.10045.2.1), as defined in [ID-pkix-ecc].
      ECC public key encoding is specified in this reference.  Note that
      the ECC key lengths are determined by the ECParameters field named
      namedCurves (curves implying key length).

3.  CGA Generation Process

   When a node supports two or more types of signing algorithms, and is
   able to generate two or more corresponding public keys, then it can
   derive a single CGA using all these keys.  The derivation is done
   exactly as in [RFC3972]; one key is placed in the CGA Parameters data
   structure "Public Key" field while the rest of the keys are placed in
   separate extension fields .  This is illustrated in Figure 2.

   It should be noted that the type of the public key (RSA, ECC, etc.)
   is already encoded into the "Public Key" field itself, and thus there
   is no need to identify the public key type separately.  This is due
   to the fact that the "Public Key" field, according to [RFC3972] is a
   DER-encoded ASN.1 structure of the type "SubjectPublicKeyInfo", and
   therefore includes a subfield called "AlgorithmIdentifier".

           Figure 2: CGA parameter structure with multiple keys

   The resulting CGA Parameters data structure is inserted into a CGA
   option as per [RFC3971].  When sending a NDP packet, the node
   includes this CGA option and also one signature option of choice,
   computed with a private key whose corresponding Public Key is present
   in the CGA Parameters data structure.  This signature option can be
   the RSA signature option as per [RFC3971], or another signature
   option, e.g. the ECC signature option as per [ID-csi-ecc], or any
   other signature defined.  The signature option contains the hash of
   the key used to sign the message.

   Note that an implementation should choose the number of simultaneous

   Public Key Extensions fields used so as the total length of the
   extension fields does not exceed a threshold that requires
   fragmentation support at the SEND or other upper-layer protocol
   layer.

   Support for RSA Public Keys and signature algorithm is only
   RECOMMENDED for backward compatibility.  This specification does not
   mandate support for any particular public key signature algorithm.
   Therefore, nodes can be configured to choose/support only a single
   additional signature algorithm besides RSA.  However, a node is also
   free to not support RSA and still claim compatibility with this
   specification.

   Since [RFC3972] mandates the use of RSA keys in the Public Key field,
   a node compatible with [RFC3972] only will extract the RSA public key
   from the Public Key field and ignore the extension fields.
   Therefore, in order to achieve backward compatibility, if a node uses
   a CGA associated with multiple public keys (through the use of the
   Public Key extension), the following procedures are in place: if one
   of the public keys is of RSA type, then that key SHOULD be placed in
   the Public Key field of the CGA Parameter data structure, while the
   other key(s) SHOULD be placed in the Extension field(s).

4.  Security Consideration

   The document specifies a CGA extension field format.  No additional
   vulnerabilities appear besides those described in section 7 of
   [RFC3972]

   However , it should be noted that the resulting security level of a
   multiple-key CGA is only that of the weakest key.  Therefore, the
   requirement remains that every key in use should have a security
   level matching or exceeding that of a 384-bit RSA key.

   Whenever protocols negotiate signature algorithms, downgrade attacks
   are considered.  This document only provides the ability for CGA
   options to carry multiple public keys; negotiations of signature
   algorithms or public keys are out of the scope of this document.
