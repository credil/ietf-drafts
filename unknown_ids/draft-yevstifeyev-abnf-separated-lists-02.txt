INTERNET DRAFT     ABNF Notation for Separated Lists    December 8, 2010


1.  Introduction

   ABNF does not provide the possibility to express the separated lists
   of elements via specific construction. If it is needed (generally for
   defining HTTP headers or human-readable forms), the following ABNF
   construction is used:

   (*LWS element n*m(*LWS separator *LWS element))

   It is obvious that this construction is too simplified and bulky.
   This document specifies universal ABNF notation for lists, separated
   by arbitrary specified characters.

1.1.  Conventions

   This document uses ABNF notation and core rules defined in RFC 5234
   [RFC5234]. The construction in {} is used for expressing arithmetic
   expressions. For instance, if a=2, b=3 and c={b-a}, c is 1. In this
   case c=1*DIGIT.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT     ABNF Notation for Separated Lists    December 8, 2010


2.  Notation Description

   The ABNF notation for separated lists is <n>^(<a>)<m>element
   indicating at least <n> and at most <m> elements separated by <a> and
   OPTIONAL linear-white-spaces.

   The ABNF for this construction is:

                    ;if n>=1
   n^(a)m element = ( *LWS element n_1*m_1(*LWS a *LWS element) 
                    ;if n=0
   n^(a)m element = ( *m_1(*LWS element *LWS a) f(element))  
   n              = *DIGIT     ;minimum amount of elements, which MUST 
                               ;be used
   m              = *DIGIT     ;maximum amount of elements, which MAY be
                               ;used
   u              = 1*DIGIT    ;the number of used elements
   n_1            = {n-1}
   m_1            = {m-1}
   a              = VCHAR / SP / HT
   f              = {(u-(u-1)+1):2} ;will be 0 if no elements are used 
                                    ;and 1 if at least one element is
                                    ;used.

   <n> MAY be omitted indicating that any amount of elements not more
   than <m> is allowed (including zero).

   <m> MAY be omitted indicating that any amount of elements not less
   than <n> is allowed (including <n>).

   <n> and <m> MAY be omitted indicating that any amount of elements is
   allowed (including zero).

2.1. Examples

   The section contains a few examples of using the defined
   construction.

   1^(";")3element indicates the list of elements separated by
   semicolons (";") and OPTIONAL linear-white-spaces which consists of
   at least 1 and at most 3 elements.

   1^(SP)element indicates the list of elements separated by spaces and
   OPTIONAL linear-white-spaces which consists of any amount of elements
   but not less than 1.

   ^(",")3element indicates the list of elements separated by commas
   (",") and OPTIONAL linear-white-spaces which consists of any amount

   of elements but not more than 3 (including zero).

   ^(-)element indicates the list of elements separated by hyphens ("-")
   and OPTIONAL linear-white-spaces which consists of any amount of
   elements (including zero).
