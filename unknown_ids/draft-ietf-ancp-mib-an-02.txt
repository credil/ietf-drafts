Internet-Draft                  ANCP MIB                      April 2008


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing access nodes as described in [ANCPFW] that are
   using the Access Node Control Protocol defined in [ANCPPR].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB
   modules that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Overview

   In [ANCPFW], the framework for the Access Node Control Protocol
   (ANCP) is described.  It defines 2 network entities, the Access Node
   (AN) and the Network Access Server (NAS), between which ANCP sessions
   are established.  The detailed protocol specification of ANCP is
   described in [ANCPPR].  This document specifies a MIB module for an
   AN that supports ANCP, and a MIB module that defines textual
   conventions.

   Note: the current MIB definition is specific for [ANCPPR].  If
   [ANCPPR] gets updated later, then the MIB definition in this document
   will also follow these changes.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   Two new textual convention, GsmpSubVersion and
   AncpSessionCapabilities, are defined in a seperate MIB module in this
   document.  The ANCP specification in [ANCPPR] is re-using the GSMP
   specification in [RFC3292] where the GSMP subversion is introduced.
   The textual conventions defined in this document complement the
   textual conventions defined in [RFC3295], GsmpVersion, GsmpNameType,
   and GsmpPartitionIdType, which are also used in the ANCP MIB module
   for ANs.  These textual conventions are used for the convenience of
   humans reading the MIB.

5.2.  The ANCP MIB module Subtree

   ANCP-TC-MIB is the first MIB module defined in this document, and
   this MIB module defines ancpMIB under mib-2.  ANCP-TC-MIB is put
   under ancpMIB, as well as ANCP-AN-MIB, the second MIB module defined
   in this document.

5.3.  The Notifications Subtree

   Notifications are defined to inform the management station about
   state changes of ANCP sessions, whenever an ANCP session changes
   state.  Two notifications are defined for this purpose.  The
   notification ancpAnSessionUp is to inform the management station when
   the session comes up, and the notification ancpAnSessionDown is to
   inform when the ANCP session is down again after it was up before.

   Attributes are introduced to enable and disable the generation of
   these notifications per ANCP session.  No other special measures for
   congestion avoidance for the notifications are needed because the
   number of ANCP sessions in an access node is typically small.  In
   addition, establishing an ANCP session and tearing down it again,
   takes some time such that for a particular ANCP session, not many
   notifications in a short time period can be generated.

5.4.  The Table Structures

   The ANCP MIB module for the AN has 3 tables.  The tables are the
   following:

   o  ancpAnSessionConfigTable

      This table is used to configure ANCP sessions at the AN towards a
      specific NAS.  The NAS is identified by a number of attributes in
      this table (ancpAnSessionConfigNasIpAddressType and



De Cnodder & Morgenstern  Expires October 30, 2008              [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  ANCP MIB                      April 2008


      ancpAnSessionConfigNasIpAddress).  The other attributes in this
      table can be used to configure properties that are specific for
      that particular ANCP session.  Also the interface to which the
      ANCP session is bound, is also configured in this table.  This
      interface can be an IP interface, an ATM PVC, a VLAN (or VLAN
      stack), or any other interface defined in IF-MIB.

   o  ancpAnCurrentSessionTable

      This table shows the operational state of a particular ANCP
      session.  Each session configured in ancpAnSessionConfigTable has
      a corresponding row in ancpAnCurrentSessionTable.  When a session
      is configured or deleted in the ancpAnSessionConfigTable, then the
      corresponding row of that session in the ancpAnCurrentSessionTable
      is, respectively, automatically created or deleted.

   o  ancpAnInterfaceConfigTable

      This table is used to assign interfaces to particular partitions
      if partitions are being used as indicated by the scalar
      ancpAnPartitionsUsed.  When partitions are used, a row in this
      table is created automatically when an interface is created in the
      ifTable of the IF- MIB [RFC2863] for which the system supports
      ANCP.

   Four groups are defined:

   o  ancpAnConfigGroup

      This group contains all objects of the ancpAnSessionConfigTable in
      which the ANCP sessions are configured in the access node.

   o  ancpAnCurrentGroup

      This group contains all objects of the ancpAnCurrentSessionTable
      where the operational state and other information of the ANCP
      sessions are shown.

   o  ancpAnInterfaceGroup

      This group contains all objects to configure interfaces to be used
      by ANCP.  Assigning interfaces to particular partitions is part of
      this group in case partitions are used.

   o  ancpAnNotificationsGroup

      This group contains the notifications that indicate state changes
      of ANCP sessions.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces Group MIB module

   There is a dependency between the ANCP MIB module and the Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) defined in [RFC2863].  The ifIndex defined in the
   ifTable of IF-MIB is used as the index of the
   ancpAnInterfaceConfigTable defined in the ANCP MIB module for access
   nodes.  Each time that an entry is created in the ifTable for which
   the system supports ANCP (e.g., in a DSLAM this is typically for each
   DSL line), a row is created automatically in the
   ancpAnInterfaceConfigTable if partitions are being used.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The ANCP TC MIB module requires following MIB modules for IMPORTS:

   o  SNMPv2-SMI defined in [RFC2578]
   o  SNMPv2-TC defined in [RFC2579]

   The ANCP MIB module for access nodes requires following MIB modules
   for IMPORTS:

   o  SNMPv2-SMI defined in [RFC2578]
   o  RMON2-MIB defined in [RFC4502]
   o  IF-MIB defined in [RFC2863]
   o  INET-ADDRESS-MIB defined in [RFC4001]
   o  SNMPv2-CONF defined in [RFC2580]
   o  GSMP-MIB defined in [RFC3295]
   o  SNMPv2-TC defined in [RFC2579]
   o  Q-BRIDGE-MIB defined in [RFC4363]
   o  ANCP-TC-MIB defined in this document

             "This object allows the manager to specify whether or not
              to use the 'Partition ID' field in the GSMP message
              header.  When set to 'false' the application does not
              use partitions and the ancpAnSessionConfigPartitionId
              object MUST be zero for all sessions.  In addition, rows
              SHOULD not be created in the ancpAnInterfaceConfigTable.
              When set to 'true' the application uses partitions and
              the ancpAnSessionConfigPartitionId object MUST be set,
              for every session, to a nonzero value.  In such a case,
              rows are created in ancpAnInterfaceConfigTable.  The
              default value zero in ancpAnInterfaceConfigPartitionId
              object means that the operator did not associate the
              interface with a particular partition.  Note that
              modifying the value of this object is restricted.
              E.g., prior to setting it from 'true' to 'false'
              ancpAnSessionConfigRowStatus objects for all sessions
              should be set to notInService and the partition ID value

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

Internet-Draft                  ANCP MIB                      April 2008


   o  ancpAnPartitionsUsed

      This scalar object supports SET operations.  Unauthorized changes
      to this object could result in a wrong interpretation of
      ancpAnSessionConfigPartitionId attribute of all sessions, as if
      all sessions use partition id zero, or to actually disabling the
      use of partitions in the system.

   o  ancpAnSessionConfigTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  ancpAnSessionConfigRowStatus
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigGsmpVersion
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigGsmpSubVersion
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigEncapsulationType
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigCapabilities
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigAliveTimer
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigPortReportShaper
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigAggregateReportShaper
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigTransportRetryTimer
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigAncpRetryTimer
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigAnName
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigPartitionId
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigWindowSize
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigRelatedInterface
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigRelatedEntity
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigSvid
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigSPrio
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigCvid
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigCPrio
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigNasIpAddressType
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigNasIpAddress
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigEncapPortNumber
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigNotifyDnEnable
      *  ancpAnSessionConfigNotifyUpEnable

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigRowStatus could result
      in session being created or brought into service prematurely; or
      could result in session being inadvertently deleted or taken out
      of service.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigGsmpVersion or
      ancpAnSessionConfigGsmpSubVersion could have an adverse
      operational effect by limiting the GSMP version to be used in the
      context of this session or enabling a GSMP version number that is
      actually unsupported by the access node.

Internet-Draft                  ANCP MIB                      April 2008


      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigEncapsulationType could
      have an adverse operational effect by configuring the session to
      use an undesired or even unsupported protocol.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigCapabilities could have
      an adverse operational effect by disabling certain ANCP
      capabilities that the operator assumed that are enabled, or enable
      a capability that the operator would not like to activate.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigAliveTimer could have
      an adverse operational effect by increasing the frequency of
      adjacency protocol messages generated by the access node and
      leading to an overload of such messages.  Decreasing the frequency
      of such messages may harm the synchronization between the access
      node and the NAS.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigPortReportShaper or
      ancpAnSessionConfigAggregateReportShaper could have an adverse
      operational effect by increasing the frequency of Event Report
      messages generated by the access node and leading to an overload
      of such messages.  Decreasing the frequency of such messages may
      delay the responsiveness of the system to events associated with
      one or more ports.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigTransportRetryTimer
      could have an adverse operational effect by increasing the
      frequency of transport connection setup attempts initiated by the
      access node or even unexpectedly enabling the access node to
      initiate the transport connection setup when that supposed to be
      disabled.  Alternatively, when the operator basically planned
      transport connection setup attempts by the access node
      unauthorized changes to the attribute may cause unexpected low
      frequency of such attempts or unexpectedly disable those attempts.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigAncpRetryTimer could
      have an adverse operational effect by increasing the frequency of
      ANCP connection setup attempts initiated by the access node or
      even unexpectedly enabling the access node to initiate the ANCP
      connection setup when that supposed to be disabled.
      Alternatively, when the operator basically planned ANCP connection
      setup attempts by the access node unauthorized changes to the
      attribute may cause unexpected low frequency of such attempts or
      unexpectedly disable those attempts.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigAnName could confuse
      the NAS, e.g., by detecting the same name from multiple access
      nodes.  This may also override the operator's will to allow/avoid
      the access node to autonomously determine its name.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigPartitionId could mean
      that partitions are used when actually they are not, or vice
      versa.  It could also al least specify a different partition ID
      than the one actually associated with the session.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigWindowSize are not
      directly harmful.  However, if the controller adopts the suggested
      wrong window size it may either cause the controller to send too
      many messages in a window or unnecessarily limit itself and that
      could reduce the system performance.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigRelatedInterface and/or
      ancpAnSessionConfigRelatedEntity and/or ancpAnSessionConfigSvid
      and/or ancpAnSessionConfigCvid can result in the ANCP packets to
      be sent out on the wrong interface.  This means that the ANCP
      packets to establish a session can be received by someone who is
      not the intended receiver.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigSPrio and/or
      ancpAnSessionConfigCPrio may give the ANCP packets a lower or a
      higher priority in the network compared to other packets.
      Lowering the priority might result in a reduced timely behavior of
      the ANCP session, and increasing the priority may result in
      impacting other traffic in the network than ANCP.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigNasIpAddressType and/or
      ancpAnSessionConfigNasIpAddress and/or
      ancpAnSessionConfigEncapPortNumber could produce a wrong address
      type (interpretation) and/or IP address for the NAS and/or specify
      a wrong transport protocol port number for the session,
      respectively.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigNotifyDnEnable could
      lead (if the change was setting the attribute to 'enable') to
      overload of notification messages at the SNMP manager in case
      multiple sessions leave the 'estab' state simultaneously.  If the
      change was setting the attribute to 'disable' it could lead to
      hiding the actual session state from the SNMP manager.

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnSessionConfigNotifyUpEnable could
      lead (if the change was setting the attribute to 'enable') to
      overload of notification messages at the SNMP manager in case
      multiple sessions enter the 'estab' state simultaneously.  If the
      change was setting the attribute to 'disable' it could lead to
      hiding the actual session state from the SNMP manager.

   o  ancpAnInterfaceConfigTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  ancpAnInterfaceConfigPartitionId

      Unauthorized changes to ancpAnInterfaceConfigPartitionId could
      result in a wrong association between the interface and a
      partition.  It could result in not being able to manage the
      interface from the correct session and/or to exposing the
      interface to a wrong NAS.


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  This is the table and these are the objects
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  ancpAnCurrentSessionTable

      Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain
      information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the
      network.  Further, such information is considered sensitive in
      many environments for competitive reasons.

      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionState
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionGsmpVersion
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionGsmpSubVersion
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionAnName
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionNasName
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionAnIpAddressType
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionAnIpAddress
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionAnInstance
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionNasInstance
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionCapabilities
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionStartUptime
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionDiscontinuityTime
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionStatSentMessages
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionStatReceivedValidMessages
      *  ancpAnCurrentSessionStatDiscardedMessages

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
