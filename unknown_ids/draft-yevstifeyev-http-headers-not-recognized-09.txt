INTERNET DRAFT      Headers-Not-Recognized for HTTP    December 15, 2010


1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation

   HTTP is one of the most widely-used protocols in the Internet. One of
   the things which made it so popular is extensibility. One can easily
   add any header to the HTTP message. However, all hosts are not able
   to support all the HTTP headers. Generally, if a it does not
   recognize the header, it is simply ignored. The another side of
   exchange is not notified about not processed headers.

   This document proposes mechanism which allows servers to notify HTTP
   hosts about not recognized headers.

   The proposal is to send a response with definite header to the client
   if one or more headers of request were not processed. This document
   defines Headers-Not-Recognized HTTP header to be used in such
   occasion.

1.2. Conventions

   HTTP refers to protocol, defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616]

1.2.1. Conformance Criteria

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.2. Syntax Notation

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234].

   The construction <n>#<m>element is used as defined in RFC 2616
   [RFC2616], Section 2.1.

1.2.3. Terminology

   The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
   the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification ([RFC2616], Section
   1.3).

   The term host means client or server.

2. Technical Overview

2.1 Model of Work

   If the HTTP host receives HTTP packet which contains some headers
   which are not supported by it, it is RECOMMENDED for it to include
   the Headers-Not-Recognized header in the response. Information about
   not supported headers is to be put in this header following the rules
   of Section 2.2 of this document. The Headers-Not-Recognized header
   MUST contain information only about not supported headers - i.e.
   headers which are not able to be processed anyway. It MUST NOT
   contain information about headers, which are partly supported, not
   intended to be used or whose entity cannot be processed while the
   header is supported at all etc.

   When HTTP host receives HTTP packet with Headers-Not-Recognized
   header, it is RECOMMENDED that it avoids sending packets with headers
   with mentioned in it names or tries to change them so that it is able
   to recognize and process them.

   Intermediate systems (also called middle-boxes), such as proxies,
   tunnels, gateways etc. MUST transfer the packets with Headers-Not-
   Recognized field to the destination host without changing the entity
   of this header if the unrecognized header had been present in the
   initial HTTP request (i. e. request which intermediate system
   received before transferring it to destination node), but SHOULD omit
   it if Headers-Not-Recognized header entity concerns to header added
   to initial request by middle-box. If the aforementioned header
   concerns added headers partly, middle-box SHOULD change the entity so
   that it concerns only initial request headers.

2.2 Syntax

   'Headers-Not-Recognized' header field has the following format:

   headers_not_recognized = 1#header_name
   header_name            = 1*VCHAR

3. IANA Considerations

   The permanent message header field registry should be updated with
   the following registration:

   Header field name: Headers-Not-Recognized

   Applicable protocol: http

   Status: experimental

   Specification document: RFC xxxx

   [RFC Editor: replace xxxx with assigned RFC number]
   [Note: This registration should take place at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html
   This note is to be deleted upon publication.]

4. Security Considerations

   This extension to HTTP is not believed to add any additional security
   concerns not already present in RFC 2616 [RFC2616].
