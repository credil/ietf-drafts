Internet-Draft      Route Configuration by DHCPv6           March 2009 
    

   For hosts with multiple interfaces, the problem is how to make it run 
   several applications simultaneously on variant interfaces such as 
   GPRS, Wifi etc. To achieve this, one key issue here is to select 
   appropriate route according to RFC 1122. The approach presented in 
   this document is extending DHCPv6 option to configure route tables of 
   the hosts.

1. Introduction 

   A host such as a laptop or a smart-phone may have multiple interfaces 
   for connections, e.g., a wired Ethernet LAN, a 802.11 LAN, a 3G cell 
   network, one or multiple VPNs or tunnels. In view of more and more 
   versatile applications, users may expect a host to utilize several 
   interfaces at the same time.   

   If the source IP address is selected and bind by an application, then 
   the application can use certain interface in this way. However, 
   source IP addresses are generally added by sockets in IP layer. 
   According to [RFC 1122], all the packets whose destination IP 
   addresses is not specified in the route table will be send to a 
   default gateway for forwarding. Accordingly, the IP address 
   corresponding to the default gateway is chosen as the source IP 
   address. 

   To avoid all packets passing through the same interface corresponding 
   to the default gateway, the approach in this document configures 
   certain routes in route tables of hosts. The configuration 
   information is sent through extending DHCPv6 option.

Internet-Draft      Route Configuration by DHCPv6           March 2009 
    

   In [RFC 4191], multiple default routers and specific routes are used 
   to handle multi-homed scenarios. To address multi-homed problems in a 
   flexible way, [I-D-hui-mif-dhcpv4-routing-00] extends DHCPv4 through 
   introducing TOS and specific routes into DHCP options. This document 
   considers IPv6 situations. Similar approach was presented in [I-D-
   dec-dhcpv6-route-option-00] where TOS and metrics information have 
   not been involved. 

2. Solution of Multiple Interface Usage 

   The procedures of configuring routing information and selecting 
   interface are depicted in Figure 1. 

   The routing configure procedures are shown as steps a1 to a3. 

   o a1) An interface sends Information-requirement when the connection 
      is established or when an existing connection receives 
      reconfiguration message from the server. 

   o a2) The server sends routing information through DHCPv6 option as 
      to be defined in Section 3.2. 

   o a3) The routing information received from the interface is used to 
      configure the routing table of the host. 

   The procedures that an application employs an interface for network 
   access are depicted in Figure 1 as steps b1 to b4. 

   o b1) An application calls sockets to build IP packets. 

   o b2) The socket selects source address based on the routing table. 

   o b3) The socket sends packets to the corresponding interface. 

   o b4) The interface will forward the packets to the next hop (the 
      corresponding gateway).

                       interface for an application. 

   Notice that the approach proposed in this document is feasible under 
   the strong ES model as defined in RFC1122.  

3. DHCPv6 Option Extensions 

3.1. Host and Server Behavior 

   The host must include "Option Request" option to let the server know 
   the option the host interested. The request option code is set as the 
   "Route Information" defined in 3.2. 

   The server constructs a Reply message to provide route information to 
   the host.  Also, a server may send a Reconfigure Message to a host. 
   The host may initiate a request when receiving the Reconfigure 
   message for the host. 

3.2. Route Information Option 

   The DHCPv6 option is extended to contain multiple pieces of route 
   information. Each piece of route information contains TOS, metric, 
   destination IP address and the next hop IP address. The ROUTE_INFO 
   option is depicted in Figure 2.

3.3. Some Considerations of the DHCPv6 Option 

3.3.1. Conflict of Route Rules 

   For the situations where a route option conflicts with one previous 
   route rules, the latter one will override the previous rule. 

3.3.2. Application Situations 

   There are two situations when DHCPv6 is applied, i.e., with or 
   without stateless autoconfiguration.  For the stateless case, since 
   the address has been configured based on the link-local/site-local 
   address, the DHCPv6 is used to obtain options. 

3.3.3. Not Limited to DHCP Servers 

   The solution presented in this document is with the context of DHCP 
   message. It should be pointed out that similar message may not be 
   conveyed by certain node in the network instead of a DHCP server. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   The option code of ROUTE RULE will be defined by IANA. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security issues in this document are similar with those that have 
   been met when using DHCPv6 options. 

   The interface selection is affected by the routing and address 
   selection rules sent from servers. Therefore, incorrect information 
   received by hosts will cause improper interface selection leading to 
   bad user experiences. Attacks such as deny of services (DoS) or man-
   in-the-middle may redirect host's solicitation, change the 
   information or flood the host with invalidate messages. Approaches to 
   guarantee the communication securities between hosts and servers 
   should be applied based on the network access types of the interfaces.
