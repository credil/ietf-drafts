    <abstract>
      <t>A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-based prefix for DKIM ADSP records
        that allow domains in the From header to authorize acceptable third-party signatures. This
        scheme allows autonomously and unilaterally authorizations for a range of third-party
        domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions. The extended scope of DKIM signing
        practice assertions supplant more difficult to administer transparent authorization schemes.
        Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate coordination
        between two or more domains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone
        delegations, and/or a regular exchange of public/private keys.</t>

      <t>Checking TPA-Label Resource Records for signing practices may infrequently occur when a
        message is not compliant with a restrictive ADSP polices where an Author Domain Signature is
        either missing or invalid. When a third-party signature is found, TPA-Label Resource Record
        transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains to authorize specific third-party
        signing domains. Recipients are afforded a method to determine whether authorization exists
        in situations where other modes of authorization are impractical. TPA-Label Resource Records
        permit Author Domain a means to selectively influence message handling, for messages
        otherwise lacking valid Author Domain signatures.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Sharing a number of details between the domain owner, and one or more providers of email
        and DNS represents a transparent method for DKIM authorization. Since there are many ways in
        which such authorizations could be accomplished, it is unlikely standardized formats will be
        developed to exchange necessary, and at times, sensitive information. In addition, when
        there is a security breach and authorization is transparent, the wrong party might be held
        accountable for content they may have never seen nor logged. The TPA-Label Resource Record
        scheme is a simple authorization method that keeps visible which administrative entity
        signed a message and whether an Author Domain authorized the signature. The authorization
        record may also impose additional header requirements.</t>

      <t>Tens of thousands of domains of various financial institutions are frequently being
        phished. Phishing creates a nuisance for those who aren't expecting these messages, and a
        threat for those who then interact with them. Whenever institutions employ DKIM and utilize
        various third-party services, the integrity of their Author Domain Signature might be
        affected. Some assert less stringent Author Domain Signing Policies on sub-domains to
        accommodate the affect of third-party services, as suggested by <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dkim-mailinglists"/> section 4.1, that recommends the use of sub-domains
        to assert less restrictive ADSP policies.</t>

      <t>Although, ADSP as currently structured does not offer a good alternative, such a strategy
        increases those who will be deceived by phish. This is because people often do not
        understand the significance of URI hierarchy, and become confused or insensitive to domain
        changes. APWG phishing trends, <xref target="apwg-globalphishingsurvey-2H2009"/> page 18,
        indicates phishing commonly uses subdomains in the URL to fool potential victims.</t>

      <t>Ensuring third-party inclusion of Sender or List-ID headers enhanced sorting strategies to
        further improve protections. Users who sort messages based upon email domains are less
        susceptible to look-alike phish attempts when acceptance is based upon valid Author Domain
        Signatures. However, when sub-domains assert less stringent policies, these messages might
        be combined with those having more stringent policies when sorting is based upon the parent
        domain. Consistently using the same domain avoids confusion that might be exploited. </t>

      <t>ADSP represents an open registry offering domain specific guidance for DKIM acceptance
        criteria, when determining whether messages should be delivered, refused or discarded.
        However, appropriate actions are unclear whenever third-party services are involved. For
        example, it is not clear whether ADSP "dkim=all" assertions include third-party services
        that could damage Author-Domain signatures. Although ADSP warns of a potential for
        disruption, specific handling recommendations are limited to "dkim=discardable". Although
        administrative domains asserting all of their outbound messages are signed offer significant
        forensic value, the handling for messages lacking an Author Domain Signature with a
        "dkim=all" remain unclear.</t>

      <t>This document describes how any Author Domain publishing ADSP records defined in <xref
          target="RFC5617"/>, can autonomously authorize DKIM signatures <xref target="RFC4871"/>
        (updated by <xref target="RFC5672"/>) by specific third-party domains. TPA-Label listed
        domains offer secondary signing practices for additional ADSP compliance options whenever no
        Author Domain Signature is present within the message. The intended purpose of TPA-Label
        Resource Records is to improve acceptance rates of genuine messages, to minimize domain use,
        to minimize success rates for phishing, and to minimize recipient's administrative
        costs.</t>

      <t>TPA-Label Resource Records authorize third-party signing domains to extend DKIM compliance
        options for signing practices defined by <xref target="RFC5617"/>. TPA-Label listed domains
        are to be considered equivalent to the authorizing Author Domain when assessing compliance
        with DKIM signing practices. The TXT resource records associated with TPA-Label start with
        the 'dkim' tag as defined by <xref target="RFC5617"/> for signing practices, and may contain
        tags specifically defined for TPA-Label Resource Records.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="TPA-Label Listed Domain">
          <t>TPA-Label Listed Domain, TPA-LLD, is a domain TXT resource record that can be
            referenced with a TPA-Label within an Author Domain. When a "tpa" tag exists within the
            TXT resource record located at the TPA-Label, the referenced domain must be within a
            listed domain. When this tag does not exist, the referenced domain is presumed listed.
            The "scope" tag provides the TPA-LLD authorization which may stipulate additional
            headers or other email elements before being authorized to act on behalf of the Author
            Domain publishing the TPA-Label Resource Record.</t>

            field, is the domain name referenced in the TPA-Label Resource Record published by the
            Author Domain with a scope of 'F', 'S', or 'L' when the List-ID is within the TPA-LLD.

    <section title="Combinatorial ADSP &quot;dkim=&quot; Values.">
      <t>This document defines new values listed with the ADSP "dkim" tag in addition to those
        defined in <xref target="RFC5617"/> section 4.2.1. These values can append to those
        currently defined. It is not recommended to use any new value in conjunction with
        "discardable", because when not understood, a message handled by an authorized third-party
        might become lost.</t>

      <section title="tpa-sig">
        <t>The ADSP dkim= value "tpa-sig" indicates that TPA-Labels will offer a comprehensive list
          of authorized third-party services that must add DKIM signatures. When this value is
          "dkim=all tpa-sig" and the DKIM signature has been authorized by a TPA-Label Resource
          Record with the scope of 'F', 'S', or 'L', then such signatures are in compliance with the
          Author Domain's asserted Signing Policies. However when there is no valid Author Domain
          Signature and the DKIM signature is not listed with an 'F', 'S', or 'L' scope, the Author
          Domain recommends these messages be refused.</t>
        <t/>
      </section>

      <section title="tpa-path">
        <t>The ADSP dkim= value "tpa-path" indicates that TPA-Labels will offer a comprehensive list
          of authorized third-party services. When this value is "dkim=all tpa-path" and the DKIM
          signature has been authorized by a TPA-Label Resource Record with the scope of 'F', 'S',
          or 'L', then such signatures are in compliance with the Author Domain's asserted Signing
          Policies.</t>

        <t>The "tpa-path" is used to accommodate third party services lacking DKIM signatures, the
          confirmed path of the message determined by either the client host name (EHLO/HELO) or the
          return path (Mail From). The permitted path element's domain is authorized by a TPA-Label
          Resource Record with the scope of 'H' or 'M' respectively. Such messages are then in
          compliance with the Author Domain's asserted Signing Policies. The leaf of the host name
          (left most label) may need to be omitted when checking for TPA-Label Resource Record
          authorization. When no scope is included in conjunction with a "tpa-path" policy, there is
          no requirement that the referenced element's domain be confirmed. </t>

        <t>When there is no valid Author Domain Signature and the DKIM signature is not listed with
          an 'F', 'S', or 'L' scope, or TPA-Label Resource Record with the scope of 'H' or 'M' where
          the path elements of the path can not be confirmed or is not listed, the Author Domain
          recommends these messages be refused.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="TPA-Label Resource Record Authorization Considerations">
      <t>When an Author Domain is not within the DKIM signing domain, the TPA-LLD scheme can extend
        ADSP signing practice compliance. The TPA-LLD scheme with an 'F', 'S', or 'L' scope permits
        a contained Third Party Signature to be treated as a Author Domain Signature. This allows
        Author Domains a means to extend restrictive policy compliance. The TPA-LLD scheme for
        offering valid signatures only requires that DNS publications be made by the Author Domain,
        even when signing domains and the Author Domain differ. This approach avoids the need to
        exchange DKIM key related information.</t>

      <t>Extended authorization will not ensure all possible spoofing is prevented. However, by
        permitting broader use of restrictive policies, this should generally reduce the level of
        spoofing. Authorized third party messages should not receive annotations that indicate the
        message contains authenticated identities. When the TPA-LLD scope include 'S' or 'L', the
        messages should contain the headers Sender and List-ID headers respectively with domains
        that are within the TPA-LLD.</t>

      <t>The TPA-LLD scheme plays the role of only providing acceptable signatures or services which
        might be suitable for non-critical messages, with the goal of improving delivery acceptance,
        such as those from specific mailing-lists. Before TPA-LLD authorization is deployed, the
        Author Domain should be assured by the domains being authorized that appropriate measures
        are in place to authenticate those submitting messages.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="eval-3p-signing-domain" title="Evaluating the Third-party Signing Domain">
      <t>An Author Domain deploying a TPA-Label Resource Record for a Third Party Signer does so on
        a trust basis. Reasons for deploying TPA-Label Resource Records might be to allow deployment
        of more stringent ADSP records while also utilizing third-party services.</t>

      <t>When an authorized Third Party Signer does not employ DKIM authentication with ADSP or does
        not include Authentication-Results headers, this could allow authorizations to be
        exploited.</t>

      <section anchor="tpa-auth" title="Third Party Authentication">
        <t>The Author Domain SHOULD ensure the Authorization Scope of the TPA-Label Resource Record
          is authenticated. There are a number of ways email can be authenticated, and different
          authentication mechanisms validate different parts of the email. The following are
          examples of how authorization might work:</t>

        <section title="Third Party Authentication - Web Email Provider with Subscriber Pingbacks">
          <t>The Author Domain "example.com" wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record to permit
            their traveling agents the use of "webmail.example.net" services. This email provider
            has a closed user policy and adds DKIM signatures to messages on behalf of the
            "webmail.example.net" domain.</t>

          <t>The closed user policy of "webmail.example.net" permits subscribers to post messages
            with Author Domains that are not "webmail.example.net" in the From header fields only
            when control of the Author Address has been validated by a response to an encoded
            "pingback" email. The "webmail.example.net" service also establishes accounts to
            authenticate all users sending messages through their service. Therefore, the referenced
            TPA-Label Resource Record can include an 'F' scope value to authorize Author Domain
            messages signed by this Third-Party Signer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Third Party Authentication - Closed Mailing List Example">
          <t>The Author Domain wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record for a mailing list with a
            closed posting policy that redistributes email in a way that breaks Author Domain
            Signatures, but that adds a DKIM signature on behalf of their domain and includes an
            Authentication-Results header field for posted messages. The closed posting policy is
            enforced by requiring subscribers to validate their control of their Author Address by
            responding to encoded "pingback" email sent to this address.</t>

          <t>Because the list management always verifies control of the Author Address, is
            configured to include Authentication-Results headers, includes a List-ID header, the
            referenced TPA-Label Resource Record can include an 'L' scope value to permit Author
            Domain messages containing an authorized List-ID domain to be signed by this Third-Party
            Signer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Third Party Authentication - Open Mailing List Example">
          <t>The Author Domain wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record for a mailing list with
            an open posting policy that redistributes email in a way that breaks Author Domain
            Signatures, but that adds a DKIM signature on behalf of their domain and includes an
            Authentication-Results header field for posted messages. The open posting policy will
            refuse messages lacking Author Domain Signatures for domains that have deployed an ADSP
            signing practice of "dkim=all" or "dkim=discardable".</t>

          <t>Because the list management always refuses to post an Author Address lacking a Author
            Domain Signature when the domain has deployed an ADSP record with an "dkim=all" or
            "dkim=discardable", and is configured to include Authentication-Results headers,
            includes a List-ID header, the referenced TPA-Label Resource Record can include an 'L'
            scope value to permit Author Domain messages containing an authorized List-ID domain to
            be signed by this Third-Party Signer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Third Party Authentication Example - Sender Header Field">
          <t>Author Domain "example.com" wishes to temporarily employ the service agency
            "temp.example.org" to handle overflow secretarial support. The agency "temp.example.org"
            sends email on behalf of the executive staff of "example.com" and adds the Sender header
            field of "secretary@example.org" in the email. Since "temp.example.org" only allows its
            own staff to email through its server that adds "temp.example.org" DKIM signatures, a
            TPA-LLD can include the "temp.example.org" domain with 'S' scope to specifically
            authorize messages containing the Sender header field to help ensure these messages are
            not detected as phishing attempts.</t>

        <section title="Services Lacking DKIM Signatures">
          <section title="Abuse and DSN Reporting">
            <t>The 'H' and 'L' scopes available within the TPA-LLD records allow the Author Domain
              to be associated with SMTP Clients publicly transmitting messages and/or the Mail
              return path when these domains differ and DKIM is not employed by the third-party
              service. In this case, appropriate DSN or abuse reporting to the Author Domain is
              better assured as a result. The correspondence between SMTP Client hosts and Mail
              return path can be affirmed by the TPA-LLD scheme with a scope of 'H' or 'M' that
              might be used to categorize feedback data or confirm DSN destinations.</t>

              should also limit the number of DNS transactions that might be attempted, or this
              could negatively impact unrelated domains when evaluating path related protocols. Path

                  together this potentially large set of addresses, path protocols provide up to one
                  hundred and eleven separate DNS transactions. One to obtain the initial record,
                  one for each of ten permitted mechanisms, which may in turn require up to ten
                  transactions to resolve the mechanism's target list.</t>

    <section title="DNS Representation">
      <t>The receiver obtains domain authorizations with a DNS query for an IN class TXT TPA-Label
        resource record located below the location specified in <xref target="RFC4871"/> section 7.4
        and the label "_tpa.". The TPA-Label itself is normally generated by processing the domain
        in question, which normally matches the DKIM signature's "d=" parameter. A TPA-Label
        Resource Record is published adjacent to the <xref target="RFC5617"/> conventional ADSP
        record, for example below "_tpa._domainkey.&lt;Author-Domain&gt;". The Author Domain
        provides authorization for other domains with the existence of a TPA-Label TXT resource
        record that when a "tpa" tag value exists, it includes the referenced domain. Authorization
        to act on behalf of the Author Domain can be limited by the "scope" tag value for specific
        message elements.</t>

      <t>An Author Domain may wish to delegate the listing of third-party services to a different
        administrative domain. Ideally, this would be accomplished by delegating the
        _tpa._domainkey.&lt;Author-Domain&gt; zone to the administrative entity handling publication
        of TPA-Label Resource Records. This delegation could also be done unilaterally with a DNAME
        resource record published at _tpa._domainkey.&lt;Author-Domain&gt;.</t>

      <t>Character-strings contained within the TXT resource record are concatenated into forming a
        single string. A character-string is a single length octet followed by that number of
        characters treated as binary information. As an example, a TPA-Label Resource Record may be
        located at these domains:<list>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This draft extends signing practices related to <xref target="RFC4871"/> where most generic
        DKIM Signature related security matters are discussed there. Additional considerations are
        also included in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dkim-mailinglists"/>. Security considerations for
        the TPA-Label Resource Record scheme are mostly related to attempts on the part of malicious
        senders to represent themselves as other senders, often in an attempt to defraud either the
        recipient or the alleged originator.</t>

      <t>Additional security considerations regarding DKIM signing practices may be found in the
        DKIM threat analysis <xref target="RFC4686"/>.</t>

      <section title="Benefits to Recipients">
        <t>The verifier, after finding an Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signature in a
          message, has a significantly greater confidence in the Third-Party authorization than when
          the no TPA-Label Resource Record could be retrieved. This enhanced confidence may, at the
          recipients' discretion, cause a message to be delivered to recipient without further
          domain compliance assessment.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Risks to Recipients">
        <t>The decisions that a recipient makes with regard to message filtering based on TPA-Label
          Resource Records is likely to depend on the system integrity of the Third Party with
          respect to Authentication (see <xref target="tpa-auth"/>) and the provided scope labels.
          When the scope is not authenticated by the Third Party or a domain is not confirmed, there
          is a risk of accepting a potentially spoofed message.</t>

        <t>With this specification, third party signatures have some verifiable value. When
          implementing the compliance assessment of third party signatures and TPA-Label Resource
          Records, implementers need to consider the possibility that a Bad Actor will send the
          recipient a message with a large number of valid DKIM Signatures. Verifying all of these
          may consume a large amount of processing resources and it may be worth checking the
          existence of a TPA-Label Resource Record first. <xref target="tpa-qt"/> describes a quick
          check to see if TPA-Label Resource Records may exist. Additionally validating DKIM
          signatures and obtaining related resource records might be limited to known trustworthy
          domains.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Benefits to Author Domains">
        <t>TPA-Label resource records can replace domain delegations, selector/key record mirroring,
          or key exchanges. Significant amounts of detail is associated with selector/key records.
          These details include user limitations, suitable services, key resource record's
          Time-To-Live, revocation and update procedures, and how the DKIM Signature header field's
          'i=' semantics are to be applied. In addition, to better secure services that might depend
          upon DKIM keys, rather than delegating DKIM keys, the TPA-LLD scheme allows Author Domains
          an ability to limit the scope of their authorizations, without being mistaken for having
          authenticated the entity submitting the message.</t>

        <t>TPA-Label Resource Records convey which third-party domains are authoritative. However,
          third-party domains are unable to utilize DKIM signature's 'i=' semantics to directly
          assert which identifiers on whose behalf a signature was added. As such, no third-party
          domain should be authorized unless it is trusted to ensure the Alleged Author of an email
          undergoes some form authentication that offers acceptable protections for the Author
          Domain. Such authentication might be to ensure submitting entities have demonstrated
          receipt of "pingback" messages sent to the Author Address contained within the messages
          being signed, for example.</t>

        <t>Author Domains benefit by deploying TPA-Label Resource Records in that a recipient who
          assesses signing practice compliance using the TPA-LLD scheme is less likely to drop
          messages from their domain. In addition, the authorized third party domains are less
          likely to need reputations for recipients to validate the signature and assess the message
          for compliance with signing practices.</t>

        <t>Scope labels provide a fine grained control that allows the Author Domain to control
          message attributes even from the authorized third parties.</t>

        <t>Signing domains having good reputations referenced by a TPA-LLD might therefore provide a
          means to safely extend limited compliance assessment resources to otherwise unknown Author
          Domains or SMTP Clients.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Risks to Author Domains">
        <t>As indicated in <xref target="eval-3p-signing-domain"/>, there is ultimately a trust of
          the third party domain to do the right thing and not generate or allow others to generate
          messages that appear to be from the Author Domain. The compliance assessment mechanisms
          deployed need to carefully match the scope of the TPA records.</t>

        <t>By authorizing some mailing lists with TPA-Label Resource Records, there could be a loss
          of confidentiality in respect to mailing list domain participation by the Author Domain.
          This might then help Bad Actors deduce which subscription related email the Author Domain
          might receive. Because of the hashing function in generating the TPA-label, anyone wishing
          to find out the authorized domains has to probe each TPA-label based on the exact signing
          domain.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Benefits to Third Party Signers">
        <t>Third Party Signers benefit by having the autonomy to deploy and change DKIM signing
          without consultation with Author Domains. This is particularly useful for mailing lists.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Risks caused by Third Party Signers">
        <t>Third Party Signers as mentioned before need to authenticate in some way messages from
          Author Domains. This authentication provides a safety mechanism for the Author Domain and
          the recipient. The Third Party may not be aware of the value of the authentication and
          change this without understanding the negative impact this may have on the author and
          recipient domains. The Third Party also may stop DKIM signing messages, also causing a
          detriment to both author and recipient.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SHA-1 Collisions">
        <t>The use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm does not represent a security concern. The hash
          simply ensures a deterministic domain-name size is achieved. Unexpected collisions can be
          detected and handled by using the extended TPA-Label Resource Record "tpa=" option. The
          use of TPA-Label Resource Records without the TPA-Label "tpa=" options does present an
          opportunity for an adversary to attempt to find a hash collision. Message spoofing outside
          the realm of DKIM protection is still likely to be easier to achieve than finding hash
          collisions. There is minimal risk of TPA-Labels colliding. Listing 3 x 10^45 domains will
          has less than a 0.1 percent risk of any two domain labels colliding.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="DNS" title="DNS Limits">
        <t>Use of the TPA-Label Resource Records, rather than simply listing the authorized domain,
          ensures the DNS record size is independent of the Third Party Domain. The typical domain
          name size has been steadily increasing. This increase has been caused by domain names that
          encode international character sets, and perhaps soon an increase will be spurred by an
          expanse of TLDs having larger labels.</t>

        <t>Using TPA-Label Resource Records in the DNS, as described by this scheme, leaves a
          residual size of 430 for the length of the author domain and the resource record content.
          DNS servers that add additional resource records, for nameservers as an example, will
          further limit this size. Author Domains exceeding this length will need to rely on the
          recipients using TCP for DNS retrieval or extended DNS lengths <xref target="RFC2671"/>.
          Normally, DNS messages should not exceed 512 bytes as per Section 2.3.4 of <xref
            target="RFC1035"/>.<vspace blankLines="100"/></t>
