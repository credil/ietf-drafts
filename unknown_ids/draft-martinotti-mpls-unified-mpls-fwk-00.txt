Internet-Draft           Unified MPLS Framework            November 2011


1.  Introduction

   The term "Unified MPLS" indicates several different things:

   The ambition to continue to keep MPLS together as one single
   technology, base on a common architecture.

   The ambition to maximize interworking between different flavors of
   MPLS (MPLS Packages) within the MPLS technology

   The ambition that functionality developed for one of the MPLS
   Aggregate Packages should be re-useable within other MPLS Aggregate
   Packages,

   MPLS is a mature Internet technology that has been used over the last
   18 years to give e.g.  QoS, resiliency, scalability, virtualization,
   etc. to IP networks.

   Through e.g.  Pseudowires and L2VPN development it has also been
   adapted to emulate legacy protocols such as Frame Relay, TDM, ATM and
   Ethernet.

   The development of the MPLS technology has been very rapid since the
   start, the last 4 to 5 years have not been an exception.  In
   particular we have seen developments in OAM in order to meet
   transport environments requirements, specification of multicast
   techniques and over the last years new resiliency strategies have
   been deployed.

   Over the years it has become possible to distinguish different MPLS
   Packages, e.g.MPLS traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), Topology Driven
   MPLS (MPLS-TD) and the Transport Profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP).

1.1.  Motivation and Background

   Needless to say this very dynamic environment has put stress on the
   MPLS architecture.  Another factor that contributed is that MPLS
   technology over the years has evolved to addresses almost all
   networking market segments.

   Vendors that are only interested to incorporate one of the MPLS
   packages often tend to prioritize the development of one of the
   packages at the expense of the others, one typical example is the
   T-MPLS standardization that was started within ITU-T and rapidly
   developed into a separate technology.  This in itself put stress on
   the MPLS architecture.

   The MPLS architecture has stood up surprisingly well, but there are a

   few things that need to be documented as part of the MPLS
   architecture, primarily on the OAM side, but also on MPLS multicast
   and traffic engineering.

   The time has come to take steps to bring the MPLS architecture
   together and create a unified MPLS architecture - an architecture and
   protocol suite that can operate end to end, with pieces that may be
   combined in a fashion that can meet the needs of the service provider
   according to their requirements and environment and not the
   limitations of the profiles.

1.2.  Scope

   The term "Unified MPLS" has come to indicate that the environment
   where MPLS is used has been gradually changing over the years, it is
   highly likely that architectural updates are needed.  This framework
   document address how the environment of RFC 3031 [RFC3031]has
   changed.  MPLS started out as a set of tools to support IP networks,
   but over time developed to have much broader application than that.
   We have seen the development of IP-VPNs, L2VPNs, PWs for carrying
   non-IP payload, deployment of MPLS in networks where we don't even
   require or have IP in the forwarding plane.

   Starting with existing MPLS protocols, i.e. data plane, signaling
   (label distribution) protocols, routing, TE-extensions, OAM and the
   different management tools it is possible to build a surprisingly
   large number of viable MPLS deployments.

   For lack of a better name we have chosen to call the deployable MPLS
   constructs "packages".  In Terminology (Section 1.3) we will
   elaborate on this terminology.

   A number of standardization and technology development projects have
   extended MPLS in very different directions.  In Unified MPLS we make
   two assumptions:

   1.  The Interworking potential between different MPLS Packages and
       MPLS Aggregate packages shall be maximized and that this is a
       design goal in all development and standardization of MPLS.

   2.  Functionality developed for one MPLS Aggregate Package, e.g. the
       MPLS-TP OAM tools developed in the joint project with ITU-T,
       shall be designed in such a way that it is re-useable within
       other MPLS (Aggregate) Packages.

1.3.  Terminology

   In the "ontology" section (Section 2.5) an outline of this aspect of
   the MPLS terminology is given.

1.3.1.  MPLS Protocols and Packages

   For the purpose of understanding the MPLS terminology structure we
   operate with four concepts; MPLS Protocols, MPLS Packages, MPLS
   Aggregate Packages and MPLS Technology.

1.3.1.1.  MPLS Protocols

   We have a rather wide definition of "protocol", i.e. all the IETF
   protocols that specify MPLS behavior of the data, control and
   management plane.  OAM is considered to be part of the data plane.

1.3.1.2.  MPLS Packages

   An MPLS Package is a ordered collection of MPLS protocols put
   together because it can give you a desired functionality.  One
   example would be running OSPF and LDP in your network to create a
   topology driven MPLS see Topology Driven MPLS (Section 1.3.3).

1.3.1.3.  MPLS Aggregate Packages

   An MPLS Aggregate Package is a grouping of MPLS Packages.  There is
   for example nothing that stops you from running Topology Driven MPLS
   (MPLS-TD) based on ISIS instead of OSPF; those two MPLS packages form
   together the MPLS-TD Aggregate package.

   We see that it is possible to form three different MPLS Aggregate
   Packages.  First we have MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), Topology
   Driven MPLS (MPLS-TD) and the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).

   In - whichever section it will be - a somewhat simplified overview of
   MPLS Protocols, Packages and Aggregate Packages.

1.3.2.  MPLS Technology

   The "MPLS" or "MPLS Technology" is a the sum of the MPLS protocols
   and the method of grouping them to MPLS Packages and Aggregate MPLS
   Packages as illustrated in the - Appendix.

   The MPLS technology is also scoped, described and explained in a
   number of documents; such as applicability statements, requirements
   and frameworks.  Though those document are not part of the Standards
   Track they are important as they gives a comprehensive view of the

Internet-Draft           Unified MPLS Framework            November 2011


   MPLS Technology.

1.3.3.  Topology Driven MPLS

   We talk about Topology Driven MPLS (MPLS-TD) then the protocols
   establishing LSPs is limited to use the topology information created
   by IP routing protocols; i.e. packets sent over an MPLS LSP will
   traverse the network over the same path as it would have taken if the
   Shortest Path IP forwarding had been used.

   MPLS-TD consist of at least two different MPLS Packages, depending if
   ISIS or OSPF is used as the routing protocol.  LDP is almost the only
   signaling protocol that is used in this type of network.

   Note: It is technically possible to use other routing protocols, e.g.
   Routing Information Protocol (RIP) RFC 2453 [RFC2453].  However the
   use RIP in MPLS are very limited, and for all practical purposes it
   can be left aside.

1.3.4.  MPLS Traffic Engineering

   We talk about MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) when other
   parameters than just the shortest path is taken into consideration
   when deciding on how and where an LSP should be set up.  By far the
   most common criteria is available BW, this explains why the RSVP-TE
   protocol was well suited to be adapted as MPLS_TE signaling protocol.

   Deciding how many MPLS-TE Packages there are is slightly harder than
   for the MPLS-TD.

   There are two and only two routing protocols - OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE.

   For the signaling protocols the situation is a bit ambivalent; the
   MPLS developed a RSVP-TE for MPLS traffic engineering RFC 3209
   [RFC3209].  When the RSVP-TE was "generalized" for Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) the intention was that the more specific objects should be
   possible to use, but for the Label object this was never achieved.
   One could therefore say that we have two different signaling
   protocols.

1.3.5.  MPLS Transport Profile

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the latest addition of the
   MPLS Aggregate Packages.  It is an extension of MPLS to meet the
   requirements from transport networks.

   There are four different MPLS Packages for MPLS-TP

   o  NMS Driven MPLS-TP (ND MPLS-TP), LSPs, PWs and segments is set up
      and configured from an NMS

   o  Control Plane driven MPLS (CD MPLS-TP), LSPs, PWs and segments is
      set up and configured from the control plane.

      There are two variants of CD MPLS-TP depending on which routing
      protocol that is used; for CD MPLS-TP there is a decision to use
      the GMPLS version of RSVP-TE.

      *  based on RSVP-TE and OSPF-TE

      *  based on RSVP-TE and ISIS-TE

   The fourth variant is MPLS-TP P2MP configured from an NMS

   The fifth variant is when the MPLS-TP P2MP is configured from a
   control plane using the MPLS signaling and routing protocols.

1.3.6.  Additional Terms and Acronyms

   This section lists terms and acronyms used in this document.

1.3.6.1.  New terms

   Control Plane Driven -
   LSPs are set up and configured from the control plane.  This is true
   for almost all MPLS, but the Control Plane Driven terminology
   originates from the MPLS-TP project.


   NMS Driven -
   LSPs are set up and configured from an NMS This is the mode Transport
   Networks has been operated in traditionally.


1.3.6.2.  Acronyms

   CD MPLS-TP - Control Plane Driven MPLS-TP

   MPLS-TD - Topology Driven MPLS

   MPLS-TE - Traffic Engineered MPLS

   MPLS-TP - MPLS for Transport Networks (MPLS Transport Profile)

   ND MPLS-TP - NMS Driven MPLS-TP

2.  Unified MPLS Requirements

   This section list the high level requirements for Unified MPLS.

2.1.  Full Interoperability and Interworking

   One important aspect of Unified MPLS is to promote interoperability
   and interworking between different flavors of MPLS.  Unified MPLS
   addresses the problem of cross-MPLS interoperation and interworking.

   Requirement: Unified MPLS SHALL guarantee full interoperability
   between all MPLS packages, i.e.  SHALL e.g. be possible to start and
   LSP in an MPLS-TP network, cross MPLS-TE network and terminate it in
   a MPLS-TD network.

2.2.  Common Data Plane

   Requirement: From the point of view of an MPLS encapsulated packet
   traversing the data plane of a MPLS Network there SHALL be no
   differences depending on whether the LSP has been set up using any of
   the MPLS routing and signaling protocols or if it has been
   established manually or from an NMS.

2.3.  Data Plane Agnostic

   Requirement: The relationship between LSPs and the payload
   transported on those LSPs, i.e.  PWs, LSPS and IP, SHALL be the same
   regardless if the payload is transported by one or the other of the
   MPLS flavors.

2.4.  Interworking

   Requirement: There SHALL be no limitations in the possibilities to
   hand over payload from one LSP to another regardless of how the LSPs
   has been established, i.e. it SHALL be possible to carry a PW on a
   MPLS-TP or MPLS-TD segment and then hand it over to a MPLS-TE LSP and
   vice versa. could

2.5.  MPLS Terminology structure

   In the abbreviated table below a way of thinking about the
   relationship between the MPLS RFCs, MPLS protocols, MPLS packages and
   MPLS Aggregate Packages is outlined.

   We take the approach that RFCs can be grouped into protocols, and
   that protocols may form MPLS packages, which in turn can be grouped
   into Aggregate Packages.

   In talking about "MPLS RFCs" and "MPLS protocols" we do so in a wide
   sense, i.e.  RFCs and protocols that might be used in MPLS networks.
   Most of those are developed by working groups that we listed as "MPLS
   working groups" in RFC 4929 [RFC4929], but there are also other
   protocols that are used and necessary in some MPLS networks, e.g. the
   IGPs that were developed in other working groups.

   We have added NMS Configuration and MPLS Data Plane, even though they
   they are not "protocols" of the same flavor as the other protocols

3.  Unified MPLS Overview

   This section should contain a high-level overview of Unified MPLS.
   Here we discuss interfacing different mpls types!

   QUESTION: Do we have to consider also co-existence of different
   packages (e.g.  CD-MPLS-TP and MPLS-TE)?  Do we want to consider a
   network being physically partitioned or logically too?

   QUESTION: Do we want to describe the possibility of reusing tools/
   protocols defined into one package into other ones?

3.1.  Unified MPLS Control Plane

   Unified MPLS comprises a set of protocols for implementing a Control
   Plane for Network Layer, for Routing and LSP label distribution.  We
   consider the following routing protocols: OSPF and ISIS and their
   versions with Traffic Engineering extensions.  We also consider the
   following LSP label distribution protocols: LDP and RSVP-TE (and its
   extensions for MPLS-TP).  Each package having a control plane uses a
   combination of them.

   We also consider the possibility where PW level is setup and
   maintained via tLDP.

   One aim of Unified MPLS is to consider the Control Plane implications
   of putting two network domains in relationship, where one or both of
   them implements a control plane; not all the combinations may
   interwork in principle.  Further considerations are done in
   Section 3.5.4.

3.2.  Unified MPLS Data Plane

   Unified MPLS comprises a standard MPLS data plane [RFC3031].  The
   following information is relevant to Unified MPLS.

   The forwarding functions comprise the mechanisms required for
   forwarding the encapsulated native service traffic over an MPLS
   network, for example, LSP and PW labels.

   MPLS label switching operations and Time-to-Live (TTL) processing
   procedures are used, as defined in [RFC3031], [RFC3032], [RFC3443]
   and [RFC5921].

   SS-PW and MS-PW forwarding operations are used, as defined in
   [RFC3985] and [RFC5659].

   Per-platform label space is used for PWs.  Either per-platform, per-

   interface, or other context-specific label space [RFC5331] may be
   used for LSPs.

   MPLS forwarding is based on the label that identifies the path (LSP
   or PW).  The label value specifies the processing operation to be
   performed by the next hop at that level of encapsulation.  A swap of
   this label is an atomic operation in which the contents of the packet
   after the swapped label are opaque to the forwarder.  The only event
   that interrupts a swap operation is TTL expiry.  This is a
   fundamental architectural construct of MPLS to be taken into account
   when designing protocol extensions (such as those for OAM) that
   require packets to be sent to an intermediate LSR.

   Further processing to determine the context of a packet occurs when a
   swap operation is interrupted in this manner, or a pop operation
   exposes a specific reserved label at the top of the stack (including
   the GAL).  Otherwise, the packet is forwarded according to the
   procedures in [RFC3032].

   MPLS Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture [RFC3270] is the
   suggested mode of supporting Quality of Services in Unified MPLS.
   Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS Diffserv modes are supported.

   Multicast MPLS is left for further study within Unified MPLS.

3.3.  Unified MPLS Management

   Here we want to describe the possible methods for Management of
   Unified MPLS.  Commonly used methods, such as CLI, may be used in
   conjunction with LCT, EM, NMS, as described in [RFC5950].  Most
   important functions related to Management are: provisioning of
   network layer and service layer, fault and performance monitoring,
   inventory.

   In several profiles of MPLS, provisioning of network layer and
   service layer is done by means of Control Plane.  Where Management
   plane only is used for provisioning (e.g. in ND-MPLS-TP), routing,
   Path Computation Element, label distribution, configuration of the
   parameters for network and service layer are done via network
   management tools.

   Where several subnetworks are deployed, it may happen that only a
   subset of them is operated via Management, while another is operated
   via Control Plane.  The dependencies of the two has to be analysed.

Internet-Draft           Unified MPLS Framework            November 2011


3.4.  Unified MPLS OAM

   OAM is used perform functions of operation, administration and
   maintenance (a comprehensive description of OAM functions is
   described in [RFC6291]).  These functions are applicable both to LSP
   and PW.  Among all the functions provided by OAM, fault management
   and performance monitoring are used to have a common method to verify
   the behavior of a network domain and a single mean to monitor the
   different kinds of service being provided.

   OAM for MPLS has been defined in [LIST-OF-RFC-OF-OAM-FOR-LSP],
   especially because of the requirements of MPLS-TP.  OAM for PW has
   been defined in [LIST-OF-RFC-OF-OAM-FOR-PW].

   One critical objective of Unified MPLS is to describe how these tools
   can be used in a multiple domain MPLS network, where different
   packages can be deployed.

3.5.  Interfaces and Interworking

   Where two or more subnetworks (or profiles instances) are deployed
   within an operator network, it is important to consider the interface
   between each pair of them.  Peering relationship is where the two
   subnetworks are at the same level with respect to the end-to-end
   service being provided.  Peering relationship may happen at LSP, PW
   or client service level.  Overlay relationship is where one
   subnetwork is client of the other one, so that the server subnetwork
   provides connectivity to part of the client one.  In this section we
   discuss the most important interfaces and subnetwork interworking.

3.5.1.  Interfaces

   Several packages are considered within MPLS Technology.  Anyhow there
   is not yet a guideline on how to use a combination of different
   packages in a single operator network.  With Unified MPLS we want to
   describe the interfaces between the different packages.  The number
   of the possible interfaces is quite high, so a brute force approach
   for their description is not beneficial to the reader.  An objective
   of Unified MPLS is to start the analysis with the most common
   interworking scenarios.

   The interface between two domains may be a node or a link.  The two
   cases may lead to different requirements and behaviors at the
   interface.  It may happen that one or several interfaces (of the same
   kind) happen between two domains.

3.5.2.  Network Layer Interworking

   This document uses the term Network Layer in the same sense as it is
   used in [RFC3031] and [RFC3032].

   Two peering network domains (each one implementing one instance of
   any MPLS package) interwork at Network Layer when they are configured
   to interconnect at LSP or PW level.  LSP stitching and MS-PW are
   used, depending on the level chosen.  LSP stitching may be used for
   any client signal encapsulated into the end-to-end LSP (MPLS, PW,
   IP), while MS-PW can only be used for PW encapsulated signals.

3.5.3.  Service Layer Interworking

   Service interface (UNI and NNI) reference models are described in
   [RFC5921] and further analyzed in [RFC6125].

   Two peering network domains (each one implementing one instance of
   any MPLS package) interwork at Service Layer when they are configured
   to interconnect at client service level.  In case of border link
   interconnecting the two domains, it can be named UNI in [RFC6125]
   terminology.

   In case of border node interconnecting the two domains, Termination
   mode applies.

3.5.4.  Network Overlay

   When two network domains are in Overlay relationship, in principle
   there isn't any interworking between them.  Anyhow there are few
   aspects to be taken into account, at least from CP and Fault
   Management point of view.

   CP aspects has to be considered when the client network domain is CD
   (it implements a CP).  If the server network domain is CD, there is
   the possibility to interact between the two CPs. if the server
   network is ND, then the resources for the client domain must be pre-
   allocated.

   In case OAM tool set is used in both client and server network
   domain, there is the possibility to propagate fault indication,
   happened within the server domain, into the client domain.

   One Unified MPLS aim is also to specific constraints given by the
   used packages (E.g. if a domain using MPLS-TE is client of a domain
   using MPLS-TD, bandwidth requirements of the client layer may not be
   guaranteed.

3.6.  Other Unified MPLS Considerations

   It is quite possible that Unified MPLS should also address a number
   of other aspects, e.g. resiliency and survivability.
