Internet-Draft               CoRE Interfaces                January 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at
   realizing the REST architecture in a suitable form for the most
   constrained nodes (e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers with limited RAM and
   ROM) and networks (e.g. 6LoWPAN).  CoRE is aimed at machine-to-
   machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building
   automation.

   The discovery of resources offered by a constrained server is very
   important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no
   humans in the loop and static interfaces result in fragility.  The
   discovery of resources provided by an HTTP Web Server is typically
   called Web Linking [RFC5988].  The use of Web Linking for the
   description and discovery of resources hosted by constrained web
   servers is specified by the CoRE Link Format
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format] and can be used by CoAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap] or HTTP servers.  The CoRE Link Format defines
   an attribute that can be used to describe the REST interface of a
   resource, and may include a link to a description document.  This
   document defines well-known interface descriptions for Batch, Sensor,
   Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web servers.  A
   short reference is provided for each type that can be efficiently
   included in the interface description (if=) attribute of the CoRE
   Link Format.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms
   and concepts that are discussed in [RFC5988] and
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].


3.  Interface Descriptions

   This section defines REST interfaces for Batch, Sensor, Parameter and
   Actuator resources.  Each type is described along with its Interface
   Description attribute value, recommended path pattern and valid
   methods.  These are defined for each interface in the table below.
   These interfaces can support plain text and/or SenML Media types.

   The if= column defines the Interface Description (if=) attribute
   value to be used in the CoRE Link Format for a resource conforming to



Shelby                    Expires July 5, 2012                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               CoRE Interfaces                January 2012


   that interface.  When this value appears in the if= attribute of a
   link, the resource MUST support the corresponding REST interface
   described in this section.  The resource MAY support additional
   functionality, which is out of scope for this specification.
   Although these interface descriptions are intended to be used with
   the CoRE Link Format, they are applicable for use in any REST
   interface definition.

   The Path column defines an example path pattern that a resource of
   this type might use for simple end-points.  These interfaces are
   expected to be used in other path patterns.  In any case, resource
   paths SHOULD be discoverable as described in
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].

   The Methods column defines the methods supported by that interface,
   which are described in more detail below.

    +-----------+--------+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | Interface | if=    | Path Example | Methods                     |
    +-----------+--------+--------------+-----------------------------+
    |     Batch | core#b | /s,/p,/a     | GET, PUT (where applicable) |
    |    Sensor | core#s | /s/{name}    | GET                         |
    | Parameter | core#p | /p/{name}    | GET, PUT                    |
    |  Actuator | core#a | /a/{name}    | GET, PUT                    |
    +-----------+--------+--------------+-----------------------------+

   The following is an example of links in the CoRE Link Format using
   these interface descriptions.  These links are used in the subsequent
   examples below.


   Req: GET /.well-known/core
   Res: 2.05 Content (application/link-format)
   </s>;if="core#b",
   </s/light>;if="core#s",
   </s/temp>;if="core#s",
   </s/humidity>;if="core#s",
   </p/name>;if="core#p",
   </a>;if="core#b",
   </a/led1>;if="core#a",
   </a/led2>;if="core#a"

3.1.  Batch

   The Batch interface is used to manipulate a collection of sub-
   resources at the same time.  The Batch interface type supports the
   same methods as its sub-resources, and can be used to read (GET) or
   set (PUT) the values of those sub-resource with a single resource



Shelby                    Expires July 5, 2012                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               CoRE Interfaces                January 2012


   representation.  The sub-resources of a Batch MAY be heterogeneous, a
   method used on the Batch only applies to sub-resources that support
   it.  For example Sensor interfaces do not support PUT, and thus a PUT
   request to a Sensor member of that Batch would be ignored.  A batch
   requires the use of SenML Media types in order to support multiple
   sub-resources.

   The following example interacts with a Batch /s with Sensor sub-
   resources /s/light, /s/temp and /s/humidity.


   Req: GET /s
   Res: 2.05 Content (application/senml+json)
   {"e":[
       { "n": "light", "v": 123, "u": "lx" },
       { "n": "temp", "v": 27.2, "u": "degC" },
       { "n": "humidity", "v": 80, "u": "%RH" }],
   }


3.2.  Sensor

   The Sensor interface allows the value of a sensor resource to be read
   (GET).  The Media type of the resource can be either plain text or
   SenML.  Plain text MAY be used for a single measurement that does not
   require meta-data.  For a measurement with meta-data such as a unit
   or time stamp, SenML SHOULD be used.  A resource with this interface
   MAY use SenML to return multiple measurements in the same
   representation, for example a list of recent measurements.

   The following are examples of Sensor interface requests in both text/
   plain and application/senml+json.


   Req: GET /s/humidity (Accept: text/plain)
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)
   80

   Req: GET /s/humidity (Accept: application/senml+json)
   Res: 2.05 Content (application/senml+json)
   {"e":[
       { "n": "humidity", "v": 80, "u": "%RH" }],
   }

3.3.  Parameter

   The Parameter interface allows configurable parameters and other
   information to be modeled as a resource.  The value of the parameter
   can be read (GET) or set (PUT).  The PUT method is not required, and
   thus a parameter can be made read-only.  Plain text or SenML Media
   types MAY be returned from this type of interface.

   The following example shows request for reading and setting a
   parameter.


   Req: GET /p/name
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)
   node5

   Req: PUT /p/name (text/plain)
   outdoor
   Res: 2.04 Changed


3.4.  Actuator

   The Actuator interface is used by resources that model different
   kinds of actuators (changing its value has an effect on its
   environment).  Examples of actuators include for example LEDs,
   relays, motor controllers and light dimmers.  The current value of
   the actuator can be read (GET) or a new actuator value set (PUT).
   Plain text or SenML Media types MAY be returned from this type of
   interface.  A resource with this interface MAY use SenML to include
   multiple measurements in the same representation, for example a list
   of recent actuator values or a list of values to set.

   The following example shows request for reading and setting an
   actuator (turning on a led).


   Req: GET /a/led1
   Res: 2.05 Content (text/plain)
   0

   Req: PUT /a/led1 (text/plain)
   1
   Res: 2.04 Changed

3.5.  Future Interfaces

   It is expected that further interface descriptions will be defined in
   this and other specifications.  Potential interfaces to be considered
   for this specifications include:

   Batch of Links:  This resource would contain a list of links,
      pointing to resources that will be manipulated by requesting a
      method on that resource.

   Collection:  This resource would be a container that allows sub-
      resources to be added or removed.

3.6.  WADL Description

   This section defines the formal Web Application Description Langauge
   (WADL) definition of these CoRE interface descriptions.

4.  Security Considerations

   An implementation of a client needs to be prepared to deal with
   responses to a request that differ from what is specified in this
   document.  A server implementing what the client thinks is a resource
   with one of these interface descriptions could return malformed
   representations and response codes either by accident or maliciously.
   A server sending maliciously malformed responses could attempt to
   take advantage of a poorly implemented client for example to crash
   the node or perform denial of service.


5.  IANA Considerations

   To be determined if a registry of interface descriptions should be
   created for CoRE, allowing other interface descriptions to be
   registered by other specifications (and if this document is the place
   to create such a registry).
