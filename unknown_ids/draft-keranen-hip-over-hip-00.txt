Internet-Draft    HIP Signaling Message Transport Modes     January 2010


1.  Introduction

   Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] signaling messages can be exchanged
   over plain IP using the protocol number reserved for this purpose, or
   over UDP using the UDP port reserved for HIP NAT traversal
   [I-D.ietf-hip-nat-traversal].  When two hosts perform a HIP base
   exchange, they set up an encrypted connection between them for data
   traffic, but continue to use plain IP or UDP for HIP signaling
   messages.

   This document defines how the encrypted connection can be used also
   for HIP signaling messages.  Two different modes are defined: HIP
   over Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and HIP over TCP.  The
   benefit of sending HIP messages over ESP is that all signaling
   traffic (including HIP headers) will be encrypted.  If HIP messages
   are sent over TCP (which in turn is transported over ESP), TCP can
   handle also message fragmentation where needed.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Extensions

   This section defines how support for different HIP signaling message
   transport modes is negotiated and the normative behavior required by
   the extension.

3.1.  Mode Negotiation in HIP Base Exchange

   A HIP host implementing this specification SHOULD indicate the modes
   it supports, and is willing to use, in the base exchange.  The HIP
   signaling message transport mode negotiation is similar to HIP NAT
   traversal mode negotiation: first the Responder lists the supported
   modes in a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter (see Figure 1) in the R1
   packet.  If the Initiator supports, and is willing to use, any of the
   modes proposed by the Responder, it selects one of the modes by
   adding a HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter containing the selected mode to
   the I2 packet.  Finally, if the Initiator selected one of the modes
   and the base exchange succeeds, hosts use the selected mode for the
   following HIP signaling messages sent between them.

         ESP-TCP     2

3.2.  HIP Messages on Encrypted Connections

   If the ESP mode is selected in the base exchange, both hosts MUST
   listen for incoming HIP signaling messages and send outgoing messages
   on the encrypted connection.  The ESP header's next header value for
   such messages MUST be set to HIP (139).

   If the ESP-TCP mode is selected, the Responder MUST start to listen
   for an incoming TCP connection on the port 10500 on the encrypted
   connection and the Initiator MUST create a TCP connection to the
   Responder on the same port.  The Initiator SHOULD use port 10500 as
   the source port for the TCP connection.  Once the TCP connection is
   established, both hosts MUST listen for incoming HIP signaling
   messages and send the outgoing messages using the TCP connection.
   The ESP next header value for messages sent using the ESP-TCP mode
   connections MUST be set to TCP (6).

   Since TCP provides reliable transport, the HIP messages sent over TCP
   MUST NOT be retransmitted for the purpose of achieving reliable
   transmission.  Instead, a host simply waits for the same time that
   would be taken by the maximum amount of retransmissions with
   unreliable transmission before concluding that there is no response.

4.  Security Considerations

   By exchanging the HIP messages over ESP connection, all HIP signaling
   data (after the base exchange) will be encrypted, but only if NULL
   encryption is not used.  Thus, host requiring confidentiality for the
   HIP signaling messages must check that encryption is negotiated to be
   used on the ESP connection.

   Thanks to Gonzalo Camarillo for comments on the draft.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This section is to be interpreted according to [RFC5226].

   This document updates the IANA Registry for HIP Parameter Types
   [RFC5201] by assigning new HIP Parameter Type value for the
   HIP_TRANSPORT_MODE parameter (defined in Section 3.1).
