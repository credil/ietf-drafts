Internet-Draft        VPLS PE Model for E-Tree              March 2011


Abstract

   A generic VPLS solution for E-Tree services is proposed which uses
   VLANs to indicate root/leaf traffic. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model
   is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-
   Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by tagged PWs, the MAC address based
   Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW works in the same way as before.
   A signaling mechanism for E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping
   negotiation is further described.

1. Introduction

   The E-Tree service is defined in Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) as a
   Rooted-Multipoint EVC service, where traffic from a root can reach
   any root or leaf, and traffic from a leaf can reach any root, but
   should never reach a leaf. Further, two or more roots can be used to
   enhance service reliability and flexibility. Although VPMS or P2MP

   multicast is a somewhat simplified version of this service, in fact,
   there is no exact corresponding terminology in IETF.

   [Etree-req] gives the requirements for providing E-Tree solutions in
   the VPLS and the need to filter leaf to leaf traffic.

   [vpls-etree] describes a PW control word based E-Tree solution, where
   a bit in the PW control word is used to indicate the root/leaf
   attribute for a packet. The Ethernet forwarder in the VPLS is also
   extended to filter the leaf-leaf traffic based on the <ingress port,
   egress port, CW L-bit> tuple.

   [Etree-2PW] proposes another E-Tree solution where root and leaf
   traffic are classified and forwarded in the same VSI but with two
   separate PWs.

   Both solutions are only applicable to "VPLS only" networks.

   In fact, VPLS PE usually consists of a bridge module itself [RFC4664],
   moreover, E-Tree services may cross both Ethernet and VPLS domains.
   Therefore, the support of interconnection between Ethernet and VPLS
   for an E-Tree service is indispensable.

   IEEE 802.1 has incorporated the generic E-Tree solution in the latest
   version of 802.1Q [802.1aq], which is just an improvement on the
   traditional asymmetric VLAN mechanism. In the solution, VLANs are
   used to indicate root/leaf attribute of a packet: one VLAN is used to
   carry traffic originated from the roots and another VLAN is used to
   carry traffic originated from the leaves. The bridge can then filter
   on each leaf port all the traffic received on the VLANs associated
   with the leaves. Therefore, it is better to use the same mechanism in
   VPLS rather than develop a new mechanism which may not interwork with
   Ethernet.

   This document introduces how the Ethernet VLAN solution can be used
   to support generic E-Tree services in the VPLS. The solution proposed
   is fully compatible with the IEEE bridge architecture and the IETF
   PWE3 technology, and VPLS scalability and simplicity is also well
   kept. With this mechanism, it is also convenient to deploy a
   converged E-Tree service across both Ethernet and MPLS networks.

   As an example, a typical VPLS PE model is firstly introduced and
   extended which consists of a Tree VSI connected to an S-VLAN bridge
   with a dual-VLAN interface. However, this model is also applicable to
   a PE with C-VLAN or B-VLAN as its service demarcation.

   This document then discusses the PW encapsulation and PW processing
   such as VLAN mapping options for transporting E-Tree services in a
   VPLS.

   Finally, the extensions for the signaling of E-Tree capability and
   VLAN mapping negotiation are also discussed.

4. PE Model with E-Tree Support

   "VPLS only" PE architecture as outlined in Fig. 1 of [Etree-req] is a
   simplification of the VPLS and PWE3 architecture, the more common
   VPLS PE architectures are discussed in more details in [RFC 4664] and
   [vpls-interop].

   Therefore, VLAN based E-Tree solution are demonstrated with the help
   of a typical VPLS PE model. Other PE models are further discussed in
   Appendix A.

4.1. Existing PE Models

   According to [RFC4664], there are at least three models possible for
   a VPLS PE, including:

   o A single bridge module, a single VSI;

   o A single bridge module, multiple VSIs;

   o Multiple bridge modules, each attaches to a VSI.

   The second PE model is more commonly used, and a typical one
   following it is depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 as per [vpls-interop],
   where the S-VLAN bridge module is connected to multiple VSIs each
   with a single VLAN virtual interface.

   In this PE model, Ethernet service from the CEs will cross multiple
   stages of bridge modules (i.e., C-VLAN and S-VLAN bridge) and a VSI
   in a PE to access the egress PWs. Therefore, the association of an AC
   port and a PW in a single forwarding engine as required in [vpls-
   etree] or [Etree-2PW] is difficult, sometimes even impossible.

   This model could be further enhanced by the introduction of a trunk
   VLAN and a branch VLAN as Ethernet frames enter the PE. To be more
   precise, they are called root and leaf VLAN respectively in this
   document. All the egress traffics from the root VLAN are transmitted
   both on the roots and the leaves, while egress traffics from the leaf
   VLAN are transmitted on the roots but dropped on the leaves (these
   VLANs are removed before the frames are transmitted over the wire).
   It was demonstrated in [802.1aq] that the E-Tree service in Ethernet
   networks can be well supported with this mechanism.

   Assume this mechanism is implemented in the bridge module, then it is
   quite straightforward to infer a VPLS PE model with two VSIs to
   support the E-Tree (as shown in Fig. 3). But this model will require
   two VSIs per PE and two sets of PWs per E-Tree service, which is
   poorly scalable in a large MPLS/VPLS network.

4.2. A New PE Model with E-Tree Support

   To provide for the E-Tree support in a more scalable way, a new VPLS
   PE model with a single Tree VSI (T-VSI, a VSI with E-Tree support) is
   proposed and depicted in Fig. 4, where the S-VLAN bridge module is
   connected to the T-VSI with a dual-VLAN virtual interface. That is,
   both the root S-VLAN and the leaf S-VLAN are connected to the T-VSI.
   In this way, only one VPLS instance and one set of PWs is needed per
   E-Tree service. With this model, multiple E-Trees can also be
   provided by the same T-VSI if needed, and further increase the
   scalability of VPLS.

   In this model, both VLANs should share the same FIB and work in
   shared VLAN learning. The traffic from the root UNIs are firstly
   tagged with root C-VLAN by the C-VLAN bridge module, and then tagged
   with root S-VLAN by the S-VLAN bridge module, thus can only be
   transported on the root S-VLAN. Similarly, the traffic from the
   leaves can only be transported on the leaf S-VLAN.

   In fact, this model can also be applied to a PE with C-VLAN (customer
   sites attached to the PEs with untagged ports), or B-VLAN (with a PBB
   bridge module embedded in the PE) as a provider's service demarcation.
   Therefore, the document will use the VLAN in its more general meaning
   in the latter sections.

5. PW for E-Tree Support

5.1. Tagged Mode PW Encapsulation

   For a VPLS instance to support an E-Tree service, its Ethernet PW
   should work in the tagged mode (PW type 0x0004) as described in
   [RFC4448], and a VLAN tag must be carried in each frame in the PW to
   indicate the E-Tree root/leaf attribute.

   A pair of T-VSIs in a VPLS is interconnected with a bidirectional PW.
   The VLAN indicating root/leaf attribute of the packet is carried in
   the PW, and the peer PE must drop all the packets with a leaf VLAN on
   each egress port associated with a leaf.

5.2. VLAN Mapping

   There are three ways of manipulating VLANs for an E-Tree:

   o Global VLAN based that is, provisioning two global VLANs across
      both the Ethernet and the VPLS instance domain, no VLAN mapping is
      needed for this case.

   o Partial global VLAN based, that is, provisioning two local VLANs
      in the VLAN space for each Ethernet domain and two global VLANs in
      the VPLS network domain, the VLAN mapping is done completely in
      the Ethernet domains (e.g., in the bridge module of the PE or in
      the Ethernet device attached to the PE), and not needed at all in
      the VPLS domain.

   o Local VLAN based, that is, provisioning two local VLANs
      independently for the VPLS on each PE.

   The first two methods require no VLAN mapping in the PW, but two
   unique VLANs must be allocated in the VPLS (they may be provisioned
   by management or signaled by some control protocols), and the PW
   processing procedure as described in RFC 4448 applies.

   The last method is more scalable in the use of VLANs, but needs a
   VLAN mapping mechanism in the PW similar to what is already described
   in Section 4.3 of [RFC4448]. It is assumed that for each PE with E-
   Tree capability there is a VLAN mapping module that can be enabled
   when VLAN mapping is needed for a PW. Actual VLAN mapping mode can be
   provisioned or determined by a signaling protocol as described in
   Section 6 when PW is being established.

5.3. PW Processing

5.3.1.PW Processing in the VLAN Mapping Mode

   In the VLAN Mapping mode, two VPLS PEs with E-Tree capability are
   inter-connected with a PW (For example, the scenario of Fig. 5
   depicts the interconnection of two PEs miscellaneously attached with
   roots and leaves).

   If a PE is in the VLAN mapping mode for a PW, then in the data plane
   the PE MUST map the VLAN in each packet as follows:

    o Upon transmit on the PW, map from local VLAN to remote VLAN (i.e.,
      the local leaf VLAN in a frame is translated to the remote leaf
      VLAN; the local root VLAN in a frame is translated to the remote
      root VLAN).

    o Upon receive on the PW, map from remote VLAN to local VLAN, and
      the packet is further forwarded or dropped in the egress bridge
      module using the filtering mechanism as described in IEEE 802.1Q.

5.3.2.PW Processing in the Compatible Mode

   The new VPLS PE model can work in a traditional VPLS network
   seamlessly in the compatibility mode. As shown in Fig. 6, the VPLS PE
   with T-VSI can access root and/or leaf nodes, while the VPLS PE with
   a traditional VSI can only access root nodes.

5.3.3.PW Processing in the Optimized Mode

   When two VPLS PE with T-VSI are inter-connected and one PE (e.g., PE2)
   is attached with pure leaves, as shown in the scenario of Fig. 6, the
   peer PE (e.g., PE1) should then work in the optimization mode, that
   is, the PE1 can drop all the frames received over the local leaf VLAN
   rather than transport them over the PW and be discarded on the remote
   PE. Thus bandwidth efficiency of the VPLS can be improved. The
   signaling for the PE with pure leaves is specified in Section 6.

6. LDP Extensions for E-Tree Support

   To dynamically provision the E-Tree service and negotiate a single PE
   to carry out the VLAN mapping function using the signaling procedures
   as specified in [RFC4447], an E-Tree specific interface parameter
   sub-TLV is proposed as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Root VLAN ID         |          Leaf VLAN ID         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                          Figure 8  E-Tree Sub-TLV

   Where:

   o E-Tree is the sub-TLV identifier to be assigned by IANA.

   o Length is the length of the sub TLV in octets.

   o Reserved bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored on
      receive.

   o P is a Pure Leaf bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is
      attached with all leaves, and set to 0 otherwise.

   o V is a bit indicating the sender's VLAN mapping capability. A PE
      capable of VLAN mapping MUST set this bit, and clear it otherwise.

   o Root VLAN ID is the value of the local root VLAN.

   o Leaf VLAN ID is the value of the local leaf VLAN.

   When the VPLS supporting an E-Tree service is setting up the PW, the
   PW endpoints negotiate the E-Tree support using the above E-Tree sub-
   TLV. Note PW type of 0x0004 should be used during the PW negotiation.

   A PE that wishes to support E-Tree service includes an E-Tree Sub-TLV
   in its PW label mapping message, with its local root VLAN and leaf
   VLAN carried in the Root VLAN ID and Leaf VLAN ID field respectively.
   A PE that has the VLAN mapping capability MUST set the V bit to 1,
   and a PE is attached with pure leaves SHOULD set the P bit to 1.

   In default, for each PW, VLAN-Mapping-Mode, Compatible-Mode, and
   Optimized-Mode are all set to FALSE.

   A PE that receives a PW label mapping message with an E-Tree Sub-TLV
   from its peer PE must process it as follows:

   1) if the root and leaf VLAN ID in the message match the local root
      and leaf VLAN ID, then exit;

   2) else {

          if the bit V is cleared, then {

                if the PE is capable of VLAN mapping, then it MUST set
                VLAN-Mapping-Mode to TRUE;

                else {

                     A label release message with the error code "E-Tree
                     VLAN mapping not supported" is sent to the peer PE
                     and exit the process;

                     }

          }

          if the bit V is set, and the PE is capable of VLAN mapping,
          then the PE with the minimum IP address MUST set VLAN-Mapping-
          Mode to TRUE;

      }

   3) If the P bit is set, then:

      {

          If the PE is a pure leaf node itself, then a label release
      message with the error code "Leaf to Leaf PW error" is sent to the
      peer PE and exit the process;

          Else the PE SHOULD set the Optimized-Mode to TRUE.

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Sub-TLV but does not receive any E-Tree
   Sub-TLV in its peer's PW label mapping message, then set Compatible-
   Mode to TRUE if the PE is VLAN mapping capable, otherwise a label
   release message is sent.

   Data plane processing for this PW is as following:

   If VLAN-Mapping-Mode is TRUE, then data plane processing is as
   described in Section 5.3.1.

   If Optimized-Mode is TRUE, then data plane processing is as
   described in Section 5.3.3.

   If Compatible-Mode is TRUE, then data plane processing is as
   described in Section 5.3.2.

   PW processing as described in RFC 4448 proceeds as usual.

7. BGP Extensions for E-Tree Support

   BGP may also be used to distribute the E-Tree and VLAN mapping
   information. It is to be specified in the next version.

8. Applicability

   The solution is applicable to LDP VPLS [RFC4762] and may also be
   applicable to BGP VPLS [RFC 4761].

   The solution is applicable to both "VPLS Only" network and VPLS with
   Ethernet aggregation network.

9. Security Considerations

   To be added in the next version.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value for E-Tree in the Pseudowire
   Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type registry.

Appendix A. Other PE Models for E-Tree

A.1. PE Model With a VSI and No bridge

   If there is no bridge module in a PE, the PE may consist of Native
   Service Processors (NSPs) as shown in Figure A.1 (adapted from Fig. 5
   of [RFC3985]) where  any transformation operation for VLANs (e.g.,
   VLAN insertion/removal or VLAN mapping) may be applied. Thus a root
   VLAN or leaf VLAN can be added by the NSP depending on the UNI type
   (root/leaf) associated with the AC over which the packet arrives.

   Further, when a packet with a leaf VLAN exits a forwarder and arrives
   at the NSP, the NSP must drop the packet if the egress AC is
   associated with a leaf UNI.

   Tagged PW and VLAN mapping work in the same way as in the typical PE
   model.
