Abstract 
    
   In order to provide an end-to-end MPLS TE LSP between customer sites 
   within a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN, it is highly desirable for a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) to be able to dynamically discover a set 
   of Path Computation Elements (PCEs) that know VPN routes. In 
   BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, it is advantageous to use BGP to distribute PCE 
   information. This document defines a new attribute and describes how 
   PCE information can be carried using BGP.

1. Introduction 
    
   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE)-based path computation model for Multi 
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) / Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this model, path 
   computation requests are issued by a PCC to PCE that may be composite 
   or external. In case the PCC and PCE are not composite, a 
   request/response communication protocol is required to carry the 
   request and return the response. The requirements for such a 
   communication protocol are described in [RFC4657]. The communication 
   protocol between PCC and PCE, and between PCEs, is defined in 
   [RFC5440]. 
    
   Requirements for PCE in BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs [E2E-RSVP-TE] are described. 
   In such a case, PCEs are quite useful to establish an end-to-end MPLS 
   TE LSP between customer sites. As described above, it is highly 
   desirable for a Path Computation Element (PCE) to be able to 
   dynamically discover a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs) that 
   know VPN routes within a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN. In the BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, it 
   is advantageous to use BGP to distribute PCE information.  
    
   This document defines BGP PCE Discovery Attribute and describes how 
   PCE information can be carried in the Path Attributes of the UPDATE 
   message described in [RFC4271]. The BGP PCE discovery attribute is 
   defined in section 4 and BGP specific procedure is described in 
   section 5.

2. Problem Statement 
    
   In order to establish an end-to-end MPLS TE LSP between customer 
   sites within a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN, our goal is for a PCE to discover a 
   set of PCEs that know VPN routes selectively and automatically. The 
   point here is that only specific PCEs that know VPN routes should be 
   discovered automatically.  
    
   Consider that a service provider offers customers an end-to-end MPLS 
   TE LSP within a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN. Also, it is assumed that all PEs are 
   PCE. In such a case, a tail-end address to establish the end-to-end 
   MPLS TE LSP is included in VPN routes, and the VPN routes are carried 
   by MP-BGP [RFC4760]. Actually, a PE that includes the VPN membership 
   receives the VPN routes and a BGP next hop (i.e., a PE address that 
   advertises the VPN routes). In that sense, it is natural for MP-BGP 
   to carry PCE addresses (PE addresses) that know the VPN routes.  
    
   In this document, therefore, BGP PCE Discovery Attribute is defined 
   to discover PCEs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs.

4. PCE Discovery Information 
 
   The PCE discovery information consists of the PCE location, an IPv4 
   and/or IPv6 address that are used to reach the PCE. 
    
   Here, the PCE discovery attribute for PCE in the Path Attributes of 
   BGP is defined.  
   
4.1  BGP PCE Discovery Attribute 
    
   The PCE information is carried in the Path Attributes of the UPDATE 
   message described in [RFC4271]. Here, the Transitive bit is defined 
   as transitive. 
 
   The Attribute Flags will be set as follows: 
    
   The Optional bit set to 1(optional). 
   The Transitive bit set to 1(transitive). 
   The Partial bit set to 0(complete). 
   The Extended Length bit set to 1(2 octets). 
    
   The Attribute Type is to be assigned by IANA. <recommended value=20> 
    
   The Path Attributes will be encoded as < Length, List of TLV >. 
    
            +---------------------------+ 
            |   Length (2 octets)       | 
            +---------------------------+ 
            |   List of TLVs(variable)  | 
            +---------------------------+ 
    
   The meaning of the fields is described as follows: 
    
   a) Length : 
    
   The length in bytes of the list of TLVs carried in the Path 
   Attribute. 
    
   b) List of TLVs : 
    
   This contains a list of TLVs each of which can be a BGP PCE Discovery 
   TLV.  
 
4.1.1 The BGP PCE Discovery TLV 
    
   The BGP PCE Discovery TLV (PCED TLV) contains a non-ordered set of 
   sub-TLVs. 
    


 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.                                              [Page 4] 
                draft-kumaki-pce-bgp-disco-attribute-05     October 2009
 
 
   The format of the BGP PCED TLV That is composed of 2 octets for the 
   type, 2 octets specifying the TLV length, and a value field.  The 
   Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets. 
    
   The BGP PCED TLV has the following format: 
    
                        1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |              Type             |             Length            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                                                               | 
   //                            sub-TLVs                          // 
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
      Type:     1 
      Length:   Variable 
      Value:    This comprises one or more sub-TLVs 
    
   Two sub-TLVs are defined: 
        Sub-TLV type  Length               Name 
              1      variable     PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV 
              2         4         PATH-SCOPE sub-TLV 
    
   The PCE-ADDRESS and PATH-SCOPE sub-TLVs MUST always be present within
   The PCED TLV. 
    
   The following sub-sections describe the sub-TLVs that may be carried 
   within the PCED TLV. 
    
4.1.1.1 PCE-ADDRESS Sub-TLV 
    
   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV specifies an IP address that can be used to 
   reach the PCE. It is RECOMMENDED to make use of an address that is 
   always reachable, provided that the PCE is alive and reachable. 
    
   The PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the 
   PCED TLV. It MAY appear twice, when the PCE has both an IPv4 and IPv6 
   address. It MUST NOT appear more than once for the same address type.  
   If it appears more than once for the same address type, only the 
   first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored. 
    
   The format of the PCE-ADDRESS sub-TLV is as follows: 
    
                        1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

                    2   IPv6 
    
   Reserved: SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored 
   on receipt. 
    
   PCE IP Address: The IP address to be used to reach the PCE. 
 
5. BGP Specific Procedure 
    
   The PCE Discovery Attribute can be carried in the Path Attribute of 
   BGP update messages. It can be handled regardless of IPv4/IPv6 and 
   VPNv4/VPNv6 routes in BGP update messages. 
    
   Transmission processing: 
    
   BGP speakers advertise the PCE address with routes. The PCE address 
   is included in Path Attribute of BGP update message as BGP PCE 
   Discovery attribute. It can be configurable whether to advertise the 
   PCE address or not. 
    
   PCE address decision: 
    
   If a BGP speaker is PCE capable, the PCE address is the same as an 
   assigned address for BGP speaker itself. It may be a vrf interface 
   address or a loopback address. If a BGP speaker is not PCE capable, 
   it is decided by configuration or another method. This method is out 
   of scope of this document. 
    
   Receiving processing: 
    
   BGP speakers that receive PCE Discovery Attributes register in their 
   RIB with routes. 
    
   Procedure at path computation request: 
    
 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.                                              [Page 6] 
                draft-kumaki-pce-bgp-disco-attribute-05     October 2009
 
 
   This part describes an inner process within a router between BGP 
   process and path computation process. If the inquiry of a PCE address 
   is received from path computation process, the BGP process retrieve 
   the pertinent route of RIB, and returns the address of PCE Discovery 
   Attribute. Path computation process transmits path computation 
   request to this address. If this attribute is not in RIB, the BGP 
   process notify path computation process error. If two or more PCE 
   addresses of PCE Discovery Attribute exists, all the addresses are 
   returned to path computation process. 
    
6.  Security Considerations 
    
   This document defines BGP extensions for PCE discovery across an 
   administrative domain. Hence the security of the PCE discovery relies 
   on the security of BGP. 
    
   The security issues are described in the existing BGP. [RFC2385]  
    
7.  IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA will assign BGP PCE Discovery Attribute type.
