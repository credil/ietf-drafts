Internet-Draft     < ALTO and DECADE service trial>   July     2010

Abstract

   This document reports the experience of China Telecom in a recent
   experiment with the ALTO service and P2P caches deployment. It is
   found that the deployment of the ALTO service significantly improves
   the capability of a Service Provider to affect the distribution of
   P2P traffic. It is also found that a traffic localized ALTO policy
   may decrease the download speed of a P2P user. However, the
   deployment of some P2P caches can compensate such influence.

1. Introduction

   Although another trial on P4P, the predecessor of the ALTO, is
   available by Comcast, the impact of ALTO on a large scale real
   network has never publicly reported. Such real network should post
   no limitation on either the number of contents or the number of
   users. This draft reports the experience of China Telecom in a
   recent experiment with the deployment of the ALTO service and P2P
   caches.

   With over 60 million fixed-line broadband subscribers, China Telecom
   is the largest broadband service provider in China. It has one IP
   backbone network that cover all of the 31 provinces and about 200
   MAN networks managed by the provinces respectively.  This trial was
   taken place in one province with 7 million broadband subscribers and
   about 11 MAN networks.

Internet-Draft     < ALTO and DECADE service trial>   July     2010



   Xunlei, the cooperator of this trial, is a leading P2P service
   provider in China. Xunlei supports both file downloads and real time
   media streaming. In 2009, when was this trail occurring, it serves
   over 20 million users each day.

   This trial is a joint effort of China Telecom and Xunlei. During
   this trial, China Telecom provided the following devices: an alto
   server for distribute ALTO information, some P2P caches to test its
   influence on traffic localization and user experience. China Telecom
   also monitored the traffic load within its backbone. Xunlei provided
   the P2P client and users. To support this trial, Xunlei modified its
   platform to support ALTO, and recorded operational information on
   its platform according to the requirement of China Telecom. Note
   that the client of Xunlei was not changed.


2. High level description of the trial



2.1. Difference between standard ALTO protocol

   Note that ALTO protocol is still on progressing, in this trail, some
   modifications were made to the ALTO.

   First, a notification mechanism for the ALTO server is introduced.
   With this mechanism, the ALTO server notifies its clients the
   changes of network maps and cost maps. Thus, ALTO clients can
   respond fast to the change of traffic optimizing policy.

   One problem that this trail met is to find the effect of ALTO&Cache
   deployment. The traffic within the IP backbone is highly periodical
   For example, the traffic on each weekend is higher than the workday of
   same week.

   As such, data should be collected in the same workday in different
   week. This can facilitate the comparison of the effects on p2p
   traffic under different ALTO configuration and different policy, and
   to evaluate the effect of ALTO service

   In this trail, ALTO clients were just embedded in the trackers of
   Xunlei, not in the Xunlei clients. The reason for this is mainly for
   deployment consideraton. There are hundreds of millions of Xunlei
   clients in use, To update these clients as the ALTO client in a
   short time is not feasible. However, according to the analysis of
   Xunlei, although both tracker based and tracker-less technology are
   adopted, the traffic does not controlled by the trackers is less

Internet-Draft     < ALTO and DECADE service trial>   July     2010



   than 15% of its total traffic. Based on this analysis, in this trial,
   Xunlei clients are not involved in the ALTO service which has
   negligible influence on the final evaluation of this trial. Such
   design can also reduce the load on the ALTO server.

   Secondly, only map service is provided in this trial. Other services
   of ALTO service were not deployed, as they are not essential for
   this trial.

2.2. Difference with Comcast's trial

   Comcast has a trial with limited swarms, with the cooperation of
   Pando. According to (ref), there are five swarms, and overall 57,000
   peers are involved in that trial.

   There are several differences between our trial and Comcast's trial:

   1. The scope of the trail: This trial covers the whole province with
     over 700 million broadband users. It lasted for over 4 months.
     There are countless swarms with all kinds of contents. Thus, this
     trial is more realistic than the previous trial from Comcast.

   2. The usage of P2P cache: This trail differs from the previous
     trail by the utilization of P2P cache. In this trail, the average
     download speed of a Xunlei client decreases with the increase of
     the level of traffic localization. Thus the usage of P2P cache was
     introduced to compensate the decrease of download speed.

   3. The evaluation method: In contrast to that all test data was
     collected by Pando client in Comcast's trial, we collect test data
     from two ways. Besides the data from Xunlei P2P client, we
     simultaneously collect the data from network operator's NMS
     system.(such as data from SNMP reports and DPI(deep package
     inspection) device deployed on backbone). We can do this because
     Xunlei's p2p traffic occupy 20% of backbone traffic flow. This
     traffic flow will all be affected by our alto policy and it is big
     enough to be observed by network operator's NMS system.

   4. The implementation of ALTO: In this trial, only the P2P trackers
     are ALTO clients, but not those Xunlei clients. There are some
     reasons to do this:

      a) To avoid the update all Xunlei clients and simplify the
         deployment of trial.

      b) To lessen the alto server load.

Internet-Draft     < ALTO and DECADE service trial>   July     2010



      c) Above 85% of Xunlei traffic flow is controlled by Xunlei
         tracker, the traffic flow from DHT mechanism is less than 15%.
         An alto server dedicated for Xunlei tracker can control
         majority of Xunlei traffic flow.



3. Trial results

   This trial used all Xunlei p2p client in the province and all
   contents that are requested or served by Xunlei P2P client in the
   province. The trial environment is more realistic than comcast's. A
   primary objective of this trial is to measure the effects of traffic
   localization and change of users download speed in comparison to
   normal p2p activity.

      The test process is divided into two parts: first part is just
   applied the ALTO server to measure the effects of traffic
   localization and change of P2P user experience. The second part is
   to introduce the P2P cache to the trial, to measure the improvement
   of user download speed, the bandwidth consumption and  their
   relationship with the scale of cache and.

   Our trial starts at 2009.6.12 and ends at 2009.10.18, lasting nearly
   four months. We do this trial by applying different ALTO policy to
   Xunlei tracker. There are two kinds of ALTO policy: One is optimized
   policy and the other is normal policy. The optimized policy will try
   to localize the traffic as much as possible by utilizing the
   information from ALTO server. The normal policy will just use the
   original Xunlei peer selection and traffic control rules and no alto
   policy are involved. We usually change the alto policy in midnight
   of a day and send a notification to Xunlei tracker with notification
   mechanism.(http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-sun-alto-notification-
   02.txt)

   Before we do the trial , we collect the information about Xunlei'S
   peer and traffic distribution

3.2. P2P cache test

   In this trial we deployed 16 cache devices, each with 1.8TB SAS hard
   disks. The P2P cache system has 15Gbps links connected to the
   internet.  We cached the content according to its popularity.

   The P2P cache system occupancy ratio is about 80%. Bandwidth
   consumed is about 4-5Gbps.

   After deployed the P2P cache system, the traffic flow in the the
   province has decreased a lot. Meanwhile the average download speed
   of Xunlei client has been increased.

4. Methods of data collection

   In this trial we have two ways for information collection; one is to
   collect from p2p service provider such as Pando and Xunlei just like
   comcast's trial. The other is to collect from ISP's network OAM
   system. Because the Xunlei's inter-province traffic flow is about
   80Gbps that is large enough to be observed by ISP's network OAM
   system

   1. Information from ISP's network OAM system and DPI system
      include

      a) Inbound/outbound traffic flow statistic

      b) Xunlei traffic flow detected by DPI system. The DPI system
         just monitored the uplink of the province to China telecom's
         backbone.

   2. Information from Xunlei

      a) Inter-province/intra-province traffic flow.

      b) User average download speed.

5. Next steps

   The alto mechanism is very effective to optimize the traffic flow.
   But when the traffic is localized, the user average download speed
   is slowed down simultaneously. If alto can cooperate with DECADE
   or other service performance enhancement mechanism, it will be more
   practical.
