      <t>When discussing IPv6 deployment related matters it is easy to mix up the terminology used in this area.

      <t>This document is intended to serve as a reference to IPv6 deployment related terminology. It is not the

    <section  title="IPv6 deployment">
      <t>IPv6 deployment is the process of introducing IPv6 in a network environment, be it an environment where currently 
      IPv4 is in use and the two IP versions co-exist or in a "Greenfield" deployment with no prior IP infrastructure. 
      IPv6 deployment in co-existence with an IPv4 environment may or may not have the goal of completing an IPv6 migration. 
      IPv6 deployment can be discussed from a node capability perspective as well as from an application capability perspective.</t>

      <t>
      Once upon a time there where two countries, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 was a crowded country with 
      limited resources and a growing population tormented by starvation and diseases. On a distant 
      shore across the sea was a brave new land, full of promises and plenty, called IPv6. Spurred 
      by the opportunities of a better life in the distant country families started the process of 
      migrating from their old country IPv4 to IPv6. In their new homeland the people there spoke 
      another language called IPv6, while the newcomers only spoke IPv4, the language of their old 
      country. Luckily many of the people that already lived in IPv6 also spoke IPv4, and being 
      bi-lingual made it possible for them to talk to their new fellow countrymen and to introduce 
      them to the language of their new country. Eventually the immigrants also became bilingual and 
      for some their frequent use of their new won language they made the transition from speaking IPv4 
      to IPv6. I was also common that the children of the immigrants only spoke IPv6, which was made 
      possible because of the bi-lingual skills of their parents. Some of the older people, like 
      grandparents than accompanied the families, kept their old habits and language which they spoke 
      among their kin and friends from the old country. To talk with their grandchildren they had to rely 
      on the bilingual parents to translate between children and grandparents. Eventually the need of 
      being bi-lingual became less important as time went by, and when the need will go away only time 
      can tell.</t>
      
      <t>Bi-lingual read Dual-Stack</t>
      <t>Starvation and diseases read Address pool depletion</t>
      <t>Migrate - move from one country or region to another and settle there</t>
      <t>Transition - a change of state</t>
