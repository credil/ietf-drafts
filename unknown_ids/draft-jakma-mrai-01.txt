Abstract

   This document briefly examines what is known about the effects of the
   BGP MRAI timer, particularly on convergence.  It highlights published
   work which suggests the MRAI interval as deployed has an adverse
   effect on the convergence time of BGP.

   It then recommends revised, lower default values for the MRAI timer,
   thought to be more suited to today's Internet environment.

Internet-Draft    BGP MRAI Timer Value Recommendations      October 2008


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Background

   The proper functioning of the [BGP] routing protocol is of great
   importance to the Internet.  Issues regarding matters of its
   stability and convergence have been documented widely, such as in
   [BGP-STAB], [bgp-converge] and [Potaroo0607].

   One such issue is the effect of 'Minimum Route Advertisement
   Interval' (MRAI).

2.1.  The MRAI Timer

   The Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI) timer is specified in
   RFC4271 [BGP].  This timer acts to rate-limit updates, on a per-
   destination basis.  [BGP] suggests values of 30s and 5s for this
   interval for eBGP and iBGP respectively.  The MRAI must also be
   applied to withdrawals according to RFC4271 [BGP], a change from the
   earlier RFC1771.

   Some implementations apply this rate-limiting on a per-peer basis,
   presumably an adequate approximation.  Some implementations apply it
   to withdrawal methods (often called "WRATE" in the literature).  Some
   implementations do not apply MRAI at all.

2.2.  Known effects of the MRAI timer on convergence

   The MRAI timer serves to suppress messages which BGP would otherwise
   send out to describe transitory states, and so allow BGP to converge
   with significantly fewer messages sent.  This beneficial effect of
   the MRAI timer, in terms of # of messages, increases as the timer is
   increased until an optimum value is reached, after which the
   beneficial effect stabilises. [bgp-converge] [mrai-final]

   In terms of convergence time, a similar beneficial effect is seen as
   the MRAI increases to the same optimum value.  However as the timer
   value is increased past the optimum, the convergence time increases
   again linearly - the scale of this increase is worse with WRATE.
   [bgp-converge] [mrai-final]

   The optimum MRAI timer value is dependent on several factors, most
   particularly the topology in its layout and propagation times.  The

   optimum value will differ between different subsets of the Internet.
   [mrai-final]

   It is believed to be infeasible to try directly calculate this value.
   However a useful approximation can be made from the diameter of the
   topology if it is known, along with some assumptions about the the
   topology, such as the latency between nodes. [mrai-internet]

   The interaction between extensions to BGP designed to improve
   convergence, such as those that allow propagation of additional
   and/or backup paths, and the MRAI timer is as yet unknown.  However,
   it seems reasonable to speculate these extensions might have the
   effect of leading to a lower optimum MRAI than would be indicated by
   an approximation based on the diameter of the BGP topology.  Further
   work on these questions would be useful.

2.3.  Interaction with Flap-Damping

   As the MRAI helps eliminate some updates, it interacts with flap-
   damping [BGP-DAMP].  The lower the MRAI timer, the greater the risk
   of crossing below the threshold of the optimum value.  If that
   threshold is crossed, there will be an increased number of updates
   somewhere within the BGP system, and hence an increased risk of paths
   being dampened, which otherwise would not.

   So, in presence of significant flap-damping deployment and given the
   uncertainty of what the optimum is, it is reasonable to err towards
   selecting a value of the MRAI timer significantly higher than the
   optimum.

   However, given that flap-damping increasingly is discouraged
   [RIPE-378] in Internet routing, this particular need to be
   conservative in the choice of MRAI timer value may be less important.

2.4.  Current Status of the MRAI

   The current recommended value of 30s may be far higher than is
   optimal for the Internet, based on observations of certain parameters
   related to its topology.  In [mrai-final] it is suggested that the
   optimal value may be between 5s ('semi-safe') to 15s ('safe').  The
   estimation of the 'safe' value here is of no relevance if WRATE is
   universally deployed, as in such a case the 'semi-safe' value and
   'safe' value are the same.  Further empirical work by the same
   authors [mrai-internet] suggests that the optimal, Internet MRAI may
   be below 5s.

   Further, [BGP-STAB] and [Potaroo0607] argue that operational
   conditions (e.g. different routers using different MRAI values) mean



Jakma                    Expires April 24, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    BGP MRAI Timer Value Recommendations      October 2008


   the MRAI is having an adverse effect even on the number of messages
   sent, and so further exacerbating convergence problems in the global
   BGP system, such as path hunting.  The [BGP-STAB] document goes
   further still and argues that MRAI be deprecated in favour of some
   better way of damping BGP UPDATES, however there are no clear
   proposals before the IDR as of this writing for such changes to BGP.


3.  Risk Evaluation in the Choice of MRAI Time

   Though there is an optimum value for the MRAI, it's unlikely that it
   can be determined empirically or otherwise for the general Internet.
   It may even not be possible, as the optimum MRAI will differ for
   different subsets of the Internet.  Some degree of guesstimation at a
   reasonable value for the MRAI is required, which is an exercise in
   risk; whether to err towards fast convergence at the risk of a
   disproportionate increase in BGP messaging, or to err to the side of
   an optimal number of messages at the expense of convergence.

   Arguably, economising on bandwidth and control-plane processing power
   is today less important than the convergence time of BGP, than in
   times past.  Presuming this, any new recommendations for the MRAI
   should seek to err slightly to the side of convergence, rather than
   erring towards minimising BGP traffic.

   Further, if we assume most implementations apply the MRAI to
   withdrawals, then the Internet BGP topology effectively is WRATE-
   enabled, and [mrai-final] suggests there is even less benefit to
   erring toward a higher MRAI.

   The most definite risk of lowering the MRAI is the increased risk of
   flap-damping, if the value is set too much below the optimum.
   Therefore, taking into account estimations of that optimum is
   required.  That said, at least one BGP implementation by default does
   not apply any MRAI at all.


4.  Recommended values for the MRAI

   The suggested default values for the
   MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer given in RFC4271 [BGP] are hereby
   revised to be 5s or less for eBGP connections, and 1s or less for
   iBGP connections, for use on Internet topologies.

   These values may not be suitable for topologies which differ from the
   internet, be that in scale, arrangement or otherwise.  Such non-
   internet, BGP topologies very likely would have significantly lower
   optimum values, assuming they are always significantly smaller in
