Internet-Draft       Civic Location Format Extension        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   In many cities in China, utility and lamp posts carry a unique
   identifier, which we call a pole number in this document.  In some
   countries, the label on the lamp post also carries the local
   emergency service number, such as "110", encouraging callers to use
   the pole number to identify their location.  This method is initially
   provided and implemented in China by Shenzhen police department.
   (One suspects that this is particularly useful in cities where street
   naming and numbering systems make it difficult to accurately identify
   locations.)

   The pole number is also useful to report broken street lights.  The
   major disadvantage is that callers would have to enter the pole
   number manually, although it may be possible in the future to simply
   point a camera phone at the number and have it recognize the number
   using pattern recognition.

   In this document, we define an extension of the civic address format
   [RFC XXXX] to carry such pole number information.  The following
   figure is a diagram for this kind of lamp post number. "110" in the
   circle is emergency service number or PSAP.

2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Additional Civic Address Type

   [RFC4776] and [RFC5139] provides a full set of parameters that may be
   used to describe a civic location.  Specifically, [RFC4776] lists
   several civic address types (CAtypes) that require support in the
   formal PIDF-LO definition that are not in [RFC4119].

   The new element, PN (pole number), is used to support Lamp Post
   number in street addresses.  The pole number can consist of any
   combination of letters and digits.  Punctuation characters and
   embedded spaces are ignored; lower and upper case letters are treated
   as equivalent.



   +-----------+--------+-------------------------------+--------------+
   | New Field | CAtype | Description                   | Example      |
   +-----------+--------+-------------------------------+--------------+
   | PN        |   40   | lamp post number              | A12101S      |
   +-----------+--------+-------------------------------+--------------+

              <civicAddress xml:lang="en-AU"
                xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4119] is relevant to this
   document.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  CAtype Registry Update

   This document updates the civic address type registry established by
   [RFC4776].  The "PIDF" column of the CAtypes table has been updated
   to include the types shown in the first column of Table 1.
