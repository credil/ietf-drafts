      <t> The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) defines extensions to the
      Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to support efficient re-
      authentication between the peer and an EAP Re-authentication (ER) server
      through a compatible authenticator. This document specifies Diameter
      support for ERP. It defines a new Diameter ERP application to transport
      ERP messages between an ER authenticator and the ER server, and a set of
      new AVPs that can be used to transport the cryptographic material needed
      by the re-authentication server. </t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>RFC5296 <xref target="RFC5296"></xref> defines the EAP
      Re-authentication Protocol (ERP). It consists of the following
      steps:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Bootstrapping"><vspace blankLines="1" />A root key for
          re-authentication is derived from the Extended Master Session Key
          (EMSK) created during EAP authentication <xref
          target="RFC5295"></xref>. This root key is transported from the EAP
          server to the ER server.</t>

          <t hangText="Re-authentication"><vspace blankLines="1" />A
          one-round-trip exchange between the peer and the ER server,
          resulting in mutual authentication. To support the EAP
          reauthentication functionality, ERP defines two new EAP codes -
          EAP-Initiate and EAP-Finish.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document defines how Diameter transports the ERP messages during
      the re-authentication process. For this purpose, we define a new
      Application Identifier for ERP, and re-use the Diameter EAP commands
      (DER/DEA). </t>

      <t>This document also discusses the distribution of the root key during
      bootstrapping, in conjunction with either the initial EAP authentication
      (implicit bootstrapping) or the first ERP exchange (explicit
      bootstrapping). Security considerations for this key distribution are
      detailed in RFC 5295 <xref target="RFC5295"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document uses terminology defined in RFC3748 <xref
      target="RFC3748"></xref>, RFC5295 <xref target="RFC5295"></xref>,
      RFC5296 <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>, and RFC4072 <xref
      target="RFC4072"></xref>.</t>

      <t>"Root key" (RK) or "bootstrapping material" refer to the rRK or rDSRK
      derived from an EMSK, depending on the location of the ER server in home
      or foreign domain.</t>

      <t>We use the notation "ERP/DER" and "ERP/DEA" in this document to refer
      to Diameter-EAP-Request and Diameter-EAP-Answer commands with the
      Application Id set to "Diameter ERP Application" Section 11.1; the same
      commands are denoted "EAP/DER" and "EAP/DEA" when the Application Id in
      the message is set to "Diameter EAP Application" <xref
      target="RFC4072"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Assumptions">
      <t> This document assumes the existence of at most one logical ER server
      entity in a domain. If several physical servers are deployed for
      robustness, a replication mechanism must be deployed to synchronize the
      ERP states (root keys) between these servers. This replication mechanism
      is out of the scope of this document. If multiple ER servers are
      deployed in the domain, we assume that they can be used interchangeably.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Overview" title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>The following figure shows the components involved in ERP, and their
      interactions.</t>

      <figure title="Figure 1. Diameter ERP Overview.">

(*) Diameter EAP application,  explicit bootstrapping scenario only.
                         </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The ER server is located either in the home domain (same as EAP
      server) or in the visited domain (same as authenticator, when it differs
      from the home domain). <cref>Can the ER server be located in a third
      domain (ex: broker's) according to ERP mechanism?</cref></t>

      <t> When the peer initiates an ERP exchange, the authenticator creates a
      Diameter-EAP-Request message <xref target="RFC4072"></xref>. The
      Application Id of the message is set to that of the Diameter ERP
      application (code: TBD) in the message. The generation of the ERP/DER
      message is detailed in <xref target="Re-authentication"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If there is an ER server in the same domain as the authenticator
      (local domain), Diameter routing must be configured so that this ERP/DER
      message reachs this server, even if the Destination-Realm is not the
      local domain.</t>

      <t>If there is no local ER server, the message is routed according to
      its Destination-Realm AVP content, extracted from the realm component of
      the keyName-NAI attribute. As specified in RFC5296 <xref
      target="RFC5296"></xref>, this realm is the home domain of the peer in
      case of bootstrapping exchange ('B' flag is set in ERP message) or the
      domain of the bootstrapped ER server otherwise <cref>This actually might
      allow the ER server to be in a third party realm</cref>.</t>

      <t>If no ER server is available in the home domain either, the ERP/DER
      message cannot be delivered, and an error DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER is
      generated as specified in <xref target="RFC3588"></xref> and returned to
      the authenticator. The authenticator may cache this information (with
      limited duration) to avoid further attempts for ERP with this realm. It
      may also fallback to full EAP authentication to authenticate the
      peer.</t>

      <t>When an ER server receives the ERP/DER message, it searches its local
      database for a root key <cref>and authorization state ?</cref> matching
      the keyName part of the User-Name AVP. If such key is found, the ER
      server processes the ERP message as described in <xref
      target="RFC5296"></xref> then creates the ERP/DEA answer as described in
      <xref target="Re-authentication"></xref>. The rMSK is included in this
      answer.</t>

      <t>Finally, the authenticator extracts the rMSK from the ERP/DEA as
      described in RFC5296 <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>, and forwards the
      content of the EAP-Payload AVP, the EAP-Finish/Re-Auth message, to the
      peer.</t>

      <t> If the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth message has its 'B' flag set
      (Bootstrapping exchange), the ER server should not possess the root key
      in its local database. In this case, the ER server acts as a proxy, and
      forwards the message to the home EAP server after changing its
      Application Id to Diameter EAP and adding the ERP-RK-Request AVP to
      request the root key. See section <xref target="Bootstrapping"></xref>
      for more detail on this process.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Bootstrapping" title="Bootstrapping the ER Server">
      <t>The bootstrapping process involves the home EAP server and the ER
      server, but also impacts the peer and the authenticator. In ERP, the
      peer must derive the same keying material as the ER server. To achieve
      this, it must learn the domain name of the ER server. How this
      information is acquired is outside the scope of this specification, but
      it may involves that the authenticator is configured to advertize this
      domain name, especially in the case of re-authentication after a
      handover.</t>

      <t>The bootstrapping of an ER server with a given root key happens
      either during the initial EAP authentication of the peer when the EMSK
      -- from which the root key is derived -- is created, during the first
      re-authentication, or sometime between those events. We only consider
      the first two possibilities in this specification, in the following
      sub-sections.</t>

      <section title="Bootstrapping During the Initial EAP authentication ">
        <t>Bootstrapping the ER server during the initial EAP authentication
        (also known as implicit bootstrapping) offers the advantage that the
        server is immediatly available for re-authentication of the peer, thus
        minimizing the re-authentication delay. On the other hand, it is
        possible that only a small number of peers will use re-authentication
        in the visited domain. Deriving and caching key material for all the
        peers (for example, for the peers that do not support ERP) is a waste
        of resources and should be avoided.</t>

        <t>To achieve implicit bootstrapping, the ER server acts as a Diameter
        EAP Proxy , and Diameter routing must be configured so that Diameter
        EAP application messages are routed through this proxy. The figure
        bellow illustrates this mechanism. </t>

        <t>The ER server proxies the first DER of the full EAP authentication
        and adds the ERP-RK-Request AVP inside, if this AVP is not already in
        the message (which might happen if there are several ER servers on the
        path), then forwards the request.</t>

        <t> If the EAP server does not support the ERP extensions, it simply
        ignores the ERP-RK-Request AVP and continues as specified in RFC 4072
        <xref target="RFC4072"></xref>. If the server supports the ERP
        extensions, it saves the value of the ERP-Realm AVP found inside the
        ERP-RK-Request AVP, and continues with the EAP authentication. When
        the authentication completes, if it is successful and the EAP method
        has generated an EMSK, the server MUST derive the rRK as specified in
        RFC 5296 <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>, using the saved domain name.
        It then includes the rRK inside a Key AVP Section 8.3 with the
        Key-Type AVP set to rRK, before sending the DEA as usual. </t>

        <t> When the ER server proxies a Diameter-EAP-Answer message with a
        Session-Id corresponding to a message to which it added an ERP-RK-
        Request AVP, and the Result-Code is DIAMETER_SUCCESS, it MUST examine
        the message and save and remove any Key AVP Section 8.3 with Key-Type
        AVP set to rRK. If the message does not contain such Key AVP, the ER
        server may cache the information that ERP is not possible for this
        session to avoid possible subsequent attempts. In any case, the
        information stored in ER server concerning a session should not have a
        lifetime greater than the EMSK for this session. <cref>how does the ER
        server knows the EMSK lifetime, if there is no ERP-RK-Answer? What is
        the lifetime of the MSK for example?</cref></t>

        <t> If the ER server is successfully bootstrapped, it should also add
        the ERP-Realm AVP after removing the Key AVP with Key-Type of rRK in
        the EAP/DEA message. This ERP-Realm information can be used by the
        authenticator to notify the peer that ER server is bootstrapped, and
        for which domain. How this information can be transmitted to the peer
        is outside the scope of this document. This information needs to be
        sent to the peer if both implicit and explicit bootstrapping
        mechanisms are possible, because the ERP message and the root key used
        for protecting this message are different in bootstrapping exchanges
        and non-bootstrapping exchanges. <cref>Is it possible? It would be
        useful...</cref></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Bootstrapping During the First Re-authentication">
        <t> Bootstrapping the ER server during the first re-authentication
        (also known as explicit bootstrapping) is less resource-consuming,
        since root keys are generated and cached only when needed. On the
        other hand, in that case first re-authentication requires a
        one-round-trip exchange with the home EAP server, which is less
        efficient than the implicit bootstrapping scenario. </t>

        <t> The ER server receives the ERP/DER message containing the EAP-
        Initiate/Re-Auth message with the 'B' flag set. It proxies this
        message, and performs the following processing in addition to standard
        proxy operations: <list>
            <t> Changes the Application Id in the header of the message to
            Diameter EAP Application (code 5). </t>

            <t>Change the content of Application-Auth-Id accordingly. </t>

            <t> QUESTION: Is it better to leave it unmodified, so that the
            server can easily differenciate between ERP and standard EAP
            message?</t>

            <t> Add the ERP-RK-Request AVP, which contains the name of the
            domain where the ER server is located. </t>

            <t> PROBLEM: Add the Destination-Host AVP to reach the appropriate
            Diameter EAP server in case there is more than one in destination
            domain, the one with the EMSK. How does the ER server know this
            information? Or can we require that all Diameter EAP servers can
            be used interchangeably for this purpose? </t>
          </list>Then the proxied EAP/DER request is sent and routed to the
        home Diameter EAP server. </t>

        <t>If the home EAP server does not support ERP extensions, it replies
        with an error since the encapsulated EAP-Initiate/Re-auth command is
        not understood. Otherwise, it processes the ERP request as described
        in <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>. In particular, it includes the
        Domain- Name TLV attribute with the content from the ERP-Realm AVP. It
        creates the EAP/DEA reply message <xref target="RFC4072"></xref>.
        including an instance of the Key AVP Section 8.3 with Key-Type AVP set
        to rRK. <cref>What about authorization AVPs ?</cref></t>

        <t> The ER server receives this EAP/DEA and proxies it as follows, in
        addition to standard proxy operations: <list>
            <t>Set the Application Id back to Diameter ERPApplication Id (code
            TBD<cref>TBD IANA</cref>)</t>

            <t> Extract and cache the content of the Key AVP with Key-Type set
            to rRK, as described in implicit scenario. <cref>And authorization
            AVPs ?</cref></t>
          </list> The ERP/DEA message is then forwarded to the authenticator,
        that can use the rMSK as described in RFC 5296 <xref

    <section anchor="Issues" title="Open issues">
      <t>This document does not address some known issues in Diameter ERP
      mechanism. The authors would like to hear ideas about how to address
      them. </t>

      <t> The main issue is the use of ERP for authentication after a handover
      of the peer to a new authenticator (or different authenticator port).
      Diameter ERP is not meant to be a mobility application. A number of
      issues appear when we try to do handover while using Diameter ERP: <list>
          <t>how to manage the Session-Id AVP -- is it a new session each
          time, or do we try to reuse the same Diameter session?; </t>

          <t>how does the ER authenticator acquire the Authorization AVPs? Is
          it cached in the Diameter ER server (received during bootstrapping)
          or do we use first Authenticate-Only with ER server, then
          Authorize-Only with home domain (and in that case how does the ER
          authenticator learn what the home domain is?) </t>

          <t>how does the peer learn the ERP domain of the new authenticator
          -- this is being addressed in HOKEY architecture draft; </t>

          <t>how does the home server reachs the peer to for example terminate
          the session if there is no notification sent to the home domain;
          </t>
        </list></t>

      <t> Another issue concerns the case where the home realm contains
      several EAP servers. In multi rounds full EAP authentication, the
      Destination-Host AVP provides the solution to reach the same server
      across the exchanges. Only this server possess the EMSK for the session.
      In case of explicit bootstrapping, the ER server must therefore be able
      to reach the correct server to request the DSRK. A solution might
      consist in saving the Origin-Host AVP of all successful EAP/DEA in the
      ER server, which is a bit similar to the implicit bootstrapping scenario
      described here -- only we save the server name instead of the root key,
      and we must then be able to match the DSRK with the user name. </t>

      <t> In roaming environments, it might be useful that a broker provides
      ERP services. The security implications of storing the DSRK generated
      for the visited domain into the broker's server should be studied. </t>

      <t>Finally, this document currently lacks a description of what happens
      when a Re-Auth-Request is received for a peer on the authenticator. </t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations from the following documents apply here:

        </list></t>

      <t>FFS: Do we really respect these security considerations with the
      mechanism we describe here? Is it safe to use ERP-RK-Request &amp; Key
      AVPs? What is the worst case? For example if a domain tricks the peer
      into beliving it is located in a different domain? </t>

      <t> EAP channel bindings may be necessary to ensure that the Diameter
      client and the server are in sync regarding the key Requesting Entity's
      Identity. Specifically, the Requesting Entity advertises its identity
      through the EAP lower layer, and the user or the EAP peer communicates
      that identity to the EAP server (and the EAP server communicates that
      identity to the Diameter server) via the EAP method for user/peer to
      server verification of the Requesting Entity's Identity. </t>
