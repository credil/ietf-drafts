1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes three Header Extensions that may be used 
   with both Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation, ULE, [RFC4326] 
   and the Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) [GSE]. ULE is defined for 
   links that employ the MPEG-2 Transport Stream, and supports a wide 
   variety of physical-layer bearers [RFC4259].  
    
   GSE has been designed for the Generic Mode (also known as the 
   Generic Stream (GS)), offered by second-generation DVB physical 
   layers, and in the first instance for DVB-S2 [ETSI-S2]. The 
   requirements for the Generic Stream are described in [ID-S2-REQ]. 
   The important characteristics of this encapsulation are described in 
   an Appendix to this document. GSE maintains a design philosophy that 
   presents a common network interface to that of ULE and uses a 
   similar construction for SubNetwork Data Unit (SNDUs). 
 
   The first Extension Header defines a method that allows one or more 
   TS-Packets [ISO-MPEG2] to be sent within a ULE SNDU. This method may 
   be used to provide control plane information including the 
   transmission of MPEG-2 Program Specific Information (PSI) for the 
   Multiplex. In GSE, there is no native support for transport stream 
   packets and this method is therefore suitable for providing an MPEG-
   2 control plane. 
    
   A second Extension Header allows one or more PDUs to be sent within 
   the same ULE SNDU. This method is designed for cases where a large 
   number of small PDUs are directed to the same Network Point of 
   Attachment (NPA) address. The method may improve transmission 
   efficiency (by removing duplicated MAC layer overhead). It can also 
   reduce processing overhead for receivers that are not addressed by 
   the NPA, since these receivers may then skip several PDUs in one 
   operation. The method is defined as a generic Extension Header and 
   may be used for IPv4 or IPv6 packets. If and when a compression 
   format is defined for ULE or Ethernet, the method may also be used 
   in combination with this method. 
    
   A third Extension Header provides an optional timestamp value for an 
   SNDU. Examples of the use of this timestamp option include 
   monitoring and benchmarking of ULE and GSE links. Receivers that do 
   not wish to decode (or do not support) the timestamp extension may 
   discard the extension and process the remaining PDU or Extension 
   Headers. 
    
   An appendix includes a summary of key design issues and 
   considerations based on the GSE Specification defined by the DVB 
   Technical Module [GSE].

3. Description of the Method 
    
   In ULE, a Type field value that is less than 1536 Decimal indicates 
   an Extension Header.  This section describes a set of three 
   extension formats for the ULE encapsulation. [GSE] uses a Type field 
   that adopts the same semantics as specified by RFC 4326. The 
   encapsulation format differs in that GSE does not include a per-SNDU 
   CRC, has different header flags, and utilises a different SNDU 
   length calculation [GSE].  
   There is a natural ordering of extension headers, which is 
   determined by the fields upon which the extension header operates. A 
   suitable ordering for many applications is presented in the list 
   below (from first to last header within an SNDU). This does not 
   imply that all types of Extensions should be present in a single 
   SNDU. The presented ordering may serve as a guideline for 
   optimisation of Receiver processing. 
    
   +----------------------------------+-------------------------------+ 
   |Fields related to Extension Header| Example Extension Headers     |      
   +----------------------------------+-------------------------------+ 
   | Link framing and transmission    | Timestamp Extension           | 
   +----------------------------------+-------------------------------+ 
   | Entire remaining SNDU Payload    | Encryption Extension          | 
   +----------------------------------+-------------------------------+ 
   | Group of encapsulated PDUs       | PDU-Concat or TS-Concat       | 
   +----------------------------------+-------------------------------+ 
   | Specific encapsulated PDU        | IEEE-defined type             |               
   |                                  | Test or MAC bridging Extension| 
   +----------------------------------+-------------------------------+ 
    
   Table 1: Recommended ordering of Extension Headers 
    
 
3.1 MPEG-2 TS-Concat Extension  
    
   The MPEG-2 TS-Concat Extension Header is specified by an IANA 
   assigned H-Type value of 0x0002 in hexadecimal. This is a Mandatory 
   Next-Header Extension.   
    
   The extension is used to transport one or more MPEG-2 TS Packets 
   within a ULE SNDU. The number of TS Packets carried in a specific 
   SNDU is determined from the size of the remainder of the payload 
   following the MPEG-2 TS Extension Header. The number of TS Packets 
   contained in the SNDU is therefore (Length-N-10+D*6) / 188, where N 
   is the number of bytes associated with Extension Headers that 
   precede the MPEG-2 TS-Concat Extension (zero if there are none).  
    
   A Receiver MUST check the validity of the Length value prior to 
   processing the payload. A valid Length contains an integral number 
   of TS Packets. An invalid Length (a remainder from the division by 
   188) MUST result in the discard of all encapsulated TS Packets and 
   SHOULD be recorded as TS-Concat size mismatch error.

   Figure 1 illustrates the format of this Extension Header for ULE 
   with a value D=0, which indicates the presence of a NPA address 
   [RFC4326]. In this case, the valid payload Length for a ULE SNDU 
   with no other extensions is (Length-10) / 188.  
    
   The method used to define the Length in GSE differs to that of ULE. 
   The equivalent case for GSE would result in a payload Length value 
   of (Length-6) / 188 (Figure 2).

   Fragmented GSE SNDUs are protected by a CRC-32 carried in the final 
   fragment. After reassembly, this CRC-32 is removed and the resulting 
   SNDU carries a Total Length field. The fields labelled S and E are 
   defined by [GSE] and contain control flags used by the GSE link 
   layer. The Label Type field (LT) specifies the presence and format 
   of the GSE label. The LT field is only specified for the first 
   fragment (or a non-fragmented) GSE SNDU (i.e. when S=1). 
    
   In ULE, a value of D=1, is also permitted and indicates the absence 
   of a NPA address (Figure 3). A similar format is supported in GSE.

   This extension may be used to transport one or more MPEG-2 TS 
   Packets of arbitrary content, interpreted according to [ISO-MPEG2]. 
   One expected use is for the transmission of MPEG-2 SI/PSI 
   signalling. 
    
   NULL TS Packets [ISO-MPEG2] SHOULD NOT be sent using this 
   encapsulation. To reduce transmission overhead and processing, an 
   Encapsulator SHOULD specify a maximum period of time that it can 
   wait before sending all queued TS Packets. This is known as the TS 
   Packing Threshold. This value MUST be bounded and SHOULD be 
   configurable in the Encapsulator. A larger value can improve 
   efficiency, but incurs higher jitter and could increase the 
   probability of corruption. If additional TS Packets are NOT received 
   within the TS Packing Threshold, the Encapsulator MUST immediately 
   send any queued TS Packets.  
    
   The use of this format to transfer MPEG-2 clock references (e.g. a 
   Network Clock Reference, NCR) over ULE/GSE framing raises timing 
   considerations at the encapsulation gateway, including the need to

   carry this Extension Header are placed before other data within the 
   BBFrame DataField [GSE]. 
    
   This document does not specify how TS Packets are to be handled at 
   the Receiver, however it notes that a poorly configured Encapsulator 
   could lead to a Multiplex carrying multiple (possibly conflicting) 
   sets of TS Logical Channels and SI information encapsulated at 
   different levels or with different NPA addresses. The need for 
   consistency in the use of PIDs and the related SI information is 
   described in [RFC4947]. 
    
    
3.2 PDU-Concat Extension 
    
   The PDU-Concat Extension Header is specified by an IANA assigned H-
   Type value of 0x0003 in hexadecimal. This is a Mandatory Next-Header 
   Extension.  It enables a sequence of (usually short) PDUs to be sent 
   within a single SNDU payload.  
    
   The base header contains the Length of the entire SNDU. This carries 
   the value of the combined length of all PDUs to be encapsulated, 
   including each set of encapsulation headers. The base header MAY be 
   followed by one or more additional Extension Headers that precede 
   the PDU-Concat Extension Header. These Extension Headers (e.g. a 
   TimeStamp Extension) apply to the composite concatenated PDU. 
    
   The Extension Header also contains a 16-bit ULE Type field 
   describing the encapsulated PDU, PDU-Concat-Type. Although any Type 
   value specified in the ULE Next-Header Registry (including Extension 
   Header Types) may be assigned to the encapsulated PDU (except the 
   recursive use of a PDU-Concat type), all concatenated PDUs MUST have 
   a common ULE Type (i.e. all concatenated PDUs passed by the network 
   layer must be associated with the same Type value). This simplifies 
   the receiver design, and reduces the transmission overhead for 
   common use cases.  
 
   Each PDU is prefixed by its length in bytes (shown as PDU-Length in 
   the following diagrams). Encapsulated PDUs are of arbitrary length 
   (in bytes) and are not necessarily aligned to 16-bit or 32-bit 
   boundaries within the SNDU (as shown in the figure). The most 
   significant bit of the first byte is reserved, R, and this 
   specification requires that this MUST be set to zero. Receivers MUST 
   ignore the value of the R bit. The length of each PDU MUST be less 
   than 32758 bytes, but will generally be much smaller.  
 
   When the SNDU header indicates the presence of an SNDU Destination 
   Address field (i.e. D=0 in ULE), a Network Point of Attachment, NPA, 
   field directly follows the fourth byte of the SNDU header. NPA 
   destination addresses are 6 Byte numbers, normally expressed in 
   hexadecimal, used to identify the Receiver(s) in a transmission 
   network that should process a received SNDU.  When present the 
   Receiver MUST associate the same specified MAC/NPA address with all

   PDUs within the SNDU Payload. This MAC/NPA address MUST also be 
   forwarded with each PDU, if required by the forwarding interface.

   When the SNDU header indicates the absence of an SNDU Destination 
   Address field (i.e. D=1 in ULE) all encapsulated PDUs MUST be 
   processed as if they had been received without an NPA address. 
    
   The value of D in the ULE header indicates whether a NPA/MAC address 
   is in use [RFC4326]. A similar format is supported in GSE (using the 
   LT field).

   To reduce transmission overhead and processing, an Encapsulator 
   SHOULD specify a maximum period of time it will wait before sending 
   a Concatenated PDU. This is known as the PDU Packing Threshold. This 
   value MUST be bounded and SHOULD be configurable in the 
   Encapsulator. A larger value can improve efficiency, but incurs 
   higher jitter and could increase the probability of corruption. If 
   additional PDUs are NOT received within the PDU Packing Threshold, 
   the Encapsulator MUST immediately send all queued PDUs.  
    
   The Receiver processes this Extension Header by verifying that it 
   supports the specified PDU-Concat Type (unsupported Types MUST be 
   discarded, but the receiver SHOULD record a PDU-Type error 
   [RFC4326]).  It then extracts each encapsulated PDU in turn. The 
   Receiver MUST verify the Length of each PDU. It MUST also ensure 
   that the sum of the Lengths of all processed PDUs equals the Length 
   specified in the SNDU base header. A Receiver SHOULD discard the 
   whole SNDU if the total and PDU sizes are not consistent and this 
   event SHOULD be recorded as a PDU-Concat size mismatch error. A 
   receiver MUST NOT forward a partial PDU with an indicated PDU-Length 
   greater than the number of unprocessed bytes remaining in the SNDU 
   payload field.

   3.3 Timestamp Extension 
 
   The Timestamp Extension Header is an Optional Next-Header Extension 
   that permits an Encapsulator to add a timestamp field to an SNDU. 
   The Timestamp Extension Header is specified by the IANA-assigned H-
   Type value of 257 decimal. This extension is an Optional Extension 
   Header ([RFC4326], Section 5).  
    
   This extension is designed to support monitoring and measurement of 
   the performance of a link to indicate the quality of an operational 
   ULE link. This may be useful for GSE links (e.g. where significant 
   complexity exists in the scheduling provided by the lower layers).  
   Possible uses of this extension include: 
    
   * Validation of in-sequence ordering per Logical Channel, 
   * Measurement of one-way delay (when synchronised with the sender) 
   * Measurement of PDU Jitter introduced by the link, 
   * Measurement of PDU loss (with additional information from sender). 
 
    
   Figure 7 shows the format of this extension with a HLEN value of 3 
   indicating a timestamp of length 4B with a Type field (there is no 
   implied byte-alignment).

         Figure 7 The format of the 32-bit Timestamp Extension Header 
    
    
   The extension carries a 32-bit value (time stamp HI plus time stamp 
   LO). The specified resolution is 1 microsecond. The value therefore 
   indicates the number of 1 microsecond ticks past the hour in 
   Universal Time when the PDU was encapsulated. This value may be 
   earlier than the time of transmission due for example to Packing, 
   queuing and other Encapsulator processing. The value is right-
   justified to the 32-bit field. Systems unable to insert timestamps 
   at the specified resolution may use an arbitrary (and varying) value 
   to pad the unused least-significant bits. 
    
   The last two bytes carry a 16-bit Type field that indicates the type 
   of payload carried in the SNDU, or the presence of a further Next-
   Header ([RFC4326], Section 4.4). 
    
   Receivers MAY process the timestamp when the PDU encapsulation is 
   removed. Receivers that do not implement, or do not wish to process, 
   the Timestamp Extension MAY skip this extension header. Receivers 
   MUST continue to process the remainder of the SNDU, forwarding the 
   encapsulated PDU.

4. IANA Considerations  
    
   This document requires IANA involvement for the assignment of three 
   new Next-Header Type values from the IANA ULE Next-Header Registry. 
   These options are defined for specific use cases envisaged by GSE, 
   but are compatible with ULE.  
    
   The following assignments have been made in this document, and 
   registered by IANA: 
    
         Type      Name                             Reference 
    
         2:       TS-Concat                        Section 3.1 
         3:       PDU-Concat                       Section 3.2 
         
         Type      Name                    H-LEN   Reference 
    
         257:      Timestamp                3      Section 3.3 
    
 
   The TS-Concat Extension is a Mandatory next-type Extension Header, 
   specified in section 3.1 of this document. The value of this next-
   header is defined by an IANA assigned H-Type value of 0x0002. 
    
   The PDU-Concat Extension is a Mandatory next-type Extension Header 
   specified in section 3.2 of this document. The value of this next-
   header is defined by an IANA assigned H-Type value of 0x0003. 
    
   The Timestamp Extension is an Optional next-type Extension Header 
   specified in section 3.3 of this document. The value of this next-
   header is defined by an IANA assigned H-Type value of 257 decimal. 
   This documents defines format for a HLEN value of 0x3.

APPENDIX: The Second Generation DVB Transmission Specifications 
    
   This section provides informative background to the network layer 
   requirements of the second generation DVB Transmission 
   Specifications. The second generation waveforms specified by the 
   Digital Video Broadcasting project offer two main enhancements.  
   First, more efficient physical layer methods that employ higher 
   order modulation with stronger FEC and permit adaptive coding and 
   modulation response to changes in traffic and propagation 
   conditions. Second, at the link layer, they offer greater 
   flexibility in framing. Support is provided for a range of stream 
   formats including the classical Transport Stream (TS) [RFC4259]. In 
   addition, a new method called Generic Streams (GS) (or the Generic 
   Mode) is supported. A GS can be packetized or continuous and is 
   intended to provide native transport of other network-layer 
   services. One such method is that provided by the Generic Stream 
   Encapsulation (GSE) [GSE].  
    
   For example, the DVB-S2 [ETSI-S2] transmission link sequentially 
   multiplexes a series of baseband frames (BBFrames). Each BBFrame 
   comprises a fixed-size 10B header and a payload. The payload carries 
   a DataField and uses padding to fill any unused space. A stream 
   comprises a sequence of BBFrames associated with an Input Stream 
   Identifier (ISI) that is carried in the header of each BBFrame.  The 
   simplest scheme uses a single stream (with just one ISI value), but 
   multiple streams are permitted. The BBFrames forming a stream may be 
   of variable size (selected from a set of allowed sizes), and must 
   use the same stream format (e.g. TS or GSE). Each stream represents 
   an independent link with independent address resolution [RFC4947]. 
    
   GSE provides functions that are equivalent to those of the 
   Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) [RFC4326].  It 
   supports the transmission of IP packets and other network-layer 
   protocols. The network-layer interface resembles that of ULE, where 
   it adopts common mechanisms for a Length field, a 16-bit Type field, 
   and support for Extension Headers. As in ULE, GSE permits multiple 
   address formats, indicated by the LT field (functionally equivalent 
   to the D field in ULE). The default addressing mode uses a 6-byte 
   NPA and a suppressed NPA address (functionally equivalent to D=1 in 
   ULE). 
    
   GSE also provides more flexible fragmentation at the interface to 
   the physical layer (using the S and E flags). This adapts the SNDUs 
   to a variable-sized link-layer frame, and reflects the more complex 
   requirements in terms of fragmentation and assembly that arise when 
   using point-to-multipoint adaptive physical layers. The integrity of 
   a reassembled SNDUs is provided by a CRC-32 in the last fragment for 
   the corresponding PDU.

   DOCUMENT HISTORY 
    
   Individual Draft 00 
   This draft complements a study item in the DVB-GBS in this area to 
   define a Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE).  Comments relating to 
   this document will be gratefully received by the author(s) and may 
   also be sent to ip-dvb mailing list. 
    
   Individual Draft 01 
   Co-Author Added. 
   This draft updates the language and format. 
   This draft fixes problems with the concatenation mode, and defines a 
   new header format that restricts the use of the Type field so that 
   all concatenated PDUs MUST have the same Type. 
    
   Future versions of this draft may define additional Extension 
   Headers, proposals and ideas are welcome via the IETF ipdvb mailing 
   list. Possible extensions include those for encapsulation FEC, Link 
   parameter negotiation (e.g. for header compression), and support for 
   ATM/ULE.
