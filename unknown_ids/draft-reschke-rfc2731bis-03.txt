1.  Introduction

   [RFC2731] defines "Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML".  Newer
   specifications published by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative [1]
   (DCMI) over the last decade, in particular "Expressing Dublin Core
   metadata using HTML/XHTML meta and link elements" (DC-HTML,
   <http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-html/>), have obsoleted this
   work.

      Note: Implementers of RFC 2731 should note that DC-HTML introduces
      a new requirement with respect to the use of the "head" element's
      "profile" attribute.


2.  Recommendation to Reclassify RFC 2731

   This document recommends that the IESG reclassify [RFC2731] as
   Historic.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document is of adminstrative nature only and therefore there are
   no security relations related to it.


4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

Appendix A.  Related Discussion on DC-ARCHITECTURE Mailing list (to be
             removed by RFC Editor before publication)

   This proposal has been discussed and approved on the DC-ARCHITECTURE
   mailing list (<DC-ARCHITECTURE@JISCMAIL.AC.UK>, <https://
   www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/
   webadmin?A2=DC-ARCHITECTURE;XwVOng;20090818152516%2B0200>).


Appendix B.  Change Log (to be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

B.1.  Since draft-reschke-rfc2732bis-02

   Added John Kunze as Co-Author.  Expand Security Considerations to say
   why there aren't any.  Include title of RFC 2731 into this document's
   title.  Mention that Dublin Core has maintained its version of the
   spec for the last decade.  Add open issue "historic", which is
   waiting for community feedback.


Appendix C.  Resolved issues (to be removed by RFC Editor before
             publication)

   Issues that were either rejected or resolved in this version of this
   document.

C.1.  edit

   Type: edit

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2009-09-09): Umbrella issue for
   editorial fixes/enhancements.

C.2.  title

   Type: edit

   ietfdbh@comcast.net (2009-09-09): Include the title of RFC 2731 into
   this document's title.

Internet-Draft            RFC 2731 is Obsolete              October 2009


   Resolution (2009-10-04): Done.

C.3.  sec

   In Section 3:

   Type: edit

   sm@resistor.net (2009-09-10): LC feedback: explain why there are no
   Security Considerations.

   Resolution: Done.


Appendix D.  Open issues (to be removed by RFC Editor prior to
             publication)

D.1.  historic

   In Section 2:

   Type: change

   julian.reschke@greenbytes.de (2009-10-08): It's not clear whether
   this case is really a candidate for reclassification as "historic".
   After all, the format that was described in RFC 2731 is still in use
   in Dublin Core's DC-HTML; it just got revised.  So simply stating
   that it is obsolete (which would be implied by publishing this
   document) should be enough.
