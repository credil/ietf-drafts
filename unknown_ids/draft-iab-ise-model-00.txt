                         draft-iab-ise-model-00

Abstract

   This document describes the function and responsibilities of the
   Independent Stream Editor (ISE).  The Independent Stream is one of
   the Stream Producers, with the ISE as its Stream Approver.  The ISE
   is overall responsible for activities within the Independent Stream,
   working with draft editors and reviewers, and interacts with the RFC
   Production Centre and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor.  The ISE
   is appointed by the IAB, and also interacts with the IETF
   Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC).

Internet-Draft     Independent Submission Editor Model    September 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Independent Submissions Editor roles and responsibilities were
   documented in "RFC Editor Model (version 1)" [RFC5620].  In the light
   of experience, we see that having it there gave rise to some
   confusion as to where and how the ISE fits into the RFC Editor model.
   To reduce that confusion, the ISE material has been moved into this
   document.

2.  Independent Submission Editor

   The Independent Submission Editor (ISE) is the head of the
   Independent Submission Stream of RFCs, as defined by [RFC4844].  The
   Independent Stream and the Independent Submission Editor are not
   under the authority or direction of the RSE.  As noted below, the ISE
   is appointed by and is responsible directly to the IAB.

2.1.  Qualifications

   The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for which the
   following qualifications are desired:

   1.  Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience and
       perspective across the whole range of Internet technologies and
       applications, and specifically, the ability to work effectively
       with portions of that spectrum in which no personal expertise
       exists.

   2.  Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.

   3.  An ability to define and constitute advisory and document review
       arrangements.  If those arrangements include an Editorial Board
       similar to the current one or some equivalent arrangement, assess
       the technical competence of potential Editorial Board members.

   4.  Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond the IETF.

   5.  Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the English
       language, and demonstrated history of being able to work
       effectively with technical documents and materials created by
       others.

   6.  The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor environment with
       divided authority and responsibility similar to that described in
       [I-D.iab-rfc-editor-model-v2].

2.2.  Responsibilities

   The Independent Submission Editor is an individual who may have
   assistants and who is responsible for:

   1.  Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission
       stream.

   2.  Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.

   3.  Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission Stream to the
       RFC Production Center.

   4.  Reviewing and approving Independent Submissions RFC errata.

   5.  Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series policies
       as specified by the IAB and RSE.

   6.  Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the RSE
       and/or IAOC.

   The Independent Submission Editor may seek support from an advisory
   board (see [RFC4846]) and may form a team to perform the activities
   needed to fulfill their responsibilities.  The individual with the
   listed qualifications will be selected by the IAB after input is
   collected from the community.  An approach similar to the one used by
   the IAB to select an IAOC member every other year as described in
   [RFC4333] should be used.  While the ISE itself is considered a
   volunteer function, the IAB considers maintaining the Independent
   Submission stream part of the IAB's supported activities, and will
   include the expenses made for the support of the ISE in its IASA-
   supported budget.

3.  Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board

   The Independent Submission Editor is supported by an Editorial Board
   for the review of Independent Submission stream documents.  This
   board is known as the Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board.
   This volunteer Editorial Board exists at the pleasure of the ISE, and
   the members serve at the pleasure of the ISE.  The existence of this
   board is simply noted within this model, and additional discussion of
   such is considered out of scope of this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
   values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.
