1.  Introduction

   RFC 2616 [RFC2616] - the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   specification - defined the 'Warning' header field, that is used to
   transfer minor warnings to HTTP hosts.  This header field uses
   warning codes, that should be assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA), for identifying warnings, but no appropriate
   registry has been created so far.  This document establishes such
   registry and updates RFC 2616 [RFC2616].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Registry Description

2.1. The Name of the Registry

   The name of created registry is 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   Warning Codes'.

2.2. The Format of the Registry

   The 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Warning Codes' registry
   consists of 3 values: Warning Code, Description and Reference. They
   are described below:

     Warning Code - an integer; refers to the value used in 'Warning'
     header field. Values form 100 to 299 are assigned.  Values 100-199
     are used for identifying warnings connected with caching and refer
     to freshness and validity of cached data.  Values 200-299 refer to
     other persistent warnings.

     Description - a brief decryption of warning code.

     Reference - the reference document, that defines the warning code.

2.3. Registration Procedures

   New assignments to 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Warning Codes'
   registry SHALL be made following the 'IETF Consensus' policies.
   [RFC5226]

2.4. The Initial Contents of the Registry

   This section contains the initial contents of the 'Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) Warning Codes' registry.

3.  Security Considerations

   Creation of this registry does not introduce any new security issues
   to HTTP.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create the 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   Warning Codes' registry following Section 2 of this document.
