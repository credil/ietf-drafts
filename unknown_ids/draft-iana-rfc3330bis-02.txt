Abstract

   This document obsoletes RFC 3330.  It describes the global and other
   specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  It does not address IPv4
   address space assigned to operators and users through the Regional
   Internet Registries.  It also does not address allocations or
   assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous system numbers.  Special
   IPv6 addresses are described in a companion document that will be
   published as RFC5156.

Internet-Draft         Special Use IPv4 Addresses               May 2008


1.  Introduction

   Throughout its entire history, the Internet has employed a central
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible for the
   allocation and assignment of various identifiers needed for the
   operation of the Internet [RFC1174].  In the case of the IPv4 address
   space, the IANA allocates parts of the address space to Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) according to their established needs.
   These Regional Internet Registries are responsible for the assignment
   of IPv4 addresses to operators and users of the Internet within their
   regions.

   This document is a revision of RFC 3330 [RFC3330], which it
   obsoletes; its primary purpose is to re-publish the technical content
   of RFC 3330 mostly unchanged as a Best Current Practice RFC.

   Minor portions of the IPv4 address space have been allocated or
   assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized
   purposes.  These allocations and assignments have been documented in
   a variety of RFCs and other documents.  This document is intended to
   collect these scattered references and provide a current list of
   special use IPv4 addresses.

   On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated by the IETF to make
   assignments in support of the Internet Standards Process [RFC2860].
   Section 5 of this document describes that assignment process.

   The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
   "IETF Consensus", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to
   refer to the processes described in [RFC5226].  The keywords MUST,
   MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
   SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  Differences between this document and RFC 3330

   Address blocks that were reserved for a special purpose in RFC 3330
   but are no longer reserved for any special purpose and are available
   for allocation are no longer listed in Sections 4 or 5.  The
   following blocks have changes: 14.0.0.0/8 is no longer set aside for
   assignments to the international system of Public Data Networks



Cotton                  Expires November 29, 2008               [Page 3]

   [RFC1700], page 181].  It is now available for allocation to RIRs in
   the normal way. 24.0.0.0/8 is no longer listed as the addresses in
   that block have been managed by the American Registry for Internet
   Numbers (ARIN) in the normal way since 2001. 39.0.0.0/8 is no longer
   listed as it has been subject to allocation to an RIR for assignment
   in the normal manner since 2001. 128.0.0.0/16 is not reserved and is
   subject to future allocation by a Regional Internet Registry for
   assignment in the normal manner. 191.255.0.0/16 is not reserved and
   is subject to future allocation by a RIR for assignment in the normal
   manner. 192.0.0.0/24 is not reserved and is subject to future
   allocation by a RIR for assignment in the normal manner.
   223.255.255.0/24 is not reserved and is subject to future allocation
   by an RIR for assignment in the normal manner.


4.  Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks

   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for this
   host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to
   refer to specified hosts on this network [RFC1700], page 4.

   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block should not appear on the public Internet.

   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned for use as the Internet host
   loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher level protocol to an
   address anywhere within this block should loop back inside the host.
   This is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback,
   but no addresses within this block should ever appear on any network
   anywhere [RFC1700], page 5.

   128.0.0.0/16 - This block, corresponding to the numerically lowest of
   the former Class B addresses, was initially reserved by the IANA.
   Given the present classless nature of the IP address space, the basis
   for the reservation no longer applies and addresses in this block are
   subject to future allocation by a Regional Internet Registry for
   assignment in the normal manner.

   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  As described in
   [RFC3927], it is allocated for communication between hosts on a
   single link.  Hosts obtain these addresses by auto-configuration,
   such as when a DHCP server may not be found.

   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block should not appear on the public Internet.

Internet-Draft         Special Use IPv4 Addresses               May 2008


   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  Addresses within this block should not appear on the
   public Internet.

   192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay
   anycast addresses, according to [RFC3068].

   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block should not appear on the public Internet.

   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
   tests of network interconnect devices.  Its use is documented in
   [RFC2544].

   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address
   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.
   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in
   [RFC3171].

   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
   space, is reserved.  The "limited broadcast" destination address
   255.255.255.255 should never be forwarded outside the (sub-)net of
   the source.  The remainder of this space is reserved for future use.

6.  Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses

   The IANA has responsibility for making assignments of protocol
   parameters used in the Internet according to the requirements of the
   "Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" [RFC2860].  Among other things,
   [RFC2860] requires that protocol parameters be assigned according to
   the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,
   Draft, and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice
   documents, and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.

   The domain name and IP address spaces involve policy issues (in
   addition to technical issues) so that the requirements of [RFC2860]
   do not apply generally to those spaces.  Nonetheless, the IANA is
   responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses as needed in
   support of the Internet Standards Process.  When a portion of the
   IPv4 address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical
   requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be
   described [RFC5226].  Immediately before the RFC is published, the
   IANA will, in consultation with the Regional Internet Registries,
   make the necessary assignment and notify the RFC Editor of the
   particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.

   As required by [RFC2860], the IANA will also make necessary
   experimental assignments of IPv4 addresses, also in consultation with
   the Regional Internet Registries.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the IANA's past and current practices and
   does not create any new requirements for assignments or allocations
   by the IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   The particular assigned values of special-use IPv4 addresses
   cataloged in this document do not directly raise security issues.
   However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of
   these addresses; if you expect (for instance) that all packets from
   the 10.0.0.0/8 block originate within your subnet, all border routers
   should filter such packets that originate from elsewhere.  Attacks
   have been mounted that depend on the unexpected use of some of these
   addresses.
