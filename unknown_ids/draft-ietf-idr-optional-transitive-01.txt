   reset the session over which the offending attribute was received.
   This behavior is undesirable in the case of optional transitive
   attributes.  This document revises BGP's error-handling rules for
   optional transitive attributes, and provides guidelines for the

   also revises the error handling procedures for several existing
   optional transitive attributes.


1.  Introduction

   According to the base BGP specification [RFC4271], a BGP speaker that
   receives an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is
   required to reset the session over which the offending attribute was
   received.  This behavior is undesirable in the case of optional
   transitive attributes whose Partial bit is set; the reason is that
   such attributes may have been propagated without being checked by
   intermediate routers that do not recognize the attribute -- in effect
   the attributes may have been tunneled, and when they do reach a
   router that recognizes and checks them, the session that is reset may
   not be associated with the router that is at fault.  This document
   revises BGP's error-handling rules for optional transitive
   attributes, and provides guidelines for the authors of documents
   defining new optional transitive attributes.  It also revises the
   error handling procedures for several existing optional transitive
   attributes.  Specifically, the error handling procedures of
   [RFC4271], [RFC1997], and [RFC4360] are revised.

   Error handling procedures are not revised if the error can be imputed
   to the direct neighbor.  In practice, this is achieved by checking
   whether the Partial bit is set -- if it is not, the original error
   handling procedures remain in force.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Revision to Base Specification

   Section 6.3 of [RFC4271] is revised as follows.  The paragraphs
   related to "any recognized attribute" and "an optional attribute" do
   not apply to optional transitive attributes received with their
   Partial bit set -- an error limited to such an attribute SHALL NOT be
   responded to by sending a NOTIFICATION message or resetting the BGP
   session.  Instead, when such an attribute is determined to be

   malformed, the UPDATE message containing that attribute SHOULD be
   treated as though all contained routes had been withdrawn just as if
   they had been listed in the WITHDRAWN ROUTES field of the UPDATE
   message, thus causing them to be removed from the Adj-RIB-In
   according to the procedures of [RFC4271].  In the case of an optional
   transitive attribute which has no effect on route selection or
   installation, the malformed attribute MAY instead be discarded and
   the UPDATE message continue to be processed.

   An example of an attribute which has no effect on route selection or
   installation is the AGGREGATOR attribute.

   A document which specifies an optional transitive attribute MUST
   provide specifics regarding what constitutes an error for that
   attribute and how that error is to be handled.

   Note that the revised error handling only applies when an individual
   optional transitive attribute is received with its Partial bit set
   and deemed to be erroneous.  In the event that an UPDATE message is
   deemed to be malformed in any other way then the procedures of
   [RFC4271] MUST be applied.  This is likewise the case if an optional
   transitive attribute is received whose Partial bit is not set -- this
   is because the detected error can be imputed to the direct peer.

   Examples of errors which would continue to be treated according to
   the procedures of [RFC4271] include the cases where the Total
   Attribute Length is inconsistent with the message length, or where
   there is more than one attribute with a given type code.  Also,
   implicit in the foregoing paragraph is the fact that if due to an
   error, including those in an optional transitive attribute, the other
   attributes of the UPDATE message cannot be correctly parsed, then the
   procedures of [RFC4271] continue to apply.

   In the specific case of incorrect path attribute flag bits -- i.e., a
   path attribute that is known by its type code to be Optional and
   Transitive but whose flag bits are not set accordingly -- the
   behavior specified by [RFC4271] SHALL be followed.  (Consider that in
   the case of such an error, the "tunneling" argument given above does
   not apply, by definition.)

   Finally, we observe that in order to treat an UPDATE as though all
   contained routes had been withdrawn as discussed above, the NLRI
   field and/or MP_REACH and MP_UNREACH [RFC4760] attributes need to be
   successfully parsed.  If this were not possible, the UPDATE would
   necessarily be malformed in some way beyond the scope of this
   document and therefore, the procedures of [RFC4271] would continue to
   apply.

3.  Operational Considerations

   Although the "treat as withdraw" error-handling behavior defined in
   Section 2 makes every effort to preserve BGP's correctness, we note
   that if an UPDATE received on an IBGP session is subjected to this
   treatment, inconsistent routing within the affected Autonomous System
   may result.  The consequences of inconsistent routing can include
   long-lived forwarding loops and black holes.  While lamentable, this
   issue is expected to be rare in practice, and more importantly is
   seen as less problematic than the session-reset behavior it replaces.

   Even if inconsistent routing does not arise, the "treat as withdraw"
   behavior can cause either complete unreachability or sub-optimal
   routing for the destinations whose routes are carried in the affected
   UPDATE message.

   Note that "treat as withdraw" is different from discarding an UPDATE
   message.  The latter violates the basic BGP principle of incremental
   update, and could cause invalid routes to be kept.  (See also
   Appendix A.)

   For any malformed attribute which is discarded instead of the
   containing UPDATE being treated as a withdraw as discussed in
   Section 2, it is critical to consider the potential impact of doing
   so.  In particular, if the attribute in question has or may have an
   effect on route selection or installation, the presumption is that
   discarding it is unsafe, unless careful analysis proves otherwise.
   The analysis should take into account the tradeoff between preserving
   connectivity and potential side effects.

   Because of these potential issues, a BGP speaker MUST provide
   debugging facilities to permit issues caused by malformed optional
   transitive attributes to be diagnosed.  At a minimum, such facilities
   SHOULD include logging an error when such an attribute is detected.


4.  Error Handling Procedures for Existing Optional Transitive
    Attributes

4.1.  AGGREGATOR

   The error handling of [RFC4271] is revised as follows:

   The AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be considered malformed if any of the
   following applies:






Scudder & Chen           Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Optional Transitive Error Handling       October 2009


   o  Its length is not 6 (when the "4-octet AS number capability" is
      not advertised to, or not received from the peer [RFC4893]).

   o  Its length is not 8 (when the "4-octet AS number capability" is
      both advertised to, and received from the peer).

   If the attribute is malformed and its Partial bit is set, either the
   attribute MUST be discarded or the UPDATE containing it treated as a
   withdraw as discussed in Section 2.  If the attribute is malformed
   and its Partial bit is clear, the procedures of [RFC4271] MUST be
   followed with respect to an Optional Attribute Error.

4.2.  Community

   The error handling of [RFC1997] is revised as follows:

   The Community attribute SHALL be considered malformed if its length
   is not a nonzero multiple of 4.

   If the attribute is malformed and its Partial bit is set, the update
   containing it MUST be treated as a withdraw as discussed in
   Section 2.  If the attribute is malformed and its Partial bit is
   clear, the procedures of [RFC4271] MUST be followed with respect to
   an Optional Attribute Error.

4.3.  Extended Community

   The error handling of [RFC4360] is revised as follows:

   The Extended Community attribute SHALL be considered malformed if its
   length is not a nonzero multiple of 8.

   If the attribute is malformed and its Partial bit is set, the update
   containing it MUST be treated as a withdraw as discussed in
   Section 2.  If the attribute is malformed and its Partial bit is
   clear, the procedures of [RFC4271] MUST be followed with respect to
   an Optional Attribute Error.

   Note that a BGP speaker MUST NOT treat an unrecognized Extended
   Community Type or Sub-Type as an error.


5.  Security Considerations

   This specification addresses the vulnerability of a BGP speaker to a
   potential attack whereby a distant attacker can generate a malformed
   optional transitive attribute that is not recognized by intervening
   routers (which thus propagate the attribute unchecked) but that

Internet-Draft     Optional Transitive Error Handling       October 2009


   causes session resets when it reaches routers that do recognize the
   given attribute type.

   In other respects, this specification does not change BGP's security
   characteristics.

Appendix A.  Why not discard UPDATES?

   A commonly asked question is "why not simply discard the UPDATE
   message instead of treating it like a withdraw?  Isn't that safer and
   easier?"  The answer is that it might be easier, but it would
   compromise BGP's correctness so is unsafe.  Consider the following
   example of what might happen if UPDATE messages carrying bad
   attributes were simply discarded:

                                  AS1--AS2
                                   \   /
                                    \ /
                                    AS3

   o  AS1 prefers to reach AS3 directly, and advertises its route to
      AS2.

   o  AS2 prefers to reach AS3 directly, and advertises its route to
      AS1.

   o  Connections AS3-AS1 and AS3-AS2 fail simultaneously.

   o  AS1 switches to prefer AS2's route, and sends an update message
      which includes a withdraw of its previous announcement.  The
      withdraw is bundled with some advertisements.  It includes a bad
      attribute.  As a result, AS2 ignores the message.

   o  AS2 switches to prefer AS1's route, and sends an update message
      which includes a withdraw of its previous announcement.  The
      withdraw is bundled with some advertisements.  It includes a bad
      attribute.  As a result, AS1 ignores the message.

   The end result is that AS1 forwards traffic for AS3 towards AS2, and
   AS2 forwards traffic for AS3 towards AS1.  This is a permanent (until
   corrected) forwarding loop.

   Although the example above discusses route withdraws, we observe that
   in BGP the announcement of a route also withdraws the route
   previously advertised.  The implicit withdraw can be converted into a
   real withdraw in a number of ways; for example, the previously-
   announced route might have been accepted by policy, but the new
   announcement might be rejected by policy.  For this reason, the same
   concerns apply even if explicit withdraws are removed from
   consideration.
