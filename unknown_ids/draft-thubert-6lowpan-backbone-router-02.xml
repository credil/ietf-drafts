	  <t>
	    The ISA100.11a standard has introduced the concept of a Backbone Router
	    that would interconnect small LLNs over a high speed transit network and scale
	     a single ISA100.11a network up to the thousands of nodes. In that model
		 the LLNs and the backbone form a single subnet in which nodes can move freely
		 without the
		 need of renumbering, and the Backbone Router is a special kind of Border Router
		 designed to manage the interaction between the LLNs and the backbone at layer 3.
		 <!--How to implement the Backbone Router
	    will not be part of the initial release of the ISA100.11a standard.-->
		Similar scalability requirements exist in the metering and monitoring industries.
		In a network that large, it is impossible for a node to register to all Border Routers
		as suggested for smaller topologies in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd">
		Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-power and Lossy Networks</xref>.

	  	  <t>
	    This paper specifies IP layer functionalities that are required to implement
	    the concept of a Backbone Router with IPv6, in particular the application of the
	    <xref target="RFC4291">"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"</xref>,
	    <xref target="RFC4861">" the Neighbor Discovery Protocol"</xref> and
	    <xref target="RFC4862">"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"</xref>.

		<xref target="RFC4429"> Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection </xref> are
	    discussed. Also, the concept of Transit Link is introduced to implement
	    the backbone network that was envisioned by ISA100.11a.
	  </t>	 
	  
	  <t>This operation of the Backbone Router requires that some protocol operates
	  over the LLNs from which node registrations can be obtained, and that can disseminate the location
	  of the backbone Router over the LLN. Further expectations will be detailed.</t>
	  <t>
	   The way the PAN IDs and 16-bit short addresses are allocated and distributed
	   in the case of an 802.15.4 network is not covered by this specification.
	   Similarly, the aspects of joining and securing the network are out of scope.
	   The way the nodes in the LLN learn about their Backbone Router depends on the protocol
	   used in the LLN. In the case of RPL, a Border Router is the root of the DODAG
	   that it serves and represents all nodes attached to that DODAG.

	      A Transit Link that we'll refer to a the LLN Backbone federates multiple LLNs as a single IP subnet.
		  Each LLN in the subnet is anchored at a Backbone Router. The Backbone

	   <t>
	      The Backbone Link is used as reference for
	      Neighbor Discovery operations, by extending the concept of a Home Link
	      as defined in <xref target="RFC3775"/> for Mobile IPv6.
	      In particular, Backbone Routers perform ND proxying for the LLN nodes
	      in the LLNs they own through a node registration.
           </t>

	   <t>
	     The Backbone Router operation is compatible with that of a Home Agent.
	     This enables mobility support for LLN devices that would move
	     outside of the network delimited by the transit link. This also enables
	     collocation of Home Agent functionality within Backbone Router
	     functionality on the same interface of a router.
           </t>

		 <t> 
		 A LLN node registers and claims ownership of its addresse(s) using 
		 proactive acknowledged registration exchanges with a neighboring router.
		 In case of a complex LLN topology, the router might be an intermediate LLN
		 Router that relays the registration to the LBR as described for instance in  
		 <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>.
		 In turn, the Backbone Routers operate as a distributed database of all the LLN 
		nodes and use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol to share that information across the
		transit link in a reactive fashion.
		</t>


	   <t>
	     For the purpose of Neighbor Discovery proxying, this specification documents
	     the LLN Master Neighbor Registry, a conceptual data structure that is similar to the
	     MIP6 binding cache. The Master Neighbor Registry is fed by redistributing addresses learnt
		 from the registration protocol used over the LLN.
           </t>

	   <t>
	     Another function of the Backbone Router is to perform 6LoWPAN  compression and
	     expansion between the LLN and the Transit Link and ensure MTU compatibility.
	     Packets flow uncompressed over the Transit Link and are routed normally towards
	     a Gateway or an Application sitting on the transit link or on a different
	     link that is reachable over the IP network.
           </t>


        </section>

	<section anchor='mess' title="New types and formats">
	
		<t>The specification expects that the protocol running on the LLN can provide
		a sequence number called Transaction ID (TID) that is associated to the registration. 
		When a node registers to multiple BRs, it is expected that the same TID is used, 
		to enable the BR to correlate the registrations as being a single one, and
		differentiate that situation from a movement. Otherwise, the resolution makes
		it so that only the most recent registration was perceived from the highest TID
		is kept.</t>
		
	    <t>The specification expects that the protocol running on the LLN can provide
		a unique ID for the owner of the address that is being registered. 
		The Owner Unique ID enables to differentiate
		a duplicate registration from a double registration. In case of a duplicate, the last
		registration looses. The Owner Unique ID can be as simple as a EUI-64 burnin address, if
		the device manufacturor is convinced that there can not be a manuf error that would 
		cause duplicate EUI64 addresses. Alternatively, the unique ID can be a hash of supposedly
		unique information from multiple orthogonal sources, for instance:
		<list  style="symbols">
		<t> Burn in address.
		</t>
		<t> configured address, id, security keys...
		</t>
		<t> (pseudo) Random number, radio link metrics ...
		</t>
		</list>
		In any fashion, it is recommended that the device stores the unique Id in persistent memory.
		Otherwise, it will be prevented to reregister after a reboot that would cause a loss of memory
		until the Backbone Router times out the registration.
		</t>
		<t>The unique ID and the sequence number are placed in a new ND option that is used by the
		Backbone Routers over the transit link to detect duplicates and movements. The option format 
		is as follows:
		</t>


	<section anchor='trackingmess' title="Binding Tracking Option">

   <t> This option is designed to be used with standard NS and NA messages between backbone Routers
   over a backbone link and may be used between LRs and LBRs over the LLN.
   By using this option, the binding in question can be uniquely identified and matched with 
   the Master Neighbor Registry entries of each Backbone Router.</t>

	   <t>
	   All nodes are required to autoconfigure at least one address, a link-local
	   address that is derived from the IEEE 64-bit extended media access control
	   address that is globally unique to the device.
	   Link-local address are described in section 2.5.6 of <xref target="RFC4291"/>.
	   Appendix A of that specification explains how the node builds an interface-ID
	   based on the IEEE 64-bit extended MAC address by inverting the "u"
	   (universal/local) bit.
           </t>

	   <t>
	   As a result, knowledge of the 64-bit address of another node on the same
	   extended LLN is enough to derive its link-local address and reach it
	   over IP. Another consequence is that the link local address is presumably
	   unique on the Extended LLN, which enables the use of Optimistic Duplicate
	   Address Detection (oDAD) <xref target="RFC4429"/> over the Transit Link and
	   the LLN. The address MAY be created as optimistic to enable its use
	   in the binding process with the Backbone Router.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t> Nodes should also autoconfigure the well known anycast address 6LoWPAN_NODE.
	   If they do not, they have to use their link local address in optimistic mode and
	   indicate so in the binding flows so that the Backbone Router uses that address in
	   its replies. 
           </t>

	   <t> Nodes MAY learn the address of the Backbone Routers using traditional means such as
	   configuration or the Neighbor Discovery  Protocol Router Advertisement messages. 
	   But those messages are multicast and might not be sent at a short interval or at all
	   over the LLN. This specification introduces a new anycast address 6LoWPAN_BBR that 
	   the node can use to reach the nearest Backbone Router without previous knowledge
	   of that router address. This specification tolerates movement within the LLN 
	   so the node does not have to stick with a given Backbone Router and MAY keep using the
	   6LoWPAN_BBR address for all its registrations.  
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>The Link Layer Address associated to the 6LoWPAN_BBR address is that of the PAN
	   coordinator unless the node has a specific reason to select an alternate next hop.
	   It is expected that the selected next hop has a route to the nearest Backbone Router
	   but the routing protocol involved is outside the scope of this specification. It
	   results that the next hop might have to forward the registration message and decrement
	   the Hop Limit. This is why the Backbone Router MUST accept Binding Solicitations
 	   with a Hop Limit that is lower than 255 (min value TBD).</t>

   	   <t>
	   The node might also form Unique Local and Global Unicast addresses, for
	   instance if it needs to be reachable from the outside of the Extended LLN,
	   or if it can manage its own mobility as prescribed by Mobile IPv6
	   <xref target="RFC3775"/>.
	   In that case, the node needs to bind each individual address individually.
	   </t>
        </section -->

	<!-- section anchor='sdoperationbind' title="Binding process">
	   <t>
	   The binding process is very similar to that of a MIP6 mobile node, though
	   the messages used are new Neighbor Discovery ICMP messages . A LLN node
	   address is tentative or optimistic as long as the binding is not confirmed by the
	   Backbone Router.
	   </t>
         < !--
	   this specification, the source address of the packet MUST be the link-local
	   address of the device derived from the IEEE 64-bit extended MAC address.

	   as well as the interface on which they are located.

	   The LLN node uses unicast Binding Solicitations to perform the binding.
	   The destination Address is that of the Backbone Router or a well know anycast address 
	   6LoWPAN_BBR that indicates the function of the Backbone Routers. The source address is
	   the unspecified address as long as the address is still optimistic or tentative,
	   and it is the link local address of the node after it is successfully bound.
	   </t>

	   <t> The acknowledgment to a Binding Solicitation is a unicast Binding Confirmation
		message that contains the status of the binding.
	   The source of the packet is the link-local address of the Backbone Router. 
	   The destination address is a well-know anycast address 6LoWPAN_NODE unless the 
	   optimistic bit is set in the Binding Solicitation or the address was already bound, 
	   in which case the link local address of the node is used.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   Upon successful completion in the Binding Confirmation message, the LLN node sets 
	   the address from optimistic or tentative to preferred.
	   </t>
	   <t>
       The 'X' flag in the Binding Confirmation message indicates that the Backbone
	   Router has completed DAD and now owns the Binding Address over the Transit Link.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   This specification also introduces the concept of secondary binding.
	   For redundancy, a node might place a secondary binding with one or more
	   other Backbone Routers over a same or different LLNs. The 'P' flag in the Binding 
	   Solicitation message indicates whether the binding is primary (set) or secondary 
	   (reset).

	  <t>The Backbone Router is a specific kind of Border Router that performs 
	  proxy Neighbor Discovery on its backbone interface on behalf of the nodes that
	  it has discovered on its Low Power Lossy Network interfaces. On the LLN side, 
	  the Backbone Router acquires its states about the nodes by terminating protocols
	  such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl">RPL</xref> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd">
	  6LoWPAN ND</xref> as a LLN Border Router. It is expected that the backbone
	  is the medium used to connect the subnet to the rest of the infrastructure, and
	  that all the LBRs are connected to that backbone and support the Backbone Router
	  feature as specified in this document.
	  </t>
	  <t>The backbone is expected to be a high speed, reliable transit link, with affordable multicast capabilities, 
	  such as an Ethernet Network or a fully meshed NBMA network with multicast emulation, which allows a full support
	  of classical ND as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/> and subsequent RFCs. In other words, the
	  backbone is not a LLN. Still, some restrictions of the attached LLNs will apply to the backbone. In
	  particular, it is expected that the MTU is set to the same value on the backbone and all attached
	  LLNs.

	  <section anchor='proxy' title="ND Proxy Operations">


	  <t>This specification enables a Backbone Router to proxy Neighbor Discovery
	  operations over 	  the backbone on behalf
	  of the nodes that are registered to it, allowing any device on the backbone 
	  to reach a LLN node as if it was on-link. </t>
	  <t>In the context of this specification, proxy ND means:
	  <list  style="symbols">
	  <t> defending a registered address over the backbone using NA messages with the
	  Override bit set</t>
	  <t> advertising a registered address over the backbone using NA messages, 
	  asynchronously or as a response to a Neighbor Solicitation messages.</t>
	  <t> Looking up a destination over the backbone in order to deliver packets
	  arriving from the LLN using Neighbor Sollicitation messages.</t>
	  <t>Forwarding packets from the LLN over the backkbone, and hte other way around.</t>
	  <t>Eventually triggering a look up for a destination over the LLN that would not be
	  registered at a given point of time, or as a verification of a registration.</t>
	  
	  </list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  The draft introduces the concept of primary and secondary BRs. The concept is
	  defined with the granularity of an address, that is a given 
	  BR can be primary for a given address and secondary or another one, 
	  regardess on whether the addresses belong to the same node or not.
	  The primary Backbone Router is in charge of protecting the address for DAD over the
	  Backbone. Any of the Primary and Secondary BR may claim the address over the 
	  backbone, since they are all capable to route from the backbone to the LLN device.</t>
	  
	  <t>When the protocol used to register the nodes over the LLN is 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl">RPL</xref>, 
	  it is expected that one BR acts as virtual root coordinating LLN
       BRs (with the same DODAGID) over the non-LLN backbone. 
	   In that case, the virtual root may act as primary BR for
       all addresses that it cares to support, whereas the physical 
	   roots to which the node is attached are secondary BRs. 
	   It is also possible in a given deployment that 
	   the DODAGs are not coordinated. In that case, 
	   there is no virtual root and no secondary BR; the DODAG 
	   root is primary all the nodes registered to it over the backbone.</t>
	   
	   <t>When the protocol used to register the nodes over the LLN is 
	   <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd"> 6LoWPAN ND</xref>, 
	   the Backbone Routers act as a distributed DAD table, using 
	   classical ND over the backbone to detect duplication. This specification
	   requires that:
      <list style="numbers">
	  <t>Registrations for all addresses that can be required to reach the device over the backbone,
	  including registrations for IPv6 addresses based on burn-in EUI64 addresses
	  are passed to the DAD table. </t>
	   <t> Nodes include the Binding Tracking Option in their NS used for registering those addresses
	   and the LRs propagate that option to the LBRs.
	   </t>
	   </list>
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   A false positive duplicate detection may arise over the backbone, 
	   for instance if the node registers to more than one LBR, 
       or if the node has moved. Both situations are handled gracefully 
	   unbeknownst to the node. In the former case, 
	   one LBR becomes primary to defend the address over the 
	   backbone while the others become secondary and may
	   still forward packets back and forth. In the latter case the LBR that receives
	   the newest registration wins and becomes primary.</t>

	  <!-- t>A Backbone Router advertises itself using a new option in the ND Router Advertisement
	  Message. A new anycast address 6LoWPAN_BBR is also introduced for the purpose of reaching the nearest 
	  Backbone Router in the absence of any information. This enables to reduce the use of multicast
	  RAs for the router discovery operation. The routing to the nearest router that owns that anycast 
	  address is out of scope for this specifiation.
	  </t -->
	  <!-- t> Another anycast address 6LoWPAN-NODE is introduced

           <t>
	   This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently protected, either
	   by means of physical or IP security for the Transit Link or MAC sublayer cryptography.
	   In particular, it is expected that the LLN MAC provides secure unicast
	   to/from the Backbone Router and secure broadcast from the Backbone Router in a way that prevents
	   tempering with or replaying the RA messages.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   The use of EUI-64 for forming the Interface ID in the link local address prevents the usage
	   of Secure ND (<xref target="RFC3971"/> and <xref target="RFC3972"/>) and address privacy
	   techniques. Considering the envisioned deployments and the MAC layer security applied,
	   this is not considered an issue at this time.
