Internet-Draft                 HTTP PATCH                   October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the new HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616] method PATCH
   that is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

   A new method is necessary to improve interoperability and prevent
   errors.  The PUT method is already defined to overwrite a resource
   with a complete new body, and can not be reused to do partial
   changes.  Otherwise, proxies and caches and even clients and servers
   may get confused as to the result of the operation.  PATCH was
   mentioned in earlier HTTP specifications, but not completely defined.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Furthermore, this document uses the ABNF syntax defined in Section
   2.1 of [RFC2616].


2.  The PATCH Method

   The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
   request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
   URI.  The set of changes is represented in a format called a "patch
   document" identified by a media type.  If the Request-URI does not
   point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource,
   depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify
   a null resource) and permissions etc.

   PATCH is neither safe or idempotent as defined by [RFC2616], Section
   9.1.

   The difference between the PUT and PATCH requests is reflected in the
   way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource
   identified by the Request-URI.  In a PUT request, the enclosed entity
   is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the
   origin server and the client is requesting that the stored version be
   replaced.  With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of
   instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the
   origin server should be modified to produce a new version.  The PATCH
   method affects the resource identified by the Request-URI, and also
   MAY have side effects on other resources; i.e., new resources may be
   created, or existing ones modified, by the application of a PATCH.

   The server MUST apply the entire set of changes atomically and never
   provide (e.g. in response to a GET during this operation) a
   partially-modified representation.  If the entire patch document



Dusseault & Snell        Expires April 18, 2010                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 HTTP PATCH                   October 2009


   cannot be successfully applied then the server MUST fail the entire
   request, applying none of the changes.  The determination of what
   constitutes a successful PATCH can vary depending on the patch
   document and the type of resource being modified.  See Error Handling
   in Section 2.2 for details on status codes and possible error
   conditions.

   If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies
   one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be
   treated as stale.  A response to this method is only cacheable if it
   contains explicit freshness information (such as an Expires header or
   "Cache-Control: max-age" directive) as well as the Content-Location
   header matching the request-URI, indicating that the PATCH response
   body is a resource representation.  A cached PATCH response can only
   be used to respond to subsequent GET and HEAD requests; it MUST NOT
   be used to respond to other methods (in particular, PATCH).

   Collisions from multiple PATCH requests are more dangerous than PUT
   collisions, because a patch document that is not operating from a
   known base point may corrupt the resource.  Clients wishing to apply
   a patch document to a known entity can first acquire the strong ETag
   [RFC2616] of the resource to be modified, and use that Etag in the
   If-Match header on the PATCH request to verify that the resource is
   still unchanged.  If a strong ETag is not available for a given
   resource, the client can use If-Unmodified-Since as a less-reliable
   safeguard.

   Note that entity-headers contained in the request apply only to the
   contained patch document and MUST NOT be applied to the resource
   being modified.  Thus, a Content-Language header could be present on
   the request but it would only mean (for whatever that's worth) that
   the patch document had a language.  Servers SHOULD NOT store such
   headers except as trace information, and SHOULD NOT use such header
   values the same way they might be used on PUT requests.  Therefore,
   this document does not specify a way to modify a document's Content-
   Type or Content-Language value through headers, though a mechanism
   could well be designed to achieve this goal through a patch document.

   There is no guarantee that a resource can be modified with PATCH.
   Further, it is expected that different patch document formats will be
   appropriate for different types of resources and that no single
   format will be appropriate for all types of resources.  Therefore,
   there is no single default patch document format that implementations
   are required to support.  Servers MUST ensure that a received patch
   document is appropriate for the type of resource identified by the
   Request-URI.

   Clients need to choose when to use PATCH rather than PUT.  For

Internet-Draft                 HTTP PATCH                   October 2009


   example, if the patch document size is larger than the size of the
   new resource data that would be used in a PUT, then it might make
   sense to use PUT instead of PATCH.  A comparison to POST is even more
   difficult, because POST is used in widely varying ways and can
   encompass PUT and PATCH-like operations if the server chooses.  If
   the operation does not modify the resource identified by the Request-
   URI in a predictable way, POST should be considered instead of PATCH
   or PUT.

2.1.  A simple PATCH example

   PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Content-Type: application/example
   If-Match: "e0023aa4e"
   Content-Length: 100

   [description of changes]

   This example illustrates use of a hypothetical patch document on an
   existing resource.  The 204 response code is used because the
   response does not have a body (a response with the 200 code would
   have a body) but other success codes MAY be used if appropriate.

   Successful PATCH response to existing text file

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   ETag: "e0023aa4f"

2.2.  Error handling

   There are several known conditions under which a PATCH request can
   fail.

   Malformed patch document:  Can be specified using a 400 (Bad Request)
      when the server finds that the patch document provided by the
      client was not properly formatted.  The definition of badly
      formatted depends on the patch document chosen, but generally if
      the server finds it cannot handle the patch due to the
      serialization of the patch document, this response ought to be
      appropriate.
   Unsupported patch document:  Can be specified using a 415
      (Unsupported Media Type) when the client sends a patch document
      format that the server does not support for the resource
      identified by the Request-URI.  Such a response SHOULD include an
      Accept-Patch response header as described in Section 3.1 to notify
      the client what patch document formats are supported.

Internet-Draft                 HTTP PATCH                   October 2009


   Unprocessable request:  Can be specified with a 422 (Unprocessable
      Entity) ([RFC4918], Section 11.2) when the server understands the
      patch document and the syntax of the patch document appears valid,
      but the server is incapable of processing the request.  This might
      include attempts to modify a resource in a way that would cause
      the resource to become invalid: for instance, a modification to a
      well-formed XML document that would cause it to no longer be well-
      formed.  There may also be more specific errors like "Conflicting
      State" that could be signaled with this status code, but the more
      specific error would generally be more helpful.
   Resource Not Found:  Can be specified with a 404 (Not Found) status
      code, when the client attempted to apply a patch document to a
      non-existent resource, but the patch document chosen cannot be
      applied to a non-existent resource.
   Conflicting State:  Can be specified with a 409 (Conflict) when the
      request cannot be applied given the state of the resource.  For
      example, if the client attempted to apply a structural
      modification and the structures assumed to exist did not exist
      (with XML, a patch might specify changing element 'foo' to element
      'bar' but element 'foo' might not exist).
   Conflicting modification:  Specified with a 412 (Precondition Failed)
      when a client uses either the If-Match or If-Unmodified-Since
      request headers and attempts to apply a patch document to a
      resource whose state has changed since the patch was created.  If
      the server detects a possible conflicting modification and neither
      the If-Match or If-Unmodified-Since request headers are used, the
      server can return a 409 (Conflict) response.
   Concurrent modification:  When a server receives multiple concurrent
      requests to modify a resource, those requests SHOULD be queued and
      processed in the order in which they are received.  If a server is
      incapable of queuing concurrent requests, all subsequent requests
      SHOULD be rejected with a 409 (Conflict) until the first
      modification request is complete.

   Other HTTP status codes can also be used under the appropriate
   circumstances.

   The entity body of error responses SHOULD contain enough information
   to communicate the nature of the error to the client.  The content-
   type of the response entity can vary across implementations.


3.  Advertising Support in OPTIONS

   A server can advertise its support for the PATCH method by adding it
   to the listing of allowed methods in the "Allow" OPTIONS response
   header defined in HTTP/1.1.  The PATCH method MAY appear in the
   "Allow" header even if the Accept-Patch header is absent, in which

Internet-Draft                 HTTP PATCH                   October 2009


   case the list of allowed patch documents is not advertised.

3.1.  The Accept-Patch Header

   This specification introduces a new response header "Accept-Patch"
   used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server.
   "Accept-Patch" SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource
   that supports the use of the PATCH method.  The presence of the
   "Accept-Patch" header in response to any method is an implicit
   indication that PATCH is allowed on the resource identified by the
   Request-URI.  The presence of a specific patch document format in
   this header indicates that specific format is allowed on the resource
   identified by the Request-URI.

   Accept-Patch = "Accept-Patch" ":" 1#media-type

   The Accept-Patch header specifies a comma separated listing of media-
   types as defined by [RFC2616], Section 3.7.

3.2.  Example OPTIONS Request and Response

   [request]

   OPTIONS /example/buddies.xml HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com

   [response]

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Allow: GET, PUT, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH
   Accept-Patch: application/example, text/example

   The examples show a server that supports PATCH generally using two
   hypothetical patch document formats.


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  The 'Accept-Patch' Response Header

   The 'Accept-Patch' response header should be added to the permanent
   registry (see [RFC3864]).

   Header field name:  Accept-Patch

   Applicable Protocol:  HTTP
   Author/Change controller:  IETF
   Specification document:  this specification


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for PATCH are nearly identical to the
   security considerations for PUT ([RFC2616], Section 9.6).  These
   include authorizing requests (possibly through access control and/or
   authentication) and ensuring that data is not corrupted through
   transport errors or through accidental overwrites.  Whatever
   mechanisms are used for PUT can be used for PATCH as well.  The
   following considerations apply specially to PATCH.

   A document that is patched might be more likely to be corrupted than
   a document that is overridden in entirety, but that concern can be
   addressed through the use of mechanisms such as conditional requests
   using ETags and the If-Match request header.

   Sometimes an HTTP intermediary might try to detect viruses being sent
   via HTTP by checking the body of the PUT/POST request or GET
   response.  The PATCH method complicates such watch-keeping because
   neither the source document nor the patch document might be a virus,
   yet the result could be.  This security consideration is not
   materially different from those already introduced by byte-range
   downloads, downloading patch documents, uploading zipped (compressed)
   files and so on.

   Individual patch documents will have their own specific security
   considerations that will likely vary depending on the types of
   resources being patched.  The considerations for patched binary
   resources, for instance, will be different than those for patched XML
   documents.  Servers MUST take adequate precautions to ensure that
   malicious clients cannot consume excessive server resources (e.g.,
   CPU, disk I/O) through the client's use of PATCH.

Appendix B.  Changes

B.1.  Changes from -00

   OPTIONS support: removed "Patch" header definition and used Allow and
   new "Accept-Patch" headers instead.

   Supported delta encodings: removed vcdiff and diffe as these do not
   have defined MIME types and did not seem to be strongly desired.

   PATCH method definition: Clarified cache behavior.

B.2.  Changes from -01

   Removed references to XCAP - not yet a RFC.

   Fixed use of MIME types (this "fix" now obsolete)

   Explained how to use MOVE or COPY in conjunction with PATCH, to
   create a new resource based on an existing resource in a different
   location.

B.3.  Changes from -02

   Clarified that MOVE and COPY are really independent of PATCH.

   Clarified when an ETag must change, and when Last-Modified must be
   used.

   Clarified what server should do if both Content-Type and IM headers
   appear in PATCH request.

   Filled in missing reference to DeltaV and ACL RFCs.

   Stopped using 501 Unsupported for unsupported delta encodings.

   Clarified what a static resource is.

   Refixed use of MIME types for patch formats.

   Limited the scope of some restrictions to apply only to usage of
   required diff format.

B.4.  Changes from -03

   Various typographical, terminology consistency, and other minor
   clarifications or fixes.

B.5.  Changes from -04

   Moved paragraphs on ACL and RFC3229 interoperability to new section.

   Added security considerations.

   Added IANA considerations, registration of new namespace, and
   discontinued use of "DAV:" namespace for new elements.

   Added example of error response.

B.6.  Changes from -05

   Due to various concerns it didn't seem likely the application/gdiff
   registration could go through so switching to vcdiff as required diff
   format, and to RFC3229's approach to specifying diff formats,
   including use of the IM header.

   Clarified what header server MUST use to return MD5 hash.

   Reverted to using 501 Unsupported for unsupported delta encodings.

B.7.  Changes from -06

   The reliance on RFC 3229 defined patch documents has been factored
   out in favor of delta encodings identified by MIME media type.

Internet-Draft                 HTTP PATCH                   October 2009


   Allow caching but only if context is clear.

   Clarify how some patch formats might allow creating a new document.

   Add comparison of PATCH to POST

B.15.  Changes from -14

   Clarified that Accept-Patch header SHOULD appear in OPTIONS response
   -- it is not absolutely required

   Clarified how server can indicate that a PATCH response body is
   cachable as a resource representation.

   Removed suggestion that PATCH side-effects might be specified in the
   patch document specification -- this implied that side-effects could
   exclusively be determined that way, but in fact side-effects are
   often determined by the server unilaterally.
