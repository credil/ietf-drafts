Abstract

   VM migration is one of the key features provided by larger scale
   virtualized data center. Various optimizations for address resolution
   in such network are expected to be provided by ARMD. This draft
   describes the problems that may be introduced by VM migration. It is
   expected that solutions provided by ARMD would address those problems.

1. Introduction

   When virtualization is used in data center, it makes the server
   management more flexible and consequently more complex. One of the
   reasons is it would be much easier to move a VM (virtual machine)
   without the service interruption among physical servers. It is called
   VM migration. VM migration may occur due to server pool re-
   arrangement for maintenance, relocation, energy saving, load
   balancing, utilization optimization and other management purposes.

   Figure 1 shows a typical VM migration scenario within a data center.
   VM1 moves from server 1 to server 2. VM migration is under control of
   the virtual machine management tools. It is known in advance by VM
   manager that where the VM would be moved to. Movement could occur
   between different servers of the same rack or across different racks
   or even across data centers.

   The assumptions of VM migration include

   o VM does not change its MAC and IP address after migration

   o Service provided by VM should not be interrupted. Some packet loss
      may be observed at the moment of migration; however it should be
      recoverable by upper layer protocol and should not cause
      connection termination.

   VM itself has no knowledge about its movement and therefore it should
   not be expected that VM would do anything special to accommodate the
   migration. On the other hand, hypervisor in a server participates in
   the whole migration process. Hypervisor in the destination server
   knows when the migration finishes and usually it will send certain
   data or control packet to signal the network entities that VM
   migration completes and it is ready to receive packets from the new
   location. Such signaling packet may be gratuitous ARP request,
   gratuitous ARP reply or reverse ARP depending on different
   implementation.

   It has been shown in [I-D. dunbar-arp-for-large-dc-problem-statement]
   that there are basically two types of approaches used in virtualized
   larger layer 2 data center to solve the scaling issue,

   1. Address translation: map raw flat MAC address to some
      hierarchical or manageable MAC address.

   2. Address encapsulation: use additional header to encapsulate the
      frame/packet.

   Either address translation or encapsulation could be performed by
   address registration or source address learning. In any case, VM live
   migration is a fundamental scenario to handle. The following sections
   talk about the problems caused by VM migration.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Problems in address resolution in VM migration

   Take figure 1 as example. During the process of VM1 movement, other
   hosts may still keep sending data packet to VM1. The switches
   including ToR1 have no knowledge that VM1 is going to move. All the
   packets still go to server 1 as normal. At the moment VM1 stops
   receiving packet from server 1, the incoming packet could be lost as
   the destination becomes a black hole to other hosts. After a short
   while, VM1 should be able to receive the packet from its new location
   server 2. It is very common that hypervisor  at server 2 will flood a
   gratuitous ARP request/reply for VM1 to inform the whole broadcast
   domain about VM1's new location.

   There are a few problems may rise during the procedures described
   above:

  3.1. No signaling message to indicate VM1 having left server.

  Gratuitous ARP is a message to inform others a new node coming up for
  free. It is used for IP/MAC correspondence announcement. At same time,
  switches perform source MAC address learning to know the MAC/port/vlan
  correspondence. However there is no gratuitous ARP "leave" message to
  make others forget the previous learned source address and location
  information. Aging is a normal way to delete the cached information.
  Black hole may last existing as long as aging timout period. In
  virtualized system architecture, virtual machine management tool like
  vCenter knows a VM is going to move at management level.  Therefore it
  is also possible to delete the stale cache through management plane
  and it needs collaboration between virtual machine manager and network
  manager. Another way might be to have some lightweight keepalive
  mechanism.

  3.2. Uncertainty of signaling message after VM migration.

  Currently there is no standard behavior defined for hypervisor in VM
  migration. Hypervisor may send gratuitous ARP request/reply and even
  reverse ARP after migration completes. The reason for sending the
  signaling message is to inform the switches and gateways about the new
  location of VM1 and make them have the correct entry for
  interface/port in the ARP/MAC table.

   However, there are a large variety of ARP implementations. We have
   tested on one of Huawei's switch on various ARP messages; the result
   is in figure 2.

   The testing scenario is as follows. VM1 moves from server 1 to server
   2 which connect to GW1 via interface 1 and interface 2 accordingly.
   Before migration, ARP table of GW1 has the entry to include IP/MAC of
   VM1 and its outgoing interface is itf1. After migration, hypervisor
   of server 2 may flood ARP or other signaling message; it is also
   possible that it keeps silent and does not send out any signaling
   packet and deals with ARP request/reply as normal. The expected
   result should be GW1 updates its ARP table entry to correlate VM1
   with interface 2 (itf2).

        Figure 2 Test result of GW ARP table update in VM migration

   There are various implementation of switches and hypervisors. Figure
   2 shows one example that depending on the type of ARP message sent by
   hypervisor and handling of switch, result may not be always as what
   we expect.

  3.3. Difficulty of traffic redirection after migration.

  Traffic redirection here has two meanings: first, as VM starts to
  operate in the new location, all switches in the network should be
  able to correctly send the frame destined to that VM. That is to say,
  the interface/port corresponding to VM has to be updated in relevant
  switches as soon as possible; second, if packets received at VM's old
  location were cached by some network entity during VM migration, those
  packets could be redirected to VM in the new location. Such
  redirection may probably last for a while after VM completes migration
  to tolerate the unexpected delay caused by some switches keeping
  sending frames to VM's old location.

  Normally we want to minimize broadcast ARP message to alleviate the
  burden on switch and server. On the other hand, it would be necessary
  to do blind flooding of ARP in VM migration as it is hard to determine
  who are the entities that should be informed with new location and who
  are not. It is also not easy for a network entity to know if a VM is a
  newly starting one or a migrated one. Optimization for new VM and
  migrated VM may go through different procedures.



4. Security Considerations

   It may not be easy to tell if an ARP sent from a new location is
   really for a migrated VM or it is a spoofed one. With VM migration,
   some security mechenism may not be applicable any more, like:

   o MAC locking: locking a MAC address to a specific physical port of
      the switch.

   o DHCP snooping: binding IP/MAC by snooping DHCP ACK to port of
      switch. VM may not send DHCP request again after migration. Some
      mechanism should be introduced to move the binding to the new port
      in migration case.

   VM migration itself does not introduce more risk to ARP messages.
   However some existing solutions to solve ARP security issues may
   wrongly treat ARP after migration as illegal one.



5. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.

6. Conclusions

   VM migration brings extra problem to larger scale virtualized data
   center. Any solution in ARMD, like directory based address resolution,
   distributed caching, or specially designed control protocol, should
   take the problems into consideration.
