    Improving the caching DNS resolvers against "authority failure"
                   draft-wang-improve-dns-resolver-00

Abstract

   This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers.
   When all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, the caching
   DNS resolvers extend the lifetime of resource records in the zone in
   the cache to provide resolution service as far as possible.  And when
   the request can't be found in the cache, during a period of time the
   caching DNS resolvers don't query the authoritative name servers, but
   directly return a NXDOMAIN to the clients to reduce the recursive
   name server load and the network load.

1.  Introduction

   When a DNS caching DNS resolver receives a request from a client,
   first it tries to search in the cache and then query the
   authoritative name servers for the corresponding zone in case of
   cache miss.

   If all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, the caching
   DNS resolvers can get no answers of queries for a domain name in that
   zone, and unable to answer the clients.  However, the client may keep
   sending the requests which won't be answered anyway, which flood both
   the caching DNS resolver, the corresponding authoritative name
   servers and the networks.  In this situation, the whole network may
   be out of domain name resolution service.

   This document specifies a mechanism for the caching DNS resolvers to
   keep the records longer in the caches and prevent hopeless queries
   from going to the authoritative name servers in case of cache miss
   when all authoritative name servers of the zone of the records are
   out of service.  Therefore enhance the DNS reliability.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The authority failure status of a zone

   A list of status for all the authoritative name servers for a zone is
   maintained.  When all the authoritative name servers of the zone are
   out of service, the queries from the caching DNS resolver can't be
   answered.  We can call this zone in an "authority failure" status.
   After setting a zone in the authority failure status, a corresponding
   timer will be set for the zone.  When anyone of the authoritative
   name servers of the zone recovers, the status should be changed back
   to normal status.

   If needed, the methods of determining and recording the all
   authoritative name servers failure status can be discussed here.


4.  New mechanism of the caching DNS resolver

   4.1 Receiving a query for a domain name/RRs from a client.

   4.2 If the RRs of domain name queried can be found in the cache of
   the caching DNS resolver, corresponding RRs are returned.

   4.3 Otherwise, the status of the zone which the domain name belongs
   to is checked.

      a.  In normal status, the caching DNS resolver will query the
      authoritative name servers as usual.

      b.  In case of "authority failure",



         b.1 If the timer doesn't expire, the caching DNS resolver will
         not query the authoritative name servers and answer a NXDOMAIN
         directly to the clients.

         b.2.  If the timer expires, the caching DNS resolver will query
         the authoritative name servers as usual.  If the query
         succeeds, the status of the zone changes to the normal status.
         Otherwise, the status is still "authority failure" and the
         corresponding timer is reset.

   4.4 When a RR in the cache will expire, the status of the zone the RR
   belonging to is checked.

      a.  If the zone is in the normal status, the RR expires as usual.

      b.  If the zone is in the "authority failure" status, the RR
      shouldn't expire.  The TTL of the RR is extended by adding the
      current value of corresponding timer.

   The initial value of timer must be reasonable, keeping the balance
   between availability and stability, it is to be discussed and
   decided.


5.  IANA Considerations


6.  Security considerations

   This document is believed to introduce no additional security
   problems to the current DNS protocol.
