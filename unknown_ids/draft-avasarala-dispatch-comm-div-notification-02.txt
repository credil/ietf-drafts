Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


Abstract

   3GPP and ETSI TISPAN are defining PSTN/ISDN simulation services and
   in particular the Communication Diversion (CDIV) using IP Multimedia
   (IM) core Network (CN) subsystem supplementary service.  As part of
   CDIV, a (SIP) Event Notification Framework-based mechanism is used
   for notifying Users about diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of
   their incoming communication sessions.  A new event package is
   proposed for allowing users to subscribe for and receive such
   notifications.  Users have further capability to define filters
   controlling the selection, rate and content of such notifications.
   This SIP event package is applicable to the IMS and may not be
   applicable to the general Internet.

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


1.  Introduction

   3GPP is currently maintaining and specifying communication diversion
   mechanisms which allow users to forward and/or redirect incoming
   communications to other destinations.  The intention of such
   mechanisms is to provide users with sufficient flexibility to manage
   their incoming communications in a better way.  The most common
   example is Communication Forward On Busy (CFB) where in users can
   forward any incoming calls, whilst they are busy on some other call,
   to their voice mail or a suitable alternative (e.g. some other user).
   Similarly other variants of communication diversion are well defined
   and used in practice such as Communication Forward on No Answer
   (CFNA), Communication Forward Unconditional (CFU).  Similarly 3GPP is
   currently maintaining and specifying a mechanism for Users to
   configure Communication Diversion Services ([1] and [2]) for their
   incoming communications.  The intention of such mechanisms is to
   provide Users with sufficient flexibility to manage their incoming
   communications in a better way.

   However, with the increasing usage of Communication Diversion
   services, users may have many different variants and configurations
   active at the same time.  For e.g. the user may have various CFU
   services configured differently based on the time-of-the-day and the
   Calling party's identity, or CFB based on the time-of-the-day.  This
   is possible by having various such configured diversions by
   subscribing to different Communication Diversion (CDIV) services as
   specified by 3GPP.  Though, there has been quite active work in the
   area of better customization and configuration of such Communication
   Diversion mechanisms, not much attention has been paid to how the
   Users can manage these services in an effective manner.  With the
   various advanced options and high flexibility provided, it is
   possible that the User loses track of the various Communication
   Diversion configurations or services they have registered for.

   One of the basic ways, by which subscribers can manage a CDIV service
   is to be informed of which services they have registered for.  For
   example, [1] and [2] allow for such indications to be received by the
   subscriber, at the time of initiating an outgoing call.  However,
   simply showing the registered services is not sufficient, since each
   service may be customized in numerous and different ways for
   different criteria.  For example various instantiations of CFB may be
   configured for different times-of-the-day and different calling party
   identities.  Even if subscribers are shown information about all the
   Communication Diversion services and their variants that they are
   registered for, they may not be able to make sense or verify that
   each of them is correct as per their *expectation*.  Such a mismatch
   in terms of service behavior expectation and actual execution, may
   happen due to incorrect configuration on behalf of the User, which

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


   cannot be easily detected if there are various communication
   diversion services and their different configurations for handling
   incoming communications.

   A probable and suitable instance, when the subscriber may easily
   judge whether a communication diversion is correct, is when it
   actually takes place.  The subscriber is already aware of the current
   conditions (time-of-day, current presence and availability etc) and
   hence is in a position to decide, whether the communication diversion
   which just occurred, was indeed as per their expectation.  For e.g.
   the subscriber wanted to divert all incoming calls to voice-mail,
   between 3.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m.  Yet, by mistake she configures the
   time-duration as 3.00 to 4.00 p.m.  It would be very difficult for
   her to spot this error while manually reviewing her complete set of
   communication diversion services, with their various configurations.
   Instead, if the subscriber receives a real-time notification of any
   communication diversion occurring after 4 p.m., she would be able to
   immediately guess that something is 'wrong' or not as per her
   intention and take corrective action.  Such corrective action could
   be manual verification of the specific rule which triggered the
   communication diversion, wherein she will be able to spot the
   *mistake* more easily.

   Thus, for effective subscriber services management of multiple
   configurations of various Communication Diversion services, a
   notification-based mechanism may work well.  Such a mechanism would
   involve notifying subscribers about diversions of their incoming
   communications, as and when the communication diversion happens or
   with a slight delay (as per subscriber service configuration).  As
   such diversion-related information is conveyed almost instantly or
   within a small time-frame, the subscribers can verify whether the
   particular communication diversion is indeed correct at that instant
   of time.

   This document defines a SIP event package that allows a SIP User
   Agents to subscribe to and be notified of communication diversions
   enacted on their behalf.  This allows subscribers to subscribe to
   this event package to gather this information.  When subscribing to
   the event package the subscribers can control how they want to
   receive such notifications, the content and rate of such
   notifications.  It is believed that the SIP event package defined
   here is not applicable to the general Internet: it has been designed
   to serve the architecture of the CDIV service.  The aim of this memo
   is to follow the procedure indicated in RFC 3427 [3] and to register
   a new event package with event name "comm-div-info" with IANA.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Applicability Statement

   The event package defined in this document is intended for use with
   network-based application servers that provide a CDIV service


4.  Abbreviations and Definitions

4.1.  Abbreviations

      CDIV: Communication Diversion.

      CDIVN: Communication Diversion Notification.

      TISPAN: Telecommunications and Internet Converged Services and
      Protocols for Advanced Networking.

4.2.  Definitions

      Subscriber - The User Agent who has subscribed to the
      Communication diversion notification service.

      Diverting User - The User Agent who has configured a Communication
      Diversion.  This could be the User Agent who has configured the
      Communication DIversion service rules in the network.

      Diverted-To Entity/User - The User Agent who is the new target of
      the incoming communication, post execution of any configured
      Communication Diversion service.

      Originating User - The User Agent who is the originator of the
      incoming communication, which was initially targeted towards the
      Diverting User, but finally sent to the Diverted-To User.  The
      Originating User is also referred to as the Caller.


5.  Requirements

   A comprehensive description of all the requirements that affect the
   CDIV service developed by TISPAN and 3GPP and can be found in the

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


   3GPP web page at http://www.3gpp.org and http://www.etsi.org.

   For the sake of simplicity, we briefly discuss here those
   requirements that affect the solution described in this document.
   These requirements can be summarized as follows:

   o  There must be a mechanism that allows subscriber-controlled
      notification of communication diversions to the diverting user,
      including the option to control which notifications the user wants
      to receive and to control the rate at which notifications are
      received.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables filtering of notifications
      of communication diversion.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables triggering of notifications
      of communication diversion.

   o  There must be a mechanism that enables selecting information to be
      included in notifications of communication diversion.


   These requirements lead to a solution whereby the user can indicate
   to a network node his interest in receiving certain type of
   notifications of communication diversion.  Pushing these settings to
   a network node allows the network node to conserve scarce resources
   while still notifying the user of communication diversions enacting
   on the user's behalf.


6.  Package Definition

   This section fills in the details needed for an event package as
   defined in Section 4.4 of [5].

6.1.  Event Package Name

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to specify
   the name of their package or template-package.

   The name of this package is "comm-div-info".  As specified in [5],
   this value appears in the Event header present in SUBSCRIBE and
   NOTIFY requests.

6.2.  Event Package Parameters

   The SIP Events specification [5] requires package and template-
   package definitions to specify any package specific parameters of the



Avasarala, et al.         Expires April 9, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


   Event header that are used by it.

   The name of this package is "comm-div-info".  As specified in
   [5],this value appears in the Event header present in SUBSCRIBE and
   NOTIFY requests .

6.3.  SUBSCRIBE bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package or template-package
   definitions to define the usage, if any, of bodies in SUBSCRIBE
   requests.

   A SUBSCRIBE for Communication Diversion event MAY contain a body.
   The purpose of the body depends on its type.  Subscriptions to the
   Comm-div-info event package typically include a body of MIME type
   "application/comm-div-info+xml".

   A body of the SUBSCRIBE request with content type set to MIME type
   "application/comm-div-info+xml" contains information about filtering
   communication diversions, trigger communication diversion
   notifications and selecting information to be included in
   communication diversions notifications.

6.4.  Subscription Duration

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to define a
   default value for subscription durations, and to discuss reasonable
   choices for durations when they are explicitly specified.

   No expiration time for subscriptions within this package is defined
   in this document.  The subscriber MAY specify an expiration value in
   the expires header field.

6.5.  Notify bodies

   The SIP Events specification requires package definitions to define a
   default value for subscription durations, and to discuss reasonable
   choices for durations when they are explicitly specified.

   The NOTIFY message contains bodies.  This body is a format listed in
   the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE request or a package
   specific default format if the Accept header field was omitted from
   the SUBSCRIBE request.

   In this event package, the body of the notification contains comm-
   div-info information when the diversion notifications occur.  See
   Section 8.

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


   All subscribers and notifiers of the "comm-div-info" event package
   MUST support the "application/comm-div-info+xml" data format
   described in Section 8.  The SUBSCRIBE request MAY contain an Accept
   header field.  If no such header field is present, it has a default
   value of "application/comm-div-info+xml" (assuming Event header has a
   value of "comm-div-info").  If the Accept header field is present, it
   MUST contain the value "application/comm-div-info+xml".

6.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE requests

   The contents of a document containing comm-div-info information can
   contain sensitive information that can reveal some privacy
   information.  Therefore, such comm-div-info documents MUST only be
   sent to authorized subscribers.  In order to determine if a
   subscription originates in an authorized user, the subscriber MUST be
   authenticated as described in Section 6.6.1 and then the user MUST be
   authorized to be a subscriber as described in Section 6.6.2.

6.6.1.  Authentication

   Notifiers MUST authenticate all subscription requests.  This
   authentication can be done using any of the mechanisms defined in [6]
   and other authentication extensions.

6.6.2.  Authorization

   Once authenticated, the notifier makes an authorization decision.  A
   notifier MUST NOT accept a subscription unless authorization has been
   provided by the user.  The means by which authorization are provided
   are outside the scope of this document.  Authorization may have been
   provided ahead of time through access lists, perhaps specified in a
   web page.  Authorization may have been provided by means of uploading
   some kind of standardized access control list document

6.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY requests

   The SIP Events specification details the formatting and structure of
   NOTIFY messages.  However, packages are mandated to provide detailed
   information on when to send a NOTIFY, how to compute the state of the
   resource, how to generate neutral or fake state information, and
   whether state information is complete or partial.  This section
   describes those details for the "comm-div-info" event package.

   A notifier MAY send a NOTIFY at any time.  Typically, it will send
   one when a communication diversion is enacted on behalf of the user.
   The NOTIFY request MAY contain a body containing a comm-div-info
   document.  The times at which the NOTIFY is sent for a particular
   subscriber, and the contents of the body within that notification,



Avasarala, et al.         Expires April 9, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


   are subject to any rules specified by the authorization policy that
   governs the subscription and to preferences indicated at the time of
   subscription.

   The body of the NOTIFY MUST be sent using the type "application/
   comm-div-info+xml".

   Notifiers could detect that a communication diversion was enacted on
   behalf of the subscriber via a "History-Info" header field value, per
   [2] or [1], sent from an application server hosting the CDIV
   application.

6.8.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   The SIP Events specification expects event packages to describe the
   process followed by the subscriber upon receipt of a NOTIFY request.
   In this specification, each NOTIFY request contains a comm-div-info
   document

6.9.  Handling of Forked Requests

   The SIP Events specification requires each package to describe
   handling of forked Requests.

   This specification only allows a single dialog to be constructed as a
   result of emitting an initial SUBSCRIBE request.  This guarantees
   that only a single notifier is generating notifications for a
   particular subscription to a particular user.

6.10.  Rate of Notifications

   The SIP Events specification requires each package to specify maximum
   rate at which notifications can be sent .

   Comm-div-info notifiers SHOULD NOT generate notifications for a
   single subscription at a rate of more than once every five seconds.

6.11.  State Agents

   The SIP Events specification requires each package to consider the
   role of state agents in the package and, if they are used, to specify
   how authentication and authorization are done

   This specification does not require state agents to be located in the
   network

Internet-Draft  SIP Communication Diversion Notification    October 2009


6.12.  Use of URIs to Retrieve State

   The SIP Events specification allows packages to use URIs to retrieve
   large state documents.

   Comm-div-info documents are fairly small.  This event package does
   not provide a mechanism to use URIs to retrieve large state
   documents.


7.  Comm-div-info Document

   Comm-div-info document is an XML document [12] that MUST be well-
   formed and SHOULD be valid.  Communication Diversion Information
   documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8
   [13].


8.  Structure of Comm-div-info Format

   A Communications Diversion Information document starts with a "comm-

9.  Security Considerations

   Authentication and authorization of subscriptions have been discussed
   in Section 6.6.  Lack of authentication or authorization may provide
   comm-div-info information to unauthorized parties and can reveal
   sensitive information with regards to the user's call receiving
   patterns.  For example, who calls the user and at what time, etc.

   Integrity protection and confidentiality of notifications are also
   discussed in Section 6.7.  If a notifier does not encrypt bodies of
   NOTIFY requests, an eavesdropper could learn the status of a SIP user
   agent and use it to create malicious sessions.  If the notifier does
   not integrity protect the bodies of NOTIFY requests, a man-in- the-
   middle attacker or malicious SIP proxy could modify the contents of
   the comm-div-info event package notification.  Although this does not
   cause harm, it can create annoyances.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the new SIP Event Package.
