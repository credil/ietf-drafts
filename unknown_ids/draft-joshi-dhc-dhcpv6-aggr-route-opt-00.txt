   Aggregate Route Option for Dynamic Host Control Protocol version 6
                                (DHCPv6)
                draft-joshi-dhc-dhcpv6-aggr-route-opt-00

Abstract

   The Aggregate Route option provides a mechanism for a requestor to
   retrieve an aggregate route(s) from a DHCPv6 server using the
   information-request message.  The aggregate route is a single route
   representing multiple prefixes delegated by a DHCP server using
   Prefix Delegation, and maybe advertised using routing protocols
   instead of individual routes learnt from DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.
   This document specifies the data contained in aggregate route option
   as well as the behavior of Requestor and DHCPv6 Server in requesting
   and processing of this option.

Internet-Draft           Aggregate Route Option               March 2011


1.  Introduction

   In service provider networks intermediate routers between DHCPv6
   Server and Consumer Premise Equipment (CPE) equipment implement a
   DHCPv6 Relay function to learn Prefixes Delegated [RFC3633] by the
   DHCPv6 server to CPE equipment.  The intermediate routers may use
   routing protocols to advertise themselves as routers for these
   individual delegated prefixes.  With each intermediate router being
   connected to a large number of CPE equipment the number of routes the
   intermediate router needs to advertise is substantial, increasing the
   size of route tables in peer routers.

   If the prefixes delegated by the DHCPv6 server are contiguous then a
   single aggregate route can represent multiple delegated prefixes.
   While it is possible to configure such an aggregate route either
   manually or through Simple Network Management Protocol, it would be
   operationally efficient if the intermediate router can query the
   DHCPv6 server for aggregate route be be advertised.

   The Aggregate Route option provides such a mechanism to the
   intermediate router to query the DHCPv6 server for aggregate routes
   to advertise through routing protocols.  Even though the mechanism
   proposed makes it easy to advertise and withdraw aggregate routes, it
   is expected that aggregate routes will have a long lifespan.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes new DHCPv6 option for aggregate route.  This
   document should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv6 specification,
   RFC 3315 and RFC 3633, for a complete mechanism.  Definitions for
   terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this document are
   defined in RFC 3315, RFC 3633 and RFC 3769 [RFC3769].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

 option-code:    OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE (TBD)

 option-length:  12 + length of aggr-route-options field

 IAID:                The unique identifier for this OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE;
                      the IAID must be unique among the identifiers for
                      all of this requesting router's
                      OPTION_AGGR_ROUTES.

 T1:                  The time at which the requestor should
                      contact the delegating router from which the
                      prefixes were obtained to extend the
                      lifetimes of the aggregated route.
                      T1 is a time duration relative to the current time
                      expressed in units of seconds.

 T2:                  The time at which the requestor should
                      contact any available delegating router to extend
                      the lifetimes of the prefixes assigned to the
                      requestor; T2 is a time duration relative to the

 aggr-route-options: Options associated with this aggregated route.

   The aggr-route-options field encapsulates those options that are
   specific to this aggregate route request.

   In a message sent by the requestor the values in these fields can be
   used to indicate requestors preference for those values.  The
   requestor shall include one or more options e.g.  OPTION_INTERFACE_ID
   necessary for server to select a unique set of prefixes to be
   selected for this aggregate route request.

Internet-Draft           Aggregate Route Option               March 2011


   A DHCP server includes the OPTION_IAPREFIX to indicate the prefixes
   associated with this aggregate route request.  More than one prefixes
   can be associated with a OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE.  The status of this
   OPTION_IAPREFIX is indicated in a Status Code option in the aggr-
   route-options field.

   A OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE may only appear in the options area of a DHCP
   message.  A DHCP message may contain multiple Aggregate Route
   options.

   Note that the Aggregate Route option is an container option and does
   not have a valid lifetime of its own.  When the lifetime of all the
   associated prefixes have expired, the Aggregate Route option can be
   considered as expired.  T1 and T2 are included to give the DHCP
   server control over when the Requestor should contact the server for
   a specific prefix.

   In a message sent by a Requestor to a Server, values in the T1 and T2
   fields indicate the Requestors preference for those parameters.  The
   Requestor sets T1 and T2 to zero if it has no preference for those
   values.  In a message sent by a Server to a Requestor, the Requestor
   MUST use the values in the T1 and T2 fields for the T1 and T2
   parameters.  The values in the T1 and T2 fields are the number of
   seconds until T1 and T2.

   The Server selects the T1 and T2 times to allow the Requestor to
   extend the lifetimes of any prefixes in the OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE before
   the lifetimes expire, even if the Server is unavailable for some
   short period of time.  Recommended values for T1 and T2 are .5 and .8
   times the shortest preferred lifetime of the prefixes in the
   OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE that the Server is willing to extend, respectively.
   If the time at which the prefixes in an OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE are to be
   renewed is to be left to the discretion of the requesting router, the
   Server sets T1 and T2 to 0.

   If a Server receives an OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE with T1 greater than T2,
   and both T1 and T2 are greater than 0, the Server ignores the invalid
   values of T1 and T2 and processes the OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE as though the
   Server had set T1 and T2 to 0.

   If a Requestor receives an OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE with T1 greater than T2,
   and both T1 and T2 are greater than 0, the client discards the
   OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE option and processes the remainder of the message
   as though the Server had not included the OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE option.

4.  Requestor Behavior

4.1.  Requesting Aggregate Route Information

   The Requestor requests aggregate route information from the DHCP
   server by sending an information-request message containing one or
   more OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE (RFC 3315 Section 18.1.5).

   The Requestor MUST include its DUID in the information-request
   message (for a client this is client ID and for a relay this is relay
   ID).

   The Requestor MUST generate and include a transaction-id in the
   information-request message.

   The Requestor within the aggr-route-options of each OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE
   includes information necessary for the server to associate a unique
   set of prefixes.  The additional information may include options such
   as INTERFACE_ID.

   The Requestor with multiple interface MAY include individual
   OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE in a single information-request message, with each
   OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE containing and INTERFACE_ID in its aggr-route-
   options.

   The requestor MAY be configured to use a list of known DHCP server as
   destination addresses.  The requestor SHOULD unicast the information-
   request to one or more known DHCPv6 servers.  In case no such list is
   configured the requestor MAY send multicast request to
   All_DHCP_Servers address.

   Requestor transmits the information-request according to Section
   18.1.5 of RFC 3315.

4.2.  Processing Server Reply

   Upon receipt of a valid Reply message for each prefix in the
   OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE the Requestor MAY based on its local configuration
   add an aggregate route entry into its routing table.  The Requestor
   MAY also advertise itself as a router for the valid prefixes through
   routing protocols such as OSPF and BGP.  Before expiry of valid
   lifetime of each prefix, the Requestor sends a Renew message to DHCP
   Server with OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE containing the prefix.

4.3.  Validation of aggregate route bindings

   The Requestor may request validation of aggregate route binding from
   the server through the Rebind/Reply exchange.  Events which can

Internet-Draft           Aggregate Route Option               March 2011


   trigger the validation MAY include.

      - Requestor Reboots.

      - Requestor detects connectivity loss towards the server.

      - Physical disconnection from network.


5.  Server Behavior

   Upon receipt of a valid information-request containing
   OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE, Server uses the information contained in the aggr-
   route-options to identify the associated Prefixes and populates the
   OPTION_IAPREFIX in aggr-route-options for each of OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE
   of the REPLY message.

   The Server SHALL copy into the REPLY message all the aggr-route-
   options received from the Requestor.

   When the status of aggregate route is reset by manual configuration,
   the Server shall initiate the message of RECONFIGURE (10) with the
   Requestor.


6.  Acknowledgements

   This document offers an alternate mechanism to solution specified in
   draft-yeh-dhcp-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt, the author would like to thank
   the authors of draft-yeh-.. for discussion of the problem and
   solution which has served as an input to this draft.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of RFC
   3315.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE from
   the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options" registry (http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml).
