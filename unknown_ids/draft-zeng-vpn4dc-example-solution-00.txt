Abstract

   More and more service providers proposed VPN4DC requirements. That
   is how to maintain and manage the host-to-host connectivity through
   Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs) between an enterprise
   legacy VPN site and the virtual datacenter (VDC) in datacenter,
   including automated provisioning, monitoring, and so on[VPN4DC].

   This document provides an example solution by prototyping experiment
   for VPN4DC auto-provision. This solution is focus on the network
   side and the DC Edge, the DC inside is out of scope.

Internet-Draft       Example Solution for VPN4DC          October 2011


   This document provides an example solution by prototyping experiment
   for VPN4DC auto-provision. This solution is focus on the network
   side and the DC Edge, the DC inside is out of scope. A finished
   prototyping shows basic service mechanism of VPN4DC. And an ongoing
   prototyping activity is to go further to experiment more.

3. Example Solution

      3.1. Definitions

   VPN4DC Controller: A service controller for VPN4DC, receives user
   requests for host to host connection, translates user request into
   instructions for VPN network domain to allocate VPN connection and
   Data Center domain to allocate cloud resource.

   VPN Database: A database stores user information and corresponded
   VPN configuration information. By a unique ID, e.g., VPN User ID, it
   can by queried VPN configuration information and additional
   configuration information correspond this ID.

   VPN Manager: A VPN Manager controls a VPN network domain, VPN
   Database typically collocates with the VPN Manager, keeps the on-
   line VPN configuration information and VPN user information. The VPN
   Manager has authentication and authorization functionality to
   control the VPN connection's creation.

   DC Manager: A DC Manager controls a Data Center domain, manipulates
   the Data Center network as well as computing and storage resources
   in Data Center. Typically the VPN4DC Controller collocates with DC
   Manager.

   PE: Provider Edge Device, A network device resides in provider
   network act as a control point for VPN4DC accessing. Typically it
   can be looked as a PE with extended VPN accessing features, help to
   enforce policy control on every VDC connection to a specific VPN.

Internet-Draft       Example Solution for VPN4DC          October 2011


   DCG: DC Gateway, A network device resides in DC network issue a
   VPN4DC connection to VPN for a user.

   VCE: Virtual CE, Virtual customer edge device, it can be a
   virtual/logical router in DC gateway, or can be a host in server.

      3.2. Overview

   The main target for VPN4DC is that we need an automated service. It
   mainly because current commercial cloud platforms may be
   instantiated or reconfigured by the customer on a self-provision
   manner. The traditional VPN models have no characteristics of cloud,
   it typically involved a rigid workflow based on human intervention
   by service provider. Elasticity of resources, on-demand
   reconfiguration, and mobility has never been requirements in VPN
   environments.

   We need a network device in DC network to know which the VPN the
   user want to join. And the network device need this information to
   setup the VPN. The question is how the information is provided to
   the network device. We assume the initial VPN configuration be
   stored in VPN Database, by a unique ID. This VPN configuration
   information can be extracted for the DC Side Network Device to
   connect the target VPN.

   Two example prototypes will be showed in this document.

   1. Management Plane Solution: With this solution, we try to keep the
      under-network unchanged, the VPN4DC service is mainly process on
      an automated management system, VPN Manager communicates with DC
      Manager each other directly or via a VPN4DC Controller, so the
      two Managers get the consistent VPN configuration information.
      The VPN configuration information is downloaded to the PE and DCG
      respectively. PE and DCG finish configuration that enable hosts
      in a Data Center to join a specific VPN.

   2. Control Plane Solution (in-band): VPN Manager doesn't communicate
      with DC Manager each other. DCG send a request for VPN-
      connectivity to the PE via some control protocol in-band. After
      some authentication process on PE and authentication system, PE
      gets the target VPN configuration and advertises the information
      to the DCG. Both PE and DCG get correct VPN configuration
      information that set up the VPN connection. After PE had
      authorized the host joint from DCG, PE advertise the host route
      into the service provider network that enables hosts in a Data
      Center to join a specific VPN.

   The following is the process:

     1. The user makes request for VMs on a web-portal, the front-end
        of service controller. The user provides VPN identifier
        information to tell what VPN the VMs be to join in.

     2. The Service Controller sends the request for VMs to DC Manager
        with a VLAN ID,e.g. 5,  and a couple of IP addresses for the
        directly connection between PE and VCE, e.g.
        192.168.1.1/192.168.1.2.

     3. DC manager finishes VMs allocation and activates the VMs. DC
        manager allocates a VCE on DCG. DC managers configures the VLAN
        5 (correspond a sub-interface) and IP address 192.168.1.2 on the
        VCE. VCE issues iBGP and peers with 192.168.1.1.

     4. The Service Controller sends the request to VPN manager to
        join a VPN along with the VPN identifier said above, and VLAN ID
        5, and IP address 192.168.1.1/192.168.1.2.

     5. VPN manager queries VPN configuration information (e.g. RT/RD)
        from VPN database by the VPN identifier. VPN manager configure
        the PE with VLAN 5 (correspond a sub-interface) and IP address
        192.168.1.1. VPN manager configure a VPN instance with the RT/RD
        and sub-interface (VLAN 5), and bind the VPN instance with the
        sub-interface which has been configured with VLAN 5. PE adds
        peer 192.168.1.2 into its iBGP session. Other additional
        configuration such as ORF or Qos can be configured with the VPN
        instance.

     6. After PE and VCE finish the configuration, the binding of VDC
        with target VPN is enabled. Along with the host route of VM
        advertised from VCE to PE, and from PE to the service provider
        network, the binding of VMs with target VPN is enabled.

   Summary for this example:

   1. The VPN4DC system needs a service controller to process original
      user request. The service controller translates user request into
      instructions for VPN configuration and cloud resource
      configuration.

   2. The VPN4DC system needs a VPN database stores user information
      and VPN configuration. Given a unique ID, the VPN configuration
      information can be queried from the VPN database and be downloaded
      to the PE.

   3. The PE and DCG/VCE need to cooperate to bind the cloud resource
      to VPN correctly. The PE needs to know some information configured
      on VCE, and VCE needs to know some information configured on PE.

   But in practice, there may be some problems for this solution.

   1. It is a challenge to have VPN management system cooperated with
      DC management system directly or via VPN4DC Controller.

   2. VPN management system is administrative system of the service
      provider, but in this context there are a little bit dangerous for
      the user/customer accessing it indirectly via VPN4DC Controller.
      Furthermore, It is a challenge to change the VPN management system
      into an automated one.

      3.4. Prototype2 - Control Plane Solution (ongoing)

   This example is ongoing. By this example, the network PE and DCG
   undertake more work for VPN4DC set up, reduce complexity of among
   VPN4DC controller, VPN manager and DC manager.

     1. The user makes request for VMs on a web-portal, the front-end
        of service controller. The user provides VPN identifier
        information to tell what VPN the VMs be to join in.

     2. The Service Controller sends the request for VMs to DC Manager
        along with the VPN identifier.

     3. DC Manager allocates VMs for the user, and configures VLAN for
        the VMs. DC manager designates DCG to request to join the target
        VPN and send it the VPN identifier and Host ID list of VMs.

     4. DCG sends request to PE to join a target VPN. The request
        includes the VPN identifier and Host ID list of VMs.

     5. PE forwards the request to AAA/VPN Manager/VPNDB system, if
        the VPN identifier is authorized by AAA system, the target VPN
        configuration is fetched from VPNDB, and downloaded to the PE.
        And PE records the Host ID list related the target VPN.

     6. The PE does some configuration for the target VPN and sends
        response to the DCG, the necessary VPN configuration info is
        included in the response.

     7. The DCG does some configuration for the target VPN. Then the
        VPN connection is to be created.

     8. DCG send VM join request for the target VPN to PE, which can
        be carried via a host route advertise. After PE had authorized
        the host joining, PE could advertise the host route into the
        service provider network.  Then, the binding of VMs with target
        VPN is enabled.

   Notes:

     1. The signaling between PE and DCG should carry VPN joining and
        VM joining request, response and access control processing. None
        of existing protocols apply to PE-CE for L3VPN routing learning
        is able to provide these capabilities. We plan to extend some
        protocol, such as BGP to support it.
