   virtual instances of network services. IP address inspection on a
   packet coming from an external network such as the Internet can be
   used to switch the packet into a VLAN, through use of VLAN tags on
   Ethernet frames. The tagged frame is subsequently fed to a VLAN-aware
   networking infrastructure appliance where the packet is directed to a
   virtualized service instance. This method of IP-based VLAN switching
   on a packet assists in hosting multiple virtual instances of network
   services on servers and other appliances.

1. Introduction

   Ethernet standards, as defined by IEEE 802.3 [1] are currently the
   most widely deployed wired LAN technology. Ethernet provides
   virtualization services using the concept of 802.1q VLANs [2].

Internet-Draft         IP-based VLAN Switching            November 2009


   Virtualization helps provide isolation between IP networks on the
   same physical LAN, utilize resources more efficiently, reduce clutter
   of appliances, and offer certain cost benefits.

   Ethernet virtualization is often deployed in layer 2 switches, and
   has steadily gained popularity in supporting network and security
   services virtualization in network appliances. Such virtualization
   helps fray costs through optimal use of hardware resources. Examples
   include virtualization of security services like firewall, ipsec vpn
   and intrusion prevention at an ISP. The ISP would use some form of
   service virtualization within a single appliance to cater to multiple
   customers. Ethernet virtualization can assist in this process,
   identifying traffic for individual instances through the use of VLAN
   identifiers. Another example would be large data centers that deploy
   and load balance server farms for their customers. These deployments
   too can use ethernet virtualization to identify and segregate network
   traffic meant for various server farms.

   Virtualization may thus rely on VLANs to distinguish traffic to
   specific service instances. In such cases, VLAN switching needs to be
   performed with IP address intelligence, since an IP packet entering
   the premises from outside may not have a VLAN ID already associated.
   Some element or logic within the networking infrastructure needs to
   identify the correct service instance that can service the packet,
   apply a suitable VLAN ID on the packet, and dispatch it to the device
   handling the service.

   The above task of VLAN switching based on IP addresses (a.k.a IP-
   based VLAN switching) may be implemented as a software module
   integrated within a target appliance that provides the services, or
   within a separate switching device external to the target appliance.

   This document provides a functional description of the IP-based VLAN
   switching module.

3. Terminology

   The term "service facing port" refers to a physical port or logical
   interface that connects to a network or device that hosts virtualized
   network services.

   The term "external network facing port" refers to a physical port or
   logical interface that connects to a network that does not host
   virtualized network services

   The term "service domain" refers to a group consisting of a network
   facing port, all virtualized network services hosted on that network
   and reachable through the network facing port, along with the VLAN
   IDs associated with those services.

4. Usage Scenarios

   This section describes some deployment scenarios in more detail. Note
   that these are only representative scenarios and that there can be
   many others deployments that can benefit from IP-based VLAN
   switching.

   The term 'service facing port' is used to distinguish physical ports
   on the IP-based VLAN switch module that are connected to the
   device(s) that run virtualized services.

4.1. ISP security services

   A network appliance at an ISP provides firewalling, ipsec vpn,
   intrusion prevention and other security services to the ISP's
   customers. For cost reasons, a single appliance supports multiple
   virtual service instances that may be assigned to individual
   customers.

   Security service instances within the appliance work with virtual
   interfaces that are mapped to separate VLAN IDs. Packets arriving
   from the Internet through the IP-based VLAN switch are destined for
   subscriber or customer networks and have destination IP addresses
   accordingly.

   To distinguish which packet must be sent to which virtual instance of
   the service, the external IP-based VLAN switch may inspect the
   destination IP address against a set of preconfigured addresses,
   address ranges and/or address lists, and insert a distinguishing VLAN
   tag into the ethernet packet before forwarding it to the appliance.
   In essence, the packet is switched to one of many defined VLANs based
   on IP address inspection. Once the packet enters the appliance, this

   VLAN id is used to direct the packet to the right virtual interface
   where the packet is processed by a service instance dedicated to that
   customer.

   address. A packet arriving from the Internet, destined for a
   particular load balancing IP address or customer network address,
   will be VLAN-tagged based on the destination IP address of the
   packet. This allows the packet can be sent to a VLAN interface and
   reach a virtual service instance on the appliance. This technique can
   require an IP subnet, IP address or a range of IP addresses to be
   mapped to a VLAN ID on the service-facing port(s) of the IP-based
   VLAN switch.

5. Protocol Considerations

5.1. IP-based VLAN switching for Virtualization Support

   IP-based VLAN switching operates on service-facing 802.3 ports. A
   service-facing port is one that connects to a VLAN-based IP services
   network as described in section 3.

   A service-facing port is part of a 'service domain'. A service domain
   is a set of IP services in the service network, along with the
   defined 802.3 ports and VLANs for those services.

   Frames entering a service domain through a service-facing port are
   VLAN tagged as per 802.1q standards. VLAN tagging is configured
   specifically for the port, with VLAN IDs assigned based on configured
   IP subnets, IP addresses or ranges. VLAN tagging in this context
   applies only to service-facing ports, and only to frames egressing
   those ports. If a frame already has a VLAN tag, an outer VLAN tag is
   applied resulting in stacked VLANs.

   The frames that exit a service domain through a service-facing port
   have those corresponding VLAN tags stripped. These are ingressing
   frames on service-facing ports. This stripping ensures that the IP-
   based VLAN tagging is specific and restricted to a given service
   domain, and will not conflict with other service domains on other
   ports, or with the general non-domain network, even if same VLAN IDs
   are used across them. If a frame has multiple VLAN tags (stacked
   VLANs), then the outermost VLAN tag is matched and stripped.

   The IEEE 802.3 frame format is assumed in this document. This format,
   with VLAN tagging additions are summarized below.

5.1.1. 802.3 Ethernet frame

   The 802.3 frame has the following format as shown in Figure 3 :

   DA - Destination MAC address
   SA - Source MAC address
   LT - Length field (carries the EtherType for Ethernet II frames)
   Payload - 802.3 LLC/SNAP headers and data
   FCS - Frame Check Sequence


                        Figure 3 802.3 Frame Format

   The 802.3 frame format is compatible in structure with other Ethernet
   frame formats. In such cases, the 2-byte Length Field (LT) contents
   are used to distinguish the frame type. A length field value
   exceeding the maximum frame size for an 802.3 frame indicates a
   different frame type.

   For example Ethernet II frames use a value starting from 0800 hex.
   For Ethernet II frames, the payload section in the 802.3 format
   aligns with that of the Ethernet II frame data payload, and lacks
   802.3 LLC/SNAP headers.

   The reader is referred to IEEE 802.3 standards for frame format
   details [1] [2].

5.1.2. 802.1q VLAN tagging

   VLAN tagging follows the IEEE 802.1q specifications. This standard
   requires inserting the VLAN tag as an additional 4 bytes between the
   Source address and the EtherType/Length field. The VLAN tagged frame
   is formatted as in Figure 4.

   The Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID) carries an Ethernet Type value
   which is used to identify the frame as a VLAN tagged frame.

   This document is not specifically concerned about various details of
   the frame format, other than using the fact that VLAN tagging is
   supported on Ethernet frames. The reader is referred to 802.3
   standards for more details [1] [2].

5.1.3. 802.1q-in-q or Stacked VLANs

   When 802.3 frames are already VLAN tagged, stacked VLAN frames may be
   used to insert the additional VLAN tag. The format of such a doubly-
   tagged frame is summarized in Figure 5.

   For IP-based VLAN switching, the tag with the desired VLAN ID is
   inserted before (i.e. nesting over) any existing tags.

5.3. Functionality

   This section discusses the operation of the IP-based VLAN switching
   module in more detail.

5.3.1. Egressing frames on service-facing ports

   Much of IP-based VLAN switching functionality is exercised when
   frames are sent out on service-facing ports. Various cases are
   covered below.

5.3.1.1. IPv4 unicast payload frames

   If a service-facing port is configured with one or more IPv4 subnets,
   addresses, or ranges, and an egressing frame on the port contains an
   IP packet with an IPv4 unicast address that matches the
   configuration, then a VLAN tag with the corresponding VLAN ID MUST be
   inserted into the frame before (i.e. nesting over) any existing VLAN
   tags. If an 802.1p priority has also been configured, it MUST be
   applied to the frame.

5.3.1.2. IPv4 broadcast payload frames

   If an egressing frame on a service-facing port contains an IP packet
   with a configured IPv4 broadcast address that matches subnets, IP
   addresses or ranges in the configuration, then a VLAN tag with the
   corresponding VLAN ID MUST be inserted into the frame, before (i.e.
   nesting) any existing VLAN tags. If there are multiple matches, then
   the frame MUST be duplicated for each such match and the
   corresponding VLAN tag inserted into each frame.

5.3.1.3. IPv4 multicast payload frames

   If an egressing frame on a service-facing port contains an IP packet
   with an IPv4 multicast address, then the frame SHOULD be duplicated
   for each VLAN ID defined in the IP-based VLAN

   switching configuration, and the respective VLAN ID inserted into
   each tag.

5.3.2. Ingressing frames on service-facing ports

   If a service-facing port has an IP-based VLAN switching configuration
   that is enabled, then an ingress frame on the port carrying a VLAN
   tag that matches one of the configured VLAN IDs, MUST have that VLAN
   tag stripped from the frame before forwarding. If there are multiple

   VLAN tags in the frame, the matching should be done against the
   outermost VLAN tag.

5.3.3. Egressing frames on external network facing ports

   IP-based VLAN switching has no additional impact on these frames,
   which are handled as per Ethernet standards.

5.3.4. Ingressing frames on external network facing ports

   The IP-based VLAN switching module may conform to any layer 2, 3 or
   higher layer processing functionality as required, with no additional
   requirements beyond imposing Ethernet standards on the processing of
   these frames.

   For example, the frames may be processed as in a layer 2 switch using
   mac address learning and forwarding, or they may be processed as in a
   layer 3 switch or router, with routing tables determining the egress
   port. Egress ports may also be determined based on inspecting a
   frame's IP payload destination address, and matching with IP-based
   VLAN configuration for service-facing ports.

   See also section 6 "External Switching Device Considerations".

5.3.5. non-IP unicast payload frames

   If a frame egressing a service-facing port carries a non-IP packet,
   and the frame is a unicast frame, a configuration SHOULD be provided
   offering one of the following actions based on the EtherType field
   (DIX format) or the Link Service Access Point (LSAP) Identifiers
   (802.3 LLC) field.

   a) Duplicate the frame for each IP-based VLAN ID associated with the
   port, and insert the appropriate VLAN tag

   b) Send the frame unmodified

   c) Drop the frame

   This covers various scenarios that may be required for non-IP frames.

5.3.6. non-IP broadcast payload frames

   Egressing non-IP broadcast frames on a service-facing port SHOULD be
   duplicated per IP-based VLAN ID configured on the port. For protocols
   like ARP to function properly, this is a requirement.

5.3.7. Non-IP multicast payload frames

   Egressing non-IP multicast frames on a service-facing port SHOULD be
   duplicated per IP-based VLAN ID configured on the port.

6. External Switching Device Considerations

   IP-based VLAN switching module functions may be integrated into layer
   2 switches or bridges, layer 3 switches, routers, load balancers etc.
   The core functionality as defined by the module is performed in the
   context of a service-facing port, and is not expected to depend on
   the packet or frame forwarding mechanisms used within the overall
   device. For example, a layer 2 switch may use an fdb to forward
   frames. A layer 3 switch or router may use a routing table. As
   ethernet frames are received or sent out on service-facing ports, the
   IP-based VLAN switching logic is applied.

7. Security Considerations

   Unless carefully implemented, the requirement to duplicate frames per
   VLAN ID in certain scenarios described above can create a denial-of-
   service vulnerability. The module should minimize the amount of
   resources utilized in this case, such as by avoiding creation of all
   duplicate frames at once. Frame duplication may be delayed until
   needed, just before actual transmission. Rate-limiting controls may
   also be used.

   Beyond this, no additional security concerns are envisaged.

8. IANA Considerations

   None
