     Problem Statement for Identical DNS Resolution of Bundle Names
     draft-yao-dnsext-identical-resolution-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies the problems related to the identical
   resolution of bundle DNS names.  With the emergence of
   internationalized domain names, two names with the same meaning or
   visual similarity sometimes require the identical resolution.
   Current DNS protocols have not provided such ability to satisfy these
   requirements.

Internet-Draft                    bname                    February 2010


1.  Introduction

   If one domain name is the alias of another domain name, the CNAME
   will be used for that name.  If the name wants to map its descendants
   to other domain, the DNAME will be used.  If the name wants to map
   itself and its descendants to another domain, what should we do.  The
   current protocols do not support to do so.  There can have a lot of
   names under the DNS zones.  Some of these names are very similar.
   The DNS was designed under the environment of ASCII characters, but
   the naming similarity in English is not very popular; the
   requirements of identical resolution of these names does not cause
   the attentions of the IETF DNS engineers.  With the internationalized
   domain names protocols publishing in 2006 and updating in 2008, more
   and more internationalized domain name labels [RFC3490] appear in the
   DNS trees.  Some labels [RFC3743] are equivalent in some languages.
   For examples: For English speak users, color and colour are same; For
   Chinese speak users, Chinese character U+56FD and its variant U+570B
   look differently, but are identical in the meaning.  The Internet
   users hope them to be identical in the DNS resolution.  For example,
   color.exmaple.com==colour.example.com.  On the other hand, ICANN's
   "Final Implementation Plan for IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process" said
   that the desired IDN TLD variants will be allocated, and may be put
   into the root.  ICANN currently does not find the perfect technical
   solution to put the IDN TLD variants into the root.

1.1.  Terminology

   All the basic terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC2672] and [RFC3490].


2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Character Variants

   Many languages have the character variants.  Although there is no
   uniform definition of variants, the variants are popular in many
   languages.  The definition of variant characters in the JET
   Guidelines [RFC3743]: One conceptual character can be identified with
   several different Code Points in character sets for computer use.  In
   UNICODE, Some characters can be identified as the compatibility
   variants of another character, which usually implies that the first
   can be remapped to the second without the loss of any meaning.  In
   this document, variant characters are two or more characters that may
   be similar in appearance or identical in meaning.  ICANN is pushing
   the IDN TLD into the root server.  Some IDN TLD has the variants.
   How to deal with the IDN TLD variant issue is a big challenge ahead
   of us.  For example, if the IDN TLD "China" (U+4E2D U+56FD) and its

Internet-Draft                    bname                    February 2010


   variant (U+4E2D U+570B) are put into the root, the first one (U+4E2D
   U+56FD) is called as the original IDN TLD and the second one (U+4E2D
   U+570B) is called as the IDN TLD variant.  In an ideal way, the
   original IDN TLD and its IDN TLD variant SHOULD be identical in the
   DNS resolution.  If case mapping is regarded as the variant, the
   uppercase A is the variant of lowercase a.  For example, the ".COM"
   is the variant of ".com".  These variants need to be identical in the
   DNS resolution, which has been done so in the DNS protocols.
   However, we can not find the ideal solution of identical DNS
   resolution for the IDN TLD variants.

2.2.  Registration of Domain Name Variants

   With the development of internationalized domain names protocols,
   more and more domain names and their variants appear in the Internet.
   Without careful management of the domain name variants, there will
   have more phising related security problems.  [RFC3743] developed by
   JET (Joint Engineering Team) gives a solution of how to manage the
   registration of domain name and its variants.  [RFC3743] proposed an
   algorithm which will allocate the domain name and its variants to the
   same domain holder.  It means that the domain holder will get the
   bundle of the domain name and its variants.  [RFC4290] suggests the
   practice in [RFC3743] to be used in registrations of
   internationalized domain names.  But [RFC3743] and [RFC4290] do not
   define how these bundle of names get the identical DNS resolution.
   [RFC4690] said that the "variant" model introduced in [RFC3743] and
   [RFC4290] can be used by a registry to prevent the worst consequence
   of the possible confusion, by ensuring either that both names are
   registered to the same party in a given domain or that one of them is
   completely prohibited.  The principle of [RFC3743], [RFC4290] and
   [RFC4690] have been accepted by many registries.  In the technology
   level, we can not guarantee that these bundle of domain names get the
   identical DNS resolution.

2.3.  Identical DNS Resolution for Bundle DNS Names

   Identical DNS Resolution means that two domain names will finally get
   the same result, in most cases the same IP address.  The Internet
   users hope that the domain names and its variants to be identical in
   DNS resolution.  In the history of DNS protocol development, there
   has already two kinds of identical resolution:CNAME[RFC1034] which
   maps or redirects itself and DNAME[RFC2672] which maps or redirects
   its descendants.  In the case of bundle Names, identical DNS
   resolution of all levels' domain names including the domain name
   itself and its descendants are expected.  Current technologies do not
   allow to do so.  Some suggestions trying to use the current
   technology are proposed in the draft of "IDN TLD Variants
   Implementation Guideline" [IDN-TLD-Variants], but this is a mechanism

   of combination of both technology and policy, which is not a perfect
   solution.


3.  Possible Solutions

   Currently, there are two possible solutions to the identical DNS
   resolution of bundle names: Bundle Names direction[BNAME] and Zone
   clone.  Both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages.  The
   implementers may select one of them to be used

3.1.  Mapping or Redirection of Domain Names

3.1.1.  Mapping itself

   A host can have many names.  The Internet users need these multiple
   names to be resolved to the same IP address by a DNS server.  CNAME
   record [RFC1034], an abbreviation of Canonical Name Records, is
   responsible for the aliases of the real host name of a computer.  In
   some cases, the CNAME can work for these bundle of variant domain
   names.  But the CNAME only maps itself, not its descendants.  In the
   case of IDN TLD variants, IDN TLD variants need to map itself and its
   variants.

3.1.2.  Mapping its descendants

   In order to maintain the address-to-name mappings in a context of
   network renumbering, a DNAME record or Delegation Name record defined
   by [RFC2672] creates an alias for all its subdomains.  In contrast,
   the CNAME record creates an alias only of a single name (and not of
   its subdomains).  Like the CNAME record, the DNS lookup will continue
   by retrying the lookup with the new name.  If a DNS resolver sends a
   query without EDNS[EDNS0], or with EDNS version 0, then a name server
   synthesizes a CNAME record to simulate the semantics of the DNAME
   record.  A DNAME record is very much alike the CNAME record, but
   while the CNAME record only applies for one name, with a DNAME record
   one can create alias for all the records for its sudbomain.

3.1.3.  Mapping itself and its descendants

   The bundle of variant domain names requires to map the whole tree of
   the domain space to another domain.  The current DNS protocols do not
   support this function.  A new DNS resource record [BNAME] may be
   invented to deal with this problem.

3.2.  Zone Clone

   Zone Clone proposed by Paul Vixie from Internet Software Consortium
   is an alternative solution to getting the identical DNS resolution of
   bundle domain names.


4.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration.


5.  Security Considerations

   There may have more disscussions related to DNSSEC [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034] and [RFC4035]in the future version.


6.  Acknowledgements

   Many ideas are from the discussion in the DNSOP and DNSEXT mailling
   list.  Thanks a lot to all in the list.  Many important comments and
   suggestions are contributed by many members of the DNSEXT and DNSOP
   WG.
