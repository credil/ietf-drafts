    <abstract>
      <t>
        AFS-3 relies upon XDR to carry Rx RPC call payloads.  XDR discriminated
        unions are ill-suited to cases where the protocol needs to evolve
        without inventing new RPCs, i.e., unknown discriminant values cause
        the entire XDR payload to fail the decoding step.  While this can be
        circumvented through the use of opaque payloads (and recursive XDR 
        invocations), such solutions are inelegant and difficult to implement.
        This memo defines a new XDR primitive type, "afs-union", which is
        derived from the XDR discriminated union primitive type, but with two
        key variations: 1) each leg contains a length field, and 2) no default
        leg is supported.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        AFS-3 <xref target="AFS1"/> <xref target="AFS2"/>
        is a distributed file system that has its origins
        in the VICE project <xref target="CMU-ITC-84-020"/>
        <xref target="VICE1"/> at the Carnegie Mellon University
        Information Technology Center <xref target="CMU-ITC-83-025"/>, 
        a joint venture between CMU and IBM.  VICE later became AFS when
        CMU moved development to a new commercial venture called
        Transarc Corporation, which later became IBM
        Pittsburgh Labs.  AFS-3 is a suite of un-standardized 
        network protocols based on a remote procedure call (RPC)
        suite known as Rx <xref target="AFS3-RX"/>.
        While de jure standards for AFS-3
        fail to exist, the various AFS-3 implementations have 
        agreed upon certain de facto
        standards, largely helped by the existence of
        an open source fork called OpenAFS that has served
        the role of reference implementation.  In addition to
        using OpenAFS as a reference, IBM wrote and donated developer
        documentation that contains somewhat outdated specifications
        for the Rx protocol and all AFS-3 remote procedure calls, as
        well as a detailed description of the AFS-3 system architecture.
      </t>

      <t>
        The Rx RPC protocol utilizes XDR <xref target="RFC4506"/> as its
        means of encoding RPC call and response payloads.  XDR provides a
        discriminated union type.  However, the semantics of the discriminated
        union base type do not lend themselves to evolution of the discriminator
        namespace: introduction of new discriminators--when there is no default
        leg--cause the remainder of the XDR octet stream to be un-parseable
        (due to the lack of a length field in the encoding) by older peers.  This
        memo introduces a new XDR base type that is identical to the XDR
        discriminated union, except that: 1) each leg contains a length field,
        and 2) the default leg is disallowed.

    <section title="AFS-3 Discriminated Union">
      <t>
        The AFS-3 discriminated union will contain a length field in every leg 
        so that decoding peers can always figure out the offset of the next
        object in the stream.  For small legs, this will result in significant
        encoding inefficiency, but it is necessary to permit the union to evolve
        over time (without peers failing to decode the entire XDR stream).
      </t>

      <section title="AFS-3 Union Type" anchor="afs3-union">
        <t>
          The definition of the AFS-3 discriminated union is derived from the
          XDR union defined in section 4.15 of <xref target="RFC4506"/>.  Unlike
          XDR discriminated unions, the types mapped to each arm of the union
          need not be defined a priori.  Instead, the length of the arm is
          always included in the wire encoding along with the discriminant
          value, thus permitting the decoder to continue decoding past an
          unknown discriminant in an XDR octet stream.  How undefined
          discriminator values are handled by the decoder is deliberately left
          unspecified by this document.  Each standards-track afs-union will
          have to define its own semantics for handling unknown discriminants.
          AFS-3 discriminated unions are defined in RPC-L as follows:
        </t>

        <figure align="left" anchor="afs-union-rpc-l">
          <artwork><![CDATA[
    afs-union switch (discriminant-definition) {
    case discriminant-value-A:
       arm-declaration-A;
    case discriminant-value-B:
       arm-declaration-B;
    ...
    } identifier;
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>
          Because the discriminant namespace of an AFS-3 union must be capable
          of evolving over time, it is not possible to support a default leg.
        </t>

        <t>
          The AFS-3 discriminated union is encoded on the wire as: a 4-octet discriminant,
          followed by a 4-octet arm length, and finally the variable-length implied arm.
          The arm length field shall count the total octets present in the union encoding: 
          8 octets for the header, plus the total length of the implied arm.

        <t>
          In order to implement the above, the XDR grammar, as specified in
          Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC4506"/>, will need to be modified in
          the following ways:
