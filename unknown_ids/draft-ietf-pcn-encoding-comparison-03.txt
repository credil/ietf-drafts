            Pre-Congestion Notification Encoding Comparison
                 draft-ietf-pcn-encoding-comparison-03

Abstract

   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a link-specific and load-
   dependent packet marking mechanism for Differentiated Services
   networks.  The packet markings are evaluated by egress nodes of PCN
   domains and the result is used for admission control and flow
   termination decisions.  Two different types of markings have been
   defined.  This document gives a summary of the marking requirements,
   the constraints to encode them in the current IP header (version 4
   and above), and it explains why the PCN WG currently supports
   different encoding schemes for PCN marking.

1.  Introduction

   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a link-specific and load-
   dependent packet marking mechanism for Differentiated Services
   networks which are then called PCN domains [RFC5559].  Links in such
   a network are configured with rate thresholds which are significantly
   lower than their bandwidth, and if the rate of specially marked PCN
   traffic exceeds such a threshold, PCN traffic is re-marked.  These
   packet markings are used to support PCN-based admission control (AC)
   and flow termination (FT) in Differentiated Services networks in a
   simple way.  High-priority traffic receives preferential treatment in
   a Differentiated Services network and AC limits the amount of high-
   priority traffic to avoid congestion on the links of the domain by
   explicitly admitting or blocking new flows that want to be carried by
   the high-priority per-hop behavior (PHB).  In case of link or node
   failures, high-priority traffic may be rerouted so that links can be
   overloaded with admitted high-priority traffic.  In such and other
   exceptional cases, FT can terminate some admitted flows to reduce the
   rate on affected links to a non-critical level.

   A straightforward implementation of PCN-based AC and FT requires two
   rate thresholds per link: when an PCN-admissible-rate (AR) threshold
   is exceeded, new flows should be blocked and when a PCN-supportable-
   rate (SR) threshold is exceeded, some already admitted flows should
   be terminated (see Fig. 3 in [RFC5559]).  This requires one metering
   and marking algorithms configured with the AR and another configured
   with the SR.  The challenge is the encoding of the required PCN marks
   which requires at least three different codepoints for not-marked PCN
   traffic, PCN traffic re-marked by the marker configured with the AR,
   and PCN traffic re-marked by the marker configured with the SR.
   Since unused codepoints are not available for that purpose in the IP
   header (version 4 and 6), already used codepoints must be re-used
   which imposes additional constraints on design and applicability of
   PCN-based AC and FT.  This document summarizes these issues for
   historical purposes.

   In Section 2, we briefly point out PCN encoding requirement imposed
   by metering and marking algorithms, and by special packet drop
   strategies.  The Differentiated Services Codepoint (6 bits) and the
   ECN field (2 bits) have been selected to be re-used for encoding of
   PCN marks (PCN encoding).  In Section 3, we briefly explain the
   constraints imposed by this decision.  In Section 4, we review
   different PCN encodings supported by the PCN working group that allow
   different implementations of PCN-based AC and FT which have different
   pros and cons.

2.  General PCN Encoding Requirements

   Metering and marking algorithms, the way they are applied for PCN-
   based AC and FT, as well as packet drop strategies impose special
   requirements on PCN encoding.

2.1.  Metering and Marking Algorithms

   Two different metering and marking algorithms are defined in
   [RFC5670]: excess-traffic-marking and threshold-marking.  They are
   both configured with a reference rate which is termed PCN-excess-rate
   and PCN-threshold-rate, respectively.  When traffic for PCN flows
   enter a PCN domain, the PCN ingress node sets a codepoint in the IP
   header indicating that the packet is subject to PCN metering and
   marking and that it is not-marked (NM).  The two metering and marking
   algorithms possibly re-mark PCN packets as PCN and excess-traffic-
   marked (ETM) or threshold-marked (ThM).

   Excess-traffic-marking leaves a rate of PCN traffic equal to the PCN-
   excess-rate to be not-ETM marked if possible.  To that end, the
   algorithm needs access to the information whether a PCN packet is
   already ETM marked or not.  Threshold-marking re-marks all PCN
   traffic to ThM when the rate of PCN traffic exceeds the PCN-
   threshold-rate.  Therefore, it does not need access to the exact
   marking information of a PCN packet.

2.2.  Approaches for PCN Based Admission Control and Flow Termination

   We briefly review three different approaches to implement PCN-based
   AC and FT and derive their requirements for PCN encoding.

2.2.1.  Dual Marking (DM)

   The intuitive approach for PCN-based AC and FT requires that
   threshold and excess-traffic-marking are simultaneously activated on
   all links of a PCN domain and their reference rate is configured with
   the PCN-admissible-rate (AR) and the PCN-supportable-rate (SR),
   respectively.  Threshold-marking meters all PCN traffic, but re-marks
   only not-marked traffic (NM) to ThM.  Excess-traffic-marking meters
   only non-ETM traffic and re-marks either not-marked (NM) or
   threshold-marked (ThM) PCN traffic to ETM.  Thus, both meters and
   markers need to identify PCN packets and their exact PCN codepoint.
   We call this marking behavior dual marking (DM) and Figure 1
   illustrates all possible re-marking actions.

                    > ETM <

     Figure 1: PCN Codepoint Re-Marking Diagram for Dual Marking (DM)

   Dual marking is used to support the Controlled-Load PCN (CL-PCN) edge
   behavior [I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour].  We briefly summarize the
   concept.  All actions are performed on ingress-egress-aggregate
   basis.  The egress node measures the rate of NM-, ThM-, and ETM-
   traffic in regular intervals and sends them as PCN egress reports to
   the AC and FT decision point.  If the proportion of marked (ThM- and
   ETM-) PCN traffic is larger than a PCN-admission-threshold, the
   decision point blocks new flow requests until new PCN egress reports
   are received, otherwise it admits them.  With CL-PCN, AC is rather
   robust with regard to value chosen for the PCN-admission-threshold.
   FT works as follows.  If the ETM-traffic rate is positive, the
   decision point triggers the ingress node to send a newly measured
   rate of the sent PCN traffic.  The decision point calculates the rate
   of PCN traffic that needs to be terminated by

   termination-rate = PCN-ingress-rate - (rate-of-NM-traffic + rate-of-
   ThM-traffic),

   and terminates an appropriate set of flows.  CL-PCN is accurate
   enough for most application scenarios and its implementation
   complexity is acceptable, therefore, it is a preferred implementation
   option for PCN-based AC and FT.

2.2.2.  Single Marking (SM)

   Single-marking uses only excess-traffic-marking whose reference rate
   is set to the PCN-admissible-rate (AR) on all links of the PCN
   domain.  Figure 2 illustrates all possible re-marking actions.

                NM --------> ETM


    Figure 2: PCN Codepoint Re-Marking Diagram for Single Marking (SM)

   Single marking is used to support the single-marking PCN (SM-PCN)
   edge behavior [I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour].  We briefly summarize
   the concept.  AC works essentially in the same way as with CL-PCN but
   AC is sensitive to the value of the PCN-admission-threshold.  Also FT
   works similarly to CL-PCN.  The PCN-supportable-rate (SR) is only
   indirectly configured on any link by

   SR=u*AR

   in the PCN domain using a network-wide constant u.  The decision
   point triggers FT only if the rate-of-NM-traffic * u < rate-of-NM-
   traffic + rate-of-ETM-traffic, and the amount of PCN traffic to be
   terminated is calculated by

   termination-rate = PCN-ingress-rate - rate-of-NM-traffic * u,

   and terminates an appropriate set of flows.

   SM-PCN has two major benefits: it requires only two PCN codepoints
   and only excess-traffic-marking is needed which means that it might
   be earlier to the market than CL-PCN since threshold-marking is not
   available off the shelf.  However, it works well only when ingress-
   egress-aggregates have a high PCN packet rate which is not always the
   case.  Otherwise, over-admission and over-termination may occur
   [Menth08-Sub-8] [Menth08-Sub-9].

2.2.3.  Packet Specific Dual Marking (PSDM)

   Packet-specific dual marking (PSDM) uses threshold-marking and
   excess-traffic-marking whose reference rates are configured with the
   PCN-admissible-rate and the PCN-supportable-rate, respectively.
   There are two different types of not-marked packets: those that are
   subject to threshold-marking (not-ThM) and those that are subject to
   excess-traffic-marking (not-ETM).  Threshold-marking meters all PCN
   traffic and re-marks only not-ThM packets to PCN-marked (PM).  In
   contrast, excess-traffic-marking meters only not-ETM packets and
   possibly re-marks them to PM, too.  Again, both meters and markers
   need to identify PCN packets and their exact PCN codepoint.  Figure 3
   illustrates all possible re-marking actions.

                  \        /
                    > PM <

                              Marking (PSDM)

   An edge behavior for PSDM has been presented in [Menth09f].  We call
   it PSDM-PCN.  In contrast to CL-PCN and SM-PCN, AC is realized by a
   packet probing mechanism.  Only a single probe packet is needed for
   the admission decision of a new flow, and even that probe packet may

   be part of an end-to-end signaling protocol so that no extra traffic
   is generated (implicit probing).  When a flow requests admission, a
   probe packet is sent and the admission decision depends on whether
   the probe packet was re-marked or not.  More specifically, the
   ingress node sets the ECN field of probe-packets to not-ThM and
   threshold marking configured with the PCN-admissible-rate possibly
   re-marks them to PM.  In contrast, the ECN field of normal data
   packets is initially set to not-ETM and excess-traffic-marking
   configured with the PCN-supportable-rate possibly re-marks them to
   PM.  For FT, the same algorithm may be used as for CL-PCN.

   Disadvantages of this approach are that the implementation of the
   packet probing mechanism seems to be complex.  Advantages are that
   the AC algorithm is more accurate than the one of CL-PCN and SM-PCN
   [Menth08-Sub-8] and that packet re-marking comes with fewer
   constraints.  Section 4.4 will shows that this is an important
   feature.

2.2.4.  Preferential Packet Dropping

   The termination algorithms proposed in the standards require
   preferential dropping of ETM-marked packets to avoid over-termination
   in case of packet loss [I-D.ietf-pcn-cl-edge-behaviour],
   [I-D.ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour].  An analysis explaining this
   phenomenon can be found in section 4 of [Menth08-Sub-9].  Thus,
   preferential dropping of ETM-marked packets is also recommended in
   [RFC5670].  As a consequence, droppers must have access to the exact
   marking information of PCN packets.


3.  Encoding Constraints

   The Differentiated Services (DS) field is chosen for the encoding of
   PCN marks.  This section briefly reviews the DS field and the
   constraints imposed by its reuse are summarized.

3.1.  Structure of the DS Field

   Figure 4 shows the structure of the DS and ECN fields.  [RFC0793]
   defined the 8 bit ToS field and [RFC2474] redefined it as DS field.
   It consists of a 6 bit DS codepoint (DSCP, see [RFC2474]).

3.2.  Constraints from the DSCP

   The DSCP indicates the per-hop behavior (PHB), i.e., the treatment IP
   packets receive from nodes in a DS domain.  Multiple DSCPs may
   indicate the same PHB.  PCN traffic is high-priority traffic and
   requires a special DSCPs that indicate a PHB with preferred
   treatment.

3.2.1.  General Scarcity of DSCPs

   As the number of unused DSCPs is small, PCN encoding should use only
   a single DSCP if possible, in any case not more than two DSCPs.
   Therefore, the DSCP should be used to indicate that traffic is
   subject to PCN metering and marking, but not to differentiate
   differently marked PCN traffic.

3.2.2.  Tunneling Rules

   PCN encoding must be chosen in such a way that PCN traffic can be
   tunneled within a PCN domain without any impact on PCN metering and
   re-marking.  In the following, the "inner header" refers to the
   header of the encapsulated packet and the "outer header" refers to
   the encapsulating header.

   [RFC2983] provides two tunneling modes for Differentiated Services
   networks.  The uniform model copies the DSCP from the inner header to
   the outer header upon encapsulation and it copies the DSCP from the
   outer header to the inner header upon decapsulation.  This assures
   that changes applied to the DSCP field survive encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  In contrast, the pipe model ignores the content of
   the DSCP field in the outer header upon decapsulation.  Therefore,
   decapsulation erases changes applied to the DSCP along the tunnel.
   As a consequence, only the uniform model may be used for tunneling
   PCN traffic within a PCN domain when PCN encoding uses more than a
   single DSCP.

3.2.3.  Restoration of Original DSCPs at the Egress Node

   PCN-based AC and FT may be requested for traffic with different
   DSCPs.  Then, ingress nodes must mark the traffic of these flows as
   non-marked PCN traffic (DSCP nNM).  Such traffic may be re-marked to
   threshold-marked or excess-traffic-marked PCN traffic (DSCP nThM,
   nETM) within the PCN domain. nNM, nThM, and nETM designate the DSCPs
   needed for encoding whereby they may all be the same DSCP n if the
   differentiation of the PCN codepoints is achieved in the ECN field.
   It is desirable that the egress node restores the original DSCP when
   PCN traffic leaves the PCN domain.  This may be achieved through
   various options.

   1.  A different PCN encoding ((mNM, mThM, mETM), (nNM, nThM, nETM),
       (oNM, oThM, oETM)) may be provided for different original DSCPs
       (i, j, k).  The ingress re-marks incoming PCN traffic as not-
       marked, i.e., it maps DSCPs (i, j, k) to DSCPs (mNM, nNM, oNM).
       Within the PCN domain, PCN traffic may be re-marked.  The egress
       node can restore the original DSCP by re-mapping ((mNM, mThM,
       mETM), (nNM, nThM, nETM), (oNM, oThM, oETM)) to (i, j, k).  If
       PCN encoding uses N different DSCPs, this restoration technique
       requires N*M DSCPs where M is the number of original DSCPs that
       need to be differentiated.  This solution may work well in IP
       networks.  However, when PCN is applied to MPLS networks or other
       layers restricted to 8 QoS classes and codepoints, this solution
       fails due to the extreme shortage of available DSCPs.

   2.  The original DSCP for the Packets of a flow may be signaled to
       the egress node.  The egress node restores the original DSCP in
       the packets of this flow.  This option assumes that all packets
       of a flow have the same DSCP and were not re-marked by previous
       network elements.  A suitable signaling protocol is still missing
       and there are voice claiming that this solution cannot work for
       backbone networks.

   3.  PCN traffic may be tunneled from the ingress node to the egress
       node using the pipe model and PCN marking is applied only to the
       outer header.  The original DSCP is restored after decapsulation.
       However, tunneling across a PCN domain adds an additional IP
       header and reduces the maximum transfer unit (MTU) from the
       perspective of the user.  GRE, MPLS, or Ethernet using Pseudo-
       Wires are potential solutions that scale well also in backbone
       networks.

   As option (3) impacts the user payload and option (2) is neither
   implemented nor able to preserve the real DSCP of the packets, option
   (1) is attractive for IP networks.  However, it requires N*M
   different DSCPs for PCN encoding.  To keep this option realistic,

   only a single (N=1) DSCP should be used for PCN encoding.

3.3.  Constraints from the ECN Field

   This section briefly reviews the structure and use of the ECN field,
   the constraints imposed by the redefinition of the ECN field and its
   impact on PCN deployment, as well as the constraints imposed by
   various tunneling rules on the persistence of PCN marks after
   decapsulation and its impact on possible re-marking actions.

3.3.1.  Structure and Use of the ECN Field

   TCP recognizes congestion in the Internet by experienced packet
   drops.  The idea of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168]
   is that routers indicate incipient congestion to TCP receivers
   without dropping packets.  To that end, the router re-marks packets
   appropriately.  Figure 5 summarizes the codepoints defined in the ECN
   field.


              +-----+-----+
              | ECN FIELD |
              +-----+-----+
                 0     0         Not-ECT
                 0     1         ECT(1)
                 1     0         ECT(0)
                 1     1         CE


               Figure 5: ECN Codepoints within the ECN field

   ECT stands for "ECN-capable transport" and indicates that the sender
   and receivers of a flow understand ECN semantics.  Packets of other
   flows are labeled with not-ECT.  To indicate congestion to a
   receiver, routers may re-mark ECT(1) or ECT(0) labeled packets to CE
   which stands for "congestion experienced".  Two different ECT
   codepoints were introduced "to protect against accidental or
   malicious concealment of marked packets from the TCP sender" which
   may be the case with cheating receivers [RFC3540].

3.3.2.  Tunneling Rules

   When packets are encapsulated, the ECN field of the inner header may
   or may not be copied to the ECN field of the outer header and upon
   decapsulation, the ECN field of the outer header may or may not be
   copied from the ECN field of the outer header to the ECN field of the
   inner header.  Various tunneling rules with different treatment of
   the ECN field exist.  Two different modes are defined in [RFC3168]



Chan, et al.           Expires April 22,  2011                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2010


   for IP-in-IP tunnels and a third one in [RFC4301] for IP-in-IPsec
   tunnels.

3.3.2.1.  Limited Functionality Option

   The limited-functionality option has been defined in [RFC3168].  Upon
   encapsulation, the ECN field of the outer header is generally set to
   not-ECT.  Upon decapsulation, the ECN field of the inner header
   remains unchanged.  As this tunneling mode loses information upon
   encapsulation and decapsulation, it cannot be used for tunneling PCN
   traffic within a PCN domain.  However, the PCN ingress may use this
   mode to tunnel traffic with ECN semantics to the PCN egress to
   preserve the ECN field in the inner header while the ECN field of the
   outer header is used with PCN semantics within the PCN domain.

3.3.2.2.  Full Functionality Option

   The full-functionality option has been defined in [RFC3168].  Upon
   encapsulation, the ECN field of the inner header is copied to the
   outer unless the ECN field of the inner header carries CE.  In that
   case, the ECN field of the outer header is set to ECT(0).  This
   choice has been made for security reasons to disable the ECN fields
   of the outer header as a covert channel.  Upon decapsulation, the ECN
   field of the inner header remains unchanged unless the ECN field of
   the outer header carries CE.  In this case, the ECN field of the
   inner header is also set to CE.

   This mode imposes the following constraints on PCN metering and
   marking.  First, PCN must re-mark the ECN field only to CE because
   any other information is not copied to the inner header upon
   decapsulation and will be lost.  Second, CE information in
   encapsulated packet headers is invisible for routers along a tunnel.
   Threshold marking does not require information about whether PCN
   packets have already been marked and would work when CE denotes that
   packets are marked.  In contrast, excess-traffic-marking requires
   information about already excess-traffic-marked packets and cannot be
   supported with this tunneling mode.  Furthermore, this tunneling mode
   cannot be used when marked or not-marked packets should be
   preferentially dropped as the PCN marking information is possibly not
   visible in the outer header of a packet.

3.3.2.3.  Tunneling with IPSec

   Tunneling has been defined in Sect. 5.1.2.1 of [RFC4301].  Upon
   encapsulation, the ECN field of the inner header is copied to the ECN
   field of the outer header.  Decapsulation works as for the full-
   functionality option in Sect. 3.3.2.  Tunneling with IPsec also
   requires that PCN re-marks the ECN field only to CE because any other



Chan, et al.           Expires April 22,  2011                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2010


   information is not copied to the inner header upon decapsulation and
   lost.  In contrast to 3.3.2, with IPsec tunnels, CE marks of tunneled
   PCN traffic remain visible for routers along the tunnel and to their
   meters, markers, and droppers.

3.3.2.4.  ECN Tunneling Option

   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel] proposes a new tunneling for ECN
   information that is intended to update the presented options.  Upon
   encapsulation, with the compatibility mode, the ECN field of the
   outer header is reset to not-ECT while with the normal mode, the ECN
   field of the inner header is copied to the ECN field of the outer
   header (like the limited functionality option in 3.3.1).

   Upon decapsulation, the scheme in Figure 6 is applied.  Thus, re-
   marking encapsulated not-ECT packets to any other codepoint would not
   survive decapsulation.  Therefore, not-ECT cannot be used for PCN
   encoding.  Furthermore, re-marking encapsulated ECT(0) packets to
   ECT(1) or CE survives decapsulation, but not vice-versa, and re-
   marking encapsulated ECT(1) packets to CE also survives
   decapsulation, but not vice-versa.

3.3.3.  Restoration of the Original ECN Field at the EgressNode

   As ECN is an end-to-end service, it is desirable that the egress node
   of a PCN domain restores the ECN field a PCN packet had at the
   ingress node.  There are basically two options.  PCN traffic may be
   tunneled between ingress and egress node using limited functionality
   tunnels (see 3.3.2.1).  Then, PCN marking is applied only to the
   outer header, and the original ECN field is restored after

   decapsulation.  However, this reduces the MTU from the perspective of
   the user.  Another option is to use some intelligent encoding that
   preserves the ECN codepoints.  However, a viable solution is not
   known.

3.3.4.  Redefinition of the ECN Field

   The ECN field may be redefined for other purposes and [RFC2474] gives
   guidelines for that.  Essentially, not-ECT-marked packets must never
   be re-marked to ECT or CE because not-ECT-capable end systems do not
   reduce their transmission rate when receiving CE-marked packets.
   This is a threat to the stability of the Internet.  Moreover, CE-
   marked packet must not be re-marked to not-ECT or ECT, because then
   ECN-capable end systems cannot reduce their transmission rate.

   The re-use of the ECN field for PCN encoding has some impact on the
   deployment of PCN.  First, routers within a PCN domain must not apply
   ECN re-marking when the ECN field has PCN semantics.  Second, before
   a PCN packet leaves the PCN domain, the egress nodes must either (A)
   reset the ECN field of the packet to the contents it had when
   entering the PCN domain or (B) reset its ECN field to not-ECT.
   According to Section 3.3.3, tunneling ECN traffic through a PCN
   domain may help to implement (A).  When (B) applies, CE-marked
   packets must never become PCN packets within a PCN domain as the
   egress node resets their ECN field to not-ECT.  The ingress node may
   drop such traffic instead.


4.  Comparison of Encoding Options

   The PCN WG has produces four different PCN encodings which redefine
   the ECN field which are summarized in Figure 7.  While ECN semantics
   apply to all DSCPs, PCN semantics apply only to one or at most two
   special DSCPs n and m which need further specification.  These DSCPs
   imply a special PHB.  All PCN encodings allow the simultaneous use of
   the taken DSCP n or m also for non-PCN traffic by marking such
   traffic with a Not-PCN codepoint.  Generally, the ECN field of PCN
   Packets entering a PCN domain is set to not-marked (NM).

      Figure 7: Semantics of the ECN field for various encoding types

4.1.  Baseline Encoding

   With baseline encoding [RFC5696], the NM codepoint can be re-marked
   only to PCN-marked (PM).  Excess-traffic-marking uses PM as ETM,
   threshold-marking uses PM as ThM, and only one of the two marking
   schemes can be used.  The 10-codepoint is reserved for experimental
   purposes (EXP) and the other defined PCN encoding schemes can be seen
   as extensions of baseline encoding by appropriate redefinition of
   EXP.  Baseline encoding [RFC5696] works well with IPsec tunnels (see
   Section 3.3.3.3).

   As baseline encoding supports only two PCN-codepoints, only a single
   metering and marking scheme can be used.  It supports SM-PCN or only
   AC according to CL-PCN so that only threshold-marking is needed.  As
   mentioned before, SM-PCN may be inaccurate and a missing FT function
   is also a severe disadvantage.

4.2.  Encoding with 1 DSCP Providing 3 States

   PCN 3-state encoding extension in a single DSCP (3-in-1 encoding,
   ,[I-D.ietf-pcn-3-in-1-encoding] extents baseline encoding and
   supports the simultaneous use of both excess-traffic-marking and
   threshold-marking. 3-in-1 encoding well supports the preferred CL-PCN
   and also SM-PCN.




Chan, et al.           Expires April 22,  2011                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2010


   The problem with 3-in-1 encoding is that the 10-codepoint does not
   survive decapsulation with the tunneling options in Section 3.3.1 -
   3.3.3.  Therefore, 3-in-1 encoding may be used only for PCN domains
   implementing the new rules for ECN tunneling (draft-..., see Section
   3.3.3.4).  Currently it is not clear how fast the new tunneling rules
   will be deployed, but the applicability of 3-in-1-encoding depends on
   that.

4.3.  Encoding with 2 DSCPs Providing 3 or More States

   PCN encoding using 2 DSCPs to provide 3 or more states (3-in-2
   encoding, [I-D.ietf-pcn-3-state-encoding] uses two different DSCPs to
   accommodate the three required codepoints NM, ThM, and ETM.  It
   leaves some codepoints currently unused (CU) and proposes also one
   way how to reuse them to store some information about the content of
   the ECN field before the packet entered the PCN domain. 3-in-2
   encoding works well with IPsec tunnels (see Section 3.3.3).  It well
   supports the preferred CL-PCN and also SM-PCN.

   The disadvantage of 3-in-2 encoding is that it consumes two DSCPs.
   Moreover, the direct application of this encoding scheme to other
   technologies like MPLS where even fewer bits are available for the
   encoding of DSCPs is more than difficult.

4.4.  Encoding for Packet Specific Dual Marking (PSDM)

   PCN encoding for packet-specific dual marking (PSDM) is designed to
   support PSDM-PCN outlined in Section 2.3.  It is the only proposal
   that supports PCN-based AC and FT with only a single DSCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcn-psdm-encoding] in the presence of IPsec tunnels (see
   Section 3.3.3).  PSDM encoding also supports SM-PCN.


5.  Conclusion

   In this document, we have summarized various requirements for PCN
   encodings and the constraints imposed by the redefinition of the DS
   field for PCN encodings.  We presented an overview of the currently
   supported PCN encodings and explained their pros and cons.  As the
   accuracy of CL-PCN is good enough and its complexity is acceptable,
   the redefinition of ECN tunneling rules and their deployment is
   desirable so that 3-in-1 encoding can support CL-PCN using only a
   single DSCP.  Moreover, it also supports SM-PCN which is important
   for the deployment of PCN-based AC and FT if threshold-marking is not
   offered by vendors.

6.  Security Implications

   Packets from normal precedence and higher precedence sessions
   [ITU-MLPP] aren't distinguishable by PCN Interior Nodes.  This
   prevents an attacker specifically targeting, in the data plane,
   higher precedence packets (perhaps for DoS or for eavesdropping).
   However, PCN End Nodes can access this information to help decide
   whether to admit or terminate a flow.  The separation of network
   information provided by the Interior Nodes and the precedence
   information at the PCN End Nodes allows simpler, easier and better
   focused security enforcement.

   PCN End Nodes police packets to ensure a flow sticks within its
   agreed limit.  This is similar to the existing IntServ behaviour.
   Between them the PCN End Nodes must fully encircle the PCN-Region,
   otherwise packets could enter the PCN-Region without being subject to
   admission control, which would potentially destroy the QoS of
   existing flows.

   It is assumed that all the Interior Nodes and PCN End Nodes run PCN
   and trust each other (ie the PCN-enabled Internet Region is a
   controlled environment).  For instance a non-PCN router wouldn't be
   able to alert that it's suffering pre-congestion, which potentially
   would lead to too many calls being admitted (or too few being
   terminated).  Worse, a rogue router could perform attacks such as
   marking all packets so that no flows were admitted.

   So security requirements are focussed at specific parts of the PCN-
   Region:

      The PCN End Nodes become the trust points.  The degree of trust
      required depends on the kinds of decisions it has to make and the
      kinds of information it needs to make them.  For example when the
      PCN End Node needs to know the contents of the sessions for making
      the decisions, when the contents are highly classified, the
      security requirements for the PCN End Nodes involved will also
      need to be high.

      PCN-marking by the Interior Nodes along the packet forwarding path
      needs to be trusted, because the PCN End Nodes rely on this
      information.

Appendix A.  Considerations for Selection of PCN Encoding

   This document provides an historical account on the examination of
   the different ways to encode pre-congestion notification (PCN)
   [RFC5559] information in IP packets for transporting the information
   from the PCN ingress nodes, through the PCN interior nodes, to the
   PCN egress nodes.  Documenting the examination results to indicate
   the reasoning behind the approach in selection of PCN encoding in IP
   packets.  The appendix provides additional information and keeps an
   account of the reasoning and lessons learned from the consideration
   of the different encoding choices.

   There are a number of criteria that affect the choice of encoding to
   be used.  The key ones are:

   1.  The support of the required encoding states to satisfy the
       functional requirement of PCN.  These required encoding states
       may need two, or three, or four encoding code points to
       represent.

   2.  Compliance with RFC 4774 [RFC4774] if the ECN field is to be re-
       used for PCN encoding.

   3.  Compliance with the requirements for specifying DSCPs and DSCP
       per-hop-behaviour groups [RFC2474].

   4.  Any PCN marking has to carry the '11' codepoint in the ECN field
       since this is the only codepoint that is guaranteed to be copied
       down into the tunneling inner header upon decapsulation.  This
       criterion is related to the constraints that any PCN encoding
       needs to survive being tunnelled through either an IP in IP
       tunnel or an IPsec Tunnel.

   5.  Co-existence of PCN and not-PCN traffic: It is important to note
       that the scarcity of pool 1 DSCPs coupled with the fact that PCN
       is envisaged as a marking behaviour that could be applied to a
       number of different DSCPs makes it essential that we provide a
       not-PCN state.  Because PCN re-defines the meaning of the ECN
       field for such DSCPs it is important to allow an operator to
       still use the DSCP for traffic that isn't PCN-enabled.  This is
       achieved by providing a Not-PCN state within the encoding scheme.

Appendix A.1.  Encoding Options

   There are couple of methods to carry the PCN marks.  The method used
   affects the possible encoding options.  Hence when we describe the
   different encoding options in this appendix, we group them based on
   how the encoding states are carried.

   The encoding transport methods considered are:

   1.  using the combination of the ECN and DSCP bits of a data packet
       header

   2.  using only the DSCP bits of a data packet header

   3.  using only the ECN bits of a data packet header

   We discuss the encoding options for each of the encoding transport
   methods separately in their own subsections.

   The main required encoding states for PCN capable packets are listed
   below:

   o  Not-Marked (NM), for indication of No Pre-Congestion Indication.

   o  Admission Marked (AM), for indication of Flow Admission
      Information.

   o  Termination Marked (TM), for indication of Flow Termination
      Information.

   o  Affected Marked (AfM), for indication of ECMP Information.

   o  Not-PCN, for indication of packets that are not PCN-enabled.

   A total of five main required encoding states for PCN capable
   packets.


Appendix B.  Encoding Using ECN and DSCP Fields

   The use of both DSCP and ECN fields is following an approach that
   allows a clean traffic treatment separation of PCN Capable traffic
   and Non PCN Capable traffic.  This natural use of the DSCP field, to
   provide treatment differentiation of packets using different DSCP
   encoding, is one way of providing the "PCN Capable Packet" encoding
   state.  The using of this approach allows us to focus on encoding the
   four required PCN Encoding States using the two ECN bits.

   Notes: NA means Not Applicable.  PCN-1, PCN-2 under the DSCP column
   denotes specific DSCPs used to indicate PCN capable packets.  AM/TM
   means the two encoding states are sharing the same encoding bit
   pattern.  NM means Not-Marked to represent Not Pre-Congested.  Not-
   PCN means that packets are not PCN enabled.

      Figure 8: Encoding of PCN Information Using DSCP and ECN Fields

   In Figure 8, we listed the fundamental options when both DSCP and ECN
   fields are used.  In Option 4 the ECN codepoints '01' and '10' could
   both be used for NM encoding or one of them could be used for NM
   encoding and the other for experimental encoding.  There are couple
   of variations of the theme provided by these options.  One way of
   comparing these options is by examining the pros and cons of the
   different ways the four code points provided by the two ECN bits are
   used.  We group these discussions in the following way:

   1.  The '01' and '10' code points.

   2.  The '11' code point.

   3.  The '00' code point.

   We discuss each of them in the following sub-sections.

Appendix B.1.  The Use of '01' and '10' Encoding for PCN

   There can be different degrees of usage of the '01' and '10' code
   points by PCN:



Chan, et al.           Expires April 22,  2011                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2010


   1.  PCN Does NOT use the '01' and '10' code points, see Option 3 and
       Option 5.  This will be the safest choice.  But this choice will
       leave us with only two usable code points, unless we want to
       deploy more than one PCN DSCPs.  Even when the PCN domain does
       not use these code points, the PCN domain still have to handle
       the receiving of '01' and '10' packets at ingress.  The notion of
       safe comes in two flavors, first if there is any packets in the
       PCN domain having the '01' or '10' encoding, it is immediately
       known that these are packets in error, either they are leaked
       into the PCN domain in error or are set to '01' or '10' in error
       inside the PCN domain.  In both cases, action can be taken.  The
       second flavor of safe is if a legitimate PCN packet leaks out of
       the PCN domain, it will not have the '01' or '10' encoding and
       should not cause an ECN router to mistaken the PCN packets to be
       ECN packets.

   2.  PCN uses '01' and '10' code points in an ECN friendly manner, see
       Options 1, 2, 4, and 6.  One ECN friendly manner is to have both
       '01' and '10' to mean "PCN Capable Packet".  The determination of
       ECN friendliness depends on the use of code points beside '01'
       and '10'.  Furthermore, the use of '01' and '10' codepoints allow
       the transport of the Not-PCN encoding, see Option 4.

Appendix B.2.  The Use of '11' Encoding for PCN

   Not using the '11' code point for PCN will be a safe choice from the
   ECN semantic point of view, see Option 6.  However, this will reduce
   the possible numger of encoding codepoints to three.  And the '11'
   code point is the only code point that survive tunneling.  The
   encoding codepoint '11' is used in Options 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Appendix B.3.  The Use of '00' Encoding for PCN

   The '00' codepoint are used by ECN to indicate Not ECN enabled.  A
   safe use of '00' codepoint by PCN will be to indicat Not PCN enabled,
   as in Option 4.  The other usage may have problem in some of the
   environments.

Appendix B.4.  Benefits of Using DSCP and ECN Fields

   A major feature of using both DSCP and ECN fields is the ability to
   use the inherent nature of DiffServ for traffic class separation to
   allow PCN treatment be applied to PCN traffic, without concerns of
   applying PCN treatment to none PCN traffic and vise versa.  This
   feature frees this approach for PCN encoding from some of the
   concerns raised by RFC 4774 [RFC4774].  This feature will also keep
   none PCN Capable traffic out of the PCN treatment mechanisms,
   allowing the PCN treatment mechanisms focus on their respective PCN

   tasks.

   This approach also leaves the ECN field available totally for PCN
   encoding states purposes.  Removing the need to carry the Not-PCN
   Encoding in the ECN field.

Appendix B.5.  Drawbacks of Using DSCP and ECN Fields

   The use of both DSCP and ECN fields will require the setting aside of
   one (or possibly two) DSCP for use by PCN.  This may add complexity
   to the PCN encoding standardization effort.

Appendix B.6.  Comparing DSCP and ECN Fields Encoding Options

   Here we discuss the differences between the different encoding
   options when both DSCP and ECN fields are used.  There are many
   encoding options, we have provided the ones we think are favorable in
   Figure 8.

   When DSCP is used to differentiate between PCN capable and Not-PCN
   capable traffic, the encoding of "Not-PCN" in the ECN field is not
   required.  This is the motivation for Option 1 in Figure 8, where the
   encoding "00" for "Not-ECT" is being used for "AM" (Admission
   Marking) encoding state.  The encodings "01" and "10" for "ECT(1)"
   and "ECT(0)" supports the required encoding states for "Not Pre-
   Congested Marking" (PCN), and reserving them for any "Nonce Marking"
   if necessary.  With the possible additional encoding of "PCN(A)" and
   "PCN(T)" in place of "ECT(1)" and "ECT(0)" for indicating percentage
   of Admission Marked traffic and percentage of Termination Marked
   traffic when the algorithm benefits from such additional information.

   Option 2 in Figure 8 uses the "00" encoding for "AfM".  With '01' and
   '10' encoding the same as for Option 1, requiring the use of "11"
   encoding for both "AM" (Admission Mark) and "TM" (Termination Mark)
   states or requiring the allocation of a DSCP for encoding the "TM"
   state.

   Option 4 is the only option that can fulfill both criteria 4 and 5,
   listed in Appendix A.

Appendix B.7.  Concerns on Alternate Semantics for the ECN Field

   Section 2 of [RFC4774] raised couple of concerns for usage of
   alternate semantics for the ECN field.  We try to address each of the
   concerns in this section.

   1.  Section 3.1 of [RFC4774] discusses Concern 1: "How routers know
       which ECN semantics to use with which packets."  This use of DSCP



Chan, et al.           Expires April 22,  2011                 [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                  Document                    October 2010


       and ECN for encoding PCN states address this by following the
       recommendation of [RFC4774] on using a diffserv codepoint to
       identify the packets using the alternate ECN semantics.  This
       diffserv codepoint may possibly be a new diffserv codepoint to
       minimize the possible confusion between using the old per hop
       behavior of the codepoint and the using of the alternate ECN
       semantics per hop behavior of the codepoint.

   2.  Section 4 of [RFC4774] discusses Concern 2: "How does the
       possible presence of old routers affect the performance of the
       alternate ECN connections."  With the notion of old routers
       meaning routers that performs RFC 3168 ECN processing instead of
       PCN processing.  An answer to this question is given by assuming
       that the environment using the alternate ECN semantics is
       envisioned to be within a single administrative domain, and it
       has the ability to ensure that all routers along the path
       understand and agree to the use of the alternate ECN semantics
       for the traffic identified by the use of a diffserv codepoint.
       This uses option 2 indicated in section 4.2 of [RFC4774].  But
       incase there is a mis-configuration, the choice of encoding may
       make a difference:

       *  With encoding Option 1, the old routers will interprete:

          +  '00' encoding as Not-ECT, and will drop AM marked packets.
             The PCN edge nodes should not admit traffic that it does
             not receive, hence the PCN admission functionality should
             be OK.

          +  '01' encoding as ECT(1), which indicates ECN capable and
             can be remarked to '11' to indicate congestion experienced.
             The RFC 3168 ECN CE encoding have the same functionality as
             the PCN TM encoding, to reduce the offered traffic load.
             Hence the PCN termination functionality should be OK.

          +  '10' encoding as ECT(0).  The discussion for '01' above
             applies equally to this encoding.

          +  '11' encoding as CE.  The old router should use this
             encoding to reduce the offered traffic load and should not
             remark this to any other ECN encoding, the same
             functionality the PCN TM encoding requires, hence should be
             OK for PCN.

          The above discussion for Option 1 applies equally for PCN
          traffic leaked out of the PCN domain and interpreted by RFC
          3168 ECN nodes.

       *  With encoding Option 2, the old routers will interpret:

          +  '00' encoding as Not-ECT, and will drop AfM marked packets.
             This may possibly affect the efficiency of the Affected
             Marking functionality.

          +  '01' encoding as ECT(1), which indicates ECN capable and
             can be remarked to '11' to indicate congestion experienced.
             The RFC 3168 ECN CE encoding have the same functionality as
             the PCN TM encoding, to reduce the offered traffic load.
             Depending on the PCN algorithm on how AM and TM share the
             same '11' encoding, this may or may not affect the
             functionality of PCN.

          +  '10' encoding as ECT(0).  The discussion for '01' above
             applies equally to this encoding.

          +  '11' encoding as CE.  The old router should use this
             encoding to reduce the offered traffic load and should not
             remark this to any other ECN encoding.  Depending on the
             PCN algorithm on how AM and TM share the same '11'
             encoding, this may or may not affect the functionality of
             PCN.

          The above discussion for Option 2 applies equally for PCN
          traffic leaked out of the PCN domain and interpreted by RFC
          3168 ECN nodes.

   3.  Concern 3: "How does the possible presence of old routers affect
       the coexistence of the alternate ECN traffic with competing
       traffic on the path."  Within the PCN domain, the PCN (alternate
       ECN) traffic is separated from the other traffic using diffserv.
       If by mis-configuration, an old routers that does not understand
       PCN handles PCN traffic, the PCN traffic will get the per hop
       behavior as the other traffic, hence not receiving the benefits
       of PCN at the old router, but will not affect the coexistence of
       the PCN and the other traffic.  If the old router uses RFC 3168
       ECN congestion treatment, then the discussion for Concern 2 above
       applies.

   4.  Concern 4: "How well does the alternate ECN traffic perform."
       The performance of the different proposed PCN (alternate ECN)
       metering and marking algorithms are currently under study with
       their simulation and study results described by their respective
       documents.

   The environment using the alternate ECN semantics is envisioned to be
   within a single administrative domain.  With the ability to ensure

   that all routers along the path understand and agree to the use of
   the alternate ECN semantics for the traffic identified by the use of
   a Diffserv codepoint.  This uses option 2 indicated in section 4.2 of
   [RFC4774].


Appendix C.  Encoding Using DSCP Field

   In this type of encoding and transport method the congestion and
   precongestion information is encoded into the 6 DSCP bits that are
   transported in the IP header of the data packets.  Four possible
   alternatives can be distinguished, as can be seen in Figure 9, with
   details provided by [I-D.westberg-pcn-load-control].  Option 7 needs
   2 additional DSCP values, Options 8 and 9 need three additional DSCP
   values and Option 10 needs four additional DSCP values.  Note that
   all additional and experimental DSCP values are representing and are
   associated with the same PHB.  The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th DSCP values
   are representing DSCP values that are assigned by IANA as DSCP
   experimental values, see [RFC2211].  Furthermore, all options listed
   in Figure 2 are able to support the Not-PCN encoding state.

Appendix C.1.  Benefits of Using DSCP Field

   The main benefits of using the DSCP field for PCN encoding are:

   o  it is not affecting the end-to-end ECN semantics and therefore the
      issues and concerns raised in [RFC4774] are not applicable for
      this encoding scheme.

   o  it is not affected by the PCN tunneling issues.

   o  all 4 DSCP encoding options depicted in Figure 9 can support the
      PCN capable not congested/UnMarked (UM) indication, the admission
      control (AM) and flow termination (TM) encoding states.

   o  the experimental DSCPs are lightly standardized and therefore, the
      rules on how to apply and use them are limited.  This provides a
      high flexibility to network operators to apply and use them in
      different settings.

   o  simple packet classification, since a router needs only to read
      the DSCP field, instead of reading both DSCP and ECN fields.

   o  Option 8 and 10 support the Affected Marking (AfM) encoding, which
      according to [I-D.westberg-pcn-load-control], it has benefits if
      the PCN-domain operates ECMP routing and is not using DSCP for
      route selection.

   o  by using an additional DSCP to encode the not congested PCN state,
      all PCN-ingress-nodes can be configured to encode this state into
      all packets that are entering the PCN domain and are PCN aware.
      This will solve any PCN-egress-node misconfiguration problems,
      which can allow a AM/TM or SM encoded packet to exit a PCN-domain.

Appendix C.2.  Drawbacks of Using DSCP Field

   The main drawbacks of using the DSCP field for PCN encoding are the
   following:

      this type of encoding needs to use per PHB, in addition to the
      original DSCP and depending on the encoding option used, one, two,
      three, or four DSCP values, respectively.  These additional DSCP
      values can be taken from the DSCP values that are not defined by
      standards action, see [RFC2211].  Note that all the additional
      DSCP values are representing and are associated with one PHB.  The
      value of this DSCP/PHB can either follow a standards action or use
      a value that is applied for experimental or local use.  It is
      important to note that the number of the DSCP values used for
      local or experimental use is restricted and therefore the number
      of different PHBs supported in the PCN domain will also be
      restricted.

      applying the DSCP field as PCN encoding transport within an PCN
      aware MPLS domain, see [RFC5129], can be problematic due to the
      scarce packet header real-estate.

      when the PCN-domain is operating ECMP that uses DSCP to select the
      routes, a risk of mis-ordering of packets within a flow might
      occur.  The impact of this drawback depends on the following:

      1.  the level of deployment of ECMP algorithms that use DSCP for
          route selection;

      2.  mis-ordering of packets within a flow when there is
          termination marking may be acceptable;

      3.  the possibility of configuring the ECMP algorithms that use
          DSCP for route selection in the PCN-domain that the used PCN
          aware DSCPs are belonging to the same PHB and therefore, all
          these DSCP values should be converted to one preconfigured
          DSCP value before applying it in the ECMP routing algorithm.
          Note that all the additional experimental DSCPs that are used
          within PCN are belonging to the same PHB.


Appendix D.  Encoding Using ECN Field

   This section takes the approach 3 option indicated in Appendix A.1.
   Which the DSCP field only indicates the packet forwarding behavior,
   for which both PCN Capable and Non PCN Capable traffic use/share the
   same DSCP.  This approach requires the use of the Not PCN Capable
   Encoding State to be encoding using the ECN bits.  Hence this section
   describes the encoding options that uses only the ECN field (without
   the DSCP field) available in the IP header of the data packets to
   encode the PCN states.

   The use of the same DSCP for both PCN Capable and Non PCN Capable
   also opens the question of having PCN and RFC 3168 ECN traffic using
   the same DSCP.  Which increases the importance of satisfying the
   concerns indicated in RFC 4774.

          Figure 10: Encoding of PCN Information Using ECN Field

   In Figure 10, we listed the fundamental options when only the ECN
   field is used.  Like in Figure 8, there are variations of the theme
   provided by these options.  For example, when both "01" and "10"
   encoding are used for NPM in Option 5, they can be interpreted as
   PCN(A) and PCN(T) instead of just PCN.  Using the PCN(A) and PCN(T)
   variation provides the additional information of the ratio of packets
   AM marked to packets Not AM marked, and the ratio of packets TM
   marked to packets Not TM marked.  Having these ratios being
   independent from one another.

   For Option 11, the use of '01' for AM and '10' for PCN can be swapped
   and provide the same functionality.  For Option 13, the use of '01'
   for AfM and '10' for PCN can also be swapped without change of
   functionality.

Appendix D.1.  Benefits of Using ECN Field

   The using of only the ECN field for encoding PCN encoding states
   allow more efficient use of the DSCP field, not requiring the
   allocation of PCN specific DSCP values.

   This approach also opens the question of possibly having both PCN and
   ECN traffic using the same DSCP.

   When the same treatment can be provided to both ECN and PCN traffic
   to achieve each of ECN and PCN purpose, then not having DiffServ as
   separation between ECN and PCN traffic may be a benefit.  Under such
   circumstances, having the same encoding between ECN and PCN may be
   desireable.  But this can only be true if the requirement set forth
   in [RFC4774] for alternate ECN semantics can be satisfied.

   If the same treatment can be applied to both ECN and PCN traffic,
   then:

   o  The first issue of [RFC4774]: "How routers know which ECN
      semantics to use with which packets." may be solved because there
      are no difference in the treatments of ECN and PCN packets, hence
      they can use the same semanics.

   o  The second and third issues of [RFC4774]: "How does the possible
      presence of old routers affect the performance of the alternate
      ECN connections." and "How does the possible presence of old
      routers affect the coexistence of the alternate ECN traffic with
      competing traffic on the path." are also solved because there are
      no difference in the treatment of ECN and PCN packets.

   o  The forth issue of [RFC4774]: "How well does the alternate ECN
      traffic perform." are dependent on the algorithm used, and should
      be provided by the respective algorithm document, and not in the
      scope of this document.

Appendix D.2.  Drawbacks of Using ECN Field

   Notice this group of encoding options does not use DiffServ code
   points for PCN encoding.  With this group of encoding options, the
   required states of "PCN Capable Transport"/"None PCN Capable
   Transport" must be encoded using the ECN field.  Leaving less
   encoding real estate to carry the remaining required PCN encoding
   states.  Another drawback is without the protection/separation
   capability provided by DiffServ, it is typically harder to satisfy
   the requirement set forth in [RFC4774] for alternate ECN semantics.

Appendix D.3.  Concerns on Alternate Semantics for the ECN Field

   Section 2 of [RFC4774] raised couple of concerns for usage of
   alternate semantics for the ECN field.  We try to address each of the
   concerns in this section.

   1.  Section 3.1 of [RFC4774] discusses Concern 1: "How routers know
       which ECN semantics to use with which packets."  When this group
       of PCN encodings are used without the use of DSCP, routers can
       not distinguished PCN encoded packets from RFC 3168 ECN encoded
       packets.  Hence there needs to be some kind of differentiation
       between PCN and RFC 3168 ECN packets, may be using PCN for real-
       time traffic types (with specific DSCP) and ECN for elastic
       traffic (with specific DSCP).  And only distinguishing PCN
       Capable and Non-PCN Capable packets in real-time traffic.  Only
       distinguishing ECT and Not-ECT packets in elastic traffic.  But
       not having PCN and ECN traffic together.

   2.  Section 4 of [RFC4774] discusses Concern 2: "How does the
       possible presence of old routers affect the performance of the
       alternate ECN connections."  With the notion of old routers
       meaning routers that performs RFC 3168 ECN processing instead of
       PCN processing, or drop packets instead of encoding the
       congestion information.  The easy answer is the environment using
       the alternate ECN semantics is envisioned to be within a single
       administrative domain.  With the ability to ensure that all
       routers along the path understand and agree to the use of the
       alternate ECN semantics for the traffic identified to be PCN
       Capable.  This uses option 2 indicated in section 4.2 of
       [RFC4774].  But incase there is mis-configuration, the choice of
       encoding may make a difference:

       *  With encoding Option 11, the old routers will interpret:

          +  '00' encoding as Not-ECT, and will drop Not-PCN marked
             packets when congestion is detected.  With '00' the
             encoding for Not-PCN, requiring the same functionality as
             Not-ECT, the presence of old routers will not affect the
             performance of PCN functionality.

          +  '01' encoding as ECT(1), which indicates ECN capable and
             can be remarked to '11' to indicate congestion experienced.
             For Option 11, the old router can possibly remark AM to TM.
             This puts a burden on the metering and marking algorithms
             to treat TM encoded packets to indicate stop admission.
             This may or may not be acceptable, depending on the
             algorithm.

          +  '10' encoding as ECT(0), which indicates ECN capable and
             can be remarked to '11' to indicate congestion experienced.
             The RFC 3168 ECN CE encoding have the same functionality as
             the PCN TM encoding, to reduce the offered traffic load.
             Hence the PCN termination functionality should be OK.

          +  '11' encoding as CE.  The old router should use this
             encoding to reduce the offered traffic load and should not
             remark this to any other ECN encoding, the same
             functionality the PCN TM encoding requires, hence should be
             OK for PCN.

          The above discussion for Option 11 applies equally for PCN
          traffic leaked out of the PCN domain and interpreted by RFC
          3168 ECN nodes.

       *  With encoding Option 12, the old routers will interprete:

          +  '00' encoding as Not-ECT, and will drop Not-PCN marked
             packets when congestion is detected.  With '00' the
             encoding for Not-PCN, requiring the same functionality as
             Not-ECT, the presence of old routers will not affect the
             performance of PCN functionality.

          +  '01' encoding as ECT(1), which indicates ECN capable and
             can be remarked to '11' to indicate congestion experienced.
             The RFC 3168 ECN CE encoding have the same functionality as
             the PCN TM encoding, to reduce the offered traffic load.
             Depending on the PCN algorithm on how AM and TM share the
             same '11' encoding, this may or may not affect the
             functionality of PCN.

             applies equally to this encoding.

          +  '11' encoding as CE.  The old router should use this
             encoding to reduce the offered traffic load and should not
             remark this to any other ECN encoding.  Depending on the
             PCN algorithm on how AM and TM share the same '11'
             encoding, this may or may not affect the functionality of

          The above discussion for Option 12 applies equally for PCN
          traffic leaked out of the PCN domain and interpreted by RFC

       *  With encoding Option 13, the old routers will interprete:

          +  '00' encoding as Not-ECT, and will drop Not-PCN marked
             packets when congestion is detected.  With '00' the
             encoding for Not-PCN, requiring the same functionality as
             Not-ECT, the presence of old routers will not affect the

          +  '01' encoding as ECT(1), which indicates ECN capable and
             can be remarked to '11' to indicate congestion experienced.
             For Option 13, the old router can possibly remark AfM to
             TM.  This may or may not be acceptable, depending on the
             algorithm's Affected Marking functionality.

          +  '10' encoding as ECT(1), which indicates ECN capable and
             can be remarked to '11' to indicate congestion experienced.

   3.  Concern 3: "How does the possible presence of old routers affect
       the coexistence of the alternate ECN traffic with competing
       traffic on the path."  If RFC 3168 ECN and PCN traffic are to be
       treated within a single DiffServ PHB, because with these encoding
       there is no way to differentiate between the ECN packets from the
       PCN traffic, the metering and marking algorithm used must be
       totally friendly between ECN and PCN traffic, else they will
       affect each other in possibly non-acceptable ways.  These
       encoding will work OK with traffic besides ECN because of the use
       of 'Not-PCN' encoding.

   4.  Concern 4: "How well does the alternate ECN traffic perform."
       The performance of the different proposed PCN (alternate ECN)
       metering and marking algorithms are currently under study with
       their simulation and study results described by their respective
       documents.


Appendix E.  Encoding Choice Considerations

   With the discussions and constraints indicated by this document, the
   use of both the DSCP [RFC2474] and the ECN [RFC3168] fields are
   necessary to fullfill the requirement of encoding and transporting
   the PCN marks.
