Internet-Draft                JSON Pointer                  October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a syntax for identifying a
   specific value within a JSON [RFC4627] text document.  The syntax is
   intended to be expressed in a JSON string value or the URI fragment
   identifier of a resource that has a JSON representation.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses syntax rules using ABNF [RFC5234]
   (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) notation.  Additionally, it uses the
   following rules from URI syntax [RFC3986]: "unreserved" and "pct-
   encoded".


3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each
   prefixed by a "/" (%x2F) character.  Each reference token is a
   sequence of unreserved and/or percent-encoded characters, per
   [RFC3986].

   json-pointer = *( "/" reference-token )
   reference-token = *( unreserved / pct-encoded )

   Unreserved characters in reference tokens SHOULD be percent-encoded,
   per [RFC3986], and MUST be so encoded as "%2F" if the character is
   "/" to avoid being interpreted as a reference token prefix.

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer does not conform to this
   syntax.


4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation begins with a reference to the root value of a JSON text
   document, and completes with a reference to some value within the
   same document.  Each token in the JSON Pointer sequence is evaluated,
   changing the referenced value according to the following scheme:

   If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
   referenced value is the object property with the name identified by
   the token.  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the

Internet-Draft                JSON Pointer                  October 2011


   new referenced value is the array element with the zero-based index
   identified by the token.

   If a reference token is being evaluated against a concrete JSON text
   document, the implementation MAY evaluate each token against the
   currently referenced concrete value, and terminate evaluation with an
   error condition should a reference token fail to resolve to a
   concrete value.


5.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft includes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   A pointer is not guaranteed to resolve to a JSON value.
   Implementations of JSON Pointer should be aware of this and take
   appropriate precautions.

Internet-Draft                JSON Pointer                  October 2011


   The following examples illustrate the use of JSON pointers in URI
   fragments for a JSON text document located at
   http://example.com/example.json, with the following value:

   {
       "foo": {
           "bar": [ "element0", "element1" ],
           "inner object": {
               "baz": "qux"
       }
   }

   http://example.com/example.json#
      Resolves to the object value at the root of the JSON text
      document.

   http://example.com/example.json#/foo
      Resolves to the object value of the "foo" property in the root
      object.

   http://example.com/example.json#/foo/inner%20object
      Resolves to the object value of the "inner object" property in the
      "foo" object value in the root object.

   http://example.com/example.json#/foo/inner%20object/baz
      Resolves to the string value "qux", which is the value of the
      "baz" property in the "inner object" property in the "foo"
      property in the root object.

   http://example.com/example.json#/foo/bar/0
      Resolves to the string value "element0", which is the first value
      in the "bar" array in the "foo" property in the root object.
