  <abstract>

    <t> This document defines a standard profile for Bogon Origin
    Attestations (BOAs).  A BOA is a digitally signed object that
    provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has
    not authorized any Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes that
    are equivalent to any of the addresses listed in the BOA, and also
    provides a means of verifying that BGP speaker is not using an AS
    as a BGP speaker without appropriate authority to use that AS. The
    proposed application of BOAs is intended to fit within the
    requirements for adding security measures to inter-domain routing,
    including the ability to support incremental and piecemeal
    deployment of such measures, and does not require any changes to
    the specification of BGP. </t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <t>This document defines an application of the Resource Public Key
    Infrastructure (RPKI) to validate the attestations of Internet
    Registries that certain addresses are currently neither allocated
    nor assigned to any party, and any appearance of such addresses or
    ASes in a routing advertisement in the Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) <xref target="RFC4271" /> should be considered an invalid
    use of such addresses or ASes.</t>

    <t>The RPKI is based on Resource Certificates.  Resource
    Certificates are X.509 certificates that conform to the PKIX
    profile <xref target="RFC3280" />, and to the extensions for IP
    addresses and AS identifiers <xref target="RFC3779" />. A Resource
    Certificate describes an action by an Issuer that binds a list of
    IP address blocks and Autonomous System (AS) numbers to the
    Subject of a certificate, identified by the unique association of
    the Subject's private key with the public key contained in the
    Resource Certificate. The PKI is structured such that each current
    Resource Certificate matches a current resource allocation or
    assignment. This is described in <xref target="ID.ietf-sidr-arch"
    />.</t>

    <t>BOAs can be regarded as a logical opposite of a Route Origin
    Authorization (ROA) <xref target="ID.ietf-sidr-roa-format" />, and
    allows a resource holder to explicitly list those IP addresses and
    ASes that are denoted by the holder as not validly appearing in
    any routing advertisement, and to make this attestation in a
    manner that a relying party can validate under the framework of
    the RPKI.</t>

    <t>A BOA is a digitally signed object that makes use of
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC3852" /> as a
    standard encapsulation format. CMS was chosen to take advantage of
    existing open source software available for processing messages in
    this format.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Basic Format">

    <t>Using CMS syntax, a BOA is a type of signed-data object.  The
    general format of a CMS object is:</t>

      <t>The version is the syntax version number.  It MUST be 3,
      corresponding to the signerInfo structure having version number
      3.</t>

      <section title="digestAlgorithms">

      <t>The digestAlgorithms set MUST include only SHA-256, the OID

      <t>The content of a BOA identifies a list of one or more ASes and

      be "bogons" and, accordingly, BOAs are intended to act as a
      constraint on the routing system to signal that no route object
      that that relates to these ASes or IP addresses should be
      interpreted as representing a valid routing attestation. A BOA
      is formally defined as:</t>

      <section title="asIDs">

      <t>The asIDs field contains the AS numbers that are to be
      regarded as Bogon ASes. The set of AS numbers may be explicitly

      <section title="BOAIPAddressFamily">

      <t>The BOAIPAddressFamily field encodes the set of IP address
      prefixes that are to be regarded as Bogon IP addresses that are
      to be constrained from appearing in any routing advertisement.
      The intended semantics is that any route object that has the
      same address prefix as that listed as a Bogon IP address, or is
      a more specific prefix of a Bogon IP address can be regarded as
      a Bogon route object.</t>

      <t>Note that the syntax here is more restrictive than that used
      in the IP Address Delegation extension defined in RFC 3779. That
      extension can represent arbitrary address ranges, whereas BOAs
      contain only prefixes.</t>

      <t>Within the BOAIPAddressFamily structure, addressFamily
      contains the Address Family Identifier (AFI) of an IP address
      family. This specification only supports IPv4 and
      IPv6. Therefore, addressFamily MUST be either 0001 or 0002. The
      addresses field represents prefixes as a sequence of type
      IPAddress. (See <xref target="RFC3779" /> for more details.)</t>

     <t>The signer MUST digitally sign a collection of attributes
     along with the content payload. Each attribute in the collection
     MUST be DER-encoded. The syntax for attributes is defined in
     <xref target="X.501" />, and the X.500 Directory provides a rich
     attribute syntax. A very simple subset of this syntax is used
     extensively in <xref target="RFC3852" />, where ATTRIBUTE.Type
     and ATTRIBUTE.id are the only parts of the ATTRIBUTE class that
     are employed.</t>

     <t>Each of the attributes used with this CMS profile has a single
     attribute value. Even though the syntax is defined as a SET OF
     AttributeValue, there MUST be exactly one instance of
     AttributeValue present.</t>

     <t>The SignedAttributes syntax within signerInfo is defined as a
     SET OF Attribute. The SignedAttributes MUST include only one
     instance of any particular attribute.</t>

     <t>The signer MUST include the content-type and message-digest
     attributes. The signer MAY also include the signing-time signed
     attribute, the binary-signing-time signed attribute, or both
     signed attributes. Other signed attributes that are deemed
     appropriate MAY also be included. The intent is to allow
     additional signed attributes to be included if a future need is

      <t>Note that requiring an exact match between the IP address
      prefixes and ASes in a BOA and the IP address prefixes and ASes
      in the corresponding EE certificate does not place any
      limitations on BOA use. Since each EE certificate in the RPKI
      architecture is used to verify only a single BOA, it is natural
      to have the IP address prefixes in the certificate match those
      in the corresponding BOA.</t>

  </section>
  <section title="BOA Use Practices">

    <t>BOAs are intended to allow relying parties a means of
    validating whether route origination information as described in a
    route advertisement refers to an IP address or AS number that has
    not been validly allocated for use in the routing system.</t>

    <t>Any party with a validly assigned Internet resource set and a
    CA certificate that described this delegation can publish a BOA,
    independently of the actions of the actions of the party that
    assigned the resource set. BOAs are not hierarchically
    related.</t>

    <t>An Internet Registry SHOULD maintain a single BOA in relation
    to each parent registry that has assigned resources to this
    registry.</t>

    <t>An Internet Registry SHOULD maintain a regular issuance cycle
    for BOAs.</t>

    <t>For registries that operate on a day-to-day basis in terms of
    resource transactions, it is suggested that a local BOA management
    practice would be that a new BOA should be issued on a regular 24
    hour basis. The corresponding EE certificate should have a
    validity period of no more than 72 hours from the time of
    issuance. Each time a new EE certificate for a BOA is issued the
    previous BOA's EE certificate should be revoked and the previous
    BOA removed from the publication repository.</t>

    <t>Parties that operate a local cache of RPKI objects should
    ensure that they refresh BOA objects at intervals 24 hours to
    ensure that they have the current BOA in the local cache.</t>

  </section>
  <section title="BOA Interpretation">

    <t>A BOA can be used to check a route object to determine if the
    origination information in the route object refers to invalid IP
    addresses or an invalid AS number.</t>

    <t>If a route object has an AS origination that refers to an AS
    number that is included in a valid BOA then the route object can
    be regarded as a Bogon object, and local policies that apply to
    Bogon ASes can be applied to the object. This holds whether or not
    the address prefix of the route object is described by a valid ROA
    or not.</t>

    <t>If a route object has an address prefix that is equal to, or is
    a more specific prefix of an IP address that is included in a
    valid BOA then the route object can be regarded as a Bogon object,
    and local policies that apply to Bogon ASes can be applied to the
    object, unless the address prefix and AS origination of the route
    object is also described by a valid ROA, in which case the BOA is
    to be disregarded.</t>

    <t>The purpose of a BOA is to convey an attestation by an address
    holder that there is no authority for the generation of a route
    object that refers to specified addresses or origination from
    specified ASes. The integrity of a BOA must be established in
    order to validate the authority of the Bogon Attestation.  The BOA
    makes use of the CMS signed message format for integrity, and thus
    inherits the security considerations associated with that data
    structure. The right of the BOA signer to authorize the
    attestation of specified IP addresses and ASes as Bogons is
    established through use of the address space and AS number PKI
    described in <xref target="ID.ietf-sidr-arch"
    />. Specifically, a relying party must verify the signature on the
    BOA using an X.509 certificate issued under this PKI, and check
    that the prefix(es) in the BOA match those in the address space
    extension in the certificate.</t>
