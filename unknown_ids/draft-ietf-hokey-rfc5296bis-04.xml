    <abstract>
      <t>The Handover Keying (HOKEY) Working Group seeks to minimize handover
      delay due to authentication when a peer moves from one point of
      attachment to another. Work has progressed on two different approaches
      to reduce handover delay: early authentication (so that authentication
      does not need to be performed during handover), and reuse of
      cryptographic material generated during an initial authentication to
      save time during re-authentication. A starting assumption is that the
      mobile host or "peer" is initially authenticated using the Extensible
      Authentication Protocol (EAP), executed between the peer and an EAP
      server as defined in RFC 3748.</t>

      <t>This document documents the HOKEY architecture. Specifically, it
      describes design objectives, the functional environment within which
      handover keying operates, the functions to be performed by the HOKEY
      architecture itself, and the assignment of those functions to
      architectural components. It goes on to illustrate the operation of the
      architecture within various deployment scenarios that are described more
      fully in other documents produced by the HOKEY Working Group.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) <xref
      target="RFC3748"></xref> is an authentication framework that supports
      different types of authentication methods. Originally designed for
      dial-up connections, EAP is now commonly used for authentication in
      wireless access networks.</t>

      <t>When a host (or "peer", the term used from this point onward) changes
      its point of attachment to the network, it must be re-authenticated. If
      a full EAP authentication must be repeated, several message round-trips
      between the peer and the home EAP server may be involved. The resulting
      delay will result in degradation or in the worst case loss of any
      service session in progress if communication is suspended while
      re-authentication is carried out. The delay is worse if the new point of
      attachment is in a visited network rather than the peer's home network,
      because of the extra procedural steps involved as well as because of the
      probable increase in round-trip time.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5169"></xref> describes this problem more fully and
      establishes design goals for solutions to reduce re-authentication delay
      for transfers within a single administrative domain. <xref
      target="RFC5169"></xref> also suggests a number of ways to achieve a
      solution: <list style="symbols">
          <t>specification of a method-independent, efficient,
          re-authentication protocol;</t>

          <t>reuse of keying material from the initial authentication;</t>

          <t>deployment of re-authentication servers local to the peer to
          reduce round-trip delay; and</t>

          <t>specification of the additional protocol needed to allow the EAP
          server to pass authentication information to the local
          re-authentication servers.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5295"></xref> tackles the problem of reuse of keying
      material by specifying how to derive a hierarchy of cryptographically
      independent purpose-specific keys from the results of the original EAP
      authentication. <xref target="RFC5296"></xref> specifies a
      method-independent re-authentication protocol (ERP) applicable to two
      specific deployment scenarios: <list style="symbols">
          <t>where the peer's home EAP server also performs re-authentication;
          and</t>

          <t>where a local re-authentication server exists but is collocated
          with a AAA proxy within the domain.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Other work provides further pieces of the solution or insight into
      the problem. For the purpose of this draft, <xref
      target="RFC5749"></xref> provides an abstract mechanism for distribution
      of keying material from the EAP server to re-authentication servers.
      <xref target="RFC5836"></xref> contrasts the EAP re-authentication (ER)
      strategy provided by <xref target="RFC5296"></xref> with an alternative
      strategy called "early authentication". <xref target="RFC5836"></xref>
      defines EAP early authentication as the use of EAP by a mobile peer to
      establish authenticated keying material on a target attachment point
      prior to its arrival. Here, a full EAP execution occurs before the
      handover of the peer takes place. Hence, the goal of EAP early
      authentication is to complete all EAP-related communications, including
      AAA signaling, in preparation for the handover, before the mobile device
      actually moves. Early authentication includes direct and indirect
      pre-authentication as well as Authenticated Anticipatory Keying (AKK).
      All three mechanims provide means to execute a full EAP authentication
      with a Candidate Access Point (CAP) while still being connected to the
      Serving Access Point (SAP) but vary in their respective system
      assumptions and communication paths. In particular, direct
      pre-authentication assumes that clients are capable of discovering
      candidate access points and all communications are routed through the
      serving access point. On the other hand, indirect pre-authentication
      assumes an existing relationship betweem SAP and CAP, whereas in AAK the
      client interacts with the AAA to discover and connect to CAPs.</t>

      <t>Both EAP re-authentication and early authentication enable faster
      inter-authenticator handovers. However, it is currently unclear how the
      necessary handover infrastructure is deployed and can be integrated into
      existing EAP infrastructures. In particular, previous work has not
      described how ER servers that act as endpoints in the re-authentication
      process should be integrated into local and home domain networks.
      Furthermore, it is currently unspecified how EAP infrastructure can
      support the timely triggering of early authentications and aid with the
      selection of candidate access points.</t>

      <t>This document proposes a general HOKEY architecture and demonstrates
      how it can be adapted to different deployment scenarios. To begin with,
      <xref target="goals"></xref> recalls the design objectives for the HOKEY
      architecture. <xref target="fncns"></xref> reviews the functions that
      must be supported within the architecture. <xref target="compon"></xref>
      describes the components of the HOKEY architecture. Finally, <xref
      target="scen"></xref> describes the different deployment scenarios that
      the HOKEY Working Group has addressed and the information flows that
      must occur within those scenarios, by reference to the documents
      summarized above where possible and otherwise within this document
      itself.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="goals" title="Design Goals">
      <t>This section investigates the design goals for the HOKEY
      architecture. These include reducing the signaling overhead for re-
      authentication and early authentication, integrating local domain name
      discovery, and improving deployment scalability. These goals supplement
      the discussion in <xref target="RFC5169"></xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="sigOvhd" title="Reducing Signalling Overhead">
        <section title="Minimized Communications with Home Servers">
          <t>ERP requires only one round trip, however, this roundtrip may
          require communications between a peer and its home ER and/or home
          AAA server in explicit bootstrapping and communication between local
          servers and home server in Implicit bootstrapping even if the peer
          is currently attached to a visited (local) network. As a result,
          even this one round trip may introduce long delays because home ER
          and home AAA servers may be distant from the peer and the local
          server to which the peer is attached. To lower the signaling
          overhead, communication with the home ER server and home AAA server
          should be minimized. Ideally, a peer should only need to communicate
          with local servers and other local entities. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Minimized User Interaction for authorization">
          <t> When the peer is firstly attached to the network or moves
          between heterogeneous networks, normally EAP full authentication
          between the peer and EAP server occurs and User Interaction for
          authorization may be needed, e.g., a dialog is prompted to the user
          for a personal identifier. To lower the signaling overhead, user
          interaction for authorization at each time of handover should be
          minimized. Ideally, user interaction once for authorization and then
          transparently authenticating in other places during handover is a
          desirable solution which also can be used to improve user
          experience. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Integrated Local Domain Name (LDN) Discovery">
          <t> ERP bootstrapping must occur before (implicit) or during
          (explicit) a handover to transport the necessary re-authentication
          root keys to the local ER server involved. Implicit bootstrapping is
          preferable because it does not require communication with the home
          ER server during handover (see section 3.1.1), but it requires the
          peer to know the domain name of the ER server before subsequent
          local ERP exchange happens in order to derive the necessary
          re-authentication keying material. <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>
          does not specify such a domain name discovery mechanism and suggests
          that the peer may learn the domain name through the EAP- Initiate/
          Re-auth-Start message or via lower layer announcements. However
          domain name discovery happens after the implicit bootstrapping
          completes, which potentially may introduce extra latency. To allow
          more efficient handovers, a HOKEY architecture should support an
          efficient domain name discovery mechanism and allow its integration
          with ERP implicit bootstrapping. Even in the case of explicit
          bootstrapping, local domain name discovery should be optimized such
          that it does not require contacting the home AAA server, as is
          currently the case. </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <!-- sigOvhd -->

      <section title="Better Deployment Scalability">
        <t>To provide better deployment scalability, it should not be required
        that the HOKEY server and AAA servers or proxies are collocated.
        Separation of these entities may cause problems with routing, but
        allows flexibility in deployment and implementation.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="fncns" title="Functions That Must Be Supported">
      <section title="System Overview">
        <t>This section views the HOKEY architecture as the implementation of
        a subsystem providing authentication services to AAA. Not only does
        AAA depend on the authentication subsystem, but the latter also
        depends on AAA as a means for the routing and secure transport of
        messages internal to the operation of network access
        authentication.</t>

        <t>The operation of the authentication subsystem also depends on the
        availability of a number of discovery functions: <list style="symbols">
            <t>discovery of candidate access points, by the peer, by the
            serving attachment point, or by some other entity;</t>

            <t>discovery of the authentication services supported at a given
            candidate access point;</t>

            <t>discovery of the required server in the home domain when a
            candidate access point is not in the same domain as the serving
            attachment point, or no local server is available;</t>

            <t>peer discovery of the local domain name (LDN) when EAP
            re-authentication is used with a local server.</t>
          </list> It is assumed that these functions are provided by the
        environment within which the authentication subsystem operates, and
        are outside the scope of the authentication subsystem itself. Local
        domain name discovery is a possible exception.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig_fctlOver"></xref> shows the major functions
        comprising the authentication subsystem and their interdependencies.
        These functions are described below. [EDITOR'S NOTE: These probably
        need refinement. The relationship of pre-authentication to EAP
        authentication, for instance, is currently not totally correct, when
        one takes account of the roles described in <xref
        target="compon"></xref>. AAK also needs an extension of ER key
        management.]</t>

        <t>EAP authentication, EAP re-authentication, and handover key
        distribution depend on the routing and secure transport service
        provided by AAA. Discovery functions and the function of
        authentication and authorization of network entities (access points,
        ER servers) are not shown. As stated above, these are external to the

    <section anchor="scen" title="Usage Scenarios">
      <t>Depends on whether it involves a change in a domain or access
      technology, we have the following the usage scenarios.</t>

      <section title="Intra-domain handover">
        <t>The peer moves between two authenticators in the same domain. In
        this scenario, the peer communicates with the ER server via the ER
        authenticator within the same network.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Inter-domain handover">
        <t>The peer moves between two different domains. In this scenario, the
        peer communicates with more than one ER servers via one or two
        different ER authenticators. One ER server is located in the current
        network as the peer, one is located in the previous network from which
        the peer moves. Another ER server is located in the home network which
        the peer belong to.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Inter-technology handover">
        <t>The peer moves between two heterogeneous networks. In this
        scenario, The peer needs to support at least two access technologies.
        The coverage of two access technologies usually is overlapped during
        handover. In this case, only authentication corresponding to
        intra-domain handover is required, i.e., the peer can communicates
        with the same local ER server to complete authentication and obtain
        keying materials corresponding to the peer.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <!-- scen -->

    <section title="AAA Consideration">
      <t>This section provides an analysis of how the AAA protocol can be
      applied for hokey architecture in accordance with Authentication
      Subsystem Functional Overview in figure 1.</t>

      <section title="Authorization">
        <t> Authorization is a major issue in deployments. Wherever the peer
        moves around, the home AAA server provides authorization for the peer
        during its handover. However authorization is not necessary to couple
        with authentication at each time of handover, since authorization is
        only needed when the peer is firstly attached to the network or moves
        between two different AAA domains. The EAP Key management document
        <xref target="RFC5247"></xref> discusses several vulnerabilities that
        are common to handover mechanisms. One important issue arises from the
        way the authorization decisions which might be handled at the AAA
        server during network access authentication. For example, if AAA
        proxies are involved, they may also influence in the authorization
        decision. Furthermore, the reasons for choosing a particular decision
        are not communicated to the AAA clients. In fact, the AAA client only
        knows the final authorization result. Another issue is about session
        management. In some circumstance when the peer moves from one
        authenticator to another, the peer may be authenticated by the
        different authenticator during a period of time and the authenticator
        to which the peer is currently attached needs to create new AAA user
        session, however the AAA Server should not view these handoffs as
        different sessions. Otherwise this may affect user experience and also
        accounting or logging issues. For example, the session-Id creation, in
        most case, is done by each authenticator to which the peer attaches.
        In this sense, the new authenticator acting as AAA Client needs to
        create new AAA user session from scratch which forces its
        corresponding AAA Server to terminate the existing user session with
        previous authenticator and setup the new user session with the new
        authenticator. This may complicate the set up and maintenance of the
        AAA User session. </t>

      <section title="Transport aspect">
        <t>The existing AAA protocols can be used to carry EAP messages and
        ERP messages between the AAA server and AAA clients AAA Transport of
        ERP messages is specified in <xref target="RFC5749"></xref> and <xref

          <abstract>
            <t>The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) defines extensions to
            the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to support efficient
            re- authentication between the peer and an EAP Re-authentication
            (ER) server through a compatible authenticator. This document
            specifies Diameter support for ERP. It defines a new Diameter ERP
            application to transport ERP messages between an ER authenticator
            and the ER server, and a set of new AVPs that can be used to
            transport the cryptographic material needed by the
            re-authentication server.</t>
