1.  Introduction

   The Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #5 [RFC2898] Password
   Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) is used by several protocols
   to derive encryption keys from a password.

   For example, Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism
   (SCRAM) [RFC5802] uses PBKDF2 with Hash-based Message Authentication
   Code (HMAC) [RFC2104] and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)
   [FIPS.180-1.1995].

   Test vectors for the algorithm were not included in the original
   specification, but are often useful for implementers.  This document
   addresses this shortcoming.


2.  PBKDF2 HMAC-SHA1 Test Vectors

   Below the input strings are encoded using ASCII [ANSI.X3-4.1986].
   The sequence "\0" (without quotation marks) means a literal ASCII NUL
   value (1 octet).

     Input:
       P = "password" (8 octets)
       S = "salt" (4 octets)
       c = 1
       dkLen = 20

     Output:
       DK = 0c 60 c8 0f 96 1f 0e 71
            f3 a9 b5 24 af 60 12 06
            2f e0 37 a6             (20 octets)


     Input:
       P = "password" (8 octets)
       S = "salt" (4 octets)
       c = 2
       dkLen = 20

     Output:
       DK = ea 6c 01 4d c7 2d 6f 8c
            cd 1e d9 2a ce 1d 41 f0
            d8 de 89 57             (20 octets)

3.  Acknowledgements

   Barry Brachman and Love Hoernquist Aestrand confirmed the test
   vectors (using independent implementations) and pointed out a mistake
   in the salt octet length count.


4.  Copying conditions

   This document should be considered a Code Component, and is thus
   effectively available under the BSD license.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2898] apply.  This document does
   not introduce any new security considerations.


6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
