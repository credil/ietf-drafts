Abstract

   With the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space, large-scale
   SPs are now faced with the only real option to deploy IPv6 in a
   timely manner. In order to achieve smooth transition to IPv6,
   migration tools should be introduced for different deployment models.
   Among different IPv6 transition mechanisms, dIVI is a prefix-specific
   and stateless address mapping method which can directly translate
   IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet. This document describes the challenges
   and requirements for large SP to deploy IPv6 in operational network,
   the experimental results of dIVI in our laboratory and the
   considerations for dIVI deployment in large SP operational network.

Internet-Draft   Considerations for Stateless Translation  October 2010


1. Introduction

   The dramatic growth of the Internet is accelerating the exhaustion of
   available IPv4 addressing pool. It is widely accepted that IPv6 is
   the only real option on the table for the continued growth of the
   Internet. However, IPv6 deployment is a huge systematic project and a
   lot of challenges will arise especially in large SP operational
   network.

   In order to achieve smooth transition to IPv6, migration tools should
   be introduced for different deployment models, among which dIVI is a
   stateless translation mechanism with good scalability. This document
   describes the challenges and requirements for large SPs in IPv6
   transition period. Then, we introduce dIVI experimental results in
   our laboratory. And finally, the considerations for designing and
   deploying dIVI in operational network are discussed in terms of
   addressing and routing, DNS deployment requirement, AAA support and
   user management, network management, CPE requirement and Xlate
   placement.

2. Terminologies

   This document uses the terminologies defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-
   v6v4-framework], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate], [I-D.ietf-behave-
   address-format], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], and [I-D.xli-
   behave-ivi].

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Problem Statement

   It is well known that the pool of public IPv4 addressing is nearing
   its exhaustion. The '/8' IANA blocks for Regional Internet Registries
   (RIRs) are projected to 'run-out' towards the end of 2011. Credible
   estimates based on past behavior suggest that the RIRs will exhaust
   their remaining address space by early 2012, apart from the
   development of a market in IPv4 address space. Thus, it will become
   much more difficult to get available public IPv4 addresses. In the
   same time, a lot of emerging applications, e.g. Apple's iPad,
   Motion's BlackBerry, etc. will quickly deplete the available
   addresses. This has led to a hightened awareness among the providers
   to consider introducing IPv6 to keep the Internet operational.

   It has been widely accepted that the end goal of IPv6 transition is
   to achieve an end-to-end IPv6-only network, and IPv4 can eventually

   be turned off. However, since it will have impact on almost the
   entire world, it will take a considerable period of time to reach the
   ultimate goal. As a result, IPv4 and IPv6 need to coexist during the
   whole transition period. In this document, we mainly focus on IPv6
   migration issues from large ISP's point of view. In order to
   facilitate smooth IPv6 migration, some factors need to be taken into
   consideration especially for large SPs. There are ten major
   requirements:

   1. It should deploy in an incremental fashion and the overall
      transition process should be stable and operational.

   2. It should largely reduce IPv4 public address consumption.

   3. It should accelerate the deployment of IPv6, rather than just
      prolonging the lifecycle of IPv4 by introducing multiple layers of
      NAT.

   4. There should be no perceived degradation of customer experience.
      As a result, IPv6 transition mechanisms should provide IPv4
      service continuity.

   5. It should achieve scalability, simplicity and high availability,
      especially for large-scale SPs.

   6. It should have user management and network management ability.

   7. It should support user authentication, authorization and
      accounting as an essential part of operational network.

   8. Most ISPs have some kind of mechanisms to trace the origin of
      traffic in their networks. This should also be available for IPv6
      traffic.

   9. It should have good throughput performance and massive concurrent
      session support.

   10.It should maintain the deployment concepts and business models
      which have been proven and used with existing revenue generating
      IPv4 services.

   All existing IPv6 transition mechanisms can be widely divided into
   three categories: dual-stack solution, translation-based solution and
   tunnel-based solution. In this document, we mainly concentrate on
   stateless translation mechanism: dIVI. The original stateless
   IPv4/IPv6 translation (stateless 1:1 IVI) is scalable, [I-D.ietf-
   behave-v6v4-framework], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate], [I-D.ietf-

   behave-address-format],[I-D.xli-behave-ivi]. But it cannot use the
   IPv4 addresses effectively. The stateless dIVI[I-D.xli-behave-divi]
   is a double translation mechanism which includes a 1:N stateless
   translator and a 1:1 Hgw translator. The 1:N stateless translator is
   implemented in the border between the IPv6 network and the IPv4
   Internet. It translates the packets between IPv4 and IPv6 with the
   1:N stateless address mapping. The 1:1 Hgw translator is implemented
   between an IPv6 network and user's end system. It translates the
   packets between IPv4 and IPv6 with 1:1 stateless address mapping. In
   addition, the home gateway translator maps random source port numbers
   to restricted port number based on the extended IPv4-translatable
   address format and keeps the mapping table in database for the port
   number mapping of the retuning packets and all the packets in the
   same session.

   dIVI support bidirectional communication initiated from IPv4 and IPv6.
   It can be deployed in an IPv6-only access network, in which
   operational and maintenance cost can be reduced. It has very good
   scalability and can largely reduce IPv4 address consumption.

   In this document, we firstly demonstrate the laboratory experimental
   results of dIVI in section 4. We can see that dIVI can support most
   of the current IPv4 applications in IPv6-only access network, while
   largely reducing IPv4 address consumption. And then dIVI deployment
   model and considerations in large operational network are proposed in
   section 5 and section 6 respectively. Some important factors need to
   be taken into account when introducing dIVI. Since most challenges in
   dIVI have no big difference compared to an IPv6-only environment, we
   strongly recommend that related network elements should take the
   corresponding modifications in order to guarantee the IPv6 transition
   process to be operational and manageable.

4. Laboratory experiment

   We have tested dIVI using the prototype in our laboratory. The major
   objective listed in the following is to verify the functionality and
   performance of dIVI:

   O Verify how to deploy dIVI in practical network.

   O Verify what applications can be used in dIVI.

   O Verify what Operating Systems can be supported in dIVI.

   O Verify the effect of user experience with limited ports.

   O Verify the performance of dIVI.

   There are three key components in the test:

   o The Hosts are dual-stack customers, who could run IPv4 application,
      IPv6 application or dual stack application.

   o The Home Gateways (Hgw) are dIVI translator in user side. It
      translates the packets between IPv4 and IPv6 with 1:1 stateless
      address mapping, and maps random source port numbers to restricted
      port number.

   o The Xlate translates the packets between IPv4 and IPv6 with the
      1:N stateless address mapping.

   The network between Hgw and Xlate is IPv6-only, and the network
   behind Hgw is dual-stack. Thus, the hosts behind Hgw can communicate
   with both IPv4 Internet and IPv6 Internet.

Internet-Draft   Considerations for Stateless Translation  October 2010


    4.2. Experiment configuration

   For address configuration, each host will use two IPv6 addresses: one
   is IVI6 address which is synthesized in Hgw with the IVI4 address and
   port-related information, and the other is non-IVI IPv6 address which
   is used for native IPv6 communication. We should notice that only
   non-IVI IPv6 address needs be allocated to end users. Besides, each
   user will get an IVI4 address from Hgw.

   For routing configuration, both IVI address and non-IVI address need
   to be imported into the IPv6-only network.

   For port configuration, since there are 65536 TCP/UDP ports for each
   IP address, and in fact one can normally use hundreds only, so one
   IPv4 address can be shared by multiple customers. In our experiment,
   we selected ratio to be 128. That is to say, one IPv4 address is
   shared by 128 people, and there are 512 ports per user.

   For DNS configuration, there is no need to have additional DNS64 for
   dIVI. Only an IPv6 DNS server with A/AAAA records is needed and the
   DNS address is manually configured in Hgw. Besides, Hgw has
   implemented DNS Proxy and it will convert an IPv4 DNS
   request/response to IPv6 DNS request/response.

   For ALG configuration, there is no need to deploy specific ALG for
   IPv4 applications in dIVI.

    4.3. Experiment results

   In our laboratory, we mainly have taken the following tests:

   o Application test: The applications we have tested include web,
      email, Instant Message, ftp, telnet, SSH, video, Video Camera, P2P,
      online game, Voip, VPN and so on.

   o Operating System test: The OS we have tested includes Win7, VISTA,
      windows XP.

   o Performance test: We have measured the parameters of concurrent
      session number, throughput performance.

   The experimental results are listed as follows:

   |----------------------|-------------------------------------------|

   |                      | windows XP.                               |
   |----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
   |                      | The performance test for dIVI Xlate is    |
   |                      | carried out on a normal PC.               |
   | Performance test     | Due to limitation of the PC hardware, the |
   |                      | overall throughput is not quite good.     |
   |                      | However, it can still support more than   |
   |                      | one hundred million concurrent sessions.  |
   |----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
                         Figure 2 dIVI test result



   From the experiment, we can have the following conclusions:

   1. dIVI can have good scalability. Xlate does not need to maintain
      any session state, and only limited session states have to been
      maintained in Hgw for its customer.

   2. dIVI can be deployed in an incremental way. The most important
      part of dIVI is addressing and routing. There is little DNS
      requirement and ALG requirement

   3. dIVI can support a majority of current IPv4 applications.

   4. dIVI can support a variety of Operating Systems.

   5. With the ratio of 128 (512 maximum concurrent sessions), there is
      no perceived degradation of customer experience.



   However, in the current process of equipment, e.g. BRAS, end system,
   etc., the support for IPv6-only function has not been fully
   accomplished. Therefore, there are still some limitations when
   deploying dIVI prototype in practical operational network:

   1. Address assignment process have not been integrated with existing
      address allocation system.

   2. IVI6 route directing from Xlate to Hgw are configured manually in
      IPv6-only network.

   3. Hgw has not integrated PPPoE functionality with dIVI functionality.

   4. AAA system has not supported IVI-related (or IPv6-only) functions.

   With regard to the listed IPv6 transition requirements in section 3,
   most of them can be satisfied by dIVI, except for the requirement of
   network management and user management. These two points should be
   paid special attention for large SPs, which will be further discussed
   in section 6.

5. dIVI Deployment Scenario

   In order to investigate the ways to deploy dIVI in operational
   network, we firstly briefly discuss network architecture for large SP
   network. Then dIVI deployment model is introduced.



    5.1. Network Architecture for Large SP Network

   In large SPs, the generic network topology can be divided into four
   main parts (as depicted in Figure3): the Customer Premises Network
   (CPN), the Access Network (AN), the Metro Area Network (MAN), and the
   Backbone Network.

   1. CPN is the part of the network by a customer when connecting to an
      ISP's network which includes the CPE and the last hop link.

   2. In Access Network, a very wide variety of access technologies can
      be used, including xDSL, Ethernet, PON, ATM, WIFI, etc.

   3. MAN is the aggregated network for customers in one single metro,
      with the vast range of size. In most metro networks, BRAS is
      connected to Core Router directly, while for a small portion of
      large metro networks, BRAS is connected to Core Routers via
      aggregated routers.

   4. Backbone network is to offer transit service between MANs, IXPs
      and other ISPs.

   There are typically two network models for fixed broadband access
   service: one is to access using PPPoE/PPPoA authentication method
   while the other is to use IPoE. The first one is usually applied to
   Residential network and SOHO networks. Subscribers in CPNs can access
   broadband network by PPP dial-up authentication. BRAS is the key
   network element which takes full responsibility of IP address
   assignment, user authentication, traffic aggregation, PPP session
   termination, etc. Then IP traffic is forwarded to Core Routers
   through Metro Area Network, and finally transited to external
   Internet via Backbone network.

   The second network scenario is usually applied to large enterprise
   networks. Subscribers in CPNs can access broadband network by IPoE
   authentication. IP address is normally assigned by DHCP server, or
   static configuration.

              Figure 4 dIVI Deployment in Operational Network


   In stateless dIVI, the network between Hgw and Xlate is an IPv6-only
   network, in which the operational and maintenance cost can be greatly
   reduced. The access network behind Hgw can either be IPv4-only or
   dual-stack.

   In operational network, Hgw can usually be integrated with CPE, while
   Xlate can be in someplace of MAN or Backbone Network. Subscribers can
   get IPv6 address from BRAS/SR after user authentication stage. Then,
   IVI-related route should be imported into the IPv6-only network
   between Xlate and Hgw. In this way, IPv4 system and IPv6 system can
   both communicate with IPv4 Internet via stateless dIVI. The detailed
   considerations for dIVI deployment will be discussed in section 6.

6. Considerations for dIVI deployment

   This section describes the considerations for dIVI deployment in
   large operational network.

   The major differences between dIVI deployment in laboratory and
   operational network lie in:

   1. Operational network is a commercial network with strict user
      management requirement, while in laboratory it is simple and
      straightforward.

   2. Operational network has different kinds of network equipments, e.g.
      BRAS/SR, CPE, Radius, etc. It would be more difficult to take
      modifications on all of these equipments.

   3. Operational network has a large number of customers. Thus, it
      would be impossible to take manual configuration for all customers.

   In this section, we try to outline considerations for dIVI deployment
   on large SP network. Some of the features are not specific to dIVI,
   but rather to a general requirement on all IPv6 transition techniques.

    6.1. Addressing

   In dIVI, there is no need to allocate IVI6 address explicitly to end
   users. Thus, the process of IPv6 address assignment can be integrated
   with existing IPv6 address allocation process. Only CPE will need to
   get IVI4 address, reallocate it to end user, do port-mapping and
   traffic translation with port-related information. Here are some
   basic considerations in dIVI addressing:

   o Determine IVI6 prefix for each Xlate. Operators should use its own
      prefix as an IVI6 prefix, i.e. pref=2001:db8:a4a6::/48, in order
      to perform stateless translation. Address allocation process in
      BRAS/SR should be consistent with Xlate.

   o Determine the embedded IVI4 address and port multx ratio.
      Operators should estimate the scale of subscribers in a certain
      region, evaluate the number of remaining IPv4 address, and analyze
      the number of concurrent ports. It is a tradeoff between multx
      ratio and concurrent port numbers. The bigger the multx ratio is,
      the more a IPv4 address can be shared by multiple subscribers and
      the less concurrent port number can be used per subscriber. From
      the above test in our laboratory, we choose multx ratio to be 128
      and it is enough for current usage.

   o Determine the ways to distribute the configuration profile
      including IVI4 address and port multx ratio to Hgw automatically,
      either by extended DHCP option, or other protocols.

    6.2. Routing

   In dIVI, IVI4(i) and IVI6(i) will be aggregated to IPS4(i) and IPS6(i)
   in border routers. They will not affect the global IPv4 and IPv6
   routing tables

   In dIVI deployment model, Hgws are normally configured with a default
   route that points to the BRAS/SR.  The routers between BRAS/SR and
   Xlate run IPv6 dynamic routing protocols (IGP or BGP), and routers in
   the upper level of Xlate run IPv4 dynamic routing protocols.
   Therefore, the aggregated IVI6 routing directing to the upper routers
   will be learned/inserted by in IPv6-only domain. And the IVI6 route
   directing to Hgws should also be configured in BRAS/SR.

    6.3. DNS

   In dIVI, there is no DNS64/DNS46 needed anymore. An IPv6 DNS server
   is needed to process IPv6 DNS request/response, and the address of
   IPv6 DNS server should be passed to Hgw.

   Since there is no IPv4 DNS server in IPv6-only network, it is
   recommended that Hgw should implement IPv4-to-IPv6 DNS Proxy to
   convert an IPv4 DNS request/response to IPv6 DNS request/response
   accordingly.

    6.4. AAA and User Management

   User authentication can be used to control who can have the dIVI
   connectivity service. This is not always required when a customer of
   IPv4 service automatically can have access to the dIVI service.
   However, it is highly recommended that IPv6-only customers should be
   authenticated separately. It is good for security, trouble shooting,
   user accounting, etc. There are some major points that AAA systems
   need to be taken into consideration:

   o User authentication function needs to be extended to support the
      identification of IPv6-only subscriber, with additional dIVI-
      related profile for subscribers, e.g. IVI6 address, IVI4 address,
      non-IVI address, etc.

   o User accounting and management function needs to be extended to
      identify dIVI user (or IPv6-only user) separately.

   In summary, the major challenge of dIVI for the AAA and User
   Management is no big difference compared to an IPv6-only environment.

    6.5. Network management

   In theory, managing an IPv6-only dIVI network should be similar to
   managing an IPv4 network.

   There are two issues to manage dIVI in operational network:

   o Manage IPv6-only network. Operators should be able to manage IPv6-
      only network, including IPv6 MIB modules, Netflow Records, log
      information, etc.

   o Manage the translation process. There are some exceptions that the
      MIB modules need to add dIVI related features, e.g. dIVI device
      management, dIVI traffic monitoring, etc.

    6.6. dIVI CPE Requirements and Configuration

   In dIVI, CPE is an important network element. It should perform DHCP
   server, integrated user authentication function, traffic translation
   and port mapping, DNS proxy, etc. The major operations in dIVI CPE
   include:

   o Address assignment: dIVI CPE should support IVI4 address
      assignment by DHCP process to end users. It should also support
      IPv6 address assignment, either by stateful DHCP or stateless
      auto-configuration.

   o Integrated user authentication function: dIVI CPE should integrate
      with existing user authentication function, e.g. PPPoE/PPPoA, etc.

   o DNS: CPE should enable RFC 5006, well-known addresses, and DHCPv6
      in order to maximize the likelihood of dIVI Hgw being able to use
      DNS without manual configuration. Besides, dIVI CPE should also
      support IPv4-to-IPv6 DNS proxy.

    6.7. dIVI Xlate Placement in Large SP Network

   Normally, dIVI Xlate can be deployed in "centralized model" and
   "distributed model".

   In "centralized model", dIVI Xlate could be deployed in the place of
   Core Router, or even in the entrance of ICP. Since dIVI is a
   stateless method with better scalability than stateful ones, it can
   handle numerous concurrent sessions.

   In "distributed model", dIVI Xlate is usually be integrated with
   BRAS/SR. So each Xlate should be configured with its own IVI6 prefix

   and is responsible for translating the traffic of its own region. The
   number of subscribers is normally limited, so does the number of IVI
   routing entries. However, the network infrastructure should still be
   upgraded to dual-stack support in MAN and backbone network, and so
   the decreased operational cost is rather limited. Besides, since the
   newly emerging customers might be distributed in the whole Metro area,
   we have to deploy Xlate on all BRAS/SRs. This will cost a lot in the
   initial phase of IPv6 transition period.

   In summary, we strongly recommend adopting "centralized model" for
   dIVI. It is a cost-effective way and easy to manage.

    6.8. ALG consideration

   dIVI does not require ALG, this is a very important feature in the
   initial development phase of IPv6.

7. Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations in this document.

8. IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.
