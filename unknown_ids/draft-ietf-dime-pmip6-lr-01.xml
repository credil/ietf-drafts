    <abstract>
      <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
      tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term
      "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
      directly by the MAG without involving the LMA. In order to establish a
      localized routing session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 domain, two tasks must be accomplished: <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>The usage of local routing must be authorized for both MAGs
          and</t>

          <t>The address of the MAG to which the Correspondent Node (CN) is
          attached must be ascertained</t>
        </list> This document specifies how to accomplish these tasks using
      the Diameter protocol.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5213">Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)</xref> allows the
      Mobility Access Gateway to optimize media delivery by locally routing
      packets within itself, avoiding tunneling them to the Mobile Node's
      Local Mobility Anchor. This is referred to as "local routing" in RFC
      5213. However, this mechanism is not applicable to the typical scenario
      in which the MN and CN are connected to different MAGs and are
      registered to different LMAs. In this scenario (<xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netext-pmip6-lr-ps">as described in</xref>), the
      relevant information needed to set up a localized routing path (e.g.,
      the addresses of the Mobile Access Gateways to which the MN and CN are
      respectively attached) is distributed between their respective Local
      Mobility Anchors. This may complicate the setup and maintenance of
      localized routing. <vspace blankLines="1" /> Therefore, in order to
      establish a localized routing path between the two Mobile Access
      Gateways, the Mobile Node's MAG must identify the LMA that is managing
      the Correspondent Node's traffic and then obtain the address of the
      Correspondent Node's MAG from that LMA. In Proxy Mobile IPv6, the LMA to
      be assigned to the CN may be maintained as a configured entry in the
      Correspondent Node's policy profile located on an Authentication,
      Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server. However, there is no relevant
      work discussing how AAA-based mechanisms can be used by the Mobile
      Node's MAG to discover the address of the Correspondent Node's LMA
      during the setup of localized routing, The method by which the Mobile
      Node's MAG interacts with the Correspondent Node's LMA to identify the
      Correspondent Node's MAG is also unspecified. <vspace blankLines="1" />
      This document describes AAA support for the authorization and discovery
      of PMIPv6 mobility entities during localized routing. In LMA discovery,
      Diameter <xref target="RFC3588"></xref> is used to authorize the
      localized routing service and provide the Mobile Node's MAG/LMA with
      information regarding the Correspondent Node's LMA. In MAG discovery,
      AAA is used to determine whether Mobile Node's MAG is allowed to fetch
      the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from the Correspondent
      Node's LMA. If MAG discovery is successful, the Correspondent Node's LMA
      will respond to the Mobile Node's MAG with the address of the
      Correspondent Node's MAG.</t>

      <t>MAG/LMA resolution is a prerequisite to the establishment of a direct
      routing path between MAG1 and MAG2 (associated with MN1 and MN2
      respectively). This document addresses how to resolve the destination
      MN’s MAG by means of interaction between the LMA and the AAA server.

      localized routing path with MAG2, MAG1 must first locate the entity that
      maintains the data required to setup the path (i.e., LMA2) by sending a
      Local Routing Optimization Request message (<xref

      (e.g., handover case). The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request

    <section title="Diameter Server Authorizes MAG Location Query">
      <t><xref target="fig5"></xref> shows a scenario in which LMA2 acts as a
      Diameter client, receiving location request and requesting authorization
      for MAG location lookup. In this scenario, MN1 and MN2 are anchored to
      LMA1 and LMA2 respectively. Upon receiving an upstream data packet, MAG1
      needs to determine the recipient of localized routing, i.e., LMA2. And
      then MAG1 solicits LMA2 to look up the IP address of the MAG to which
      MN2 is currently attached (in this case, MAG2) by sending a Local
      Routing Optimization Request message containing the IP addresses/HNPs of
      MN1 and MN2. LMA2 validates the request from MAG1 by sending an AAR to
      the AAA server containing the IP address/HNP of MN1 (encapsulated in an
      instance of the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP) and an instance of the
      MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP (<xref target="RFC5447"></xref>, Section 4.2.5)
      with the INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit set. If the authorization is
      successful, LMA2 then looks up the IP address of MAG2 based on the IP
      address/HNP of MN2 and responds to MAG1 with the IP address of MAG2.

      <t>Referring to an architecture with multiple AAA servers (as
      illustrated in <xref target="fig6"></xref>), AAA1 may not maintain the
      LMA to be assigned to MN2 as a configured entry in the Correspondent
      Node's Policy profile, as AAA2 holds this information in its policy
      store. In such a case, AAA1 contacts a Diameter redirect agent [RFC3588]
      to request the AAA server being responsible for maintaining MN2's policy
      profile. AAA2 checks if localized routing is allowed between MAG1 and
      MAG2 and if so, responds with the IP address of LMA2 corresponding to
      MN2 and sends the results back to LMA1 via AAA1. Details about the use
      of redirect agents in this context are beyond scope of this
      document.</t>
