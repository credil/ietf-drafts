1. Introduction 

   In packet transport network, protection switching can be triggered by 
   fault conditions and external manual commands. The fault conditions 
   include Signal Failure (SF) and Signal Degrade (SD). SF on a 
   transport entity can be detected by fault management OAM functions; 
   SD on a transport entity can be detected by performance monitoring 
   OAM functions. 

   The SD condition used for protection switching mostly depends on 
   packet loss ratio. For some services that are sensitive to time and 
   synchronization, the SD condition may depend on packet loss ratio, 
   packet delay and delay variation.

   In MPLS-TP OAM tools, the packet loss measurement (LM) is used to 
   measure the amount of the lost service packets and compute the loss 
   ratio of service packet. The packet Delay Measurement (DM) is used to 
   measure the packet delay and delay variation by sending periodic DM 
   packets during the diagnostic interval. The LM and DM mechanisms are 
   out of scope of this document. 

   The detection of SD (e.g. packet loss) must be based on service 
   packets. But in some situation, there is no normal traffic on 
   working/protection transport entity, which makes the detection of SD 
   based on service packets impossible and causes switch flapping. 

   This document describes the mechanism for SD detection and consequent 
   protection switching in 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture. 

2. Terminology

3. SD-Triggered Protection Switching 

3.1. General Operation 

3.1.1. General protection architecture 

   In case of MPLS-TP 1+1 protection architecture, the normal traffic is 
   permanently sent on both working and protection entities by the 
   permanent bridge at the source. Therefore, the detection of SD or the 
   clearing of SD on both working and protection entities can be based 
   on the characteristics of the original traffic.  

   In case of MPLS-TP revertive 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture: 

   - If the protection switching is not active, normal traffic is 
      transported together with OAM on the working entity while on the 
      protection entity OAM is transported alone or together with the 
      possible extra traffic. 

   - If the protection switching is active, only OAM is transported on 
      the working entity. Normal traffic is transported on the 
      protection entity together with OAM. The extra traffic originally 
      transported on protection entity is disrupted. 

   In case of MPLS-TP non-revertive 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture:  

   - If the protection switching is not active, normal traffic is 
      transported together with OAM on the working entity while on the 
      protection entity OAM is transported alone or together with the 
      possible extra traffic. 

   - If the protection switching is active, OAM is transported alone or 
      possibly together with extra traffic on the working entity. Normal 
      traffic is transported on the protection entity together with OAM 
      traffic. That is, the normal traffic is switched from the working 
      entity to the protection entity and the extra traffic is switched 
      from the protection entity to the working entity. 

   As mentioned above, in case of 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture, 
   there may be no normal traffic on working/protection transport entity, 
   which makes the detection of SD impossible and consequently switch 
   flapping may happen. 

3.1.2. APS Protocol 

   In APS request types, similar to the definition of SF-W (SF for 
   working entity) and SF-P (SF for protection entity), a definition of

   SD-W (SD for working entity) and SD-P (SD for protection entity) is 
   required to prevent flapping. 

3.2. SD-Triggered Protection Based on other Traffic (i.e. non normal 
   traffic) 

3.2.1. Detection of SD 

   In case of 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture, for the transport 
   entity on which there is no normal traffic, the detection of SD can 
   be based on other service packets, e.g. 

   - Extra traffic 

   The extra traffic can be used instead of normal traffic in packet 
   loss measurement. That is, the performance monitoring OAM packets (LM) 
   will count the number of extra service packets and the loss 
   measurement is based on extra service, which will be used as the 
   input of SD condition of the transport entity that lacks normal 
   service. 

   - OAM packets for Test 

   The Test OAM packets can be used to simulate the characteristics of 
   the normal traffic and replace the normal service. With the 
   performance monitoring OAM packets (LM) the SD condition of the 
   transport entity can be detected. 

   - OAM packets for CC/CV 

   The CC/CV OAM packets can be used instead of normal service in packet 
   loss measurement. That is, the performance monitoring OAM packets (LM) 
   will count CC/CV packets and the loss measurement is based on CC/CV 
   packets, which will be used as the input of SD condition of the 
   transport entity where there is no normal service. 

   The above-mentioned SD-triggered protection switching mechanism based 
   on other traffic is general and flexible without constraint on the 
   bridge type by using the extra traffic, OAM packets (test or CC/CV).  

   However, the characteristics of the extra traffic are usually not the 
   same as that of the normal traffic so that the performance 
   measurement is not exactly reflecting the condition of real service. 
   OAM packets for CC/CV are sent in fixed transmission period (3.3ms, 
   10ms, 1s, etc.) which as well doesn't reflect the condition of real 
   services. It is applicable in places without strict requirement for 
   SD measurement.

   The performance measurement by Test OAM packets is accurate. But the 
   usage of test packets on protection entity defeats the objective of 
   the 1:1 and 1:n architectures, which is to have the protection entity 
   bandwidth available for best effort traffic during the time there is 
   no fault or degradation of the working transport entity. The test 
   packets consume now this bandwidth. For the case of the 1:1 
   protection, this makes the bandwidth usage of this 1:1 architecture 
   similar to the bandwidth usage of the 1+1 architecture. 

3.2.2. Protection Switching and APS Protocol 

   For the SD-triggered protection based on other traffic, if a 
   broadcast bridge is used, the other traffic used to detect SD is 
   required on the protection transport entity only. 

   The priority of SD-P and SD-W shall be fixed as SD-P > SD-W similar 
   to SF-P > SF-W. Therefore, a protection switching based on SD 
   detection shall not be initiated if there exists also an SD condition 
   on the protection transport entity. The priority of SD-P and SD-W can 
   be flexible as well based on the actual degraded degree of signal. 
   Therefore, traffic is sent on the transport entity with better SD 
   condition if both SD-W and SD-P exist. 

3.3. SD-Triggered Protection Based on Normal Traffic 

   In case of 1:1 and 1:n protection architecture, a broadcast bridge 
   can be applied to assist SD detection in SD-triggered protection. 

3.3.1. Broadcast Bridge with special APS request priority 

   In the normal state, the normal traffic is sent only on the working 
   transport entity and only the SD condition of the working transport 
   entity can be evaluated.  

   When SD is detected on the working transport entity, sink end sends 
   SD-W indication to the source end and the selector at the sink end 
   switches to the protection transport entity. The broadcast bridge at 
   the source end will then send the normal traffic on both working and 
   protection transport entities and the performance of both working and 
   protection transport entities can be monitored.  

   If SD is detected on protection transport entity as well, i.e. SD-W 
   and SD-P exist simultaneously, normal traffic is selected at the sink 
   still from the protection transport entity to avoid flapping between 
   protection and working states. 


 
 
Zhang and He           Expires April 26, 2010                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft       draft-zhl-mpls-tp-sd-01.txt          October 2009 
    

   In this case the priority of SD-W and SD-P in the APS protocol is 
   fixed as SD-W > SD-P to avoid flapping of between protection and 
   working states. 

3.3.2. Broadcast Bridge with extra protection switching coordination 

   The SD-W based protection switch action described in section 3.3.1 is 
   performed under the assumption that a SD condition on a transport 
   entity is a rare condition, and it is thus unlikely that SD on 
   protection will co-exist with SD on working. When such assumption is 
   not considered to be reasonable, the operation of the selector may be 
   modified as described hereafter. 

   When the sink end detects an SD condition, it does not switch to the 
   protection entity immediately. Instead, the broadcast bridge at the 
   source end will send the normal traffic on both working and 
   protection transport entity after receiving SD-W indication sent by 
   the sink end. Then sink end is able to detect the SD condition of 
   working and protection transport entity. 

   If SD is detected on the protection transport entity as well, the 
   normal traffic is sent to both working and protection transport 
   entities and is selected from the working transport entity; if no SD 
   is detected on the protection transport entity the normal traffic is 
   selected from the protection entity. 

   SD-triggered protection switching based normal traffic is simple and 
   efficient by applying a specific broadcast bridge but with a minor 
   modification to the priority order of APS request (i.e. SD-W > SD-P) 
   or to the operation order. 

4. Analysis 

   In section 3.2 and 3.3, the different mechanisms are described. They 
   may be suitable in differenct application scenarios with different 
   requirements for simplicity, accuracy, flexibility. 

   [More analysis may be needed in a future version of this draft] 

5. Security Considerations 

   To be added in a future version of the document. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   No new IANA considerations.
