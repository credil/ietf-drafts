Internet-Draft         Diameter Key Transport AVPs             July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter EAP application [RFC4072] defines the EAP-Master-
   Session-Key and EAP-Key-Name AVPs for the purpose of transporting
   cryptographic keying material derived during the execution of certain
   EAP [RFC3748] methods (for example, EAP-TLS [RFC5216]).  At most one
   instance of either of these AVPs is allowed in any Diameter message.

   However, recent work [RFC5295] has specified methods to derive other
   keys from the keying material created during EAP method execution
   that may require transport in addition to the MSK.  In addition, ERP
   [RFC5296] specifies new keys that may need to be transported between
   Diameter nodes.

   This note specifies a set of AVPs allowing the transport of multiple
   cryptographic keys in a single Diameter message.


2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this note.

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Technical Terms and Acronyms

   AAA
      Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (see below).

   Accounting
      The act of collecting information on resource usage for the
      purpose of trend analysis, auditing, billing, or cost allocation
      [RFC2989].

   Authentication
      The act of verifying a claimed identity, in the form of a pre-
      existing label from a mutually known name space, as the originator
      of a message (message authentication) or as the end-point of a
      channel (entity authentication) [RFC2989].

   Authorization
      The act of determining if a particular right, such as access to
      some resource, can be granted to the presenter of a particular
      credential [RFC2989].

3.  Attribute-Value Pair Definitions

   This section defines new AVPs for the transport of cryptographic keys
   in the Diameter EAP application [RFC4072], as well as other Diameter
   applications.

3.1.  EAP-Key AVP

   The EAP-Key AVP (AVP Code <AC1>) is of type Grouped [RFC3588].  It
   contains the name, type and optionally, the usable lifetime of the
   key, as well as the keying material itself.

     EAP-Key ::= < AVP Header: AC1 >
                                   { EAP-Key-Type }
                                   { EAP-Keying-Material }
                                   [ EAP-Key-Lifetime ]
                                   [ EAP-Key-Name ]
                                 * [ AVP ]

3.1.1.  EAP-Key-Type AVP

   The EAP-Key-Type AVP (AVP Code <AC2>) is of type Enumerated and
   signifies the type of the key being sent.  The EAP-Key-Type MAY be
   included in a DER command as a signal that a certain type of key is
   required in the response (e.g., to support ERP).  The following
   values are defined in this document:

   MSK (0)
      The EAP Master Session Key. [RFC3748]

   DSRK (1)
      A Domain Specific Root Key. [RFC5295]

   USRK (2)
      A Usage Specific Root Key. [RFC5295]

   rRK (4)
      A reauthentication Root Key. [RFC5296]

   rMSK (5)
      A reauthentication Master Session Key. [RFC5296]

   If additional values are needed, they are to be assigned by IANA
   according to the policy stated in Section 6.2.

3.1.2.  EAP-Key-Name AVP

   The syntax and semantics of the EAP-Key-Name AVP are specified in
   Section 4.1.4 of RFC 4072.

3.1.3.  EAP-Keying-Material AVP

   The EAP-Keying-Material AVP (AVP Code <AC3>) is of type OctetString.
   The exact usage of this keying material depends upon several factors,
   including the link layer in use and the type of the key; it is beyond
   the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft         Diameter Key Transport AVPs             July 2009


3.1.4.  EAP-Key-Lifetime AVP

   The EAP-Key-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code <AC4>) is of type Integer64
   [RFC3588] representing the period of time (in seconds) for which the
   keying material is valid.

   Note: Applications using this value SHOULD consider the beginning of
   the lifetime to be the point in time when the keying material is
   first used.


4.  AVP Occurrence Table

   The following table lists the AVPs that MAY be present in the DER and
   DEA commands [RFC4072].
