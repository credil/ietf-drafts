Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the IPv6 multicast addressing
   architecture to be used in the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.
   In particular, this document defines an address format for IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 multicast addresses.  This address format can be used
   for IPv4-IPv6 translation or encapsulation schemes.

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format         December 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to the multicast IPv6 addressing
   architecture [RFC4291].  This extension is used for building IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 multicast addresses.

   This specification can be used in conjunction with other extensions
   such as building unicast prefix-based multicast IPv6 address
   [RFC3306] or embedding the rendez-vous point [RFC3956].  This is left
   to the taste of operators.  In particular, the extension defined in
   this document can be used in a context where [RFC3306] and [RFC3956]
   are not implemented.

   This document updates [RFC6052] which focuses exclusively on IPv4-
   embeded IPv6 unicast addresses.

1.1.  Scope

   The address format defined in this document applies for both IPv4-
   IPv6 translation and encapsulation schemes.

   It is out of scope of this document to define the overall procedure
   for the delivery of IPv4-embeded IPv6 multicast to the requesting
   receivers.  Practical details about the procedure is defined in
   specific documents such as [I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework] and
   [I-D.qin-softwire-dslite-multicast].


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  IPv4-embeded IPv6 multicast address: denotes a multicast IPv6
      address which includes in 32 bits an IPv4 address.  The format to
      build such address is defined in Section 4.

   o  IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function: refers to a function which is
      enabled in a node interconnecting an IPv4-enabled domain with an
      IPv6-enabled one.  An IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function can be
      implemented using encapsulation or translation techniques. t can
      be located in various places of the multicast network, and that is
      the deployment specific issue left to operators.  Particularly, in
      terms of multicast control message, it can be an "IGMP/MLD
      interworking function" or an "IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking
      function".  Since from the protocol perspective, the MLD protocol
      is a translation of IGMP in the semantics of IPv6 and PIM has been
      designed to accommodate both IPv4 and IPv6, no extra functionality
      is needed to be defined but to follow the address format specified

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format         December 2010


      in Section 4.  In terms of multicast traffic forwarding, it can be
      translation-based or encapsulation- based.

   o  Multicast Prefix64 (or MPREFIX64 for short) refers to an IPv6
      multicast prefix to be used to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6
      multicast addresses.

   o  ASM_MPREFIX64: denotes an MPREFIX64 used in ASM mode.

   o  SSM_MPREFIX64: denotes an MPREFIX64 used in SSM mode.


3.  Motivations

   Recently various solutions (e.g.,
   [I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework],
   [I-D.xu-softwire-mesh-multicast] or
   [I-D.qin-softwire-dslite-multicast]) have been proposed to allow
   access to IPv4 multicast content from hosts attached to IPv6-enabled
   domains.  Even if these solutions have distinct applicability scopes
   (translation vs. encapsulation) and target various use cases, they
   all make use of specific IPv6 multicast addresses to embed an IPv4
   multicast address.  Particularly, the IPv4-embeded IPv6 multicast
   address is used as a destination IPv6 address of multicast flows
   received from the IPv4-enabled domain and injected by the IPv4-IPv6
   Interconnection Function into the IPv6-enabled domain.  It is also
   used to build the IPv6 multicast state (*, G6) or (S6,G6)
   corresponding to their (*, G4) or (S4,G4) IPv4 counter parts by the
   IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function.

   This document aims at harmonizing the definition of an IPv4-embeded
   IPv6 address format.


4.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address Format

   This document specifies a modification to the IPv6 multicast address
   format [RFC4291] by defining the first higher bit of the "flags"
   field.

   The description of the fields is as follows:

   o  Binary 11111111 at the start of the address identifies the address
      as being a multicast address.

   o  Flags

      *  "T-bit" is defined in [RFC4291].

      *  "P-bit" is defined in [RFC3306].

      *  "R-bit" is defined in [RFC3956].

      *  "M-bit" when set to 1 indicates that an IPv4 address is
         embedded in the last 32 bits of the multicast IPv6 address

   o  Scope is defined in [RFC4291].  Allowed values are 8 for
      Organization-Local scope or E for Global scope.

   o  Reserved bits: the 5th higher bit "S-bit" indicates the scheme
      used to carry IPv6 multicast flows in the IPv6 domain.  When set
      to 0, it indicates flows are transported using IPv4-in-IPv6
      encapsulation scheme (i.e., IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function is
      an IPv4-IPv6 encapsulator).  When set to 1, it indicates the
      multicast flows are to be transported in native IPv6 (i.e., IPv4-
      IPv6 Interconnection Function is an IPv4-IPv6 translator).  All
      remaining bits SHOULD be set to 0 by default.  This bit is only
      used by the IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function.  See Section 4.1.

   o  sub-group-id: This field is configurable according to local
      policies of the entity managing the IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection
      Function.  The default value is all zeros.

   o  The last 32 bits MUST include an IPv4 multicast address.

   [[Discussion note: Below is provided an alternative proposal for the
   location of the bits]]

                                                           +-+-+-+-+
             flgs is a set of four flags:                  |0|R|P|T|

                                                           +-+-+-+-+
             IPv4-IPv6 interconnection scheme bits:        |r|r|M|S|
                                                           +-+-+-+-+

4.1.  Role of the S-bit

   IPv4-IPv6 encapsulator and translator may be embedded in the same
   device or even implemented with the same software module.  In order
   to help the function whether an encapsulated IPv6 multicast packets
   or translated IPv6 ones are to be transferred; the "S-bit" is used
   for that purpose.

4.2.  Textual Representation

   The embedded IPv4 address is included in the last 32 bits; therefore
   dotted decimal notation can be used.

4.3.  Lifetime of the IPv4-Embeded IPv6 Multicast Address

   TBC.

4.4.  Scope

   Fixed or let it be configurable.

4.5.  SSM

   Further elaboration on SSM [RFC4607].


5.  Multicast PREFIX64

   For the delivery of the IPv4-IPv6 multicast interconnection services,
   a dedicated multicast prefix denoted as MPREFIX64 should be
   provisioned to any function requiring to build an IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address based on an IPv4 multicast address.

   MPREFIX64 can be of ASM or SSM type.

   The structure of the MPREFIX64 follows the guidelines specified in

   Section 4.

   MPREFIX64 MAY be of any length from /32 to /96; /96 being the
   RECOMMENDED prefix length as shown in Figure 3).  The format of the
   MPREFIX64 should be compatible with what proposed in [RFC3306] and
   [RFC3956] if corresponding mechanisms are used.

   consideration.
