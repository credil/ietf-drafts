                    Diameter General Purpose Session
                 draft-liebsch-dime-diameter-gps-00.txt

Abstract

   The Diameter protocol has specified and relies on the use of per-user
   sessions, which are established between a Diameter client and server
   during a user's authentication and authorization procedure.  This
   document proposes an extension to the Diameter session concept to
   establish a general purpose Diameter session for signaling the
   context of multiple users, such as for group handling or application
   state restoration.

Internet-Draft      Diameter General Purpose Session           June 2010


1.  Introduction

   Diameter [RFC3588] has received wide acceptance in large scale
   networking, e.g. in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project's (3GPP)
   Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network architecture [3GPP-EPC], based on
   applications like Network Access Server [RFC4005] and Credit-Control
   [RFC4006].  Such deployments also depend on application level
   defined, interoperable resilience schemes.  It has been noticed that
   these could potentially be extended beyond the original Diameter
   session model by the concept of bulk handling.  In this manner the
   efficiency of signaling can be enhanced significantly.

   Another potential use case within 3GPP consists in optimization for
   mass handling, (mass activation/de-activation, mass registration
   update).  Similarly, there are also mobility related scenarios where
   Diameter clients want to communicate with servers without reference
   to individual user sessions.  One example is the enforcement of a
   policy to all or a group of users.

   This document describes exemplary use cases of a more general
   Diameter signaling (i.e. independent from individual Diameter User
   Sessions) in Section 3.  In Section 4 the document defines an
   extension to the Diameter base protocol for such signaling using a
   General Purpose (GP) Diameter session.  The proposed extension to
   Diameter enables signaling volume reduction for various specific use
   cases.

3.  Use Cases

   This section describes some use cases where Diameter signaling
   between a client and a server can benefit from a general purpose
   Diameter session.  The use cases about Diameter node restoration and
   mass handling are relevant in current 3GPP work and reflect the need
   for more efficient Diameter signaling.

3.1.  PCRF Failure and Restoration

   A use case encountered in 3GPP's network architecture is the Policy
   and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) failure and restoration
   [3GPP-PCRFFR].  The PCRF is a control function interacting via
   Diameter with BBERF (Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function) and
   PCEF (Policy Enforcement Function) in the bearer plane, as well as AF
   (Application Function) in the application plane; a simplified
   functional view is given in Figure 1.  The PCRF appears as a central
   entity, keeping and coordinating states per mobile terminal; it is a
   Diameter server, whereas BBERF, PCEF and AF are Diameter clients.
   Note that in real network deployments all functions would be present
   in multiple instances (e.g. geographically distributed and including
   load balancing).

   User sessions in the bearer plane are controlled by PCRF sessions,
   e.g. regarding Quality of Service, packet filters and charging
   parameters.

   Although a PCRF can certainly be implemented as a highly resilient
   node in itself, there is also the desire to provide resilience by
   network based means.  In case of failure of one particular PCRF node
   this could mean that PCRF session state has to be restored on either
   the same PCRF node (after recovery), or on other, alternative PCRF
   nodes (during the downtime of the failed PCRF).  Preferably this
   restoration procedure is performed in a bulk mode, e.g. for hundreds
   or thousands of user sessions.  After detecting the failure of a
   PCRF, clients will have to send PCRF session state information of
   affected sessions to the alternative PCRF (the target for
   restoration).  Obviously this signaling must be independent of any
   user sessions being currently handled on a target PCRF.  Details
   about the restoration procedure are out of scope of this document,
   but are currently under study in 3GPP [3GPP-PCRFFR].

3.2.  Optimization for Mass Handling

   One typical case (again for the EPC architecture [3GPP-EPC]) is
   depicted in Figure 2; the Mobility Management Entity (MME)
   communicates with Home Subscription Server (HSS) via Diameter for the
   purpose of performing location registration and download/update of
   subscription information.

   Especially for machine-type applications, external triggers may lead
   to a massive amount of attachments, or recurring applications may
   exhibit (almost) synchronized behavior, leading to massive amount of
   registration updates.  Both may (and most likely do, see [3GPP-EPC])
   require Diameter signaling exchanges between MME and HSS (Update
   Location Request/Response pairs, as part of the S6a application
   realized on top of Diameter).  HSS is here in the role of a Diameter
   server, and MME acts as Diameter client.  More details can be found
   in [3GPP-DIAM].

3.3.  Policy enforcement to subscriber groups

   A further use case for the GP Session is the signaling of group
   related context.  As example, a Policy Control entity may comprise a
   Diameter server function, whereas a Diameter client is co-located
   with the entity implementing the Policy Enforcement engine.  The
   Diameter client and server may have individual user sessions set up,
   but could consider grouping of multiple users and identification of
   groups according to a group key.  Instead of applying the same policy
   to individual users one after the other by means of sequential
   handshakes, the Diameter server may use the GP Session and a RAR/RAA
   handshake to enforce the policy to a group of users.  Figure 3
   depicts policy enforcement to a group of users by means of a GP
   Session.

   The Diameter server identifies the group of users with the group key.
   Alternatively, the Diameter server could use the GP Session to
   enforce the policy to a sub-set of users by means of identifying the
   addressed users with user keys.  The user key may be any user-
   individual AVP according to [RFC3588] or [RFC4005], such as the user
   name AVP, or a new AVP which serves as user identification.  In case
   the Diameter client and server have individual Diameter User Session
   IDs set up for the users, the GP Session related signaling may
   identify individual users also by means of appending multiple User
   Session ID AVPs as user keys.  However, in such case the Diameter
   signaling context is identified by means of the GP Session ID,
   whereas a set of User Session IDs is used solely to identify
   individual users and apply an accompanying value to their policy
   settings.  Details about group identification and individual user
   identification in the context of GP Session signaling are out of
   scope of this version of the document.

4.  Protocol Extension

4.1.  Enhancement to the Diameter Session Concept

   The Diameter base protocol [RFC3588] explicitly distinguishes a
   Connection between a Diameter client and a Diameter server from
   Diameter Sessions.  Whereas a connection provides transport service
   to convey Diameter messages between a particular client and a server,
   a session is referred to be a logical concept at the application
   layer.  A connection is established between a client and a server and
   is used in a shared manner.  A session is established on a per-user
   basis and is not shared to signal context of multiple users.

   This document proposes an enhancement to the original Diameter
   session concept and specifies the use of a dedicated Diameter session
   in the context of multiple users or application specific context.
   Figure 4 depicts one possible interpretation of the proposed Diameter
   GP Session.  A Diameter client establishes user-specific sessions
   with the Diameter server.  Each session is identified by a Session
   ID, which uniquely identifies a user.  The Diameter GP Session is
   established without linking the session and the associated Session ID
   to a particular user.  The Diameter client may make use of a virtual
   user and associated identifiers, keys etc. to open the GP Session
   with the Diameter server.  Important is that client and server are
   aware of the meaning and use of the virtual user's session for
   general purpose signaling.  Details about authentication and
   authorization of the virtual user behind the GP Session is out of
   scope of this version of the document.

                         Client-Server association

4.2.  Setting up the General Purpose Session

   In order to avoid breaking the Diameter User Session concept, a
   General Purpose Session is interpreted as an additional User Session
   between the Diameter Client and the Diameter Server, whereas the user
   behind this session is virtual.  The GP Session ID can be
   administratively configured or well known (static GP Session).
   Alternatively, the Diameter client may bootstrap a GP Session by
   means of a authentication/authorization procedure, e.g. according to
   the authorization procedure specified in [RFC4005].  In such case, a
   unique and temporary Session ID is assigned to a GP Session.  The
   Diameter client and server may add an Authorization-Lifetime AVP to
   the authorization signaling to negotiate a limited lifetime of the GP
   Session.

   The GP Session ID meets the format of the Diameter Session ID
   according to [RFC3588].  During dynamic set up of a GP Session
   according to the Authentication/Authorization procedure, the AAR/AAA
   may indicate the special type of Diameter session.  The Diameter base
   specification as well as the NASREQ specification provide several
   means to allow such indication.  For example, the Diameter Session
   AVP could carry an indicator in the optional value field, which

   classifies the Session ID as GP Session.  The set of high/low 64 bits
   identify the GP Session.  Details about the setup as well as the
   indication of the Session ID type are out of scope of this version of
   the document and are for further study.

6.  Security Considerations

   The GP Session concept relies on the trust relationship and
   associated security association between a Diameter client and a
   server.  Hence, security considerations do not go beyond what is
   covered in [RFC3588].

7.  IANA Considerations

   If the option field in the Session ID AVP is being used to identify a

   specification.  Future details about the specification and message
   format definitions may require IANA actions.
