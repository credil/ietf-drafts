                    OSPFv3 Stub Router Advertisement
                   draft-shishio-ospf-ospfv3-stub-02

Abstract

   OSPFv3 accommodates for the possibility to indicate through the R-bit
   if a router is an active router and should be taken into
   consideration as a transit device.  Another method available is the
   v6-bit indicating if a router or link should be excluded from IPv6
   routing calculations.

   A direct result is that OSPFv3 has "no transit capability"
   potentially based upon the setting of R-bit and V6-bit, unlike the
   stub OSPFv2 router functionality.  This feature proposal has as
   purpose to re-introduce existing OSPFv2 stub router behavior into
   OSPFv3 to keep the operational service provider experience used to
   deploy, troubleshoot and be familiar with OSPFv2 stub routing.

   OSPFv3 has similar metric field information field of all of LSAs,
   with exception of the Link-LSA, so RFC3137 method can be re-utilized
   in OSPFv3.

   To drive consistency between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, there should be next
   to supporting both R-bit and v6-bit be support for"max-metric".

Internet-Draft      OSPFv3 Stub Router Advertisement        January 2011


1.  Motivation

   OSPF Stub Router Advertisement [RFC3137] describes a set of
   situations when the Service provider has a desire to utilize this
   functionality.

   o  The router is in a critical condition resulting in either a very
      high CPU load, or not enough memory to store all LSAs, or doesn't
      succeed to build the routing table

   o  Graceful introduction or removal of a router to or from the
      network

   o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons

   Even if the network will be moved or migrated towards from IPv4 in
   combination with OSPFv2 towards IPv6 using OSPFv3 [OSPFv3]
   technology, it remains important that the operational behaviour
   remains similar between routing protocols.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  OSPFv2 operation

   RFC3137 [RFC3137] describes in section 2 in detail the behavior of
   link cost metrics. i.e.  Router X announces its Router LSA to the
   neighbor with costs of all non-stub links which are set to
   LSInfinity(0xFFFF), while stub links are announced with interface
   cost.

   Often the operator will check interface metric of ospf database
   assuming he would like to confirm whether the router is announcing
   LSInfinity.

   Many service provider operators are using OSPF stub router
   advertisement [RFC3137] for OSPFv2 [OSPFv2].  This feature is
   supported by majority of OSPFv2 implementations.  Use cases are
   below;

Internet-Draft      OSPFv3 Stub Router Advertisement        January 2011


3.1.  Wait for BGP during booting


               |R1|--|R2|---|R4|---internet
                |             |
                +----|R3|-----+

                                 Figure 1

   In this example R2 can be assumed it is the best path towards the
   Internet from R1.  When R2 reloads it would result that R3 would be
   best path for going towards Internet.  From the moment R2 is reloaded
   and OSPF has converged, there may be a situation when BGP is still
   not converged to the full.  If in this situation R1 should not send
   traffic towards R2 just yet.  R2 should send LSInfinity(0xFFFF) to
   indicate that R1 should wait for R2's BGP converge.  Once BGP is
   fully converged, R2 LSA's out with correct interface metric value in
   OSPFv2 area which will result in R2 being reintroduced as the primary
   path.

3.2.  LDP Synchronization


               |R1|--|R2|---|R4|
                |            |
                +----|R3|----+

                                 Figure 2

   Assume that from R1 the best path to R4 is via R2 in this MPLS
   network.  When R2 is reloaded, then R3 is the only and hence also the
   best path.  At some point in time R2 is fully successfully reloaded
   resulting that OSPF has converged also.  This does not necessary mean
   LDP has fully converged either.  In this situation R1 should not send
   traffic to R2 immediately.  In that case R2 could send
   LSInfinity(0xFFFF) resulting in a situation where R1 must wait for R2
   to be fully be available and transit states have been passed.  From
   the moment LDP converged on R2, it can distribute the traditional
   Interface OSPF metric value.  This operation will result that OSPF
   and LDP have a converged behaviour.  The importance and the
   description of this behaviour can be found in [LDP-Sync].

3.3.  Configuration change


              |R1|--|R2|---|R4|
               |             |
               +----|R3|-----+

                                 Figure 3

   When operator needs R2 configuration change,R2 sends
   LSInfinity(0xFFFF) for traffic engineering.  R2 configuration
   completed,R2 sends correct metric value in OSPFv2 area.


4.  OSPFv3 operation

4.1.  R-bit and v6-bit

   [OSPFv3] explains at section 2.7 the following: If the "R-bit" is
   clear, an OSPF speaker can participate in OSPF topology distribution
   without being used to forward transit traffic.  The V6-bit
   specializes the R-bit; if the V6-bit is clear, an OSPF speaker can
   participate in OSPF topology distribution without being used to
   forward IPv6 datagrams.  If the R-bit is set and the V6-bit is clear,
   IPv6 datagrams are not forwarded but datagrams belonging to another
   protocol family may be forwarded.

   This protocol implementation is useful in multi address family
   environment such as [OSPFv3-AF].  But Service Provider operators have
   to check both the "R-bit" and "v6-bit" during their operation and
   introduce both training and operational changes to make this a true
   usable technology.  Operators have believe that a useful approach
   would be to rely upon successful IPv4 OSPFv2 behaviour and to add a
   "OSPFv2 compatibility mode" in IPv6 only environment to mimic OSPFv2
   behavior in this environment.

   The functionality of the R-bit and v6-bit operations is described in
   [OSPFv3]'s Errata 2078 more detail.

   A Router should support a "R-bit" know with a clear wait for BGP or
   waiting-before-becoming-active time on start-up same as [RFC3137]
   indicates.

4.2.  OSPFv2 compatibility mode

   An OSPFv3 routing device has through the area scope LSAs metric
   information of all of devices.  As result the router can announce the
   interface metric LSInfinity(0xFFFF).  This is simple implementation
