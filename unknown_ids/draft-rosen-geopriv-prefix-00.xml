<abstract>
<t>RFC4119 updated by RFC5139 defines suffixes for street names and house numbers, but does not define prefixes.  Both occur regularly
in addresses and CAtypes are needed for them.  This memo defines STP Street Prefix and HNP house number prefix CAtypes.</t>
</abstract></front><middle>
<section title="Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref 
target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
<section title="Prefixes in addressing">	
<t>In <xref target="RFC4119"/> one can define a PIDF for 123 Main Street but not 123 Boulevard Coranado.  There is an STS CAtype for a
suffix, but no corresponding prefix.  <xref target="RFC5139"/> added PRM Premodifier and POM
Postmodifier, but those are not suitable for the purpose.</t>
<t>Similarly, one can express 123B Main, but not H123 Main.  Although one can include such letters
in the house number, most addressing authorities keep the number numeric only to facilitate sorting, and have prefix and suffix fields
for alphanumerics that appear in front of or following the numeric house number.</t>
<t>To remedy this situation, new CAtypes are required: STP for a street (road) prefix, and HNP for a house number prefix.</t>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The XML representation described in this document is designed for
   inclusion in a PIDF-LO document.  As such, it is subject to the same
   security considerations as are described in <xref target="RFC4119"/>.
   Considerations relating to the inclusion of this representation in
   other XML documents are outside the scope of this document.</t>
</section>
<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>   This document updates the civic address type registry established by
   <xref target="RFC4776"/>.  Two additional value are added:</t>
