Abstract

   This document defines prefix delegation support for mobile networks.
   Mobile Router dynamically requests its Mobile Network Prefixes from
   its Home Agents using Binding Update both at the home link and at the
   visited links.  Home agents get the prefixes delegated using DHCPv6
   Prefix Delegation and reply to the Mobile Router with Binding
   Acknowledgement.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support             March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Nemo Basic Support Protocol requires that IPv6 prefixes called Mobile
   Network Prefix(es) delegated to a Mobile Router and advertized in the
   Mobile Network [RFC3963].  However the protocol does not provide any
   means of provisioning Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs) dynamically.

   Prefix delegation is widely discussed in IETF 16NG, MEXT, and NETLMM
   Working Groups.  Corresponding solutions are also introduced.  NEMO
   deals with synchronization of Mobile Network prefixes between a
   Mobile Router and a Home Agent, while the method is agnostic to the
   way that a Home Agent gets prefixes from back end servers.

   [RFC3633] defines Prefix Delegation options and procedures to provide
   a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] home network prefix (HNP) is used by
   MN to assign a home address.  Mobile access gateway (MAG) needs to
   emulate MN's home network on the access link and therefore needs to
   learn HNP.  The design decision was made to learn this from the proxy
   binding acknowledgement message sent by the local mobility agent
   (LMA) (See Section 6.7 in [RFC5213]).  For this purpose, proxy
   binding update and acknowledgement messages are extended with Home
   Network Prefix Option to carry HNP and its length.  However, how LMA
   gets prefixes is not currently defined yet.

   In Nemo MNP provisioning problem, MR, like MAG needs to get MNP, like
   HNP from HA, like LMA in order for MR to advertise MNP on its
   downstream link(s).  Because of this similarity, this document
   proposes to use the binding update/acknowledgement exchanged with HA
   to carry MNPs similar to proxy binding update/acknowledgement
   messages of Proxy Mobile IPv6.  DHCPv6 prefix delegation (PD) is
   proposed to be used for HA to get prefixes from DHCP server with HA
   as the requesting router (RR) and DHCP server as the delegating
   router (DR) [RFC3633].

   When MR is on the home link, MR gets authenticated first and then
   gets the configuration settings including MNPs from the policy store.
   This document describes an IKEv2 and EAP authentication based home
   link configuration but other solutions are also possible.  MR uses
   IKEv2 exchanges to receive prefixes for its home link only and not
   for MNPs.

   MR requests MNP from HA using the binding update message as in the
   visited link.  A successful EAP authentication can trigger MR to send
   BU with Home Link Exchange flag set to HA.  HA then uses DHCPv6 PD
   interactions to get MNPs and send them to MR using BA.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support             March 2009


   BU/BA based prefix delegation support differs from the solution
   described in [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] in several aspects:

   1.  DHCPv6 PD is executed between HA as Requesting Router (RR) and
       DHCP Server as Delegating Router (DR) while in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] DHCPv6 PD is executed between MR as
       Requesting Router (RR) and HA as Delegating Router (DR).
   2.  Prefix(es) are exchanged in BU/BA using HNP Option in BU/BA based
       prefix delegation support which is already used in Proxy Mobile
       IPv6 [RFC5213].  In [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd], prefix(es) are
       carried in DHCP messages as defined in [RFC3633].
   3.  Because of (1) the MR in [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] becomes more
       complicated as it needs to support DHCP on its upstream
       interface.
   4.  Because of (2) visited link operation in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] is much more complicated.
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] requires that DHCPv6 Relay agent
       implemented on MR's upstream interface.
   5.  In terms of deployment, BU/BA based prefix delegation support
       offers more flexibility and it is much simpler since DHCP server
       could be on the same link as HA in which case HA only needs to
       have DHCP Client.  In case DHCP server is located on a different
       network, HA can accomodate this having a DHCP Relay on the same
       link or colocated with HA.  MR does not have any requirement to
       support DHCP on its upstream interface.
   6.  In terms of deployment, the solution described in
       [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] requires MR to support both DHCPv6
       Client and Relay on its upstream interface.  Also since DHCP
       Relays can not be chained, HA has to support DHCP Server.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3315], [RFC3633],
   [RFC4886], [RFC3775], [RFC4306] and [RFC5213].


3.  Nemo Prefix Delegation Using DHCPv6

   We assume that the prefixes are managed by an authority that owns the
   Home Network and subnets it into MNPs that it assigns to the MRs.  An
   MNP can be preassigned to the associated MR (e.g. manually or
   automatically with a provisioning system), or assigned dynamically by
   a server such as a DHCP Prefix Delegation server.  In this
   architecture, HA is the requesting router and the DHCP Server is the
   delegating router.  HA needs to be collocated with a DHCP Client to
   solicit/request prefixes from the DHCP Server.  The delegating router
   could be a backend DHCP Server.

   In a visited link, Mobile Router(MR) requests its Mobile Network
   Prefixes from its Home Agents dynamically using Binding Update
   message.  When BU message contains one or more Home Network Prefix
   Options, this triggers HA to start DHCPv6 PD with DHCP Server.
   Figure 1 shows the process that a Mobile Router requests prefixes
   from a Home Agent.


          MR       HA   DHCP Server

          |------->|        |      1. BU with Home Network Prefix Option

          |        |<-------|      5. DHCP Reply (MNP)
          |<-------|        |      6. BA with Home Network Prefix Option


                    Figure 1: Prefix Delegation in NEMO

   1.  Home Network Prefix option defined in [RFC5213] included in the
       Binding Update(BU) and R flag in the binding update are used to
       indicate to the Home Agent (HA) that the MR wishes to get new
       prefixes assigned to it for use as Mobile Network Prefixes.  MR
       MUST set the R bit in Home Network Prefix option Section 8.1 to
       indicate a prefix request.
   2.  DHCP Client at the HA initiates DHCP Solicit procedure to request
       prefixes for the MN.  HA creates and transmits a Solicit message
       as described in sections 17.1.1, "Creation of Solicit Messages"
       and 17.1.2, "Transmission of Solicit Messages" of RFC 3315.  HA
       creates an IA_PD and assigns it an IAID.  HA assigns a different
       IAID for each Home Network Prefix option it receives in a BU.  HA
       MUST include the IA_PD option in the Solicit message.
   3.  The DHCP server sends an Advertise message to HA in the same way
       as described in section 17.2.2, "Creation and transmission of
       Advertise messages" of RFC 3315.
   4.  HA uses the same message exchanges as described in section 18,
       "DHCP Client-Initiated Configuration Exchange" of RFC 3315 to
       obtain or update prefixes from a DHCP server.  HA and the DHCP
       server use the IA_PD Prefix option to exchange information about
       prefixes in much the same way as IA Address options are used for
       assigned addresses.
   5.  HA stores the prefix information including prefix lifetime it
       received in the Reply message in the Prefix Table [RFC3963].
   6.  HA sends the prefixes received to MR in a Binding Acknowledgement
       message.  Home Network Prefix option defined in [RFC5213] is
       included in the Binding Acknowledgement.  One Home Network Prefix
       option is included for each prefix received.

   MR sets prefix length and home network prefix values to ALL_ZERO in
   Home Network Prefix option of BU MR sends to HA.  If MR bootstrapped
   in the home link MR sets prefix length and home network prefix values
   to the values received in the BA with Home Link Exchange Flag (C
   flag) defined in [I-D.devarapalli-mext-mipv6-home-link] set as in
   Section 4.  In subsequent BUs, MR sets these fields to the values
   received in the previous BA from HA.

   When advertizing MNPs in Router Advertisement messages, MR MAY set
   the prefix lifetime value to any value chosen at its own discretion.
   The value may be bound to the lifetime of MR's binding with HA.  The
   value may also be set by a value taken from MR's policy profile.
   Prefixes MUST be renewed by MR sending a BU that contains one or more
   Home Link Prefix Options Section 5.


4.  Home Link Support

   If MR boots in the home link, DHCPv6 prefix delegation operation is
   as shown in Figure 2.

   1.   An MR boots up in the network.  DHCP Server in Figure 2 is not
        involved in the network entry procedures.
   2.   MR starts IKEv2 procedures [RFC4306] to establish a security
        association with the HA [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-split].
   3.   MR requests prefix(es) to configure its home link using
        CFG_REQUEST payload in the message.  MR includes a zero length
        INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attribute in the CFG_REQUEST payload to
        request a prefix.  MR MUST include multiple instances of
        INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attribute to request multiple prefixes to be
        assigned by HA.
   4.   MR and HA authenticate each other using EAP.
   5.   If authentication succeeds HA is ready to assign prefix(es)
        using DHCP PD.
   6.   HA includes the prefixes for MR's home link in the payload in
        CGF_REPLY.  CFG_REPLY contains more than one instances of
        INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attribute each containing home link prefix
        and its length.  MR uses these prefixes for its home link.
   7.   MR sends BU with Home Link Exchange (C) Flag on and includes
        Home Network Prefix Option in order to get MNPs from HA.
   8.   HA as the requesting router starts DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
        exchange with the Delegating Router.  Step 2 in Figure 1.
   9.   Step 3 in Figure 1.
   10.  Step 4 in Figure 1.
   11.  Step 5 in Figure 1.
   12.  HA sends BA back to MR.  BA has Home Link Exchange (C) Flag set
        and it contains Home Network Prefix Option containing MNPs for
        the mobile devices in the NEMO.

   After Step 5, HA MAY execute DHCP PD procedures with DHCP Server to
   request prefixes for MR's home link configuration.  At Step 6, HA
   sets CFG_REPLY INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attribute values to the prefixes
   obtained from DHCP Server.  HA MUST use a different IA_ID for the
   prefixes to be used in home link configuration of MR.

                   Figure 2: Home Link Prefix Delegation


5.  Prefix Renew Procedure

   To extend MNP lifetimes, HA sends a Renew message to the DHCP server.
   The server determines new lifetimes for the prefixes and returns the
   prefix to HA in a Reply message.  The DHCP server MAY add new
   prefixes to the MR for renumbering in its Reply message.

   Prefix renew request can also be received from MR.  MR sends BU with
   HNP set to the prefix already assigned to HA.  The Release (R) bit
   MUST not be set in HNP Option.  If this happens, HA sends a Renew
   message to the DHCP server to renew the MNP.  After receiving the
   Reply message, HA sends a BA with HNP set to the prefix assigned and
   with Q bit set to 1.  Setting Q bit in BA indicates reception of a
   renewed prefix.


6.  Prefix Release Procedure

   Prefixes can be released in two ways, prefix aging or DHCP release
   procedure.  In the former way, a prefix SHOULD not be used by an MR
   when the prefix ages, and the DHCP Server can delegate it to another
   MR.  A prefix lifetime is delivered from the DHCPv6 server to the
   requesting router (HA) through DHCP IA_PD Prefix option [RFC3633] and

   RA Prefix Information option [RFC4861].

   Mobile Router can initiate the prefix release procedure based on
   deregistration of the nodes in the mobile network.  Figure 3 can be
   used to release prefixes.

        MR        HA       DHCPS

         |------->|        |    2. BU with R bit set
         |        |------->|    3. DHCP Release (MNP)
         |        |<-------|    4. DHCP Reply
         |<-------|        |    2. BA with R bit set
         |        |        |

                         Figure 3: Prefix release

   HA MUST release the mobile network prefix when MR signals to do so.
   The prefix release signaling is as shown in Figure 3.

   1.  A local mobile node (LMN) or visiting mobile node (VMN) leaves
       the mobile network.  If such a node was the only user for MNP or
       if all LMNs/VMNs left the mobile network then MR starts MNP
       release procedure.
   2.  MR sends a BU with HNP option to HA.  In the HNP option, MR MUST
       set the R bit to one.
   3.  HA receives BU and checks the R bit. if R bit is set HA as the
       requesting router sends DHCPv6 Release message to the delegating
       router.  HA MUST include the mobile network prefix to be released
       in IA_PD by copying it from the home network prefix option of BU
       it received from MR.
   4.  DR sends back DHCPv6 Rely message confirming the release.
   5.  HA sends BA to confirm the prefix release.  MR MUST stop
       advertizing the MNP in the mobile network.


7.  Miscellaneous Considerations

7.1.  Rapid Commit Option

   4-way exchange between HA as requesting router (RR) and DHCP server
   as delegating router (DR) in Figure 1 and Figure 2 MAY be reduced
   into a two message exchange using the Rapid Commit option [RFC3315].
   HA includes a Rapid Commit option in the Solicit message.  DR then
   sends a Reply message containing one or more prefixes.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support             March 2009


7.2.  Implicit/Explicit Modes

   If MRs operate in implicit mode then MR MUST not include Mobile
   Network Prefix option in BUs nor Home Network Prefix Option.  This is
   because MR and HA will run a dynamic routing protocol to manage
   prefixes.  HA MAY use DHCPv6 prefix delegation as requesting router
   to request prefixes for the mobile network from the DHCP server
   acting as delegating router.

   NEMO explicit mode is recommended to use all aspects of the protocol
   defined in this document.

7.3.  Advertising Delegated Prefixes

   HA should broadcast the prefix(es) dynamically upstream as the route
   information of all the MRs connected to this HA.  This might cause
   high routing protocol traffic (IGMP, OSPF, etc.) due to large number
   of prefixes.  To solve the problem, route aggregation SHOULD be used.
   For example, each HA can be assigned a /48 or /32 prefix (aggregate
   prefix) while each interface of MR can be assigned a /64 prefix.  The
   /64 prefix is an extension of /48 one, for example, an HA's /48
   prefix is 3FFE:FFFF:0::/48, an interface of MR is assigned 3FFE:FFFF:
   0:2::/64 prefix.  The HA only broadcasts it's /48 or /32 prefix
   information to Internet.

7.4.  DHCP Server Issues

   The delegating router should normally be located in Home Agent's
   network.  In that case HA needs only a DHCP Client to communicate
   with DHCP server.

   If the delegating router is not local HA needs DHCP Relay Agent to
   forward multicast packets to DHCP server.  DHCP Relay Agent should be
   located in the same link as HA and it needs to be configured with the
   address of DHCP server.


8.  Message Formats

   contain one or more INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attributes.

   This document requires Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
   messages defined in [RFC3775] to contain one or more Home Network
