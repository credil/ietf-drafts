Internet-Draft                SRV for Email                     May 2009


1.  Introduction

   [RFC2782] defines a DNS-based service discovery protocol that has
   been widely adopted as a means of locating particular services within
   a local area network and beyond, using SRV RR records.

   Internet Email protocols include SMTP [RFC5321], IMAP [RFC3501] and
   POP3 [RFC1939].

   [RFC5321] defines the MX RR record type to locate SMTP services for a
   domain.  However, [RFC4409] defines a "profile" of the SMTP service
   that is specifically used for message submission - which is of direct
   relevance to email clients which typically don't use MX records.

   Both IMAP and POP3 are mail access protocols used by email clients to
   manipulate email messages after delivery.

   Typically email clients have required users to enter host name and
   port information for the services they need.  This is not ideal as
   the way in which server information is specified can differ from
   client to client, and can be confusing to users, leading to errors
   when inputting the details.  A better approach would be to require
   miniml information to be entered by a user which would result in
   automatic configuration of appropriate services for that user.  The
   minimal information entered would be the user's email address.

   This specification defines new SRV service types for the message
   submission, IMAP and POP3 services to enable simple autoconfiguration
   of email clients.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  SRV service types

3.1.  Email Submission

   This specification adds one SRV service type for message submission
   [RFC4409]:

   submission:  Identifies a message submission server as defined by
      [RFC4409].  Note that this covers connections both with and
      without transport layer security [RFC3207].

   Example: service record

       _submission._tcp     SRV 0 1 587 mail.example.com.

3.2.  IMAP

   This specification adds two SRV service types for IMAP [RFC3501]:

   imap:  Identifies an IMAP server that includes support for the
      "STARTTLS" extension to optionally allow transport layer security
      to be negotiated by the client.

   imaps:  Identifies an IMAP server where transport layer security is
      initiated directly upon connection to the server.

   Example: service record

       _imap._tcp     SRV 0 1 143 imap.example.com.

3.3.  POP3

   This specification adds two SRV service types for POP3 [RFC1939]:

   pop3:  Identifies a POP3 server that includes support for the "STLS"
      command [RFC2595] to optionally allow transport layer security to
      be negotiated by the client.

   pop3s:  Identifies a POP3 server where transport layer security is
      initiated directly upon connection to the server.

   Example: service record

       _pop3._tcp     SRV 0 1 110 pop3.example.com.

4.  Guidance for mail access clients

   By using SRV records as above, clients need only prompt the user for
   their email address [RFC5322]. "local-part" and "domain" portions are
   extracted from the email address by the client.  The "local-part" is
   used for the user identifier (used for authentication with the
   appropriate service) and the "domain" is used as the service domain.

   The client uses the service domain to perform SRV lookups for the
   services it wants to configure.  If the SRV lookup is successful the
   host name and port for the service can be determined and used to
   complete client configuration.  If an SRV record is not found, the
   client will need to prompt the user to enter host name and port
   information directly.

   Clients that support both POP3 and IMAP SHOULD check for both
   services using SRV lookups.  If both services are returned the choice
   of which to configure is up to the client - it could prompt the user
   to make a choice, or pick one based on local policy.

5.  Security Considerations

   Clients that support transport layer security SHOULD try the "imaps"
   or "pop3s" services first before trying the "imap" or "pop3"
   services.  If a user has explicitly requested a connection with
   transport layer security, the client MUST NOT use any service
   information returned for the "imap" or "pop3" services.

   A malicious attacker with access to the DNS server data can
   potentially cause clients to connect to any server chosen by the
   attacker.  In the absence of a secure DNS option, clients SHOULD
   check that the host name returned in the SRV record matches the
   original service domain that was queried.  If the host is not in the
   queried domain, clients SHOULD verify with the user that the SRV host
   name is suitable for use before executing any connections to the
   host.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions on the part of IANA.
