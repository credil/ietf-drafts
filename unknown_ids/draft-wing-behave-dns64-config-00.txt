Abstract

   Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and
   IPv6-only hosts at the same time.  Such networks also want to IPv6/
   IPv4 translation for the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on
   the IPv4 Internet.  On such a network, the synthesized AAAA responses
   from a DNS64 can cause traffic to be translated.  This document
   describes two solutions to avoid that translation:  modifying default
   address selection on the host, and using DHCP to configure different
   DNS recursive resolvers.

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts      January 2010


1.  Introduction

   In order to access IPv4 servers, an IPv6-only host needs to use an
   IPv6/IPv4 translator and a DNS64 recursive resolver.  However, if a
   dual-stack host uses that same DNS64 recursive resolver, the dual-
   stack host will send traffic through the IPv6/IPv4 translator (when
   such traffic could have been sent using IPv4).  Thus, as an
   optimization it is desirable to avoid IPv6/IPv4 translation.

   If the dual-stack host's IPv4 traffic is being NATted the difference
   is NAT44 versus NAT64, so the performance and saleability concern is
   nearly identical.  However, at least one application breaks when
   translated between IP address families unless special measures are
   taken [I-D.ietf-behave-ftp64].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "IPv4-only" means a host that has only IPv4 address(es) assigned to
   its interface(s).  "Dual-stack" means a host that has an IPv4 address
   and an IPv6 address assigned to its interface(es).  "IPv6-only" means
   a host that has only IPv6 address(es) assigned to its interface(s).


3.  Procedures to support IPv6-only and dual-stack hosts with DNS64

   Two solutions are proposed in this section:  the first solution is to
   modify the dual-stack host's default address selection rules
   [RFC3484], [I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise].  The second solution
   involves the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers replying with the appropriate
   DNS server for the host.

3.1.  Modify Host's Address Selection Rules

   The default address selection rules [RFC3484] prefer IPv6 over IPv4.
   This means, for a dual-stack host, that IPv6 will be preferred (if
   available) over IPv4.  If a dual-stack host is configured to use a
   DNS64 server, that DNS64 server will synthesize an AAAA response if
   there is an A record.  Thus, the dual-stack host will always use IPv6
   if a DNS lookup was involved, even if IPv4 could have been used more
   optimally.

      Note:  If both a NAT44 and NAT64 are deployed on the same network,
      roughly the same inefficiency occurs (that is, NAT state is

      created).  However, it is generally considered better to perform
      NAT44 than NAT64, because NAT64 translates between IP address
      families which can have side effects (e.g., FTP).

   To avoid this, the host's default address selection rules [RFC3484]
   can be modified so that IPv4 is preferred over the IPv6/IPv4
   translator's prefix.  At the same time, native IPv6 can still be
   preferred over IPv4.  This is accomplished by adding the network's
   IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix as the lowest Precedence in the address
   selection rules.

   If the IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix is the IANA-assigned well-known
   prefix (64:FF9B::/96, as assigned in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]), this can be hard-coded or easily
   scripted into the system startup.  However, if the IPv6/IPv4
   translator's prefix is a network-specific prefix (NSP, as described
   in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]), the default address selection
   rules can be modified only after the host learns its currently-
   connected network's IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix (e.g., using
   [I-D.wing-behave-learn-prefix]).

   On some operating systems, the address selection rules can be
   configured using a command line utility (e.g., Windows, FreeBSD),
   without new software in the host's IP stack.  Other operating systems
   are not as accomodating of this solution (see Section 3.1.2).

      Note:  it may be desirable to create a standard to adjust a host's
      address selection rules, perhaps using DHCPv6.  This is a topic
      for the IPv6 maintenance working group [6man].  This automatic
      mechanism may involve modifications to the host's IP stack,
      depending on how the operating system supports obtaining newly-
      defined DHCPv6 options.

3.1.1.  Host Transition

   An IPv6-only and a dual-stack host can both be configured with the
   same address selection rules (namely, both can add the network's
   translator as the lowest Precedence).  This is because the IPv6-only
   host will never use IPv4 (because it lacks an IPv4 address) and will
   thus fall through and use the IPv6 address synthesized by the DNS64
   containing the IPv6/IPv4 translator's prefix (that is, as shown in
   the examples, the IPv6-only host will use the Precedence 3 entry in
   the default policy table).  The dual-stack host, if it receives an
   AAAA response, will prefer use IPv6; if it receives only an A
   response, it will prefer to use IPv4 (using Precedence 10 for IPv4-
   mapped addresses defined in Section 2.5.4 of [RFC2373]).

3.1.2.  Limitations

   OSX does not implement a [RFC3484] or [RFC3484]-like policy table.

3.1.3.  Examples

   For example, if a network is using the IANA-assigned WKP 64:FF9B::/96
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] and a host is using the new default
   policy table from [I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise] (which added
   Precedence 5 for Teredo), the host's new policy table would contain
   one new entry with Precedence 3, as shown below:

        Prefix        Precedence Label
        ::1/128               50     0     # localhost
        ::/0                  30     2     # IPv6 native
        2002::/16             20     3     # 6to4
        ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4     # IPv4-mapped
        2001::/32              5     5     # Teredo
        64:FF9B::/96           3     6     # 6/4 translator's prefix

   As another example, if a network has the prefix 2001:0DB8::/32 and
   the NAT64 is using the network-specific prefix (NSP) 2001:0DB8:
   AAAA::/96, and the host is using the new default policy table from
   [I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise] (which added Precedence 5 for
   Teredo), the host's new policy table would contain one new entry with
   Precedence 3, as shown below:

        Prefix        Precedence Label
        ::1/128               50     0     # localhost
        ::/0                  30     2     # IPv6 native
        2002::/16             20     3     # 6to4
        ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4     # IPv4-mapped
        2001::/32              5     5     # Teredo
        2001:0DB8:AAAA::/96    3     6     # 6/4 translator's prefix

3.2.  Use DHCP to Assign Appropriate DNS Server

      Note:  due to the limitations of this solution (see
      Section 3.2.5), it may have little or no value.

   To avoid unnecessary traffic through a translator, it is desirable to
   configure IPv4-only and dual-stack hosts with a 'normal' DNS
   recursive resolver.

   However, it is necessary to configure IPv6-only hosts with a DNS64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] recursive resolver so those hosts can use an
   IPv6/IPv4 translator and access servers on the IPv4 Internet.

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts      January 2010


   It is difficult to provide different DNS servers to those types of
   hosts, because there is no existing protocol that declares a host is
   IPv4-only, dual-stack, or IPv6-only.

   This document describes how a network's DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers,
   combined with a client-identifiers [RFC4361] chosen by the host, can
   determine if a host is IPv4-only, dual-stack, or IPv6-only, and
   assign the correct DNS server according to that determination.

      Note:  the DHCP mechanism described in this section have some
      overlap with the Multiple Interfaces Working Group [mif] and with
      split-zone DNS [I-D.savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection].

   Both an IPv4-only host and a dual-stack host obtain an IPv4 network
   address.  Today, hosts most commonly obtain an IPv4 address using
   DHCPv4 [RFC2131].  An IPv6-only host does not obtain an IPv4 address;
   however, it may be using DHCPv6 to obtain other information (e.g.,
   NTP servers).  The following procedure takes advantage of that
   difference to determine if a host is IPv4-only, dual-stack, or IPv6-
   only.

3.2.1.  Host Requirements

   The host has the following requirements:

   1.  if the host uses IPv4, it MUST use DHCPv4 to learn its IPv4
       address and its DNS server address(es); and,

   2.  if the host uses IPv6, it MUST use DHCPv6 to learn its IPv6 DNS
       resolver, using the Information-Request message described in
       Section 18.1.5 of [RFC3315] and using [RFC3646]; and,

   3.  the host MUST use client-identifiers [RFC4361] to identify itself
       to its DHCP server(s), and MUST use the same client-identifier
       for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6

          Note:  This last requirement is stronger than the SHOULD in
          Section 6.2 of [RFC4361]

       If the host does not support DHCP authentication, and acquires/
       releases its IPv4 address while keeping its IPv6 address, it MUST
       support the procedure described in Section 3.2.4; and,

   4.  the host MUST support the DHCP Information Refresh Time Option
       [RFC4242].

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts      January 2010


3.2.2.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 Server Requirements

   The DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers have the following requirements:

   1.  the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers MUST be able to communicate with
       each other both client-identifiers [RFC4361] and if an IPv4
       address is assigned to that client-identifier; and,

   2.  If the DHCP server and the host support DHCP authentication, the
       DHCP server MUST support the procedure described in
       Section 3.2.4.

   3.  MUST support the DHCP Information Refresh Time Option [RFC4242].

3.2.3.  DHCP Server Operation

   If the DHCP server first receives a DHCPv4 request for a particular
   client-identifier, it responds with the 'normal' DNS resolver.  The
   DHCPv6 server remembers that RFC4361 client identity and if the
   DHCPv6 server sees a DHCPv6 request from that same client identity,
   it responds to the DHCPv6 request with a 'normal' DNS resolver.

   If the DHCP server first receives a DHCPv6 request for a particular
   client-identifier, it responds with a short information refresh time
   [RFC4242] (e.g., 30 seconds) and a DNS64 recursive resolver.

      Note-1:  This means that during the short information refresh
      time, both a dual-stack host and an IPv6-only will have their DNS
      queries processed by the DNS64 recursive resolver.  During that
      time, both the dual-stack host and the IPv6-only host will get
      connectivity to IPv4 servers, but the dual-stack host will use the
      IPv6/IPv4 translator until the information refresh time expires.

      Note-2:  for discussion:  Consider have DHCP server slightly delay
      (e.g., 100ms) responding to a DHCPv6 request.  This gives a chance
      for the DHCPv4 request to be received, thus avoiding the issue
      described in Note-1.

   After the short information refresh time, the DHCPv6 client will send
   a new request.  By that time, the DHCPv6 server will have either:

   a.  have seen a DHCPv4 request from the same RFC4361 host.  This
       indicates the host supports dual-stack.  The DHCP server should
       extend the DHCPv6 lease, and provide a 'normal' DNS server
       (instead of the DNS64 server).

   b.  have not seen a DHCPv4 request from the same RFC4361 host.  This
       indicates the host is IPv6-only.  The DHCP server should extend

Internet-Draft    DNS64 Resolvers and Dual-Stack Hosts      January 2010


       the DHCPv6 lease and continue providing the same DNS64 server.

3.2.4.  Host Transition

   During natural evolution of a network or because of debugging/
   troubleshooting, a host might transition between IPv4-only, dual-
   stack, or IPv6-only.  When the host acquires or releases its IPv4
   address it transitions to needing a different DNS server; if the host
   has an IPv4 address, it needs a 'normal' DNS server and if it does
   not have an IPv4 address it needs a DNS64 server.

   There are two transitions considered, where the host transitions:

   1.  from IPv6-only to IPv4-supporting (that is, IPv4-only or dual-
       stack),

   2.  from IPv4-supporting (that is, IPv4-only or dual-stack) to IPv6-
       only.

   When doing (1), the DHCPv4 server will provide a 'normal' DNS server
   (because the DHCPv4 server sees the same client-identifier as seen by
   the DHCPv6 server).  So case (1) is solved.

   However, when doing (2), the host is giving up its IPv4 address and
   is currently using a normal DNS server, but needs to be told to use a
   DNS64 server instead.  There are two mechanisms to provide that
   function, based on the network and host's support of DHCP
   authentication (Section 19.1.1 of [RFC3315])

   1.  with DHCP authentication:  When a certain client identifier loses
       or acquires its IPv4 address and also has an IPv6 address, the
       DHCPv6 server MUST send a DHCP RECONFIGURE message [RFC3315] to
       the host and SHOULD include the Option Request option indicating
       the DNS server information has changed.  The RECONFIGURE message
       triggers the host to send a new Information-Request message to
       the DHCPv6 server.

   2.  without DHCP authentication:  the host, when keeping its IPv6
       address and releasing its IPv4 address, MUST also issue a new
       DHCPv6 Information-Request message to the DHCPv6 server.

   In both cases, the Information-Request message causes the DHCPv6
   server to reply with a DNS64 recursive resolver, as discussed in
   Section 3.2.2.

3.2.5.  Limitations

   o  A network with mixed IPv4-only/dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only
      hosts needs to have a mix of DNS configurations for those hosts.
      Thus, mechanisms that advertise the same DNS servers to all hosts
      cannot be used on such networks (e.g., IPv6 router
      advertisements).

   o  Windows does not support [RFC4361].

   o  OSX does not support DHCPv6.
