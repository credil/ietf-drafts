        <abstract><t>Internet Key Exchange is a component of IPsec used for 
performing mutual authentication as well as establishing and maintaining 
security associations (SAs) between two parties such as a user and a network 
entity. Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) protocol allows several different 
mechanisms for authenticating a user, namely the Extensible Authentication 
Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared secrets. To authenticate and/or 
authorize the user, the network element such as the Access Gateway may need to 
dynamically bootstrap a security association based on interaction with the 
Diameter server. This document specifies the interaction between the Access 
Gateway and Diameter server for the IKEv2 based on pre-shared 
secrets.</t></abstract>

      <section title="Introduction">
            <t><xref target="RFC4306"/> defines IKEv2 as a protocol that 
performs mutual 
authentication between two parties and establishes a security association 
(SA) that includes shared secret information that can be used to efficiently 
establish SAs for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"/> and/or 
Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"/>, and a set of cryptographic algorithms to 
be used by the SAs to protect the traffic that they carry. IKEv2 protocol 
allows several different mechanisms for authenticating a IKEv2 Peer to be used,
 such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared 
secrets.</t>

<t>From a service provider perspective it is important to ensure that a user 
is 
authorized to use the services. Therefore, the IKEv2 Server must verify that 
the IKEv2 Peer is authorized for the requested services possibly with the 
assistance of the operator’s Diameter servers.  Moreover, this document does 
not assume that the IKEv2 Server has the pre-shared secrets (PSK) with the 
IKEv2 Peer. Instead, it allows for PSK to be derived for a specific IKEv2 
session and exchanged between IKEv2 Server and HAAA. This is accomplished 
through the use of a new Diameter application specifically designed for 
performing IKEv2 authorization decisions.  This document specifies the 
Diameter support for shared secrets (PSK) based IKEv2.</t>

   <t>The IKEPSK Application Identifier is used when the IKEv2 Peer is to be authenticated
   and authorized using IKEv2 with PSK-based authentication. </t>



  </section>

	<section title="Protocol Description">
	  <section title="Support for IKEv2 and Pre-Shared Secrets">
	    <t>When IKEv2 is used with PSK-based initiator authentication, 
the Diameter commands IKEv2-PSK-Request and IKEv2-PSK-Answer defined in this 
document are used to authorize the IKEv2 Peer for the services.  Upon 
receiving the IKE_AUTH message from the IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2 Server uses the 
information received in IDi to determine if it has the PSK for this IKEv2 Peer. 
If there is no PSK found associated with this IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2 Server 
MUST send an Authorize-Only (Auth-Request-Type set to “Authorize-Only”) 
Diameter IKEv2-PSK message with the IKEv2 Peer’s IDi payload to the HAAA to 
obtain the PSK. The IDi payload extracted from the IKE_AUTH message has to 
contain an identity that is meaningful for the Diameter infrastructure, such 
as a Network Access Identifier (NAI), since it is used by the IKEv2 Server to 
populate the User-Name AVP in the Diameter message. The IKEv2 Server also 
includes in the IKEv2-Nonces AVP of the same Diameter message the 
initiator and responder nonces (Ni and Nr) exchanged during initial IKEv2 
exchange.  </t>

 <t>This message is routed to the IKEv2 Peer’s HAAA. Upon receiving Diameter 
IKEv2-PSK message from the IKEv2 Server, the HAAA shall use the User-Name 
AVP to retrieve the associated keying material. The HAAA SHALL use the 
nonces Ni and Nr received in IKEv2-Nonces AVP to generate the PSK. 
   It is outside of scope of this document how the 
HAAA obtains or generates the PSK. For example, if the HAAA previously 
performed EAP based access authentication and authorization of the IKEv2 Peer, 
it can use the available EMSK to generate the PSK <xref target="RFC5295"/>.  The HAAA returns the PSK 
to the IKEv2 Server using the Master-Security-Association AVP. </t>

 <t>Once the IKEv2 Server receives the PSK from the HAAA, the IKEv2 Server 
verifies the IKE_AUTH message received from the IKEv2 Peer. If the 
verification of AUTH is successful, the IKEv2 Server sends the IKE message 
back to the IKEv2 Peer. </t>
	  </section>
	

	  <section title="Session Management">
<t>The HAAA may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is indicated by 
presence or absence of the Auth-Session-State AVP.  The IKEv2 Server MUST 
support the Authorization Session State Machine defined in <xref target="RFC3588"/>.</t>

<t>This specification makes an assumption that each IKE_SA created between the 
IKEv2 Peer and the IKEv2 Server as a result of a successful IKEv2 negotiation 
exchange together with CHILD_SAs set up through that particular IKE_SA 
correspond to one currently active PSK and one active Diameter session. </t>
	
<section title="Session-Termination-Request/Answer">
<t>In the case where session tracking is being used, when the IKEv2 Server 
terminates the SA it SHALL send a Session-Termination-Request (STR) message 
<xref target="RFC3588"/> to inform the HAAA that the authorized session has been 
terminated.</t> 

<t>The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the 
HAAA to acknowledge the notification that the session has been terminated.</t>
	</section>
	<section title="AbortSession-Request/Answer">
<t>The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message <xref target="RFC3588"/> is sent by the HAAA to 
the IKEv2 Server to terminate the authorized session.  When the IKEv2 Server 
receives the ASR message, it MUST delete the corresponding IKE_SA and all 
CHILD_SAs set up through it.  </t>
<t>The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message <xref target="RFC3588"/> is sent by the IKEv2 Server 
in response to an ASR message.</t>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
        

<t>Any authentication and key agreement protocol with pre-shared keys between 
an end-user client and AAA infrastructure relies on the assumption that the 
client and network can mutually authenticate each other. In context of, for 
example, 3GPP networks, the HAAA sharing a PSK with the IKEv2 Server is similar 
to the HSS sharing an authentication vector with the SGSN or MME in AKA based 
mutual authentication protocols.  </t>

 <t> The basic security assumptions in sharing the PSK are based on the 
following standard considerations.
<list style="symbols">
 <t> The security tunnel between the HAAA and the IKEv2 Server is typically 
a mutually authenticated tunnel, with ciphering and integrity protection for 
every packet. The existence of such tunnels ensures that on-going trust and 
security are enforced, and in particular the HAAA can guarantee that the 
IKEv2 Server is not misbehaving. </t>
 <t> The protocol under discussion relies on the fact an IKEv2 Peer has 
successfully authenticated with the system and has, for example, an EMSK 
stored in the HAAA. The fact that the PSK is derived from the EMSK proves 
to the HAAA of the existence of an authenticated and active IKEv2 Peer. </t>
 <t>If the HAAA is to treat an IKEv2 Server as adversarial, then we claim 
that under no circumstances can an IKEv2 Peer communicate with that IKEv2 
Server. Recall that any authentication and key agreement protocol with 
pre-shared keys between an end-user client and AAA infrastructure relies 
on the assumption that the client and network can mutually authenticate 
each other, and furthermore the client trusts the network elements that 
the AAA communicates with and delegates post authentication security 
parameters to be legitimate. If the HAAA is to treat the IKEv2 Server 
as adversarial, then the trust assumption is no longer valid. This in 
turn implies that the IKEv2 Peer is no longer guaranteed that the 
network elements it is communicating with are trusted. </t>

 <t>Hence the following two assumptions are critical to ensure 
secure communications:
<list style="symbols">
<t> The HAAA server and the IKEv2 Server share a trust relationship; 
for instance, may be owned and managed by the same network operator. </t>
<t>Moreover, transfer of keys between the HAAA and the IKEv2 Server 
rely on an existing security association between the above network 
elements.</t>

<t> In addition, the security considerations of the Diameter Base 
protocol <xref target="RFC3588"/> are applicable to this document. </t>
