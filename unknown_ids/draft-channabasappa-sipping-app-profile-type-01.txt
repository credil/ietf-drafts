Internet-Draft          Application Profile Type           November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The SIP [RFC3261] User Agent profile delivery framework
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] describes how a User Agent (UA)
   can retrieve its data using a variety of protocols.  The framework
   also defines a SIP event package (ua-profile) for profile delivery,
   and notification of profile changes.  The ua-profile event package
   contains a parameter identified by 'profile-type' that can be used to
   request data specific to certain type of profiles.  This document
   extends the profile-type parameter to support an additional profile
   type, termed 'application'.  The 'application' profile type is used
   for delivery and change notification of profile content for the
   user's applications.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the SIP terminology defined in [RFC3261]
   and [RFC3265], and specifies the usage of the following terms.



3.  Profile Type Definition

   This document specifies a new profile type for use with the SIP UA
   configuration framework.  The name of the profile type is
   'application'.  It is to be used in deployments where SIP UAs are
   provided with application specific configuration.  This document also
   defines an additional event header parameter for use with the
   application profile type.

3.1.  Parameter 'appids'

   The "appids" parameter describes the application profile being
   requested.  Its value is an identifier unique to the application, and
   defined by the application specification, along with the profile
   content.  This parameter value SHOULD be provided in the SUBSCRIBE
   request, along with the other three parameters (vendor, model and
   version) specified in [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework], only for
   the 'application' profile-type.  This parameter is useful to the PDS
   to affect the profile provided.

Internet-Draft          Application Profile Type           November 2007


   COMMENT:  The namespace for application identifiers must be defined
      in order to ensure uniqueness.  A likely choice is to make the
      appids value be a URN.  Examples in this document do not reflect
      likely application identifiers.

   The "appids" parameter describes the specific application, or the
   list of applications, for which the user agent desires a profile
   subscription.

   In the following ABNF defining the syntax, EQUAL and quoted-string
   are defined in [RFC3261]

      appids            = "appids=" list-of-app-ids
      list-of-app-ids   = DQUOTE app-id *("," app-id) DQUOTE
      app-id            = 1*(subset-print-chars)
      subset-print-chars= %x21 /%x23-25 / %x27-29 / %x2D-3C / %x3E-7E
                          ;All printable characters except ", =, &, *, +
                          ;comma or white-space characters.

          Note: Need to validate the above ABNF.


   The "appids" parameter may appear in the Event header of the NOTIFY
   request to specify the actual application the NOTIFY belongs to.  In
   the initial NOTIFY following a SUBSCRIBE, the appids parameter SHOULD
   list all applications obtained in the subscription, which may be a
   subset of the applications listed in the SUBSCRIBE.  The only case in
   which the "appids" parameter MAY be omitted from the initial NOTIFY
   is when only one application was listed in the SUBSCRIBE.  If the
   SUBSCRIBE included an "appids" parameter, the "appids" parameter of
   the initial NOTIFY MUST NOT list applications not present in the
   SUBSCRIBE.  If the parameter contains a list of applications, the
   order in the appids parameter MUST be the same as followed in the
   body (see below).  Subsequent NOTIFY requests on a single application
   subscription MAY omit the "appids", since the application context is
   implied by the subscription dialog.

3.2.  Summary of Event Header

   The following are example Event headers which may occur in SUBSCRIBE
   requests.  The examples are not intended to show complete SUBSCRIBE
   requests.

   Event: ua-profile;profile-type=application;
          vendor="vendor.example.com";model="Z100";version="1.2.3"

   Event: ua-profile;profile-type=application;
          vendor="vendor.example.com";model="Z100";version="1.2.3";
          appids="myapplication"

   Event: ua-profile;profile-type=application;
          vendor="vendor.example.com";model="Z100";version="1.2.3";
          appids="myapplication1","myapplication2","myapplication3"


   The following are example Event headers which may occur in NOTIFY
   requests.  These example headers are not intended to be complete
   NOTIFY requests.

   Event: ua-profile;profile-type=application

   Event: ua-profile;profile-type=application;appids="myapplication1"

   Event: ua-profile;profile-type=application;
          appids="myapplication2","myapplication3"



   The table shows the use of Event header parameters in SUBSCRIBE
   requests for the application profile type:

      profile-type || application
      ===========================
      appids        ||     o

      m - mandatory
      s - SHOULD be provided
      o - optional

   for the application profile type:

      appids        ||     o

3.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   This draft defines an enhancement to
   the[I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] by specifying a use for the
   SUBSCRIBE request body.  If the appids parameter contained a list of
   applications, the body of the SUBSCRIBE SHOULD include appropriate
   bodies for each of the applications for which the user-agent is
   subscribing, in the same order in which they are listed in the appids
   parameter.  If present in the SUBSCRIBE request, the body SHALL be
   used by the each of the application specific PDSs to tailor the
   NOTIFY responses to the subscribing UA for each of the applications
   listed.

3.4.  NOTIFY Bodies

   The NOTIFY message body contains a content type specific to the
   requested application (this type must be listed in the Accept header
   of the SUBSCRIBE).  If the subscription is for multiple applications,
   the initial NOTIFY message body will contain a "multipart/mixed"
   content-type, and the ordering of the body-parts corresponds to the
   ordering of the "appids" application values.
   COMMENT:  An alternative to multipart/mixed content is to require all
      applications supporting multi-application subscription to conform
      to a common XML container schema, which in turn contains the
      application-specific profile content, or content-indirection
      information.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There is one consideration associated with this document.
   Specifically it registers a new profile type as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework].


            Profile Type                          Reference
            --------------                         ---------
            application                            [RFCXXXX]


            CONTACT:
            -------
            sumanth@cablelabs.com


   Note to RFC editor: Please replace RFCXXXX with the RFC number
   assigned to this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document is an extension to the SIP Configuration Framework and
   as such inherits the security considerations for profile delivery as
   listed in [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework].  In addition, the
   presence of application ids in the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY bodies plays
   an important role in how the profile data is received by the client.
   A man-in-the-middle who manipulates the application ids can
   effectively cause a disruption in application profile data delivery.
   (Editor's note: Need to add more security considerations, e.g., when
   is the presence of an app-id a threat.)

   Broadsoft and Paul Kyzivat from Cisco.
