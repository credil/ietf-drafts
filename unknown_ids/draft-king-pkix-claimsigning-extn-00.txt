Abstract

   This memo specifies an Extended Key Usage (EKU) X.509 certificate
   extension which indicates that the certificate holder is authorized
   to sign security tokens to assert claims, or attributes, about a
   principal.

   When an owner of a certificate that asserts the claimSigning EKU
   signs a claim, the owner is asserting that a statement about the
   principal is true. For example, a IdP secure token service (STS)
   would use an X.509 certificate containing the claimSigning EKU to
   sign SAML assertions containing an identifier and attributes about a
   user.

INTERNET DRAFT      claimSigning Extended Key Usage       April 14, 2011


1  Introduction

   A Claim Signer is software or a service that packages and digitally
   signs statements about particular subjects (i.e., claims) in the form
   of security tokens.  The Claim Signer conveys that it is certified to
   issue claims by using a certificate that asserts the claimSigning 
   Extended Key Usage (EKU) X.509 certificate extension.  Claim Signing
   services are used in a number of applications.  Examples of these
   services include Backend Attribute Exchange (BAE), Metadata signing,
   and SAML and other assertion protocols.

   This memo documents an extended key usage (EKU) X.509 certificate
   extension [PROFILE] for specifying the applicability of a certificate
   to be used with a Claim Signing service.  As such, in addition to
   providing rules for processing certificates that assert the
   claimSigning EKU Object Identifier (OID), this memo also provides
   guidance to issuers of certificates for use with Claim Signing.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

   Additionally, the following terms are defined:

   A Claim is a statement about a particular subject. Statements may
   include values that represent identity, attributes, keys, or other
   identifiers that are related to a particular subject. 

   A Signed Claim is a digitally signed claim about a particular subject
   where the signer is indicating the veracity of the claim.

   A Claim Signer is software or a service that packages and digitally
   signs claims in the form of security tokens.  The claim signer
   conveys the veracity of signed claims by using a certificate that
   asserts the claimSigning EKU.


2.  Abstract Syntax Notation

   All X.509 certificate [X.509] extensions are defined using ASN.1
   [X.680, X.690].

3.  claimSigning Extended Key Usage Value

   RFC 5280 [PROFILE] specifies the extended key usage (EKU) X.509
   certificate extension.  The EKU extension indicates one or more
   purposes for which the certificate may be used.  The EKU extension
   can be used in conjunction with the key usage extension, which
   indicates the intended purpose of the certified public key. The EKU
   extension syntax is repeated here for convenience:


        ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) of KeyPurposeID

        KeyPurposeID ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER


   This specification defines one KeyPurposeID value for use in
   transactions where Claim Signing is required. Inclusion of the Claim
   Signing value in the EKU indicates that the certificate is
   appropriate for use by an entity who intends to assert the veracity
   of a signed claim. 

         id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=         { iso(1) identified-
   organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)           security(5)
   mechanisms(5) pkix(7) 3 }

         id-kp-claimSigning  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp TBD }

   The EKU extension MAY, at the option of the certificate issuer, be
   either critical or non-critical.

   Certificate-using applications MAY require the EKU extension to be
   present in a certificate, and they MAY require a particular
   KeyPurposeId value to be present (such as id-kp-claimSigning) within
   the EKU extension.  If multiple KeyPurposeId values are included, the
   certificate-using application need not recognize all of them, as long
   as the required KeyPurposeId value is present.

   If a certificate contains a key usage extension, the certificate MUST
   only be used for a purpose consistent with the extension.  If there
   is no purpose consistent with the extension, then the certificate-
   using application MUST NOT use the certificate for any purpose.

4.  Using the claimSinging EKU in a Certificate

   In order to determine whether the usage of a certificate is
   restricted to serve as a claimSigning certificate only,
   implementations MUST perform the steps given below as a part of the
   certificate validation:

   The implementation MUST examine the Extended Key Usage value(s):


      If the certificate does not contain any EKU values (i.e., the 
      Extended Key Usage extension does not exist), it is a matter of
      local policy whether or not to accept the certificate for use as a
      claimSigning certificate.  Note that since certificates that do
      not follow this specification will not have the id-kp-claimSigning
      EKU value local policies might accept certificates for use as a
      claimSigning certificate to improve interoperability. 

      If the certificate contains the id-kp-claimSigning EKU value, then
      implementations of this specification MUST consider the
      certificate acceptable for use as a claimSigning certificate.

      If the certificate does not contain the id-kp-claimSigning EKU
      value, but does contain the id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU value,
      it is a matter of local policy whether or not to consider the
      certificate acceptable for use as a claimSigning certificate.

      If the EKU extension exists, but does not contain any of the id-
      kp-claimSigning or id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU values, then the
      certificate MUST NOT be accepted as valid for use as a
      claimSigning certificate.


5.  Implications for a Certification Authority

      The procedures and practices employed by a certification authority
      MUST ensure that the certificate requestor is authorized to sign
      claims within a particular community of interest before populating
      the certificate with the id-kp-claimSigning EKU value. 

6.  Security Considerations

      This memo defines an EKU X.509 certificate extension that
      restricts the usage of a certificate to a Claim Signing service. 
      The procedures and practices employed by the certification
      authority (CA) MUST ensure that the correct values for the EKU are
      inserted in each certificate that is issued. Relying parties may
      accept or reject a particular certificate for an intended use

      based on the information provided in the extension.  Incorrect
      representation of the information in the extension could cause the
      relying party to reject an otherwise appropriate certificate or
      accept a certificate that ought to be rejected.


7.  IANA Considerations

      Certificate extended key usage values are identified by object
      identifiers (OIDs).  The OIDs used in this document were assigned
      from an arc delegated by the IANA.  No further action by the IANA
      is necessary for this document or any anticipated updates
      [RFC5513].
