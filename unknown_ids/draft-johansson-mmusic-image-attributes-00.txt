Abstract

   This draft proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make it
   possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image size.
   A possible use case is to make it possible for a e.g a low-end hand-
   held terminal to display video without the need to resample the
   image, something that may consume large amounts of memory and
   processing power.

Internet-Draft           Image attributes in SDP                May 2008


1.  Introduction

   This draft proposes a new attribute to make it possible to negotiate
   different image attributes such as image size.  The term image size
   is defined here as it may differ from the physical screen size of e.g
   a hand-held terminal.  For instance it may be beneficial to display a
   video image on a part of the physical screen and leave space on the
   screen for e.g menus and other info.

   There are a number of benefits with a possibility to negotiate the
   image size:

   o  Possible for a e.g a low-end hand-held device to display video
      without the need to resample the image size

   o  The device will know the size of the image and can then allocate
      memory accordingly

   Several of the existing standards (see [RFC4587], [RFC4629] and
   [RFC3984]) has support for enabling the receiver to ask for different
   resolutions at different framerates.  The purpose of this memo is to
   provide for a generic mechanism and is targeted at the image size.


2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  Defintion of attribute

   A new "imageattr" attribute is defined.  The imageattr attribute
   contains a set of different image-resolution options that the offerer
   can provide.  The receiver can then select the desired image size and
   has then the ability to avoid costly transform (e.g resampling) of
   the images.  In this approach only the image resolution and
   optionally the framerate is handled but the framework makes it
   possible to extend with other image related attributes that makes
   sense.

   The syntax for the imageattr attribute is:

      a=imageattr:<PT> 1*WSP <orientation> 1*WSP <proto-list>
      <orientation> can have the values landscape or portrait
      <PT> is the payload type number
      proto-list = proto *(1*WSP proto) ; defined in RFC 4566

Internet-Draft           Image attributes in SDP                May 2008


   The proto field is defined by

      proto=[<fr=range,>x=range,y=range]
      fr is the framerate range for the given set (optional).
      x is the horizontal image size range
      y is the vertical image size range

      range is (in matlab or octave syntax) given by
      range=value
       or
      range=value:value
       or
      range=value:step:value
      value is a positive integer value
      step is a positive or negative integer value.
       If step is left out in the syntax a stepsize of 1 is implied.

   The imageattr attribute is bound to a specific media by means of the
   payload type number.  Several imageattr can be defined e.g for
   different video codec alternatives conditioned that the payload type
   number differs.

   The imageattr definitions has different preferences such that the
   leftmost (first) proto field has the highest preference.

   The landscape and portait definitions are used to reduce the number
   of odd image size options.  In landscape only entries where x>=y are
   valid.  In portrait only entries where y>=x are valid.

   The offerer MUST be able to support the image attributes that it
   offers.  The receiver MAY accept the imageattr but is not required to
   do so.  The receiver MUST only include a valid entry taken from the
   offer in the SDP answer.

3.1.  SDPCapNeg

   For use with the SDP capability negotiation framework (SDPCapNeg) an
   extra attribute "imcap" is defined with the syntax:

      a=imcap:<tag> 1*WSP <orientation> 1*WSP <proto-list>
      <orientation> can have the values landscape or portrait
      <tag> is a number from 1 to 1^32-1 both included.
      proto-list = proto *(1*WSP proto) ; defined in RFC 4566

   The proto field is defined as earlier in this text.

   The imcap attributes are referenced with the parameter "im" in the
   pcfg and acfg lines.  Several imcap may be referenced in the

Internet-Draft           Image attributes in SDP                May 2008


   potential configurations.

   The ability to support the imcap attribute MUST be specified with the
   "im-v0" identifier on the a=ccap line or using the "+" option on the
   pcfg line and optionally also on the a=csup line.


4.  Examples

   A few examples to highlight the syntax

4.1.  Example 1

      a=imageattr:97 landscape [x=800,y=640] [x=480,y=320]

   Two image resolution alternatives (landscape) are offered with
   800x600 having the highest preference

4.2.  Example 2

      a=imageattr:97 landscape [fr=[5:15],x=800,y=640] /
           [fr=[15:30],x=480,y=320]

   Two image resolution alternatives (landscape) with different
   framerates are offered with 800x600 having the highest preference.

4.3.  Example 3

      a=imageattr:98 landscape [x=800:-16:480,y=640:-16:320] /
           [x=208:-8:176,y=176:-8:144]

   Two image resolution ranges (landscape) are offered with 800x600
   having the highest preference.  The x-axis resolution can take the
   values 800 down to 480 in 16 pixels steps and 208 down to 176 in 8
   pixels steps.  Because of the 'landscape' definition only x and y
   combinations where x>=y are valid.

4.4.  Example 4 (offer/answer)

   Given the offer from example 2 above

      a=imageattr:98 landscape [x=800:-16:480,y=640:-16:320] /
           [x=208:-8:176,y=176:-8:144]

   An answer to this offer may look like

      a=imageattr:98 landscape [x=192,y=160]




Johansson               Expires November 21, 2008               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           Image attributes in SDP                May 2008


   Indicating that the answerer wish to render the video through a
   rectangular 192x160 block (image).

4.5.  Example 5 (SDPCapNeg offer/answer)

   An offer using the SDPCapNeg formulation may look like

      m=video ....
      a=ccap:med-v0,im-v0
      m=mcap:1 H_264
      a=imcap:1 landscape [x=800:-16:480,y=640:-16:320] /
           [x=208:-8:176,y=176:-8:144]
      a=pcfg t=.. a=.. m=.. im=1 pt=1:97

   The SDP answer may then look like

      m=video ....
      a=csup:med-v0,im-v0
      a=imageattr:97 landscape [x=192,y=160]
      a=acfg t=.. a=.. m=.. im=1 pt=1:97

   Note the inclusion of the "clear text" imageattr in the answer that
   gives the desired image size.


5.  Issues

   Here is listed a few possible issues connected to the use of the
   imageattr SDP attribute :

   o  Conflict with sprop-parameter-set: H.264 defines the sprop-
      parameter-set which may define features as defined in this draft.
      To avoid conflicts sessions that use the imageattr attribute MUST
      not specify similar features in sprop-parameter-set.

   o  Image scaling on encoder side: e.g the H.264 codec is not mandated
      to rescale the video to fit a preferred receiver image size.  If
      this is the case then a possible solution is that only a part of
      the input, corresponding to the preferred size, is encoded.
      Preferably this part is also displayed on the sender display as
      well to avoid that the important parts drop out of the image.

   o  Odd resolution combinations: Given the format of the offered
      resolution there is a chance that the receiver may ask for an odd
      resolution like 800x176.  These scenarios are however less likely
      and can also be avoided by specifying several ranges.
