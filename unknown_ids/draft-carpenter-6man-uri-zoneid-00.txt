Internet-Draft             IPv6 Zone ID in URI             December 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3986] defined how a literal IPv6 address can be represented in
   the "host" part of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
   Subsequently, [RFC4007] extended the text representation of limited-
   scope IPv6 addresses such that a zone identifier may be concatenated
   to an address, for purposes described in that RFC.  Zone identifiers
   are especially useful in contexts where literal addresses are
   typically used, for example during fault diagnosis, when it may be
   essential to specify which interface is used for sending to a link
   local address.  It should be noted that zone identifiers have purely
   local meaning within the host where they are defined, and they are
   completely meaningless for any other host.

   RFC 4007 does not specify how zone identifiers are to be represented
   in URIs.  Practical experience has shown that this feature is useful,
   in particular when using a web browser for debugging with link local
   addresses, but as it is undefined, it is not implemented consistently
   in URI parsers or in browsers.

   This document updates [RFC3986] by adding syntax to allow a zone
   identifier to be included in a literal IPv6 address.  It also
   clarifies some statements in [RFC4007].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Specification

   According to RFC 4007, a zone identifier is attached to the textual
   representation of an IPv6 address by concatenating "%" followed by
   <zone_id>, where <zone_id> is a string identifying the zone of the
   address.  However, RFC 4007 gives no precise definition of the
   character set allowed in <zone_id>.  There are no rules or de facto
   standards for this.  For example, the first Ethernet interface in a
   host might be called %0, %1, %en1, %eth0, or whatever the implementer
   happened to choose.

   In a URI, a literal IPv6 address is always embedded between "[" and
   "]".  This document specifies that <zone_id> may contain any ASCII
   character classified in RFC 3986 as "unreserved", which conveniently
   excludes "]" in order to simplify parsing.

   There is an additional complication in that "%" is always treated as
   an escape character in a URI, and according to RFC 3986 it must
   therefore itself be escaped in a URI, in the form "%25".  Thus, the

   scoped address fe80::a%en1 would appear in a produced URI as
   http://[fe80::a%25en1].

   In RFC 3986, the IPv6 literal format is formally defined in ABNF
   [RFC5234] by the following rule:

      IP-literal = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"

   To provide support for a zone identifier, firstly a new rule is
   added:

       ZoneID = 1*15unreserved

   Then two options are possible (to be discussed).

   OPTION 1:

   The existing syntax of IPv6address is extended by adding a specific
   option for the case of link-local addresses.  The following
   definition of IPv6address replaces that given in RFC 3986:

      IPv6address =  6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
                   / "fe80::" [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "%" ZoneID

   OPTION 2:

   The existing syntax of IPv6address is retained, and a zone identifier
   may be added optionally to any literal address.  This allows
   flexibility for unknown future uses.  The rule quoted above from RFC
   3986 is replaced by two rules:

      IP-literal = "[" ( IPv6addrz / IPvFuture  ) "]"

      IPv6addrz = IPv6address [ "%" ZoneID ]

   The rules in [RFC5952] SHOULD be applied in producing URIs, and the
   user MUST replace "%" by "%25" when manually constructing such a URI.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3986] and [RFC4007] apply.  In
   particular, this URI format creates a specific pathway by which a
   deceitful zone index might be communicated, as mentioned in the final
   security consideration of RFC 4007.  It is emphasised that the format
   is intended only for debugging purposes, but of course this intention
   does not prevent misuse.

   IF OPTION 2 IS CHOSEN:

   To limit this risk, implementations SHOULD NOT allow use of the
   format except for link local addresses under prefix fe80::/10.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no action by IANA.
