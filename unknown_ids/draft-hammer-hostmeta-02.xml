    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Web-based protocols often require the discovery of host policy or metadata, where host is
        not a single resource but the collection of resources identified by URIs with a common
        scheme and authority as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"/>. While these protocols have a
        wide range of metadata needs, they often define metadata that is concise, has simple syntax
        requirements, and can benefit from sharing its metadata store with other related protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because there is no URI or a resource available to describe a host, many of the methods
        used for associating per-resource metadata (such as HTTP headers) are not available. This
        often leads to the usage of the root HTTP resource as a placeholder for host metadata that
        is not specific to the root resource, and often has nothing to do it.
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo registers the "well-known" URI suffix 'host-meta' in the Well-Known URI Registry
        established by <xref target="I-D.nottingham-site-meta" />, and specifies a simple,
        general-purpose metadata document for hosts, to be used by multiple Web-based protocols.
        The name 'host-meta' was chosen based on the HTTP 'Host' header defined by <xref target="RFC2616"/>.

      <section title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
          "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <xref target="RFC2119" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification uses the namespace prefix "host-meta:" for the extension Namespace URI
          identified in <xref target="ns" />.  Note that the choice of namespace prefix is arbitrary
          and not semantically significant. Element names without a namespace prefix belong to the
          XRD 1.0 XML namespace identified in <xref target="ns" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC5234" />.
          Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref target="RFC3986" />: reserved,
          unreserved, authority, and scheme.
        </t>
      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Metadata Scope">
      <t>
        The scope of each host-meta document is defined by one or more scheme-authority pairs, each
        applies to the collection of resources identified by URIs with the same scheme and authority
        as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"/>. The scope MUST be expressed explicitly within the
        document by using the one or more <xref target="Scope element">'host-meta:Scope' elements</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The host-meta scope does not apply to a subset, nor does it apply to other combinations of
        scheme and authority (e.g., using another scheme, port, or a different hostname in the same
        domain) not explicitly declared. For example, resources with URIs beginning with
        'http://example.com/', 'http://example.com:8080/', 'https://example.com/', and
        'http://www.example.com/' all have different and non-overlapping scopes.
      </t>
      <t>
        The scope declared within the host-meta document MUST match the scheme and authority used
        to <xref target="obtain">obtain</xref> the document. However, protocols MAY use a different
        scheme to obtain the document than the one they are interested in, as long as both scheme
        and authority combinations are declared. For example, a protocol can use HTTP to obtain
        metadata about a scheme other than 'http' for which a host-meta document cannot be obtained
        using the method described in <xref target="obtain" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        Protocols MAY place additional requirements on protocol-specific metadata retrieved from
        multiple host-meta documents. For example, protocols can require that protocol-specific
        metadata obtained for the 'example.com:80' authority to be the same in both host-meta
        documents for the 'http' and 'https' schemes.
      </t>
      <t>
        Any changes in scope, the retrieval of metadata for one scheme using another, and other
        requirements should only occur after a careful consideration of their security implications
        and authoritativeness.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="The host-meta Document Format">
      <t>
        The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 document format as defined by
        <xref target="OASIS.XRD-1.0" />, which provides a simple and extensible XML-based format
        for describing resources. Since the host-meta XRD document does not describe a single
        resource but a collection of resources, this memo defines additional XRD elements and
        processing rules. The XRD elements not mentioned in this memo are allowed and used as
        defined in <xref target="OASIS.XRD-1.0" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        host-meta document SHOULD NOT include the 'Subject' or 'Alias' XRD elements since these
        elements require a valid URI to identify the resource being described, which is not
        available for the host-meta scope. The use of these elements in host-meta is undefined.
        Instead, host-meta defines the <xref target="Scope element">'host-meta:Scope' element</xref> for
        declaring document scope.
      </t>
      <t>
        The subject (or "context resource" as defined by <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header" />)
        of the XRD 'Type' and 'Link' elements is the entire collection of resources included in the
        document scope, with the exception of 'Link' elements with a 'URITemplate' child element as
        defined in <xref target="Link element" />.
      </t>

      <section title="The 'host-meta:Scope' Element" anchor="Scope element">
        <t>
          The 'host-meta:Scope" element is used to declare the scope of the host-meta document and
          is defined as a child element of the root 'XRD' element. The parent 'XRD' element MUST
          include one but MAY include more 'host-meta:Scope' elements (order does not matter).
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            The element value syntax ABNF:
          </preamble>
          <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    Scope  =  scheme "://" authority
  ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          If the authority component does not include a port number, the port is implicitly set to
          the default port number for the given scheme, and does not include any other port number.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, these two scope declarations are equivalent:
          </preamble>
          <artwork>
            <![CDATA[
        <host-meta:Scope>http://example.com</host-meta:Scope>
        <host-meta:Scope>http://example.com:80</host-meta:Scope>
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section title="The 'Link' Element" anchor="Link element">
        <t>
          The XRD 'Link' element, when used with the 'URI' child element, conveys a link relation
          between the collection of resources included in the host-meta document scope and a common
          target URI.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the following link declares a common author for the entire scope:
          </preamble>
          <artwork  xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    <Link>
        <Rel>author</Rel>
        <URI>http://example.com/author</URI>
    </Link>
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          However, there are cases in which individual resources within the same scope do not share
          the same target URI, but follow a common pattern in how the target URI is constructed. A
          'Link' element with a 'URITemplate' child element conveys relations whose context are
          individual resources within the host-meta document scope, and whose target is constructed
          by applying the context URI to a template.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, a blog with multiple authors can provide information about each article's
            author by appending a suffix (such as ';by') to the URI of each article. Each article
            has a unique author, but all share the same pattern of where that information is located:
          </preamble>
          <artwork  xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    <Link>
        <Rel>author</Rel>
        <URITemplate>{+uri};by</URITemplate>
    </Link>
  ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <section title="Template Syntax" anchor="template_syntax">
          <t>
            host-meta defines a simple template syntax and a vocabulary for URI transformation. A
            template is a string containing brace-enclosed ("{}") variable names marking the parts
            of the string that are to be substituted by the corresponding variable values.
          </t>
          <t>
            Before substituting template variables, any value character other than reserved and
            unreserved (as defined by <xref target="RFC3986" />) MUST be percent-encoded per
            <xref target="RFC3986" />. If a variable name is not prefixed by a '+' character, any
            reserved character SHALL also be percent-encoded.
          </t>
          <t>
            To construct a URI using a template, the context URI is parsed into its URI components
            and each component value assigned to a variable name. The variable set is based on the
            URI vocabulary defined by <xref target="RFC3986" /> section 3 and includes: 'scheme',
            'authority', 'path', 'query', 'fragment', 'userinfo', 'host', and 'port'. In addition,
            this memo defines the 'uri' variable as the entire context URI excluding the fragment
            component and the '#' fragment separator.

    <section title="Obtaining host-meta Documents" anchor="obtain">
      <t>
        The host-meta document for a given scheme-authority pair is identified by a URI constructed
        using the desired scheme, authority, and '/.well-known/host-meta' as the URI path. For
        example, given the 'http' scheme and 'www.example.com:80' authority, the host-meta URI is:
      </t>
      <figure>
        <artwork  xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      http://www.example.com/.well-known/host-meta
  ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        The host-meta document is obtained by dereferencing the request host-meta URI. The
        semantics of the protocol used to obtain the host-meta document apply. Therefore, if the
        server indicates that the host-meta resource is located elsewhere (in HTTP, 3xx response
        status codes), the client MUST try to obtain the resource from the location provided. This
        means that the host-meta document for one authority MAY be retrieved from a different
        authority. Likewise, if the resource is not available or exists (in HTTP, the 404 or 410
        response status codes), the client SHOULD infer that metadata is not available via this
        mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        If a representation is successfully obtained, but is not in the format described above,
        clients SHOULD infer that the authority is using this URI for other purposes, and not
        process it as a host-meta document. To aid in this process, authorities using this
        mechanism SHOULD correctly label host-meta responses with the "application/xrd+xml" internet
        media type.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
        The metadata returned by the host-meta resource is presumed to be under the control of the
        appropriate authority and representative of all the resources described by it. If this
        resource is compromised or otherwise under the control of another party, it may represent a
        risk to the security of the server and data served by it, depending on what protocols use it.
      </t>
      <t>
        Scoping metadata to a single scheme-authority pair is the default host-meta scope. Protocols
        that change the scope without careful consideration can incur security risks.
