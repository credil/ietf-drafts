Internet-Draft       Security Efforts and Documents        February 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Internet is being recognized as a critical infrastructure similar
   in nature to the power grid and a potable water supply.  Just like
   those infrastructures, means are needed to provide resiliency and
   adaptability to the Internet so that it remains consistently
   available to the public throughout the world even during times of
   duress or attack.  For this reason, many SDOs are developing
   standards with hopes of retaining an acceptable level, or even
   improving this availability, to its users.  These SDO efforts usually
   define themselves as "security" efforts.  It is the opinion of the
   authors that there are many different definitions of the term
   "security" and it may be applied in many diverse ways.  As such, we
   offer no assurance that the term is applied consistently throughout
   this document.

   Many of these SDOs have diverse charters and goals and will take
   entirely different directions in their efforts to provide standards.
   However, even with that, there will be overlaps in their produced
   works.  If there are overlaps then there is a potential for conflicts
   and confusion.  This may result in:

      Vendors of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard
      to follow.

      Purchasers of networking equipment who are unsure of which
      standard will best apply to the needs of their business or
      ogranization.

      Network Administrators and Operators unsure of which standard to
      follow to attain the best security for their network.

   For these reasons, the authors wish to encourage all SDOs who have an
   interest in producing or in consuming standards relating to good
   security practices to be consistent in their approach and their
   recommendations.  In many cases, the authors are aware that the SDOs
   are making good efforts along these lines.  However, the authors do
   not participate in all SDO efforts and cannot know everything that is
   happening.

   The OpSec Working Group met at the 61st IETF and agreed that this
   document could be a useful reference in producing the documents
   described in the Working Group Charter.  The authors have agreed to
   keep this document current and request that those who read it will
   submit corrections or comments.

   Comments on this document may be addressed to the OpSec Working Group
   or directly to the authors.

2.  Format of this Document

   The body of this document has three sections.

   The first part of the body of this document, Section 3, contains a
   listing of online glossaries relating to networking and security.  It
   is very important that the definitions of words relating to security
   and security events be consistent.  Inconsistencies between the
   useage of words on standards is unacceptable as it would prevent a
   reader of two standards to appropriately relate their
   recommendations.  The authors of this document have not reviewed the
   definitions of the words in the listed glossaries so can offer no
   assurance of their alignment.

   The second part, Section 4, contains a listing of SDOs that appear to
   be working on security standards.

   The third part, Section 5, lists the documents which have been found
   to offer good practices or recommendations for securing networks and
   networking devices.

4.  Standards Developing Organizations

   This section of this document lists the SDOs, or organizations that
   appear to be developing security related standards.  These SDOs are
   listed in alphabetical order.

   Note: The authors would appreciate corrections and additions.  This
   note will be removed before publication as an RFC.

4.1.  3GPP - Third Generation Partnership Project

   http://www.3gpp.org/

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is a collaboration
   agreement formed in December 1998.  The collaboration agreement is
   comprised of several telecommunications standards bodies which are
   known as "Organizational Partners".  The current Organizational
   Partners involved with 3GPP are ARIB, CCSA, ETSI, ATIS, TTA, and TTC.

4.2.  3GPP2 - Third Generation Partnership Project 2

   http://www.3gpp2.org/

   The Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) is:

      a collaborative third generation (3G) telecommunications
      specifications-setting project

      comprising North American and Asian interests developing global
      specifications for ANSI/TIA/EIA-41 Cellular Radiotelecommunication
      Intersystem Operations network evolution to 3G

      and global specifications for the radio transmission technologies
      (RTTs) supported by ANSI/TIA/EIA-41.

   3GPP2 was born out of the International Telecommunication Union's
   (ITU) International Mobile Telecommunications "IMT-2000" initiative,
   covering high speed, broadband, and Internet Protocol (IP)-based
   mobile systems featuring network-to-network interconnection, feature/
   service transparency, global roaming and seamless services
   independent of location.  IMT-2000 is intended to bring high-quality
   mobile multimedia telecommunications to a worldwide mass market by
   achieving the goals of increasing the speed and ease of wireless
   communications, responding to the problems faced by the increased
   demand to pass data via telecommunications, and providing "anytime,
   anywhere" services.

4.3.  ANSI - The American National Standards Institute

   http://www.ansi.org/

   As the voice of the U.S. standards and conformity assessment system,
   the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) empowers its members
   and constituents to strengthen the U.S. marketplace position in the
   global economy while helping to assure the safety and health of
   consumers and the protection of the environment.

   The Institute oversees the creation, promulgation and use of
   thousands of norms and guidelines that directly impact businesses in
   nearly every sector: from acoustical devices to construction

4.20.  The World Wide Web Consortium

   http://www.w3.org/Consortium/

   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community
   where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work
   together to develop Web standards.  Led by Web inventor Tim Berners-
   Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its
   full potential.

   http://www.w3.org/Security/Activity

   The work in the W3C Security Activity currently comprises two Working
   Groups, the Web Security Context Working Group and the XML Security
   Working Group.

   The Web Security Context Working Group focuses on the challenges that
   arise when users encounter currently deployed security technology,
   such as TLS: While this technology achieves its goals on a technical
   level, attackers' strategies shift towards bypassing the security
   technology instead of breaking it.  When users do not understand the
   security context in which they operate, then it becomes easy to
   deceive and defraud them.  This Working Group is planning to see its
   main deliverable, the User Interface Guidelines, through to



Lonvick & Spak           Expires August 18, 2011               [Page 24]

   Recommendation, but will not engage in additional recommendation
   track work beyond this deliverable.  The Working Group is currently
   operating at reduced Team effort (compared to the initial effort
   reserved to this Working Group).  Initial (and informal)
   conversations about forming an Interest Group that could serve as a
   place for community-building and specification review have not led as
   far as we had hoped at the previous Advisory Committee Meeting, but
   are still on the Team's agenda.

   The XML Security Working Group started up in summer 2008, and has
   decided to publish an interim set of 1.1 specifications as it works
   towards producing a more radical change to XML Signature.  The XML
   Signature 1.1 and XML Encryption 1.1 specifications clarify and
   enhance the previous specifications without introducing breaking
   changes, although they do introduce new algorithms.

   In the telecommunications industry, this access incorporates
   operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning for network
   elements and various supporting systems and databases.  Members of
   the SRWG, from a cross-section of telecommunications carriers and
   vendors, developed an initial list of security requirements that
   would allow vendors, government departments and agencies, and service
   providers to implement a secure telecommunications network management
   infrastructure.  This initial list of security requirements was
   submitted as a contribution to Committee T1 - Telecommunications,
   Working Group T1M1.5 for consideration as a standard.  The
   requirements outlined in this document will allow vendors, government
   departments and agencies, and service providers to implement a secure
   telecommunications network management infrastructure.
