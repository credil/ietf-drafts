1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The [SORT] extension to the [IMAP] protocol provides a means for
   server-based sorting of messages.  It defines a set of sort criteria
   and the mechanism for determining the sort value of a message for
   each such ordering.

   The [SORT] extension's FROM ordering sorts messages lexically on the
   [IMAP] addr-part of the first mailbox in the From header.  Likewise,
   its TO ordering sorts on the [IMAP] addr-part of the first address in
   the message's To header.  This document provides two alternate
   orderings, DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO, which sort messages lexically
   based on the first From or To address's [RFC5322] display-name, when
   present.

   A server that supports the full [SORT] extension as well as the
   DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO sort criteria indicates this by returning
   "SORT=DISPLAY" in its CAPABILITY response.


3.  DISPLAY Sort Value for a Mailbox

   For the purposes of the sort keys defined in this document, the sort
   value for an [RFC5322] mailbox is defined as follows:

   o  If the mailbox contains an [RFC5322] display-name, replace each
      instance of [RFC5322] CFWS in the display-name with a single
      space, trim leading and trailing whitespace, and decode any
      quoted-strings and [RFC2047] encoded-words.  If the resulting
      string is not the empty string, use it as the sort value for the
      mailbox.

   o  Otherwise, completely remove all [RFC5322] FWS and CFWS from the
      mailbox's [RFC5322] addr-spec and use the resulting string as the
      mailbox's sort value.


4.  The DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO Sort Keys

   This document introduces two new [SORT] sort-keys, DISPLAYFROM and
   DISPLAYTO.

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Display-based Address Sorting    September 2009


   A message's sort value under the DISPLAYFROM ordering MUST be derived
   as follows:

   o  If the message's From header is absent or if the header contains
      no [RFC5322] mailboxes, the message's sort value is the empty
      string.

   o  Otherwise, the message's sort value is the DISPLAY sort value of
      the first mailbox in its From header.

   A message's sort value under the DISPLAYTO ordering MUST be derived
   as follows:

   o  If the message's To header is absent or if the header contains no
      [RFC5322] addresses, the message's sort value is the empty string.

   o  If the first address in the message's To header is an [RFC5322]
      group, the message's sort value is the group's display-name.

   o  Otherwise, the message's sort value is the DISPLAY sort value of
      the first [RFC5322] mailbox in its To header.


5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC4234].  [IMAP] defines the
   non-terminal "capability" and [SORT] defines "sort-key".

capability    =/ "SORT=DISPLAY"

sort-key      =/ "DISPLAYFROM" | "DISPLAYTO"


6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an additional IMAP4 capability.  As such, it
   does not change the underlying security considerations of [IMAP].
   The author believes that no new security issues are introduced with
   this additional IMAP4 capability.


7.  Internationalization Considerations

   DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO are string-based sort criteria.  As stated
   in [SORT], the collations mandated by I18NLEVEL=1 or I18NLEVEL=2 from
   [RFC5255] MUST be followed when sorting such strings.

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Display-based Address Sorting    September 2009


   The DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO orderings sort on the full decoded
   [RFC5322] display-name, when present.  They do not attempt to parse
   this string in a locale- or language-dependent manner in order to
   determine and sort on some semantically meaningful substring such as
   the surname.


8.  IANA Considerations

   [IMAP] capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG-approved experimental RFC.  This document constitutes
   registration of the SORT=DISPLAY capability in the [IMAP]
   capabilities registry.
