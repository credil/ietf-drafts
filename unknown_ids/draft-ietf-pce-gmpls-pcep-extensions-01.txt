Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2010


1.  Introduction

   PCEP RFCs [RFC5440], [RFC5521], [RFC5541], [RFC5520] are focused on
   path computation requests in MPLS networks.  [RFC4655] defines the
   PCE framework also for GMPLS networks.  This document complements
   these RFCs by providing some consideration of GMPLS applications and
   routing requests, for example for OTN and WSON networks.

   The requirements on PCE extensions to support those characteristics
   are described in [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-wson-routing-wavelength].

1.2.  PCEP requirements for GMPLS

   This section provides a set of PCEP requirements to support GMPLS
   LSPs and assure signal compatibility in the path.  When requesting a
   path computation (PCReq) to PCE, the PCC should be able to indicate,
   according to [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] and to RSVP procedures like
   explicit label control (ELC), the following additional attributes:

      (1) Switching capability: for instance PSC1-4, L2SC, TDM, LSC, FSC

      (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g.,
      Ethernet, SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc.

      (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that
      constitutes the requested LSP.  A lot of signal types with
      different granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709
      ODUk, such as VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, ODU2
      and ODU3 in G.709 ODUk [RFC4606], [RFC4328] and other signal types
      like the one defined in [I-D.ceccarelli-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-g709] or
      [I-D.zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709] .

      (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 OTN networks, two
      kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous concatenation
      which requires co-route for each member signal and requires all
      the interfaces along the path to support this capability, and
      virtual concatenation which allows diverse routes for the member
      signals and only requires the ingress and egress interfaces to
      support this capability.  Note that for the virtual concatenation,
      it also may specify co-routed or separated-routed.  See [RFC4606]

      and [RFC4328] about concatenation information.

      (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are
      requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated.  See also
      [RFC4606] and [RFC4328].

      (6) Technology specific label(s) such as wavelength label as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-g-694-lambda-labels]

      (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1
      protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc.

      (8) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203]

      (9) Support for unnumbered interfaces: as defined in [RFC3477]

      (10) Support for asymmetric bandwidth requests.

      (11) Indicate the requested granularity for the path ERO: node,
      link, label to allow the use of the explicit/suggested label
      control of RSVP.

   We describe in this document a proposal to fulfill those
   requirements.

1.3.  PCEP existing objects related to GMPLS

   PCEP as of [RFC5440], [RFC5521] and [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext],
   supports the following information (in the PCReq and PCRep) related
   to the described requirements.

   From [RFC5440]:

   o  numbered endpoints

   o  bandwidth (encoded as IEEE float)

   o  ERO

   o  LSP attributes (setup and holding priorities)

   o  Request attribute (include some LSP attributes)

   From [RFC5521]:

   o  Extensions to PCEP for Route Exclusions, definition of a XRO
      object and a new semantic (F bit or Fail bit) indicating that the
      existing route is failed and resources present in the RRO can be

      reused.  This object also allows to exclude (strict or not)
      resources; XRO include the diversity level (node, link, SRLG).
      The requested diversity is expressed in the XRO.

   From [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext]:

   o  INTER-LAYER : indicates if inter-layer computation is allowed

   o  SWITCH-LAYER : indicates which layer(s) should be considered, can
      be used to represent the RSVP-TE generalized label request

   o  REQ-ADAP-CAP : indicates the adaptation capabilities requested,
      can also be used for the endpoints in case of mono-layer
      computation

   The shortcomings of the existing PCEP information are:

      The BANDWIDTH and LOAD-BALANCING objects do not describe the
      details of the traffic request (for example NVC, multiplier) in
      the context of GMPLS networks, for instance TDM or OTN networks.

      The END-POINTS object does not allow specifying an unnumbered
      interface, nor the labels on the interface.  Those parameters are
      of interest in case of switching constraints.

   Current attributes do not allow to express the requested link level
   protection and end-to-end protection attributes.

   The covered PCEP extensions are:

      New objects are introduced (GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH and GENERALIZED-
      LOAD-BALANCING) for flexible bandwidth encoding,

      A new object type is introduced for the END-POINTS object
      (generalized-endpoint),

      A new TLV is added to the LSPA object.

      In order to allow to restrict the range of labels returned, an
      additional object is added: LABEL-SET

      In order to indicate the mandatory routing granularity in the
      response, a new flag in the RP object is added.

2.  PCEP objects and extensions

   This section describes the required PCEP objects and extensions.  The
   PCReq and PCRep messages are defined in [RFC5440].  The format of the
   request and response messages with the proposed extensions
   (GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH, SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET and LABEL-SET) is as
   follows:

     <request>::= <RP>

2.1.  RP object extension

   Explicit label control (ELC) is a procedure supported by RSVP-TE,
   where the outgoing label(s) is(are) encoded in the ERO.  In
   consequence, the PCE may be able to provide such label(s) directly in
   the path ERO.  The PCC, depending on policies or switching layer, may
   be required to use explicit label control or expect explicit link,
   thus it need to indicate in the PCEReq which granularity it is
   expecting in the ERO.  The possible granularities can be node, link,
   label.  Those granularities are dependent, i.e link granularity imply
   that the nodes are provided, label granularity that the links and
   nodes are provided in the ERO

   A new 2-bit routing granularity (RG) flag is defined in the RP object
   (IANA suggestion : bit 17 and 16).  The values are defined as follows





Margaria, et al.         Expires April 27, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2010



                               00 : node

                               01 : link

                               02 : label

                               03 : reserved

   When the RP object appears in a request within a PCReq message the
   flag indicates the requested route granularity.  The PCE SHOULD try
   to follow this granularity and MAY return a NO-PATH if the requested
   granularity cannot be provided.  The PCE MAY return more details on
   the route based on its policy.  The PCC can decide if the ERO is
   acceptable based on its content.

   When the RP object appears in a response within a PCRep message the
   flag indicates the granularity provided in the response.  The PCE MAY
   indicates the granularity of the returned ERO.  The RG flag is
   backward-compatible with previous RFCs: the value sent by
   implementation not supporting it will indicate a node granularity.
   this flag is optional for responses.  A new capability flag in the
   PCE-CAP-FLAGS from RFC [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] may be added.

2.2.  Traffic parameters encoding, GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH

   The PCEP BANDWIDTH does not describe the details of the signal (for
   example NVC, multiplier), hence the bandwidth information should be
   extended to use the RSVP Tspec object encoding.  The PCEP BANDWIDTH
   object defines two types: 1 and 2.  C-Type 2 is representing the
   existing bandwidth in case of re-optimization.

   The following possibilities cannot be represented in the BANDWIDTH
   object:

   o  Asymmetric bandwidth (different bandwidth in forward and reverse
      direction), as described in [RFC5467]

   o  GMPLS (SDH/SONET, G.709, ATM, MEF etc) parameters are not
      supported.

   According to [RFC5440] the BANDWIDTH object has no TLV and has a
   fixed size of 4 bytes.  This definition does not allows extending it
   with the required information.  To express this information, a new
   Object named GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH having the following format is
   defined:

   The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH has a variable length.  The Traffic spec
   length field indicate the length of the Traffic spec field.  The bits
   R and O have the following meaning:

      O bit : set when the value refer to the previous bandwidth in case
      of re-optimization

      R bit : set when the value refer to the bandwidth of the reverse
      direction

   The Object type determines which type of bandwidth is represented by
   the object.  The following object types are defined:

   1.  Intserv

   2.  SONET/SDH

   3.  G.709

   The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH MAY appear more than once in a PCReq
   message.  If more than one GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH have the same Object
   Type, Reserved, R and O values, only the first one is processed, the
   others are ignored.  On the response the object that were considered
   in the processing SHOULD be included.

   When a PCC needs to get a bi-directional path with asymmetric
   bandwidth, it SHOULD specify the different bandwidth in forward and
   reverse directions through two separate GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH
   objects.  The PCE MUST compute a path that satisfies the asymmetric
   bandwidth constraint and return the path to PCC if the path
   computation is successful.

   Optional TLVs may be included within the object body to specify more
   specific BW requirements.  The specification of such TLVs is outside
   the scope of this document.

2.3.  Traffic parameters encoding, GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING

   The PCEP LOAD-BALANCING follows the bandwidth encoding of the
   BANDWIDTH object, it does not describe enough details for the traffic
   specification expected by GMPLS, hence this bandwidth information
   should be extended to use the RSVP Tspec object encoding.

   According to [RFC5440] the LOAD-BALANCING object has no TLV and has a
   fixed size of 8 bytes.  This definition does not allows extending it
   with the required information.  To express this information, a new
   Object named GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING is defined

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object is optional.

   Traffic spec length (16 bits): the length of the min traffic spec
   length, also including the eventual TLV present in RSVP-TE traffic
   specification.

   Flags (8 bits): The undefined Flags field MUST be set to zero on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.  The following flag is
   defined:

      R Flag : (1 bit) set when the value refer to the bandwidth of the
      reverse direction

   Max-LSP (8 bits): maximum number of TE LSPs in the set.

   Min-Traffic spec (variable): Specifies the minimum traffic spec of
   each element of the set of TE LSPs.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING has a variable length.  The Object
   type determines which type of minimum bandwidth is represented by the
   object.  The following object types are defined:

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING MAY appear more than once in a PCReq
   message.  If more than one GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING have the same
   Object Type, and R Flag, only the first one is processed, the others
   are ignored.  On the response the object that were considered in the
   processing SHOULD be included.

   When a PCC needs to get a bi-directional path with asymmetric
   bandwidth, it SHOULD specify the different bandwidth in forward and
   reverse directions through two separate GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING
   objects with different R Flag.  The PCE MUST compute a path that
   satisfies the asymmetric bandwidth constraint and return the path to
   PCC if the path computation is successful.

   Optional TLVs may be included within the object body to specify more
   specific bandwidth requirements.  The specification of such TLVs is
   outside the scope of this document.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object has the same semantic as the
   LOAD-BALANCING object, If a PCC requests the computation of a set of
   TE LSPs so that the total of their generalized bandwidth is X, the
   maximum number of TE LSPs is N, and each TE LSP must at least have a
   bandwidth of B, it inserts a GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object specifying
   X as the required bandwidth and a GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object
   with the Max-LSP and Min-traffic spec fields set to N and B,
   respectively.

   For example a request for one co-signaled VCAT members will not use
   the GENERALIZEd-LOAD-BALANCING.  In case the VCAT member can be
   diversely routed, the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH will contain a traffic
   specification indicating the complete VCAT group and the GENERALIZED-
   LOAD-BALANCING the minimum co-signaled members.  For a SDH network, a
   request to have a VC4 VCAT group with 10 VC4 container, diversely
   routed with 2VC4 container on each path minimum, can be represented
   with a GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object with OT=4, the content of the
   Traffic specification is ST=6,RCC=0,NCC=0,NVC=10,MT=1.  The
   GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING, OT=4,R=0,Max-LSP=5, min Traffic spec is

   (ST=6,RCC=0,NCC=0,NVC=2,MT=1).  The PCE can respond with a response
   with maximum 5 path, each of then having a GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH
   OT=4,R=0, and traffic spec matching the minimum traffic spec from the
   GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object of the corresponding request

2.4.  END-POINTS Object extensions

   The END-POINTS object is used in a PCReq message to specify the
   source and destination of the path for which a path computation is
   requested.  From [RFC3471] the source IP address and the destination
   IP address are used to identify those.  A new Object Type is defined
   to address the following possibilities:

   o  Different endpoint types.

   o  Label restrictions on the endpoint.

   o  Specification of unnumbered endpoints type as seen in GMPLS
      networks.

   The Object encoding is described in the following sections.

2.4.1.  Generalized endpoint Object Type

   In GMPLS context the endpoints can:

   o  Be unnumbered

   o  Have label(s) associated to them

   o  May have different switching capabilities

   The IPV4 and IPV6 endpoints are used to represent the source and
   destination IP addresses.  The scope of the IP address (Node or Link)
   is not explicitly stated.  It should also be possible to request a
   Path between a numbered link and an unnumbered link, or a P2MP path
   between different type of endpoints.

   Since the PCEP ENDPOINTS object only support endpoints of the same
   type new C-Types are proposed that support different endpoint types,
   including unnumbered.  This new C-Type also supports the
   specification of constraints on the endpoint label to be use.  The
   PCE might know the interface restrictions but this is not a
   requirement.  On the path calculation request only the TSPEC and
   SWITCH layer need to be coherent, the endpoint labels could be
   different (supporting a different TSPEC).  Hence the label
   restrictions include a Generalized label request in order to
   interpret the labels.

   The proposed object format consists of a body and a list of TLVs with
   the following defined TLVs (described in Section 2.4.2).

   1.  IPV4 address.

   2.  IPV6 address.

   Endpoint type 0 MUST be accepted by the PCE, other endpoint type MAY
   be supported if the PCE implementation supports P2MP path
   calculation.  The TLVs present in the object body should follow the
   following grammar:

       <generalized-endpoint-tlvs>::=
        <p2p-endpoints> | <p2mp-endpoints>

       <p2p-endpoints> ::=

             <endpoint> [<endpoint-restrictions>]
             [<endpoint> [<endpoint-restrictions>] ...]


   Private TLV MAY be inserted at any place and SHOULD be ignored if not
   supported by the PCE

   For endpoint type Point-to-Point the first endpoint and optional
   endpoint-restriction is the ingress endpoint.  The second endpoint
   and optional endpoint-restriction is the egress endpoint The further
   endpoint and endpoint-restriction are ignored

   For endpoint type Point-to-Multipoint several endpoint objects may be
   present in the message and represent a leave, exact meaning depend on
   the endpoint type defined of the object.

   [RFC3471] Section 3.1 Generalized label request

2.4.2.5.  LABELS TLV

   Label or label range may be specified for the TE-LSP endpoints.
   Those are encoded in the TLVs.  The label value cannot be interpreted
   without a description on the Encoding and switching type.  The REQ-
   ADAP-CAP object from [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext] can be used in
   case of mono-layer request, however in case of multilayer it is
   possible to have in the future more than one object, so it is better
   to have a dedicated TLV for the label (the scope is then more clear).
   TLVs are encoded as follow (following [RFC5440]) :

   o  LABEL TLV, Type = TBA by IANA, Length is variable, Encoding is as
      [RFC3471] Section 3.2 Generalized label.  This represent the
      downstream label

   o  UPSTEAM-LABEL TLV , Type = TBA by IANA, Length is variable,
      Encoding is as [RFC3471] Section 3.2 Generalized label.  This
      represent the upstream label

   o  LABEL-SET TLV, Type = TBA by IANA , Length is variable, Encoding
      follow :[RFC3471] Section 3.5 Label set with the addition of a U
      bit, the U bit is set for upstream direction in case of
      bidirectional LSP.

   o  SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV Set, Type = TBA by IANA, Length is
      variable, Encoding is as Label Set.

   A LABEL TLV represent the label used on the unnumbered interface,
   bits I and U are used to indicate which exact unnumbered interface/
   direction is considered. the fields are encoded as in the RSVP-TE.
   The Encoding Type indicates the encoding type, e.g., SONET/SDH/GigE
   etc., that will be used with the data associated with the LSP.  The
   Switching type indicates the type of switching that is being
   requested on the link.  G-PID identifies the payload of the TE-LSP.
   The label type indicates which type of label (2) for generalized
   label is carried.  A LABEL-SET TLV represents a set of possible
   labels that can be used on the unnumbered interface.  The action
   parameter in the Label set indicates the type of list provided.
   Those parameters are described by [RFC3471] A SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV
   has the same encoding as the LABEL-SET TLV, it includes the preferred
   (ordered) set of label to be used.

   The U bit has the following meaning:


   U: Upstream direction: set when the label or label set is in the
      reverse direction

2.4.2.6.  Private TLVs

   The length is at minimum 4 bytes.

2.5.  LABEL-SET object

   The LABEL-SET object is carried in a request within a PCReq message
   to restrict the set of labels to be assigned during the path
   computation.  Any label included in the ERO object on the response
   must comply with the restrictions stated in the LABEL-SET, whose
   encoding is defined as following

     <LABEL-SET-OBJECT> ::= <LABEL-REQUEST><LABEL-SET>[<LABEL-SET>]

   The LABEL-REQUEST and LABEL-SET TLVs are as defined in
   Section 2.4.2.5, See also [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] for the definitions
   of the fields.

   It is allowed to have more than one LABEL-SET object per request
   within a PCReq message (for example in case of multiple SWITCH-LAYER
   present).

   In the case of unsuccessful path computation the LABEL-SET object MAY
   be used to indicate the set of constraint that could not be
   satisfied.

2.6.  SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET object

   The SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET object is carried within a PCReq or PCRep
   message to indicate the preferred set of labels to be assigned during
   the path computation.  The encoding is the same as the LABEL-SET
   object.  It is allowed to have more than one SUGGESTED LABEL-SET
   object per PCReq (for example in case of multiple SWITCH-LAYER
   present).

2.7.  LSPA extensions

   The LSPA carries the LSP attributes.  In the end-to-end protection
   context this also includes the protection state information.  The
   LSPA object can be extended by a protection TLV type: Type TBA by
   IANA: protection attribute

   The content is as defined in [RFC4872], [RFC4873].

   LSP Flags can be considered for routing policy based on the
   protection type.  The other attributes are only meaningful for a
   stateful PCE.

2.8.  NO-PATH Object Extension

   The NO-PATH object is used in PCRep messages in response to an
   unsuccessful path computation request (the PCE could not find a path
   by satisfying the set of constraints).  In this scenario, PCE MUST
   include a NO-PATH object in the PCRep message.  The NO-PATH object
   carries the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV that specifies more information on the
   reasons that led to a negative reply.  In case of GMPLS networks
   there could be some more additional constraints that led to the
   failure like protection mismatch, lack of resources, and so on.  Few
   new flags have been introduced in the 32-bit flag field of the NO-
   PATH-VECTOR TLV and no modifications have been made in the NO-PATH
   object.

2.8.1.  Extensions to NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV

   The current NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carry the following information:

      Bit number 31 - PCE currently unavailable [RFC5440]

      Bit number 30 - Unknown destination [RFC5440]

      Bit number 29 - Unknown source [RFC5440]

      Bit number 28 - BRPC Path computation chain unavailable [RFC5440]

      Bit number 27 - PKS expansion failure [RFC5520]

      Bit number 26 - No GCO migration path found [RFC5557]

      Bit number 25 - No GCO solution found [RFC5557]

      Bit number 24 - P2MP Reachability Problem [RFC5440]

   The modified NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carrying the additional information
   is as follows: New fields PM and NR are defined in the 23th and 22th
   bit of the Flags field respectively.

      Bit number 23 (TBA by IANA) - Protection Mismatch (1-bit).
      Specifies the mismatch of the protection type in the request.

      Bit number 22 (TBA by IANA) - No Resource (1-bit).  Specifies that
      the resources are not currently sufficient to provide the path.

      Bit number 21 (TBA by IANA) - Granularity not supported (1-bit).
      Specifies that the PCE is not able to provide a route with the
      requested granularity.

3.  Additional Error Type and Error Values Defined

   A PCEP-ERROR object is used to report a PCEP error and is
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error and
   an Error-value that provides additional information about the error
   type.  An additional error type and few error values are defined to
   represent some of the errors related to the newly identified objects
   related to SDH networks.  For each PCEP error, an Error-Type and an
   Error-value are defined.  Error-Type 1 to 10 are already defined in
   [RFC5440].  Additional Error- values are defined for Error-Type 10
   and A new Error-Type 14 is introduced.

4.  Manageability Considerations

   Liveness Detection and Monitoring This document makes no change to
   the basic operation of PCEP and so there are no changes to the
   requirements for liveness detection and monitoring set out in
   [RFC4657] and [RFC5440].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA assigns values to the PCEP protocol objects and TLVs.  IANA is
   requested to make some allocations for the newly defined objects and
   TLVs introduced in this document.  Also, IANA is requested to manage
   the space of flags that are newly added in the TLVs.
