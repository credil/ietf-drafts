    Redaction of Potentially Sensitive Data from Mail Abuse Reports
                      draft-ietf-marf-redaction-01

Abstract

   Email messages often contain information which might be considered
   private or sensitive, per either regulation or social norms.  When
   such a message becomes the subject of a report intended to be shared
   with other entities, the report generator may wish to redact or elide
   the sensitive portions of the message.  This memo suggests one method
   for doing so effectively.

Internet-Draft                  Redaction                   October 2011


1.  Introduction

   [ARF] defines a message format for sending reports of abuse in the
   messaging infrastructure, with an eye toward automating both the
   generating and consumption of those reports.

   For privacy considerations it might be the policy of a report
   generator to redact, or obscure, portions of the report that might
   identify an end user that caused the report to be generated.
   Precisely how this is done is unspecified in [ARF] as it will
   generally be a matter of local policy.  That specification does
   admonish generators against being too over-zealous with this
   practice, as obscuring too much data makes the report non-actionable.

   Previous redaction practices, such as replacing local-parts of
   addresses with a uniform string like "xxxxxxxx", often frustrates any
   kind of prioritizing or grouping of reports.

   Generally, it is assumed that the recipient-identifying fields of a
   message, when copied into a report, are to be obscured to protect the
   identity of then end user who submitted the complaint about the
   message.  However, it is also presumed that other data will be left
   intact, and that data could theoretically be correlated against log
   files or other resources to determine the intended recipient of the
   message.


2.  Recommended Practice

   To enable correlation of reports that might refer to a common but
   anonymous source, the following redaction practice is recommended
   (but not required):

   1.  Select an arbitrary string that will be used by an Administrative
       Domain (ADMD) that generates reports.  This string will not be
       changed except according to a key rotation policy or similar.
       Call this the "redaction key".
   2.  Identify string(s) (such as local-parts of email addresses) in a
       message that need to be redacted.  Call this the "private data".
   3.  Construct a new string that is a copy of the redaction key with
       the private data concatenated to it.
   4.  Compute a digest of that string with any hashing/digest algorithm
       such as SHA1.
   5.  Encode that hash with the base64 algorithm as defined in [MIME].
   6.  Replace the private data with the encoded hash when generating
       the report.

   This has the effect of obscuring the data in an irreversible way but

   still allows the report recipient to observe that numerous reports
   are about one particular end user.  Such detection enables the
   receiver to prioritize its reactions based on problems that appear to
   be focused on specific end users that may be under attack.


3.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   Security issues with respect to these reports are found in [ARF].

   While the method of redaction described in this document may somewhat
   reduce the likelihood of some types of private data from leaking
   between Administrative Domains, it is extremely unlikely that report
   generation software could ever be created to recognize all of the
   different ways that private information may be expressed through
   human written language.  If further protections are required,
   implementors may wish to consider establishing legal contracts or
   other non-technology-based agreements between the relevant entities.
