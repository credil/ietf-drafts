      3410 <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref
      target="RFC2578"></xref>, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref
      target="RFC2579"></xref> and STD 58, RFC 2580 <xref

      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>SMF provides methods for implementing DPD-based multicast forwarding
      with the optional use of Connected Dominating Set (CDS)-based relay sets. 
      The CDS provides a complete connected coverage of the nodes comprising 
      the MANET.  The MCDS is the smallest
      set of MANET nodes (comprising a connected cluster) which cover all the
      nodes in the cluster with their transmissions. As the density of the
      MANET nodes increase, the fraction of nodes required in an MCDS
      decreases. Using the MCDS as a multicast forwarding set then becomes an
      efficient multicast mechanism for MANETs.</t>

      <t>Various algorithms for the construction of estimates of the MCDS
      exist.  The Simplified Multicast Framework <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-manet-smf"></xref> describes some of these. It further
      defines various operational modes for a node which is participating in
      the collective creation of the MCDS estimates. These modes depend upon
      the set of related MANET routing and discovery protocols and mechanisms
      in operation in the specific MANET node.</t>

      <t>A SMF routers' MIB contains SMF process configuration parameters
      (e.g. specific CDS algorithm), state information (e.g., current
      membership in the CDS), performance counters (e.g., packet counters),
      and notifications.</t>

      <section title="SMF Management Model">
        <t>This section describes the management model for the SMF node
        process.</t>

        <t>Figure 1 (reproduced from Figure 4 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-manet-smf" />) shows the relationship between the SMF
        Relay Set selection algorithm and the related algorithms, processes
        and protocols running in the MANET nodes. The Relay Set Selection
        Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon topology information gotten from the
        MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP), from the specific MANET
        routing protocol running on the node, or from Layer 2 information
        passed up to the higher layer protocol processes.</t>

            draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-00.txt. A few changes
            were made in the development of this draft.
            Specifically, the following changes were made:
               - Removed the smfGatewayFilterTable from this
                 draft.  It is a useful construct, e.g.,
                 an IPTABLES-MIB, but might best be handled
                 as a seperate MIB and worked within a
                 security focused working group. 
               - Removed the smfReportsGroup. This capability
                 is being replaced with a new and more general
                 method for offline reporting.  This is being
                 worked as a new MIB module refered to as the
                 REPORT-MIB.
               - Rev'd as a new MANET WG document.

           "Updated draft of this MIB module published as
            draft-cole-manet-smf-mib-02.txt. Fairly extensive
            revisions and additions to this MIB were made
            in this version. Specifically, the following
            changes were made in development of this version:
               - added a Capabilities Group within the Objects
                 Group to allow the device to report supported
                 capabilities, e.g., RSSAs supported.
               - added administrative status objects for device
                 and interfaces
               - added multicast address forwarding tables, both
                 for configured (within Configuration Group) and
                 discovered (within the State Group).
               - added additional Performance counters related
                 to DPD functions.
               - Split up the performance counters into IPv4
                 and IPv6, for both global and per interface
                 statistics.
               - Split out the reports capability into a seperate
                 Reports Group under the Objects Group.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>[TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
      contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
      those modules. This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
      template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).
      Remember that the objective is not to blindly copy text from the
      template, but rather to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and
      then state/document the result of this evaluation.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
      include the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive
          if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
          security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
          example.</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they
          are sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
      use the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
      following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
          are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
          be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
          information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
          European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
          sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
      information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs
      should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
      certainly require justification during IESG review.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
      http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
      submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
      Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
      what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
      information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module document.</t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
      MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
      See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
      MIB module.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
