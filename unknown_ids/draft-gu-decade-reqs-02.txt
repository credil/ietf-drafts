Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


1.  Introduction

   The goal of DECADE is to specify a protocol that allows P2P
   applications to use and control storage and related resources in an
   in-network storage element.  In this context, using storage resources
   includes basic capabilies such as storing and retrieving data, but
   also (1) controlling access by peers with which it is sharing data
   and (2) controlling the resources used by remote peers to access that
   data.

   This document enumerates and explains the rationale behind
   requirements that should be considered in the specification of a
   protocol for DECADE.  More details about DECADE can be found in the
   problem statement [I-D.song-decade-problem-statement].

   This document will be updated to track revisions to the problem
   statement.


2.  Terminology and Concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms defined in
   [I-D.song-decade-problem-statement].  In particular, IAP refers to
   the In-network storage Access Protocol, which is the protocol used to
   communicate between a DECADE client and DECADE server (in-network
   storage).


3.  General Principles

   A number of general principles are identified in this section.  These
   general principles are important in achieving the goal of DECADE to
   be useful in many P2P applications.

3.1.  Client Simplicity

3.1.1.  Requirement

   DECADE SHOULD be specified such that client implementations remain
   simple.







Gu, et al.                Expires June 20, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


3.1.2.  Rationale

   The P2P paradigm has been applied in many contexts such as file-
   sharing, streaming, and video-on-demand, resulting in the development
   of a large amount of software supporting such systems.  It is
   envisioned that many applications can benefit from supporting DECADE,
   so supporting the specified protocol should be simple for client
   applications.

3.2.  Storage Management

3.2.1.  Requirement

   DECADE MUST support the ability for a user to own and manage storage
   space at in-network storage element.

3.2.2.  Rationale

   A primary departure from an existing form of in-network storage, P2P
   caching, is the ability for applications to manage the data stored.
   This allows applications to persist data in the network without fear
   that it may be deleted (e.g., pushed out of the cache) by other
   users.

3.3.  Access by Other Users

3.3.1.  Requirement

   DECADE MUST support the ability for a user to apply access control
   policies to users other than itself for its storage.  The users with
   whom access is being shared can be under a different administrative
   domain than the user who owns the in-network storage.

3.3.2.  Rationale

   Peers in a P2P application may be located across multiple ISPs under
   multiple administrative domains.  Thus, to be useful by P2P
   applications, DECADE allows a user to specify access control policies
   for users that may or may not be known to the user's storage
   provider.

3.4.  Resource Control

3.4.1.  Requirement

   DECADE MUST provide the ability for a user to define resource usage
   guidelines for resources consumed by other users when accessing its
   storage.  A DECADE client MUST be able to control parameters for at

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


   least the following types of resources:

   o  Bandwidth (relative weight)

   o  Storage space

   o  Network connections

3.4.2.  Rationale

   Recent developments in P2P systems have rely on resource-control to
   achieve certain application-level goals, such as improving incentives
   [LLSB08] and forming distribution topologies [PPLive].  It is
   important that DECADE provides basic support for applications to meet
   such requirements.  Thus, DECADE supports more than the ability read
   and write data.  In particular, DECADE also supports the ability to
   control resources used by remote peers while accessing data in in-
   network storage.

   There can multiple options when controlling bandwidth used by remote
   peers.  We indicate that a relative weight can be used to share
   bandwidth amongst multiple external peers.  Other possibilities (not
   exclusive of using a relative weight) may be to also specify a
   maximum bandwidth, or indicating an order in which requests should be
   served (as is done in eMule).  However, care should be taken to not
   require complex implementation by the server.

3.5.  Data Object Size

3.5.1.  Requirement

   DECADE MUST allow for efficient data transfer of small objects (e.g.,
   16KB) between a DECADE client and in-network storage with only
   minimal additional latency required by the protocol.

3.5.2.  Rationale

   Though P2P applications are frequently used to share large amounts of
   data (e.g., continuous streams or large files), the data itself is
   typically subdivided into smaller chunks that are transferred between
   peers.  Additionally, the small chunks may have requirements on
   delivery time (e.g., in a live-streaming application).  DECADE must
   enable data to be efficiently transferred amongst peers at this
   granularity.

   Note that DECADE should allow for efficient data transfer for larger
   data objects as well.

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


4.  Data Access

4.1.  Reading/Writing Own Storage

4.1.1.  Requirement

   IAP MUST support the ability for a DECADE client to read data from
   and write data to its own in-network storage.

4.1.2.  Rationale

   Two basic capabilities for any storage system are reading and writing
   data.  A DECADE client can read data from and write data to in-
   network storage space that it owns.

4.2.  Allow Others to Read/Write Storage

4.2.1.  Requirement

   IAP MUST support the ability for other DECADE clients to read data
   from and write data to a DECADE client's own in-network storage.

4.2.2.  Rationale

   One defining characteristic of many P2P applications is the ability
   to share data with peers.  In particular, a client may upload data to
   remote peers.  With DECADE, a client can indicate to a remote peer
   that data should be read from in-network storage instead of being
   uploaded directly between the peers.

   Similarly, in many P2P applications, a client can download data from
   remote peers.  With DECADE, a client can indicate to a remote peer
   that data should be written to in-network storage instead of being
   downloaded directly between the peers.

4.3.  Communication among In-network Storage Elements

4.3.1.  Requirement

   DECADE SHOULD support the ability for two in-network storage elements
   in different administrative domains to store and/or retrieve data
   directly between each other.  If such a protocol is supported, this
   MAY be the same (or a subset or extension of) as the IAP protocol.

4.3.2.  Rationale

   Allowing server-to-server communication can reduce latency in some
   common scenarios.  Consider a scenario when a DECADE client is



Gu, et al.                Expires June 20, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


   downloading data into its own storage from another client's in-
   network storage.  One possibility is for the client to first download
   the data itself, and then upload it to its own storage.  However,
   this causes unnecessary latency and network traffic.  Allowing the
   data to be downloaded from the remote in-network storage into the
   client's own in-network storage can alleviate both.


5.  Data Management

5.1.  Explicit Deletion of Stored Data

5.1.1.  Requirement

   IAP MUST support the ability for a DECADE client to explicitly delete
   data from its own in-network storage.

5.1.2.  Rationale

   A DECADE client may continually be writing data to its in-network
   storage.  Since there may be a limit (e.g., imposed by the storage
   provider) to how much total storage can be used, some data may need
   to be removed to make room for additional data.  A DECADE client
   should be able to explicitly remove particular data.

5.2.  Time-to-live for Stored Data

5.2.1.  Requirement

   IAP MUST support the ability for a DECADE client to indicate a time-
   to-live value (or expiration time) indicating a length of time until
   particular data is deleted by the in-network storage element.

5.2.2.  Rationale

   Some data stored by a DECADE client may be usable only within a
   certain window of time, such as in live-streaming P2P applications.
   Providing a time-to-live value for stored data (e.g., at the time it
   is stored) can reduce management overhead by avoiding many 'delete'
   commands sent to in-network storage.

5.3.  Storage Status

5.3.1.  Requirement

   A DECADE client MUST be able to retrieve current resource usage
   (including list of stored data) and resource quotas on its in-network
   storage.



Gu, et al.                Expires June 20, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


5.3.2.  Rationale

   The resources used by a client are not directly-attached (e.g., disk,
   network interface, etc).  Thus, the client cannot locally determine
   how such resources are being used.  Before storing and retrieving
   data, a client should be able to determine which data is available
   (e.g., after an application restart).  Additionally, a client should
   be able to determine resource availability (see Section 3.4) to
   better allocate them to remote peers.


6.  Resource Control

6.1.  Multiple Applications

6.1.1.  Requirement

   DECADE SHOULD support the ability for users to define resource
   sharing policies for multiple applications being run/managed by the
   user.

6.1.2.  Rationale

   A user may own in-network storage and share the in-network storage
   resources amongst multiple applications.  For example, the user may
   run a video-on-demand application and a live-streaming (or even two
   different live-streaming applications) application which both make
   use of the user's in-network storage.  The applications may be
   running on different machines and may not directly communicate.
   Thus, DECADE should enable the user to determine resource sharing
   policies between the applications.

   One possibility is for a user to indicate the particular resource
   sharing policies between applications out-of-band (not using a
   standard protocol), but this requirement may manifest itself in
   passing values over IAP to identify individual applications.  Such
   identifiers can be either user-generated or server-generated and do
   not need to be registered by IANA.

6.2.  Per-Peer, Per-Data Control

6.2.1.  Requirement

   A DECADE client MUST be able to assign resource quotas to individual
   peers for reading from and writing particular data to its in-network
   storage within a particular range of time.





Gu, et al.                Expires June 20, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


6.2.2.  Rationale

   P2P applications can rely on control of resources on a per-peer or
   per-data basis.  For example, application policy may indicate that
   certain peers have a higher bandwidth share for receiving data.
   Additionally, certain data (e.g., chunks) may be distributed with a
   higher priority.  As another example, when allowing a remote peer to
   write data to a user's in-network storage, the remote peer may be
   restricted to write only a certain amount of data.  Since the client
   may need to manage multiple peers accessing its data, it should be
   able to indicate the time over which the granted resources are
   usable.  For example, an expiration time for the access could be
   indicated to the server after which no resources are granted (e.g.,
   indicate error as access denied).

6.3.  Server Involvement

6.3.1.  Requirement

   A DECADE client MUST be able to indicate, without contacting the
   server itself, resource control policies for peers' requests.

6.3.2.  Rationale

   One important consideration for in-network storage elements is
   scalability, since a single storage element may be used to support
   many users.  Many P2P applications use small chunk sizes and frequent
   data exchanges.  If such an application employed resource control and
   contacted the in-network storage element for each data exchange, this
   could present a scalability challenge for the server as well as
   additional latency for clients.

   An alternative is to pass resource control policies (in a
   cryptographically secure way) directly amongst peers.  Peers can then
   present the policy to the server using IAP.  This can result in
   reduced messaging handled by the in-network storage.


7.  Authorization

7.1.  Per-Peer, Per-Data Read Access

7.1.1.  Requirement

   A DECADE Client MUST be able to authorize individual peers to read
   particular data stored on its in-network storage.

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


7.1.2.  Rationale

   A P2P application can control certain application-level policies by
   sending particular data (e.g., chunks) to certain peers.  It is
   important that peers not be able to circumvent such decisions by
   arbitrarily reading any currently-stored data in in-network storage.

7.2.  Per-User Write Access

7.2.1.  Requirement

   A DECADE Client MUST be able to authorize individual peers to store
   data into its in-network storage.

7.2.2.  Rationale

   The space managed by a user in in-network storage can be a limited
   resource.  At the same time, it can be useful to allow remote peers
   to write data directly to a user's in-network storage.  Thus, a
   DECADE client should be able to grant only certain peers this
   privilege.

   Note that it is not (currently) a requirement to check that a peer
   stores a particular set of data (e.g., the check that a remote peer
   writes the expected chunk of a file).  Enforcing this as a
   requirement would require a client to know which data is expected
   (e.g., the full chunk itself or a hash of the chunk) which may not be
   available in all applications.  Checking for a particular hash could
   be considered as a requirement in the future that could optionally be
   employed by applications.

7.3.  Authorization Checks

7.3.1.  Requirement

   In-network storage MUST check the authorization of a client before it
   executes a supplied request.

7.3.2.  Rationale

   Authorization granted by a DECADE client are meaningless unless
   unauthorized requests are denied access.  Thus, the in-network
   storage element must verify the authorization of a particular request
   before it is executed.

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements             December 2009


7.4.  Server Involvement

7.4.1.  Requirement

   A DECADE client MUST be able to indicate, without contacting the
   server itself, access control policies for peers' requests.

7.4.2.  Rationale

   See discussion in Section 6.3.2.


8.  Data Availability

8.1.  Offline Usage

8.1.1.  Requirement

   DECADE MAY support the ability for a user to provide authorized
   access to its in-network storage even while no DECADE-enabled
   applications are currently running or connected to the network.

8.1.2.  Rationale

   If an application desires, it can authorize peers to access its
   storage even after the application exits or network connectivity is
   lost.  An example use case is mobile scenarios, where a client can
   lose and regain network connectivity very often.


9.  Error Conditions

9.1.  Insufficient Resources

9.1.1.  Requirement

   IAP MUST support an error condition indicating to a DECADE client
   that resources (e.g., storage space) were not available to service a
   request (e.g., storage quota exceeded when attempting to store data).

9.1.2.  Rationale

   The currently-used resource levels within the in-network storage are
   not locally-discoverable, since the resources (disk, network
   interfaces, etc) are not directly attached.  In order to allocate
   resources appropriately amongst peers, a client must be able to
   determine when resource limits have been reached.  The client can
   then respond by explicitly freeing necessary resources or waiting for

   such resources to be freed.

9.2.  Unavailable and Deleted Data

9.2.1.  Requirement

   IAP MUST support error conditions indicating that (1) data was
   rejected from being stored, (2) deleted, or (3) marked unavailable by
   a storage provider.

9.2.2.  Rationale

   Storage providers may require the ability to (1) avoid storing, (2)
   delete, or (3) quarantine certain data that has been identified as
   illegal (or otherwise prohibited).  DECADE does not indicate how such
   data is identified, but applications using DECADE should not break if
   a storage provider is obligated to enforce such policies.
   Appropriate error conditions should be indicated to applications.

9.3.  Overload Conditions

9.3.1.  Requirement

   In-network storage, which is operating close to its capacity limit
   (e.g., too busy servicing other requests), MUST be able to reject
   requests.

9.3.2.  Rationale

   When in-network storage is operating at a limit where it may not be
   able to process additional requests, it should not be required to
   generate responses to such additional requests.  Forcing the in-
   network storage to do so can impair its ability to service existing
   requests.


10.  Protocol Applicability

10.1.  NATs and Firewalls

10.1.1.  Requirement

   IAP SHOULD be usable across firewalls and NATs without requiring
   additional network support (e.g., Application-level Gateways).

10.1.2.  Rationale

   Firewalls and NATs are widely used in the Internet today, both in ISP
   networks and within households.  Deployment of DECADE must not
   require modifications to such devices (beyond, perhaps,
   reconfiguration).

10.2.  Connections to Clients

10.2.1.  Requirement

   IAP SHOULD NOT require that network connections be made to DECADE
   clients (e.g., from a server to a DECADE client or from a DECADE
   client to another DECADE client).

10.2.2.  Rationale

   Many household networks and operating systems have firewalls and NATs
   configured by default.  To ease deployment by avoiding configuration
   changes and help mitigate security risks, DECADE should not require
   clients to listen for any incoming network connections (beyond what
   is required by any other already-deployed application).


11.  Security Considerations

   Authorization for access to in-network storage is an important part
   of the requirements listed in this document.  Authorization for
   access to storage resources and the data itself is important for
   users to be able to manage and limit distribution of content.  For
   example, a user may only wish to share particular content with
   certain peers.

   If the authorization technique implemented in DECADE passes any
   private information (e.g., user passwords) over the wire, it MUST be
   passed in a secure way.


12.  Discussion

   Sometimes, several logical in-network storages could be deployed on
   the same physical network device.  In this case, in-network storages
   on the same physical network device can communicate and transfer data
   through internal communication messages.  However in-network storages
   deployed on different physical network devices SHOULD communicate
   with in-network storage Access Protocol (IAP).

   To provide fairness among users, the in-network storage provider

   should assign resource (e.g., storage, bandwidth, connections) quota
   for users.  This can prevent a small number of clients from occupying
   large amounts of resources on the in-network storage, while others
   starve.


13.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration with this document.
