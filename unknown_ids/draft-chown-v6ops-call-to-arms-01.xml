The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be
World IPv6 Day, on which organisations are being encouraged to test their
production IPv6 deployment capability.   Many significant content providers
and networks have stated they will take part.  Given this date is likely
to see more IPv6 traffic flowing across the Internet than has ever been
seen before, it seems timely to issue a call to arms for operators and
administrators to review and mitigate common causes of IPv6 connectivity 
problems.   The increased traffic on World IPv6 Day should also 
create an excellent opportunity to observe the behaviour and performance
of IPv6; it is thus very desirable to have appropriate measurement tools
in place in advance.   We discuss some appropriate tools from the network
and application perspective.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
Despite the recent exhaustion of the available IPv4 address pool, 
deployment of IPv6 remains limited.  To help encourage organisations
to trial production deployment, ISOC has declared June 8th 2011 as
World IPv6 Day.  Organisations are encouraged to use this day to
test IPv6 in production, either by enabling clients in their network,
or by making externally-facing services available over IPv6.   At the
current time, this would generally mean enabling dual-stack 
networking with IPv4 running alongside IPv6.  However, IPv6-only 
networks are inevitable, and so some sites may choose to use 
June 8th to undertake some focused tests on that deployment model.
	</t>
	<t>
The purpose of this document is two-fold.  One is to discuss common
IPv6 connecivity issues that are likely to arise on June 8th, with a
focus on dual-stack networking (which is likely to be how the vast majority
of sites take part).  This should help raise awareness of those problems
and possible mitigations.  The other is to encourage organisations to think
about how they might get useful instrumentation on what happens in and
to/from their networks on the day.   Such measurement tools are likely 
to also be useful longer term - once deployed they could be left in
place.
	</t>
	<t>
For most sites providing content, June 8th will be a chance to make
some public facing services available over IPv6, such as web content
using their production
domain (e.g. www.example.com) rather than a contrived IPv6 test domain
(e.g. www.ipv6.example.com).  But also some enterprise sites may choose to 
enable IPv6 in user/client subnets, in which case the performance of
those systems and the applications they run will be of paramount interest.
	</t>
	<t>
The document also includes a brief section on tools that might be used to 
test IPv6-only operation.  
	</t>
	<t>
NB. This is a very rough draft of the document; feedback is welcomed.
The scope of the document is purely informational to provoke discussion,
and to encourage deployment steps for June 8th, which may remain in 
place after that date.
We aim to have a relatively mature informational text ready well in
advance of June.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Connectivity Issues">
	<t>
In this section we review some common causes of IPv6 connectivity issues.
The topics below include initial thoughts for this early draft, and
there is no significance to the order in which issues are listed.
Some issues, such as transit arrangements, are not included - currently
the focus is on end sites (or users) who may take part in the World
IPv6 Day.
	</t>

<section title="Unmanaged Tunnels">
	<t>
One cause of connectivity problems is the use of unmanaged tunnels,
in particular 'automated' methods that are not provisioned by the
user's ISP.   The most common example is 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"/>,
or more specifically the 6to4 relay approach described in 
<xref target="RFC3068"/>.   A native IPv6 host communicating with a
6to4 host will require both hosts to have access to an appropriately
capable 6to4 relay (which may or may not be the same relay).
If a host in a native IPv6 network has
no route to 2002::/16 it cannot send traffic to a 6to4 host.
Similarly, a 6to4 router that cannot reach the well-known IPv4 anycast
relay address cannot send traffic to a native IPv6 network.
	</t>
	<t>
One approach to this problem is to encourage sites/ISPs to run local
relays, as discussed in
<xref target="I-D.carpenter-v6ops-6to4-teredo-advisory"/>.  The
alternative to reduce such problems is simply to obsolete 6to4, as
proposed in 
<xref target="I-D.troan-v6ops-6to4-to-historic"/>.  
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Tunnel Broker first-hop delays">
	<t>
IPv6 tunnel brokers, such as those provided by SixXS (http://www.sixxs.net) 
and Hurricane Electric (http://tunnelbroker.net) provide a more robust, 
managed approach to IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnelled access than 6to4.   
Individual users interested in IPv6 access for World IPv6 Day, in the 
absence of IPv6 support from their ISP, should consider registering to 
use a free tunnel broker.   When choosing a broker service, it is 
prudent to pick one with a presence near to you that has a minimal
round trip time.   Providers such as SixXS and HE have tunnel broker 
servers in many countries.   Beware picking a broker in another
continent that may add 150ms+ to your round trip times.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Connection Timeouts">
	<t>
Where dual-stack systems - or rather the applications running on them -
have a choice of IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity, timeouts can occur if there
is no connectivity on the preferred protocol.  For example, if both A and
AAAA DNS records exists for a web server, and IPv6 connectivity is broken,
there is likely to be some timeout for the browser before the connection
drops back to IPv4.   
	</t>
	<t>
A bigger problem exists if the application or OS tries IPv6 first
and then does not fall back to IPv4.  A bug in versions of Opera prior
to 10.5 caused such behaviour, which was obviously a big issue for Opera
users trying to access dual-stack web sites with broken IPv6
connectivity.
	</t>
	<t>
The author has undertaken some informal tests at his own site, which
shows how different operating systems handle ICMP unreachables, 
if they are received.
On Linux, web connections timeout after 20 seconds for 'no response',
but immediately for unreachables.  In contrast, Windows Vista was 20
seconds regardless of unreachables being received.  Any non-trivial
delay will cause significant user frustration.
	</t>
	<t>
This problem is probably the main reason that Google implemented a AAAA
whitelisting system for its test sites.   The sites had to demonstrate
they had good IPv6 connectivity before being allowed into the test
programme.   The topic is discussed in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-v6-aaaa-whitelisting-implications"/>.
For the sake of World IPv6 Day, it is expected that no such 
whitelisting is in place - that is, after all, the point of having
a day dedicated to testing IPv6 in production.
	</t>
	<t>
An interesting suggestion to handle the problem is the 'happy eyeballs'
approach described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-happy-eyeballs"/>.
This approach is now also being suggested for multiple interface
systems, as per <xref target="I-D.chen-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension"/>.   
However some people feel this 'workaround' is simply masking
underlying problems that should be fixed.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="PMTU Discovery">
	<t>
IPv6 mandates that fragmentation is only undertaken by the sending node,
and thus IPv6 requires working PMTU Discovery <xref target="RFC1981"/>.  
An existing RFC gives Recommendations for Filtering ICMPv6 Messages in
Firewalls <xref target="RFC4890"/>; if this guidance is not followed,
connectivity problems are likely to arise.  Blindly filtering all
ICMPv6 messages is not good practise.   
	</t>
	<t>
The minimum MTU for IPv6 is 1280 bytes.  Where PMTUD is not working or
not implemented, the minimum MTU should be used.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Rogue Router Advertisements">
	<t>
Within a site, hosts may use IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
(SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"/>.   However, it is possible for 
accidental (or malicious) rogue RAs to cause connectivity issues, 
as described in the Rogue Router Advertisement Problem Statement 
<xref target="RFC6104"/>.   
	</t>
	<t>
A typical cause of rogue RAs is Windows ICS, which can present a 
rogue 6to4 router on its wireless interface.   This will cause hosts
to potentially autoconfigure two global IPv6 addresses and pick the
wrong default router, with unpredictable results.  As a (bad) 
example the author experienced a scenario where he had a rogue 6to4
RA, but because the rogue 6to4 was working he was able to access IPv6 
networks outside his own network, but could not access most internal 
hosts inside his own network because he was unwittingly using 6to4 
from outside into his own network, and thus being firewalled from
those internal hosts.  
	</t>
	<t>
In many cases, default address selection <xref target="RFC3484"/>
(and <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise"/>) would avoid 
such cases, because the address selection rules
should prefer, or can be configured to prefer, native IPv6 over 6to4.   
However not all operating systems implement RFC 3484 yet, in 
particular MacOS X.
	</t>
	<t>
Adding ACLs to your switches to block ICMPv6 Type 134 packets on
ports that do not have routers connected would also minimise rogue RAs.
A more elegant solution is RA Guard <xref target="RFC6105"/>, and
another is use of SEcure Neighbour Discovery (SEND) <xref target="RFC3971"/>.
However neither is widely implemented yet.  Indeed, any
reported operational experience of SEND in an enterprise network
would be very welcome.
	</t>
	<t>
Finally, there is a tool called RAmond, available freely from
http://ramond.sourceforge.net, that can be configured to detect and
issue deprecating RAs against observed rogue RAs.   This software
is based on rafixd.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Tunnel performance">
	<t>
In scenarios where sites currently have manually configured tunnels
to gain IPv6 connectivity, it may be the case that such encapsulation
is performed by a router's CPU, in which case unexpected high 
volumes of traffic may cause problems.   Bear in mind that on World
IPv6 Day, you may start using IPv6 by default for some high bandwidth
applications that you had not used before, e.g. YouTube from Google.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="AAAA record advertised but service not enabled">
	<t>
If enabling a service for World IPv6 Day, be aware of other
existing services that may be running on the same system.
If a server has multiple functions, all services should be IPv6
enabled before a AAAA record is entered into the DNS for services
that may use that name.  
	</t>
	<t>
A related consideration is to make sure that firewalls don't 
just drop IPv6 packets to ports that are not in use.   It's 
better if the firewall or host sends a TCP RST to avoid a
potential timeout. For example, if you add a AAAA record for your 
web server that also runs say FTP, where FTP is IPv4 only, either 
the firewall should have port 21 open or the firewall should be
configured to send a TCP RST.
	</t>
</section>

</section>



<section title="Instrumentation">
	<t>
In this section we discuss potential instrumentation approaches that
may be configured for World IPv6 Day, and then retained longer term
after the event.  These should complement informal, subjective
reports from users at participating sites.   It is probably prudent
to make users aware of the 'at risk' day, and actions they should
take should the experience problems.   It may also be desirable to
undertake some form of user survey soon afterwards.
	</t>

<section title="IPv6 traffic levels">
	<t>
It should be possible to measure raw IPv6 traffic levels independently 
on dual-stack switch/router platforms, given implementations of 
appropriate MIBs.  Sites should take steps to ensure they have the tools in 
place to be able to view the relative levels of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic 
over time.
	</t>
	<t>
Application level measurement is also desirable, because handling of
choice (preference) of protocol used lies with the application if
both A and AAAA records are returned.  Sites should be aware that
due to IPv6 Privacy Extensions <xref target="RFC4941"/> application
logs may show more apparent different clients connecting, due to
clients cycling the source IPv6 address they use over time.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Network flow records">
	<t>
Where available, sites should seek to deploy network flow records for
traffic, to maximise opportunities to analyse traffic patterns after
the event, or in the case of reports of specific problems.   Netflow v9
supports IPv6.   Open source IPv6-capable Netflow collectors also
exist, e.g. nfsen, from http://nfsen.sourceforge.net.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Client Web Access Success Rate">
	<t>
There have been some recent studies on the capabilities of web clients
to access content on dual-stack servers by IPv4 or IPv6 in the
presence of both A and AAAA records existing for a web domain.   
	</t>
	<t>
One good example is that of <xref target="Anderson10"/>, as 
reported at RIPE-61, where the author set up some application (web
server) oriented tests for his newspaper content in Norway.
The methodology was to add an invisible IFRAME to his site that
would include IMG links randomly to 1x1 images that were served
either via an IPv4-only target or a dual-stack target.  Variation
in the hit rates would imply IPv6 brokenness.  By analysing the
http metadata information could be gleaned on the cause of the
brokenness.   Results in Q4'2009 showed 0.2-0.3% brokenness, 
including the Opera bug mentioned above.
	</t>
	<t>
Recent figures published by Google suggest at most a 0.1% level
of brokenness, indicating some improvement, but that level is
still potentially 1 in 1000 users with a problem.   Sites may 
wish to make their own measurements of IPv6 brokenness rather 
than relying on third party reports.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="IPv4 Performance Comparison">
	<t>
Where a dual-stack service is deployed, measuring the relative performance
of both protocols is desirable.  This may primarily be a measurement of
throughput or delay, but may also include availability/uptime measurement.
A site may choose to set up its own performance measuring framework, for 
example using open source bandwidth and throughput test tools.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Security monitoring">
	<t>
We mentioned RAmond above in the context of watching for rogue RAs.
There is another useful package called NDPmon, also available freely
from http://ndpmon.sourceforge.net, that can be configured to watch
for certain types of IPv6 'abuse' on your local network.  It may be
interesting to run the tool to confirm whether any 'bad' traffic is
observed within your network on World IPv6 Day.
	</t>
</section>

</section>


<section title="IPv6-only testing">
	<t>
The long-term IPv6 deployment plan is IPv6-only networking, rather than
dual-stack.  It is not clear how quickly significant IPv6-only networks
will emerge, but testing of approaches to IPv6-only operation is
desirable as soon as possible.
	</t>
	<t>
Some experience of NAT64 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful"/>
has been described in
<xref target="I-D.tan-v6ops-nat64-experiences"/>,
though this appears to have used only NAT-PT so far.
An implementation of NAT64 is available at http://ecdysis.viagenie.ca.
Operational experience of IVI is also desirable.  An implementation
of IVI is available at http://www.ivi2.org/IVI.
	</t>
</section>


<section anchor="Conclusions" title="Conclusions">
	<t>
With the ISOC World IPv6 Day event due on June 8th 2011, this document aims 
to help focus attention on both improving awareness and mitigations of
common causes of IPv6 connectivity problems, and encouraging sites and
organisations to introduce appropriate instrumentation into their networks
so they can observe traffic behaviour appropriately.
