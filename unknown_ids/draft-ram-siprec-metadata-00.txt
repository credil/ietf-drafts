          Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata
                      draft-ram-siprec-metadata-00

Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes the metadata model as
   viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS).

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata              August 2010


1.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document focuses on the Recording metadata
   which describes the communication session.  The document describes a
   metadata modelas viewed by Session Recording Server, the architecture
   for which is described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture] and the
   requirements for which are described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-req].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs.


3.  Metadata Model

   Metadata is the data that describes the communication session.  Below
   diagram shows a model for Metadata as viewed by Session Recording
   Server (SRS).

   The metadata model above MUST be used by a SRS.  (NOTE: Not entirely
   clear what sort of normative statement to make about this.)

   The Session Recording Client (SRC) MUST initiate the Recording
   Session.  It should be noted that the Recording Session is a

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata              August 2010


   completely independent from the Communication Session that is being
   recorded at both the SIP dialog level and at the session level.  The
   metadata MUST be conveyed from SRC to SRS.  The metadata MAY be
   conveyed in Recording Session Dialog.


4.  Recording Metadata elements

   This section describes the different elements and its attributes of
   the metadata model shown above.

4.1.  Recording Session Group

   A recording Session Group represents a collection of related
   Recording Sessions maintained by SRS.  Recording Session Groups are
   optional - they need not be present in the common case where
   Recording Sessions are independent of one another.

   (A group with multiple sessions might arise when recordings of the
   same or different communication sessions independently initiate
   recording sessions.)

4.2.  Recording Session

   A Recording Session element represents one instance of a Recording
   Session.  It MAY have attributes like Recording requestor ID(which
   could be SRS or SRC), reason for recording and recording type.  The
   reason for recording MUST be a policy(in a financial trading floor or
   Call centre) or to monitor a agent, or for quality purposes etc.  The
   recording type attribute indicates whether the recording session is
   selective or persistant.

4.3.  Communication Session

   A Communication Session element represents one instance of a
   Communication Session.

   NOTE: Discussions are needed to determine different attributes of CS
   which are needed for SRS

4.4.  Recorded Media Streams

   A Recorded Media Stream represents the content of a media stream
   captured and stored by the SRS.  A Communication Session MUST have
   one, and MAY have several, Recorded Media Streams.  In addition to
   the recorded media, it has attributes describing the encoding of the
   recording.

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata              August 2010


4.5.  Received Media Streams

   A Received Media Stream is an element that represents a media stream
   received by the SRS that contributed content to a recorded media
   stream.  There MUST be one Received Media Stream per Recorded Media
   Stream if mixing is done before recording, or several if a separate
   unmixed stream per participant is supplied.  Or there could be
   multiple per source (with disjoint time intervals) due to codec
   changes.

   The Received Media Stream element can have attributes like Start
   time, End time, Codec, Media Stream reference.

4.6.  Participant

   A Participant represents one contributor of media.  Participant has
   attributes like AoR, Name.  AoR MAY be SIP/SIPS/TEL URI.

4.7.  Application Data

   A recording metadata object MAY have a opaque application data.  This
   opaque data is intended to be used by vendor specific applications on
   SRS.


5.  Association of different Recording metadata elements

   This section describes in brief on how the different elements of
   metadata are associated.

5.1.  Recording Session Group : Recording Session

   A Recording Session Group element MUST have one or more Recording
   Session elements.

   NOTE: Model is currently permitting a single Recording Session to
   participate in more than one Recording Session Group.  Its unclear if
   this makes sense.  Might be better to restrict to one or none.

5.2.  Recording Session : Communication Session

   A Recording Session element MAY have zero or more CS per RS.  One CS
   per RS is typical.  Multiple CS per RS can arise due to private side
   conversations, etc.  Having no Communication Sessions is possible if
   the RS is established in anticipation of future CS.

   NOTE: We are currently modeling exactly one RS per CS, as a stake in
   the ground.  The assumption is that its difficult to distinguish a

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata              August 2010


   single CS viewed from two different RSs.  But this requires
   discussion.

5.3.  Communication Session : Recorded Media Stream

   Communication Session MAY have zero or more Recorded Media Streams
   for various reasons.  Distinct media might have their own.  (Or not -
   maybe audio/video together.)  Independent sources might be recorded
   separately.

   A Recorded Media Stream is always associated with exactly one
   Recording Session.

5.4.  Recorded Media Stream : Received Media Stream

   There MUST be one or more Received Media Streams per Recorded Media
   Stream.  There may be one if mixing is done before recording, or if
   media only flows in one direction.  There may be several if a
   separate unmixed stream per participant is supplied and mixing is
   done at the recorder.  Or there could be multiple for a single
   participant (with disjoint time intervals) due to codec changes.

   A Received Media Stream is always associated with exactly one
   Recorded Media Stream.

5.5.  Received Media Stream : Participant

   A Received Media Stream MUST have one or more participants.
   Typically there will be one, unless mixed before being sent to RS, in
   which case there may be several.

   A Participant MAY supply multiple Received Media Streams.

5.6.  Participant : Application Data

   NOTE: This is a place holder for as yet undefined data.


6.  Security Considerations

   The Recording Session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog and
   media session and therefore make use of existing SIP security
   mechanisms for securing the Recording Session and Media Recording
   Metadata.
