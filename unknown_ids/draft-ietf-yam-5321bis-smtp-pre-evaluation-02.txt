Internet-Draft           YAM 5321bis Evaluation             January 2010


1.  Introduction

   A preliminary evaluation has been made of Simple Mail Tranfer
   Protocol [RFC5321] by the Yet Another Mail (YAM) Working Group for
   advancing it from Draft to Full Standard.  The YAM WG requests
   feedback from the IESG on this decision.

1.1.  Note to RFC Editor

   This Internet-Draft is not meant to be published as an RFC.  It is
   written to facilitate processing within the IESG.


2.  Preliminary Evaluation

2.1.  Document

   Title:   Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

   Link:   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321

2.2.  Time in Place

   RFC2026:   _"A specification shall remain at the Draft Standard level
      for at least four (4) months, or until at least one IETF meeting
      has occurred."_

   Published:   October 2008

2.3.  Implementation and Operational Experience

   RFC2026:   _"significant implementation and successful operational
      experience ... characterized by a high degree of technical
      maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified
      protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet
      community."_

   Confidence level:  Very high.

   Electronic mail (historically known as "netmail" before "email" came
   into common use) has been in active use in the Internet community
   since the early 1970s.  Although many small adjustments and
   clarifications have been made, the basic transport protocol that is
   now used has been changed in only two important ways since the
   publication of RFC 821 in August 1982.  One of those changes was the
   introduction of DNS-based mail routing with the MX record with RFC
   974 in January 1986 (with some small clarifications in RFC 1123 in
   October 1979).  The second was the introduction of a model for

   negotiating optional services with RFC 1425 in February 1993.

   While many mail systems over the years have relied more on the
   robustness of receiving systems in the face of deviations (or
   creative interpretations of RFC 821 language in spite of changes and
   clarifications over the last 27 years), the DRUMS WG work that
   produced RFC 2821 [RFC2821] in April 2001 was largely an update to
   clarify various provisions.  With the exception of a very few edge-
   case clarifications and changes in requirements levels, systems that
   conform to the combination of RFC 821 [RFC0821] and RFC 1869
   [RFC1869] (both Full Standards) conform to RFC 5321.  Those
   differences represented existing practice when RFC 5321 was written
   and have been well-tested and widely deployed.

2.4.  Proposed Changes

   The YAM WG proposes making the following changes in a revision:

   Terminology:  There has been ongoing controversy about the
      terminology in RFC 5321 and especially changes made between 821
      and 2821 or between 2821 and 5321.  While we assume that 5321 is
      adequate, the WG will review terminology as appropriate and may
      make some adjustments.

   Metalanguage:  During and after IETF Last Call on 5321, some
      suggestions were made about how to make metalanguage productions
      easier to find and connect.  A complete rewrite or restructuring
      of the metalanguage should be avoided on the grounds that it would
      carry a very high risk of introducing errors.  Instead, resources
      and tools permitting (significant manual work is now required),
      the revised document will contain an index to productions and
      where they are defined.

   Normative References:  RFC 5321 is worded in a way that makes some
      references normative that are not strictly required to be.  The WG
      will consider whether those rewordings are appropriate.  In
      particular, the reference to RFC 821 will be moved to Informative
      because all normative uses have been removed.

   Existing Errata Reports:  The working group will incorporate
      corrections to accepted errata, as shown in the RFC Editor's
      errata tool.  Errata ID 1683 is currently the only such item.  IDs
      1543 and 1851 are reported, but unverified; the working group will
      consider those.

Internet-Draft           YAM 5321bis Evaluation             January 2010


   Small Editorial Errors:  Clear up various small editorial errors,
      e.g., the use of "SHOULD not" in one location.  YAM issue tracker
      issues 5, 6, 9, 12, and 13 refer to issues of this sort.  The
      working group will add others that may be identified in its
      detailed review.

   Clarifications:  The working group will attempt to address things
      that have ben identified as unclear in RFC 5321.  YAM issue
      tracker issues 7, 8, 10, and 11 refer to issues of this sort.
      There has been discussion of these on the mailing list, and the
      resolutions of each may or may not result in a change in the
      document.  In no case will clarification changes be significant
      enough to violate "Non-Changes", Section 2.5.

2.5.  Non-Changes

   The YAM WG discussed and chose not to make the following changes:

   1.  Complete revision, rearrangement, or reformatting of metalanguage
       (see #2 above).

   2.  Any extensions that would violate the rules for Full Standard or
       otherwise require revisiting the approved interoperability report
       for RFC 5321.

   3.  A number of extensions and changes that would have imposed
       significant new requirements on SMTP, or that would have implied
       incompatible changes, were proposed during both the DRUMS WG
       period and during the discussions that led to RFC 5321.  In each
       case, the authors were advised to prepare a specific Internet-
       Draft describing the change, convince the community to progress
       it to Proposed Standard, and then implement and deploy the change
       quickly enough to "catch up" with the progress that started with
       RFC 2821.  The notion was that those changes could then be
       integrated with the progression at the same maturity level.  It
       is important to note that, independent of any constraints imposed
       by the YAM charter design, none of those proposals have appeared
       and been progressed even to IETF Last Call.

   4.  As agreed when RFC 5321 was reviewed, the examples will not be
       revised to bring them into alignment with RFC 2606 (BCP 32)
       conventions (example.com, etc.).  The issues are explained in
       Section 1.3 of RFC 5321.  The community also noted at the time
       that the relevant examples have been in use, substantially
       unchanged, for more than a quarter-century with no serious claims
       of confusion or other harm being caused.

   5.  The Security Considerations section was extensively reviewed last
       year (during the review and approval of RFC 5321).  No evidence
       has appeared since then that would require further review or
       additional changes.

2.6.  Downward references

   At Full Standard, the following references would be downward
   references:

      RFC 5322 if 5322bis is not progressed simultaneously with 5321bis.
      (This is not expected to happen.)

      RFC 4291, IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture.

      RFC 3848, ESMTP and LMTP Transmission Types Registration.  Note
      that it is possible to rephrase RFC 5321bis to avoid this
      normative reference and the WG will consider doing that.

2.7.  IESG Feedback

   The YAM WG requests feedback from the IESG on this decision.  In
   particular:

   o  Does the IESG believe the proposed changes are suitable during a
      move from Draft to Full Standard?

   o  Excluding the previous proposed changes and expected IESG support
      for technically substantive IETF last call feedback, does the IESG
      believe any additional changes are critical to advance this
      document from draft to full standard?  If so, please provide
      sufficient information so the WG can address these issues prior to
      IETF last call or determine that the document is inappropriate for
      the YAM WG to process at this time.

   o  Does the IESG consider the downward references acceptable for a
      full standard?  If not, please cite which specific downward
      reference or references are problematic and why so the WG can
      address these issues prior to IETF last call or determine the
      document is inappropriate for the YAM WG to process at this time.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA actions.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document requests IESG feedback and does not raise any security
   concerns.  Security considerations for RFC 5321 have been taken into
   account during the preliminary evaluation and appear in either
   Section 2.4 or Section 2.5 of this document.
