Internet-Draft    A Transition Mechanism for RANGI          March 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   The Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI) 
   described in [RANGI] is designed to address several issues that the 
   current Internet is facing, e.g., routing scalability, mobility, 
   multi-homing and traffic-engineering, etc. 

   RANGI is a hybrid proposal that combines and enhances the ideas from 
   several proposals particularly those based on identifier/locator 
   split approach. It introduces a hierarchical and cryptographic host 
   identifier and adopts a hierarchical routing mechanism to support 
   routing across multiple independent address spaces. To allow smooth 
   transition from IPv4 to IPv6, it adopts an IPv6 address with an IPv4 
   embedded in the last four bytes as locator. 

   RANGI uses a 128-bit host identifier, which consists of two parts, 
   the first part is the Administrative Domain Identifier (AD ID) which 
   has organizational structure and global uniqueness, and the second 
   part is a cryptographic hash over the AD ID and its public key as in 
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA)[CGA]. The locator is a 
   provider-assigned IPv6 address with local IPv4 address embedded in 
   the last four octets. The mapping from FQDN to identifier is stored 
   in Domain Name Service (DNS) system, whereas the mapping from 
   identifier to locator is stored in another mapping system (e.g., 
   hierarchical Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system, reverse DNS system, 
   etc.). Since the identifier is as long as IPv6 address, it can be 
   stored directly in DNS servers as an AAAA resource record (RR).  

   As specified in [Goals], incremental deployability is one of the 
   design goals for a new routing and addressing architecture. Thus, in 
   this document, we define a transition mechanism with which legacy 
   hosts can communicate with RANGI hosts, and vice versa. Note that the 
   Application Layer Gateway (ALG) used for transforming the address 
   information in application layers is not specified in this document. 

   In order to distinguish identifiers from ordinary IPv6 addresses and 
   locators, identifiers use a specific prefix, which is to be allocated 
   by IANA. 

2. Transition Mechanism 

2.1. Communication between IPv6 and RANGI Hosts 

   As mentioned previously, RANGI hosts can store their identifiers as 
   AAAA resource records in the DNS system. Thus, when a legacy IPv6 
   host makes a DNS query for a RANGI host, the identifier is returned

Internet-Draft    A Transition Mechanism for RANGI          March 2009 
    

   as an AAAA resource record in the DNS response. This identifier is 
   processed by the legacy host as an IPv6 address. 

   As shown in Figure 1, A is a legacy IPv6 host, and B is a RANGI host. 
   The proxy is located as the exit border router in the IPv6 site, and 
   maintains an Identifier (ID)/Locator mapping table which is used 
   during the process of transforming IPv6 packets to RANGI packets and 
   vice versa. For the remainder of this document, the ID/Locator 
   mapping table is called mapping table for short.

    +-------------------------+           +-------------------------+ 

          Figure 1. Communication between IPv6 and RANGI Networks 

   The basic idea is to make the proxy assign each legacy IPv6 host a 
   secure identifier (associated with a public/private key pair). Then 
   the packets between the proxy and the RANGI host can be secured in an 
   IPsec tunnel. It should be noted that if security is not required, 
   the Provider-Independent (PI) IPv6 address of the legacy IPv6 host 
   could be used as an identifier directly. 

2.1.1. IPv6 Hosts Communicate with RANGI Hosts 

   Assume IPv6 Host A attempts to initiate a communication with RANGI 
   host B. Host A performs a DNS lookup for B's IPv6 address, and the 
   identifier of B is returned as an AAAA resource record. Then host A 
   constructs IPv6 packets with B's identifier as the destination IPv6 
   address.  

   We assume here that the proxy has advertised in the IPv6 site network 
   an IPv6 route to the identifier-specific prefixes. So the packets 
   with the identifier as the destination IPv6 address can reach the 
   proxy along that route. Upon receiving the packets, the proxy 
   attempts to determine the identifier corresponding to the source IPv6 
   address in its mapping table. If not found, the proxy should assign a 
   temporary identifier for A and store the mapping between A's IP 
   address and the identifier in its mapping table (as illustrated in 
   Figure 2).

                    Figure 2. ID/locator Mapping Table 

   Meanwhile, the proxy also attempts to find B's locator in its mapping 
   table. If not found, it should perform a lookup through the 
   ID/locator mapping system. Once resolution succeeds, the proxy should 
   cache the ID/locator mapping information in its mapping table and 
   transform the packets into RANGI packets (see Figure 3). Otherwise, 
   the packets will be delayed or dropped.

                    Figure 3. Packet Header Translation 

   In Figure 3, the source identifier in RANGI packets is A's temporary 
   identifier, the destination identifier is B's identifier, the source 
   locator is one of the proxy's locators, and the destination locator 
   is B's locator. 

   After receiving the packets, B sends response packets back. Once the 
   response packets arrive at the proxy, the proxy transforms these 
   packets into IPv6 packets according to the mapping entries in its 
   mapping table. In the IPv6 packets, the source address is B's 
   identifier, and the destination address is A's IPv6 address. 

2.1.2. RANGI Hosts Communicate with IPv6 Hosts 

   In order to make the legacy IPv6 hosts in a site accessible to RANGI 
   hosts, the proxy should assign each of its IPv6 hosts a globally 
   unique identifier and store the mapping of the identifier and the 
   corresponding IPv6 address in its mapping table. The identifier

Internet-Draft    A Transition Mechanism for RANGI          March 2009 
    

   should also be stored in the DNS system as an AAAA resource record. 
   Moreover, the identifier, associated with one of the proxy's locators, 
   should be stored in the ID/locator mapping systems. 

   Before initiating a communication with IPv6 host A, RANGI host B 
   needs to perform a DNS lookup and gets A's identifier as an AAAA 
   resource record. Then B obtains A's locator (the proxy's locator in 
   fact) from the ID/locator mapping system according to A's identifier. 
   After that, B constructs RANGI packets and sends them out. 

   Upon receiving the packets, the proxy finds the IPv6 address of A in 
   its mapping table, and caches B's identifier and locator in its 
   mapping table. The proxy then transforms the packets into IPv6 
   packets. In the IPv6 packets, B's identifier is used as the source 
   IPv6 address, while A's IPv6 address is used as the destination IPv6 
   address.  

   When A receives the packets, it sends response packets back.  

   Upon receiving the response packets, the proxy transforms the packets 
   into RANGI packets according to the corresponding mapping entries.  

2.2. Communication between IPv4 and RANGI Hosts 

   The process of translating between IPv4 and RANGI is a bit more 
   complex than the translation between IPv6 and RANGI. As shown in 
   Figure 4, again there is a proxy located as exit border router in 
   legacy IPv4 site network.

            ||  A   +--------+ Proxy +---+-----------+  B   | | 
            |+------+        +--+----+   |           +------+ | 
            |                   |        |                    | 
            | IPv4 Site Network |        | RANGI Site Network | 
            +-------------------+        +--------------------+ 

            Figure 4. Communication between IPv4 and RANGI Hosts 

   The basic idea is to make the proxy assign each legacy IPv4 host a 
   secure identifier (associated with a public/private key pair). Then 
   the packets between proxy and RANGI host can be secured in an IPsec 
   tunnel. Again, if there is no need for security, the proxy could use 
   the combination of a specific /96 IPv6 prefix and A's IPv4 address as 
   A's identifier.

2.2.1. IPv4 Hosts Communicate with RANGI Hosts 

   Before initiating a communication with RANGI host B, the IPv4 host A 
   performs a DNS lookup for B's IPv4 address. The DNS request would 
   travel from IPv4 network towards the DNS server S on the RANGI 
   network. Upon receiving the DNS request, the proxy rewrites the "A" 
   record in the DNS message as "AAAA" record, and then translates this 
   IPv4 packet into a RANGI packet according to an already-configured 
   mapping entry for the DNS server S.  

              +------------+------------+------------+---------+ 
              |IPv4 Address| Identifier |  Locator   |  TTL(s) | 
              +------------+------------+------------+---------+ 
              | IPv4(S)    |   ID(S)    |   Loc(S)   |   --    | 
              +------------+------------+------------+---------+ 
              |  ...       |  ...       |  ...       |  ...    | 
              +------------+------------+------------+---------+ 

                    Figure 5. ID/locator Mapping Table 

   Upon receiving the corresponding DNS response, the proxy obtain B's 
   identifier as an AAAA resource record, allocates B a temporary IPv4 
   address from its local IPv4 address pool, and caches the mapping of 
   B's identifier and IPv4 address in its mapping table. Meanwhile, the 
   proxy replaces the AAAA record in DNS response as an A record with 
   the temporary IPv4 address filled in and sends this DNS response 
   message to the DNS resolver. In addition, the proxy resolves B's 
   locator according to the identifier from ID/locator mapping system. 
   Once the resolution succeeds, the proxy caches the mapping in its 
   mapping table. Optionally, the proxy could assign A a temporary 
   identifier and cache the binding of this identifier, A's IPv4 address 
   and one of the proxy's locator in its mapping table. Of course, this 
   action can also be performed when data packets (other than DNS 
   messages) are received from A. 

   As the DNS resolution succeeds, A constructs IPv4 packets and sends 
   them out. Upon receiving these packets, the proxy translates them to 
   RANGI packets according to the existing mapping entries in its 
   mapping table. 

   When the response packets are received, the proxy transforms them 
   into IPv4 packets accordingly. 

2.2.2. RANGI Hosts Communicate with IPv4 Hosts 

   In order to make IPv4 hosts in a site accessible to RANGI hosts, the 
   site proxy should assign each IPv4 host in the site a globally unique

   identifier, and store the bindings of the identifiers and the 
   corresponding IPv4 addresses in its mapping table. In addition, these 
   identifiers should also be stored in the DNS system as AAAA resource 
   records of the corresponding IPv4 hosts (of course, this can also be 
   implemented by using DNS-ALG on the proxy to translate between 
   the "A" and the "AAAA" records in the DNS messages). The proxy also 
   stores these identifiers and one of the proxy's locators in the 
   ID/locator mapping system. 

   Before initiating a communication with IPv4 host A, RANGI host B 
   obtains A's identifier and locator from its DNS system and ID/locator 
   mapping system, respectively. With such information, B would 
   construct RANGI packets and send them to A.  

   Upon receiving these packets, the proxy would allocate B a temporary 
   IPv4 address from its local IPv4 address pool, and cache the binding 
   of B's identifier, locator and the temporary IPv4 address in its 
   mapping table. After doing this, the proxy would transform the RANGI 
   packets into IPv4 packets according to the existing mapping entries 
   in its mapping table.  

   Subsequently, the proxy can also translate the response IPv4 packets 
   from A into RANGI packets going to B according to the mapping entries 
   mentioned above. 

3. Security Considerations 

   The security details related to the proxy mechanism has not been 
   explored. 

4. Conclusions 

   With the proxy mechanism defined in this document, legacy IPv6 and 
   IPv4 hosts can communicate with RANGI hosts and vice versa. This 
   allows RANGI to be deployed incrementally. 

   This first draft is our initial attempt to develop a transition 
   mechanism. We are still working on several details and would 
   appreciate feedback and suggestions for improvement.
