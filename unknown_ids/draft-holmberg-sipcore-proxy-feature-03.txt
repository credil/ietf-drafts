               Indication of features supported by proxy
              draft-holmberg-sipcore-proxy-feature-03.txt

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension,
   defined in RFC 3840, provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message
   to convey information relating to the originator's features and
   capabilities.  This document defines a new SIP header field, Feature-
   Caps, that can be used by entities to indicate support of features
   and capabilities, in case they cannot use the Contact header field
   for that purpose.

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension,
   defined in RFC 3840 [RFC3840], provides a mechanism that allows a SIP
   message to convey information relating to the originator's features
   and capabilities.

   This document defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps, that can
   be used by entities to indicate support of features and capabilities,
   in case they cannot use the Contact header field for that purpose.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   Proxy: Within this specification, a "proxy" refers to an entity that
   does not indicate supported features using the Contact header field.
   Normally, however, entities that indicate support of features do not
   act as pure proxies, as defined by RFC 3261, but rather contain
   different levels of B2BUAs functionality.

   Downstream SIP entity: SIP entity in the direction towards which a
   SIP request is sent.

   Upstream SIP entity: SIP entity in the direction from which a SIP
   request is received.


4.  User Agent (UA) Behavior

4.1.  General

   A UA MUST NOT, except when it acts as a SIP registrar, insert a
   Feature-Caps header field in a SIP request or response.

   NOTE: Feature-caps header field values of a request are not copied to
   the associated responses.

   When a UA receives a SIP request, or response, that contains one or
   more Feature-Caps header fields, the feature tags in the header field
   inform the UA is about the features supported by the proxies that

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                 October 2011


   inserted the header fields.  Procedures how features are invoked are
   outside the scope of this specification, and MUST be described by
   individual feature tag specifications.

   When the UA receives the SIP request or the response, the feature
   tags in the topmost Feature-Caps header field will represent the
   supported features "closest" to the UA.

4.2.  Registrar Behavior

   If a SIP registrar wants to indicate support of features towards its
   upstream SIP entities, it can insert a Feature-Caps header field,
   together with feature tags associated with the supported features, in
   a REGISTER response.


5.  Proxy behavior

   When a proxy receives a SIP request, if the proxy wants to indicate
   support of features towards its downstream SIP entities, it adds a
   Feature-Caps header field to the request, together with one or more
   feature tags associated with the supported features, before it
   forwards the request.

   When a proxy adds a Feature-Caps header field to a SIP request, it
   MUST place the header field before any existing Feature-Caps header
   field in the request.

   When a proxy receives a SIP response, if the proxy wants to indicate
   support of features towards its upstream SIP entities, it adds a
   Feature-Caps header field to the response, together with one or more
   feature tags associated with the supported features, before it
   forwards the response.

   When a proxy adds a Feature-Caps header field to a SIP response, it
   MUST place the header field before any existing Feature-Caps header
   field in the response.

   Each value of a Feature-Caps header field MUST contain a "*" value,
   followed by one or more feature tags, associated with the supported
   features, separated by semicolon (";").

   A "*" value means that no information regarding which proxy, or
   domain, that support the features associated with the feature tags,
   is provided.

   NOTE: When used in a Contact header field, a "*" value has an "any
   URI" meaning.  When used in a Feature-Caps header field, it simply

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                 October 2011


   means that no URI information is provided.


6.  Feature-Caps Header Field Definition

6.1.  General

   This section describes how the Feature-Caps header field is used, and
   the associated semantics, with different SIP methods and response
   codes.

   NOTE: Future specification can define usage semantics of the Feature-
   Caps header fields for SIP methods, response codes and request types
   not specified in this specification.

6.2.  SIP Dialog

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within an initial SIP
   request for a dialog, and within any provisional or successful final
   response (18x and 2xx) associated with such request.

   If a feature tag is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field of an
   initial SIP request or response for a dialog, the feature associated
   with the feature tag MUST be supported for the dialog, until the
   dialog is terminated.

6.3.  SIP Registration (REGISTER)

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within a SIP REGISTER
   request, and within the 200 (OK) response of such request.

   If a feature tag is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field of a SIP
   REGISTER request or response, the feature associated with the feature
   tag MUST be supported for the registration, and all SIP transactions
   associated with the registration, until the registration is re-
   freshed or terminated.

6.4.  SIP Stand-Alone Transactions

   The Feature-Caps header field can be used within an request for
   standalone SIP transaction, and within any provisional or successful
   final response (18x and 2xx) associated with such request.

   If a feature tag is inserted in a Feature-Caps header field of an
   request or response for a standalone transaction, the feature
   associated with the feature tag MUST be supported for the standalone
   transaction.

7.  Syntax

7.1.  General

7.2.  ABNF

   The ABNF for the Feature-Caps header fields is:


           Feature-Caps = ("Feature-Caps" / "fc") HCOLON fc-value
                          *(COMMA fc-value)
           fc-value     = "*" *(SEMI feature-param)
                          ;;feature-param from RFC 3840


                              Figure 1: ABNF


8.  Feature Tag Usage With Feature-Caps

   Feature tags inserted in a Feature-Caps header field indicate that
   the SIP entity that inserted the header field support of the
   associated features.

   In order to use a feature tag in a Feature-Caps header field, the
   feature tag specification MUST specify the semantics of the feature
   tag when inserted in that specific header field.  Unless the feature
   specification defines such semantics, a the feature tag MUST NOT be
   used in a Feature-Caps header field.

   Within a given Feature-Caps header field, features are listed in a
   non-priority order, and for a given header field the the order of
   listed features have the same meaning.  For example, "foo;bar" and
   "bar;foo" have the same meaning (i.e. that the entity that inserted
   the feature tags support the features associated with the "foo" and
   "bar" feature tags.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps,
   according to the process of RFC 3261 [RFC3261].

   The following is the registration for the Feature-Caps header field:

   RFC Number: RFC XXX

   Header Field Name: Feature-Caps

   Compact Form: fc


10.  Security Considerations

   Feature tags can provide sensitive information about a SIP entity.
   RFC 3840 cautions against providing sensitive information to another
   party.  Once this information is given out, any use may be made of
   it.


11.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Paul Kyzivat and Dale Worley for their comments and
   guidance on the mailing list.

   The usage of a new header field, and the header field name, were
   suggested by Hadriel Kaplan.
