Abstract

   The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration
   datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware of
   common system events such as a change in system capabilities, which
   may impact management applications.  Standard mechanisms are needed
   to support the monitoring of the system events within the NETCONF
   server.  This document defines a YANG module which allows a NETCONF
   client to receive notifications for some common system events.

Internet-Draft            System Notifications            September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The NETCONF protocol [RFC4741] provides mechanisms to manipulate
   configuration datastores.  However, client applications often need to
   be aware of common system events such as a change in system
   capabilities, which may impact management applications.  Standard
   mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the system events
   within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang] which allows a NETCONF client to receive
   notifications for some common system events.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC4741]:
   o  client
   o  datastore
   o  operation
   o  server

   The following terms are defined in [RFC5277]:
   o  event
   o  stream
   o  subscription

   The following term is defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang]:
   o  data node


2.  YANG Module for System Notifications

2.1.  Overview

   The YANG module defined within this document specifies a small number
   of notification event messages for use within the 'NETCONF' stream,
   and accessible to clients via the subscription mechanism in
   [RFC5277].

   The YANG language is defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang].

2.1.1.  Notifications

   This module defines some system events to notify a client application
   that the system state has changed.

   o  sys-startup: Generated during a system restart.  Lists any errors
      that were encountered while loading the <running> datastore during
      system initialization.
   o  sys-config-change: Generated when the <running> configuration
      datastore is changed.  Summarizes each edit being reported.
   o  sys-capability-change: Generated when the NETCONF server
      capabilities are changed.  Indicates which capabilities have been
      added, deleted, and/or modified.
   o  sys-session-start: Generated when the NETCONF session is started.
      Indicates the identity of the user that started the session.
   o  sys-session-end: Generated when the NETCONF session is terminated.
      Indicates the identity of the user that owned the session, and why
      the session was terminated.
   o  sys-conformed-commit: Generated when the NETCONF confirmed-commit
      event occurs.  Indicates the current state of the confirmed-commit
      operation in progress.

3.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a YANG module for reporting of particular
   system events.  Although unlikely, it is possible that data obtained
   from this module could be used in an attack of some kind, although no
   specific information in this module is considered sensitive.

   TBD: follow Security Consideration guidelines from new template text.
