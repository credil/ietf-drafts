Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Oct 2011


1.  Introduction

   Cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated, and their numbers are
   increasing day by day.  To cope with such situation, incident
   information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among
   organizations.  IODEF is one of the tools enabling such exchange, and
   is already in use.

   To efficiently run cybersecurity operations, these exchnaged
   information needs to be machine-readable.  IODEF provides a
   structured means to describe the information, but it needs to embed
   various non-structured such information in order to convery detailed
   information.  Further strucuture within IODEF increases IODEF
   documents' machine-readability and thus facilitates streamlining
   cybersecurity operations.

   On the other hand, there exist various other activities facilitating
   detailed and structured description of cybersecurity information,
   major of which includes [CAPEC], [CEE], [CPE], [CVE], [CVRF], [CVSS],
   [CWE], [CWSS], [ISO/IEC 19770-2], [OCIL], [OVAL], [XCCDF], and
   [XDAS].  Since such structured description facilitates cybersecurity
   operations, it would be beneficial to embed and convey these
   information inside IODEF document.

   To enable that, this document extends the IODEF to embed and convey
   various structured cybersecurity information, with which
   cybersecurity operations can be facilitated.  Since IODEF defines a
   flexible and extensible format and supports a granular level of
   specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF instead of
   defining a new report format.  For clarity, and to eliminate
   duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing
   the exchange of such structured information are provided.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in
   [RFC5070].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange
   cybersecurity information, which includes the following information:



Takahashi, et al.         Expires April 7, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Oct 2011


   attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness,
   countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.

   IODEF provides a scheme to exchange such information among interested
   parties.  However, the detailed common format to describe such
   information is not defined in the IODEF base document.

   On the other hand, to describe those information and to facilitate
   exchange, a structured format for that is already available.  Major
   of them are CAPEC, CEE, CPE, CVE, CVRF, CVSS, CWE, CWSS, OVAL, and
   XCCDF.  By embedding them into the IODEF document, the document can
   convey more detailed contents to the receivers, and the document can
   be easily reused.

   These structured cybersecurity information facilitates cybersecurity
   operation at the receiver side.  Since the information is machine-
   readable, the data can be processed by computers.  That expedites the
   automation of cybersecurity operations

   For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident
   wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited.  Then the sender
   can simply use IODEF, where an CAPEC record is embedded instead of
   describing everything in free format text.  Receiver can also
   identify the needed details of the attack pattern by looking up some
   of the xml tags defined by CAPEC.  Receiver can accumulate the attack
   pattern information (CAPEC record) in its database and could
   distribute it to the interested parties if needed, without needing
   human interventions.


4.  Extension Definition

   This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity
   information by introducing new classes, with which these information
   can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents of
   AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.

4.1.  Structured Cybersecurity Information Formats

   This extension intends to embed various structured cybersecurity
   information.  The below table describes the initial list of supported
   specifications and their IDs, versions, and namespaces; future
   assignments are to be made through Expert Review, as requested in
   Section 7.

4.2.  Extended Data Types

   This extension inherits all of the data types defined in the IODEF
   model.  One data type is added: EM_XML.

4.2.1.  EM_XML

   An embedded complete XML document is represented by the EM_XML data
   type.  The elements of the document must match its root namespace
   element.

4.3.  Extended Classes

   The IODEF Incident element ([RFC5070], Section 3.2) is summarized
   below.  It is expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax as
   used in the IODEF specification.  The UML representation is for
   illustrative purposes only; elements are specified in XML as defined
   in Appendix A.

4.3.1.  AttackPattern

   An AttackPattern consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes attack patterns of incidents or events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   An AttackPattern class is structured as follows.

   +------------------------+
   | AttackPattern          |
   +------------------------+
   | STRING Version         |<>--(0..*)--[ Record ]
   | ENUM SpecificationID   |<>--(0..*)--[ Reference ]
   | STRING AttackPatternID |<>--(0..*)--[ PlatformID ]
   +------------------------+

                       Figure 3: AttackPattern class

   This class has the following attributes.

   Version:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The version number of the extension
      specification to which this class conforms.  This value should be
      1.00, to be compliant with this document.  Its default value is
      1.00.

   SpecificationID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The ID of the specification and
      its version specifying the format of the Record element.  The
      value should be chosen from the IDs listed in Figure 1, such as
      CAPEC_1.6.  Note that the lists in Figure 1 will be developed
      further by IANA.

   AttackPatternID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An ID of attack pattern to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such ID is
      available, but could be omitted if no such ID is available.  In
      case Record or Reference elements are provided, writers/senders
      MUST ensure that this ID is consistent with the one provided by
      the Record or Reference elements; if a reader/receiver detects an
      inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the AttackPatternID, and SHOULD
      log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   The AttackPattern class is composed of the following aggregate
   classes.

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Oct 2011


   Record:  Zero or more.  EM_XML.  A complete document that is
      formatted according to the specification and its version
      identified by the value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a Record
      element.

   PlatformID:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform
      involved in the specific attack pattern, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.2.

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecificationID are consistent with the contents of
   the Record; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.2.  PlatformID

   A PlatformID identifies a software platform.  It is recommended that
   AttackPattern, Vulnerability, Weakness, and System classes contain
   this elements whenever available.

   A PlatformID element is structured as follows.

   +----------------------+
   | PlatformID           |
   +----------------------+
   | STRING Version       |<>--(1..*)--[ ID ]
   | ENUM SpecificationID |
   +----------------------+

                        Figure 4: PlatformID class

   This class has the following attributes.

   Version:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The version number of the extension
      specification to which this class conforms.  This value should be
      1.00, to be compliant with this document.  Its default value is
      1.00.

   SpecificationID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The ID of the specification and
      its version specifying the format of the ID element.  The value
      should be chosen from the IDs listed in Figure 1, such as CPE_2.3
      and 19770-2.  Note that the lists in Figure 1 will be developed
      further by IANA.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

   ID:  One or more.  ML_STRING.  An ID that is formatted according to
      the rule defined by the specification and its version identified
      by the value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecificationID are consistent with the contents of
   the ID; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.3.  Vulnerability

   A Vulnerability consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes the (candidate) vulnerabilities of incidents or
   events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   A Vulnerability element is structured as follows.

   +------------------------+
   | Vulnerability          |
   +------------------------+
   | STRING Version         |<>--(0..*)--[ Record ]
   | ENUM SpecificationID   |<>--(0..*)--[ Reference ]

   Version:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The version number of the extension
      specification to which this class conforms.  This value should be
      1.00, to be compliant with this document.  Its default value is
      1.00.

   SpecificationID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The ID of the specification and
      its version specifying the format of the Record element.  The
      value should be chosen from the IDs listed in Figure 1, such as
      CVE_1.0 and CVRF_1.0.  Note that the lists in Figure 1 will be
      developed further by IANA.

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Oct 2011


   VulnerabilityID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An ID of a vulnerability to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such ID is
      available, but could be omitted if no such ID is available.  In
      case Record or Reference elements are provided, writers/senders
      MUST ensure that this ID is consistent with the one provided by
      the Record or Reference elements; if a reader/receiver detects an
      inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the AttackPatternID, and SHOULD
      log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

   Record:  Zero or one.  EM_XML.  A complete document that is formatted
      according to the specification and its version identified by the
      value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

   Reference:  Zero or one of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a Record
      element.

   PlatformID:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform
      affected by the vulnerability, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.2.  Some of the structured information may include
      platform ids within it.  In this case, the PlatformID element
      SHOULD NOT be used since the Record element contains the platform
      ids.  If a reader/receiver detects platform ids in both Record and
      PlatformID elements and their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the
      platform ids derived from the Record element, and SHOULD log the
      inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   Scoring:  Zero or more.  An indicator of the severity of the
      vulnerability, such as CVSS score, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.4.  Some of the structured information may include
      scores within it.  In this case, the Scoring element SHOULD NOT be
      used since the Record element contains the scores.  If a reader/
      receiver detects scores in both Record and Scoring elements and
      their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the scores derived from the
      Record element, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

4.3.4.  Scoring

   A Scoring class describes the scores of the severity in terms of
   security.  It is recommended that Vulnerability and Weakness classes
   contain the elements whenever available.

   A Scoring class is structured as follows.

   Version:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The version number of the extension
      specification to which this class conforms.  This value should be
      1.00, to be compliant with this document.  Its default value is
      1.00.

   SpecificationID:  REQUIRED.  STRING.  The ID of the specification and
      its version specifying the format of the Score element.  The value
      should be chosen from the IDs listed in Figure 1, such as CVSS_2.0
      and CWSS_0.8.  Note that the lists in Figure 1 will be developed
      further by IANA.

   This class is composed of an aggregate class.

   Score:  One. EM_XML.  Arbitrary information structured by the
      specification identified by the specification and its version
      identified by the value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecificationID are consistent with the contents of
   the Score; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.5.  Weakness

   A Weakness consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes the weakness types of incidents or events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   A Weakness element is structured as follows.

      further by IANA.

   WeaknessID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An ID of attack pattern to be
      reported.  This element SHOULD be used whenever such ID is
      available, but could be omitted if no such ID is available.  In
      case Record or Reference elements are provided, writers/senders
      MUST ensure that this ID is consistent with the one provided by
      the Record or Reference elements; if a reader/receiver detects an
      inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the AttackPatternID, and SHOULD
      log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

   Record:  Zero or more.  EM_XML.  A complete document that is
      formatted according to the specification and its version
      identified by the value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a Record
      element.

   PlatformID:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform
      affected by the weakness, which is elaborated in Section 4.3.2.
      Some of the structured information may include platform ids within
      it.  In this case, the PlatformID element SHOULD NOT be used since

      the Record element contains the platform ids.  If a reader/
      receiver detects platform ids in both Record and PlatformID
      elements and their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the platform
      ids derived from the Record element, and SHOULD log the
      inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   Scoring:  Zero or more.  An indicator of the severity of the
      weakness, such as CWSS score, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.4.  Some of the structured information may include
      scores within it.  In this case, the Scoring element SHOULD NOT be
      used since the Record element contains the scores.  If a reader/
      receiver detects scores in both Record and Scoring elements and
      their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the scores derived from the
      Record element, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can

4.3.6.  EventReport

   An EventReport consists of an extension to the
   Incident.EventData.Record.RecordData.RecordItem element with a dtype
   of "xml".  The extension embeds structured event reports.

   This class is composed of three aggregate classes.

   Record:  Zero or one.  EM_XML.  A complete document that is formatted
      according to the specification and its version identified by the
      value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

   Reference:  Zero or one of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a Record
      element.

   This class MUST contain at least one of Record or Reference elements.
   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecificationID are consistent with the contents of
   the Record; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.7.  Remediation

   A Remediation consists of an extension to the Incident.AdditionalData
   element with a dtype of "xml".  The extension elements describes
   incident remediation information including instructions.

   It is recommended that Incident class SHOULD contain one or more of
   this extension elements whenever available.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and



Takahashi, et al.         Expires April 7, 2012                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Oct 2011


   authenticity for the specific environment.

   Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.

6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns

   The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol [RFC6045] and its associated transport
   binding [RFC6046] provide such security.

   The critical security concerns are that these structured information
   may be falsified or they may become corrupt during transit.  In areas
   where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection.

6.2.  Using the iodef:restriction Attribute

   In some instances, data values in particular elements may contain
   data deemed sensitive by the reporter.  Although there are no
   general-purpose rules on when to mark certain values as "private" or
   "need-to-know" via the iodef:restriction attribute, the reporter is
   cautioned not to apply element-level sensitivity markings unless they
   believe the receiving party (i.e., the party they are exchanging the
   event report data with) has a mechanism to adequately safeguard and
   process the data as marked.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemata
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   information extension namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Oct 2011


      XML: None

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   infomration extension XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in the appendix of the document.

   Request for managing a namespace list: the schemata of the embedded
   structured information are maintained outside of the IETF currently,
   but the list of the embedded specifications' IDs and namespaces need
   to be registered to IANA repository.
