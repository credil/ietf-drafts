Internet-Draft       RTP Format for SMPTE 336M Data        December 2009


1.  Introduction

   [SMPTE336M], Data Encoding Protocol Using Key-Length-Value, defines a
   byte-level data encoding protocol for representing data items and
   data groups.  This encoding protocol definition is independent of the
   application or transportation method used.

   SMPTE 336M data encoding can be applied to a wide variety of binary
   data.  This encoding has been used to provide diverse and rich
   metadata sets that describe or enhance associated video
   presentations.  Use of SMPTE 336M encoded metadata in conjunction
   with video has enabled improvements in multimedia presentations,
   content management and distribution, archival and retrieval, and
   production workflow.

   The SMPTE 336M standard defines a Key-Length-Value (KLV) triplet as a
   data interchange protocol for data items or data groups where the Key
   identifies the data, the Length specifies the length of the data and
   the Value is the data itself.  The KLV protocol provides a common
   interchange point for all compliant applications irrespective of the
   method of implementation or transport.

   The standard also provides methods for combining associated KLV
   triplets in data sets where the set of KLV triplets is itself coded
   with KLV data coding protocol.  Such sets can be coded in either full
   form (Universal Sets) or in one of four increasingly bit-efficient
   forms (Global Sets, Local Sets, Variable Length Packs and Defined
   Length Packs).  The standard provides a definition of each of these
   data constructs.

   The standard also describes implications of KLV coding including the
   use of a SMPTE Universal Label as a value within a KLV coding triplet
   or whose meaning is entirely conveyed by the SMPTE UL itself.  The
   two kinds of usage for such standalone SMPTE Universal Labels are a)
   as a value in a K L V construct and b) as a Key that has no Length
   and no Value.  This standard defines where SMPTE ULs may be used for
   each kind of construct.

   The standard also defines the use of KLV coding to provide a means to
   carry information that is registered with a non-SMPTE external
   agency.

   The encoding byte range (length of the payload) may accommodate
   unusually large volumes of data.  Consequently, a specific
   application of KLV encoding may require only a limited operating data
   range and those details shall be defined in a relevant application
   document.

Internet-Draft       RTP Format for SMPTE 336M Data        December 2009


   KLV Encoded Data is often used to express metadata that accompanies
   media streams.  Users expect that the metadata will be delivered with
   no, or a low level, of lost information.

   Therefore, a mechanism based on RTP is specified here.  It enables
   metadata arrival in correct order, and with detection and indication
   of loss.

   By using RTP for metadata transmission in multimedia application,
   uniform handling of metadata and other media can be achieved in, for
   example, acquisition systems, firewalls, and network translation
   devices.  This, in turn, facilitates the design for either combined
   or separate media delivery as a function of application needs and
   channel capacity.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Usage of RTP

   The payload format for real-time SMPTE 336M Encoded Data transmission
   with RTP [RFC3550] described in this memo is intended for general
   binary data constructs, assembled in accordance with [SMPTE336M], and
   uses the application/smpte336m MIME type.

2.1.  Payload Format for Transmission of KLV Encoded Data

   A KLV Encoded Data RTP payload format consists of one, and only one,
   block of KLV Encoded Data, referred to as a "KLVunit" (see
   Section 2.2).  The standard 12-byte RTP header is assumed.  The
   structure of the RTP packet is shown below in Table 1.

       +-------------------+----------------+---------------------+
       | Field             | Length         | Semantics           |
       +-------------------+----------------+---------------------+
       | RTP packet header | 96 (see below) | Standard RTP header |
       | Payload           | Remainder      | KLVunit             |
       +-------------------+----------------+---------------------+

                     Table 1: Structure of RTP Packet

   There are no additional headers specific to this payload format.  The
   fields in the RTP header are set as defined in Section 2.3, carried
   in network byte order (see [RFC0791]).  The RTP packet header may be

   longer than 96 bits if CSRC fields are used (as defined in
   [RFC3880]).

2.2.  The KLVunit

   A KLVunit is a collection of all KLV items that are to be presented
   at a specific time.  A KLVunit is comprised of one or more self-
   contained KLV items, where a self-contained KLV item consists of a
   universal key, length, and value triplet.  Compound items (sets,
   packs) are allowed as per [SMPTE336M], but the contents of a compound
   item MUST NOT be split across two KLVunits.  Multiple KLV items in a
   KLVunit occur one after another with no padding or stuffing between
   items.

2.3.  KLVunit Mapping to RTP Packet Payload

   An RTP packet payload SHALL contain one, and only one, KLVunit or a
   segment thereof.  KLVunits small enough to fit into a single RTP
   packet (RTP packet size is up to implementation but should consider
   underlying transport/network factors such as MTU limitations) are
   placed directly into the payload of the RTP packet, with the first
   byte of the KLVunit (which is the first byte of a KLV universal key)
   being the first byte of the RTP packet payload.

   KLVunits too large to fit into a single RTP packet payload may span
   multiple RTP packet payloads.  All RTP packets comprising the parts
   of a KLVunit MUST have the same timestamp.

   KLVunits are bounded with changes in RTP packet timestamps.  The
   marker (M) bit in the RTP packet headers marks the last RTP packet
   comprising a KLVunit.

2.4.  Synchronization of KLV Encoded Data with Other Media

   Usually, each medium in a session utilizes a separate RTP stream.  As
   such, if synchronization of the KLV Encoded Data and other media
   packets is important, the streams MUST be associated when the
   sessions are established and the streams MUST share the same
   reference clock (refer to the description of the timestamp field as
   it relates to synchronization in Section 5.1 of [RFC3550]).  One
   method of associating RTP streams is to use the CNAME field found in
   RTCP SDES packets.  The choice of a specific method for stream
   association is dependent on the particular application and is outside
   the scope of this document.

2.5.  RTP Packet Header

   Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header.  The following fields
   of the RTP fixed header are specified for SMPTE 336M KLV Encoded Data
   streams:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Field     | Usage                                                 |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Payload   | The assignment of an RTP payload type is specific to  |
   | Type (PT) | the RTP profile under which the payload format is     |
   |           | used.  For profiles that use dynamic payload type     |
   |           | number assignment, this payload format can be         |
   |           | identified by the MIME type "application/smpte336m".  |
   | Sequence  | The definition of sequence numbers is available in    |
   | number    | [RFC3550].  When transmitting KLV metadata using the  |
   |           | payload format for application/smpt336m, it is used   |
   |           | for detection of packet loss and out-of-order         |
   |           | packets, and reordering of KLVunits and marking       |
   |           | missing KLVunits.                                     |
   | Timestamp | The RTP Timestamp encodes the approximate instant of  |
   |           | the start of the KLV encoded data in the packet.  A   |
   |           | clock frequency equal to that of the video time base  |
   |           | MUST be used.  Because packets do not represent any   |
   |           | constant duration, the timestamp cannot be used to    |
   |           | directly infer packet loss.                           |
   | M-bit     | The M-bit MUST be included.  The marker bit shall be  |
   |           | set to '1' for any RTP packet which contains the      |
   |           | final byte of a KLVunit.  All other RTP packets shall |
   |           | have the marker bit set to '0'.  This allows          |
   |           | receivers to pass a KLVunit for parsing/decoding      |
   |           | immediately upon receipt of the last RTP packet       |
   |           | comprising the KLVunit.  Without this, a receiver     |
   |           | would need to wait for the next RTP packet with a     |
   |           | different timestamp to arrive, thus signaling the end |
   |           | of one KLVunit and the start of another.              |
   | V         | Version number (currently = 2)                        |
   | P         | Padding bit.  If padding is added the P bit is set.   |
   | X         | The X bit is set to denote that extension headers are |
   |           | present after the fixed RTP header.  X=0 in this      |
   |           | spec.                                                 |
   | CC        | The number of contributing sources (CSRCs) if any.    |

3.  Loss of Data

   RTP is generally deployed in network environments where packet loss
   may occur.  Receivers MUST be prepared to accept gaps in KLV data
   caused by RTP packet loss.  Packet loss can cause the loss of whole
   KLVunits or portions thereof.

3.1.  Damaged KLVunits

   A damaged KLVunit is any KLVunit that was carried in one or more RTP
   packets that have been lost.  Damaged KLVunits can be recognized and
   flagged by looking at the sequence numbers, marker bits, and
   timestamps of the RTP headers.

   Certain patterns of lost packets in a sequence can, to a receiver,
   are indistinguishable between whole lost KLVunits and single damaged
   KLVunits.  One such sequence is given as an example below.  In cases
   such as this, where it is ambiguous if all packets carrying a KLVunit
   have been properly received, receivers SHOULD consider the
   questionable KLVunit as damaged.


     +---------+------+  +----------------+  +---------+------+
     | RTP Hdr | Data |  |                |  | RTP Hdr | Data |
     +---------+------+  +----------------+  +---------+------+
     | ts = 30 |      |  |                |  | ts = 45 |      |
 ... | M = 1   | KLV  |  |                |  | M = 1   | KLV  |
     | seq = 5 |      |  |                |  | seq = 7 |      |
     +---------+------+  +----------------+  +---------+------+
        Last RTP pkt       Lost RTP Packet     RTP pkt for time 45
        For time 30        (seq = 6)           Lost packet may have
                                               included data for KLVunit
                                               of time 45, or may have
                                               been a whole KLVunit with
                                               30 < ts < 45.


3.2.  Treatment of Damaged KLVunits

   KLV data streams are built in such a way that it is possible to
   partially recover from errors or missing data in a stream.  Exact
   specifics of how damaged KLVunits are handled are left to each
   implementation, as different implementations may have differing
   capabilities and robustness in their downstream KLV payload
   processing.  Because some implementations may be particularly limited
   in their capacity to handle damaged KLVunits, receivers MAY drop
   damaged KLVunits entirely.

Internet-Draft       RTP Format for SMPTE 336M Data        December 2009


4.  Recommended Procedure

   This section contains RECOMMENDED procedures for usage of the payload
   format.  Based on the information in the received packets, the
   receiver can:

   o  reorder KLV data received out of order

   o  mark where KLV data is missing/damaged because of packet loss

4.1.  Recommended Basic Procedure

   Packets are transmitted when there is valid KLV data to transmit.
   When new KLV data is available for transmission, it is RECOMMENDED to
   send it as soon as possible.

4.2.  Detection of Lost KLV Packets

   Packet loss for KLVunit packets is detected by observing gaps in the
   sequence numbers of RTP packets received by the receiver.  The
   highest RTP sequence number received may also be compared with that
   in RTCP reports, as an additional check for loss of the last packet
   before an idle period.  Lost data SHOULD be dealt with as described
   in Section 3.

   The sequence number in the RTP packet header is used for detection of
   loss and, therefore, is not suitable for applications where it needs
   to be alternating with other payloads in the same RTP stream.  It
   would be complicated and unreliable to try to detect loss of data at
   the edges of the shifts between KLV data and other stream contents.
   Therefore, application/smpte336m is RECOMMENDED to be the only
   payload type in the RTP stream.

4.3.  Compensation for Packets Out of Order

   For protection against packets arriving out of order, the following
   procedure MAY be implemented in the receiver.  If analysis of a
   received packet reveals a gap in the sequence, the received packet
   SHOULD be kept in a buffer to allow time for the missing packet(s) to
   arrive.

   If a packet with a KLVunit belonging to the gap arrives before the
   waiting time expires, this KLVunit is inserted into the gap and then
   consecutive KLVunits from the leading edge of the gap may be
   consumed.  Any KLVunit that does not arrive before the time limit
   expires should be treated as lost.

5.  Security Considerations

   All of the security considerations from Section 14 of [RFC3550]
   apply.

5.1.  Confidentiality

   Because the intention of the described payload format is to carry KLV
   metadata that adds value to a motion imagery sequence, security
   measures in the form of encryption are of importance.  The amount of
   data in a metadata session can vary greatly, but in general is less
   than the amount of motion imagery data with which it is associated.
   Therefore, any encryption method selected must be done with the final
   application in mind, as it will affect the performance.  Secure Real-
   time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] may provide a suitable
   method for ensuring confidentiality.

5.2.  Integrity

   It will be desirable to protect the KLV data content of an RTP stream
   against manipulation.  SRTP [RFC3711] provides methods for providing
   integrity that MAY be applied.

5.3.  Source Authentication

   There are several methods of making sure the source of the metadata
   is the intended one.

   Metadata streams are usually used in a multimedia control
   environment.  Security measures for authentication are available and
   SHOULD be applied in the registration and session establishment
   procedures, so that the identity of the sender of the metadata stream
   is reliably associated with the person or device setting up the
   session.  Once established, SRTP [RFC3711] mechanisms MAY be applied
   to ascertain that the source is maintained the same during the
   session.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIME type "application/smpte336m" has been assigned by the IANA
   in the MIME Media Types registry to describe a stream of KLV data
   conforming to [SMPTE336M].

   The media subtype "smpte336m" under media type "application" has been
   registered by the IANA in the RTP Payload Format media types registry
   to indicate RTP payload data in a format described by this RFC.

6.1.  Registration of MIME media type application/smpte336m

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: smpte336m

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: None

      Security considerations: None

      Interoperability considerations: None


7.  SDP Mapping

   The information carried in the application/smpte336m MIME media type
   specification has a specific mapping to fields in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], which is commonly used to
   describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is used to specify sessions
   employing data of type application/smpte336m, the mapping is as
   follows:

   o  The "media" field in the SDP media description line ("m=") is set
      to the MIME type ("application").

   o  The "encoding name" field of the SDP "a=rtpmap" line is set to
      smpte336m to indicate the MIME media subtype of smpte336m.

   o  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" SHOULD be a sub-multiple of the
      video clock rate for application/smpte336m.
