Abstract

   The precise syntax allowed in top-level domain name labels has been
   the subject to some debate.  RFC 1123, for example, makes the
   statement that top-level domain names are "alphabetic".  This
   document updates the definition of allowable top-level domain names
   in order to support internationalized domain names (IDNs), as encoded
   by the IDNA protocols.  This document focuses narrowly on the issue
   of IDNs and does not make any other changes or clarifications to
   existing domain name syntax rules.

Internet-Draft     Top Level Domain Name Specification      October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The precise syntax allowed in top-level domain (TLD) name labels has
   been the subject to some debate.  RFC 1123 [RFC1123], for example,
   states that TLD names must be "alphabetic", which is interpreted as
   excluding the hyphen (or dash) character.  This document updates the
   definition of allowable top-level domain names to support
   internationalized domain names that consist of Unicode letters, as
   encoded by the IDNA protocols [RFCXXX].  In particular, this document
   clarifies that ASCII TLDs beginning with the IDN A-label prefix
   (currently "xn--"), as encoded by IDNA, are permissible as DNS TLD
   names as long as they are made from Unicode letters.  This document
   focuses narrowly on the issue of allowable ASCII labels encoded by
   the IDNA protocols and does not (and is not intended to) make any
   other changes or clarifications to existing domain name syntax rules.

1.1.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is as defined in RFC 0952
   [RFC0952] and RFC 1035 [RFC1035].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     Top Level Domain Name Specification      October 2009


2.  Background

   RFC 0952 [RFC0952] states (among other things) that a host name is;

      ... a text string up to 24 characters drawn from the alphabet
      (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus sign (-), and period (.).  Note that
      periods are only allowed when they serve to delimit components of
      "domain style names".  (See RFC-921, "Domain Name System
      Implementation Schedule", for background).  No blank or space
      characters are permitted as part of a name.  No distinction is
      made between upper and lower case.  The first character must be an
      alpha character.  The last character must not be a minus sign or
      period.

   RFC 1123 [RFC1123] reaffirms this definition, making two additional
   changes to the syntax:

      The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified in RFC-952
      [DNS:4].  One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the
      restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow either a
      letter or a digit.  Host software MUST support this more liberal
      syntax.

   and

      However, a valid host name can never have the dotted-decimal form
      #.#.#.#, since at least the highest-level component label will be
      alphabetic.

   The restrictions on host names and specifically TLD names have always
   been, at least in part, driven by human factors considerations.
   Underscores in host names are avoided because they are
   indistinguishable from hyphens when seen on a page or written in
   longhand, and to some extent because of early internationalization
   issues.  The original "no leading digits" rule was driven by wanting
   to make sure that even imprecise programming or human thought errors
   didn't confuse addresses with names.

   The wish to express TLD names in other scripts than Latin makes it
   necessary to relax the the rules for TLD names.  However, the old
   motivations for keeping the TLD names alphabetical still hold, and
   furthermore, certain characteristics of some IDN names with digits in
   them make them unsuitable as DNS labels.  The problem is referred to
   as "jumping digits", and is described in draft-ietf-idnabis-bidi.

   In order to keep changes to existing specifications to a minimum but
   to still allow for IDN TLD names, this document hereby changes the
   existing specification to allow for IDN TLD names in the "A-label

   form" as specified by the IDNA-2008 specifications, i.e., an ASCII-
   compatible-encoding, using reversible Punycode conversion from valid
   IDN labels, with IDN A-label prefix (currently "xn--"), but requiring
   that the native-character ("Unicode") form consist of letters only.

   Hence, the ABNF expression that matches a valid TLD label is as
   follows:


             tldlabel = traditional-tld-label / idn-label

             traditional-tld-label = 1*63(ALPHA)

             idn-label = Restricted-A-label

             ALPHA    = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z


   Restricted-A-label is an A-label as defined in draft-ietf-idna-defs
   converted from (and convertible to) a U-label that is consistent with
   the definition in draft-ietf-idna-defs and that is further restricted
   to contain only Unicode characters of General Category "L".  Note
   that "L" contains several sub-categories.  The list is:


             ; Letter
             L = Ll / Lm / Lo / Lt / Lu

             Ll = Lowercase-Letter

             Lm = Modifier-Letter

             Lo = Other-Letter

             Lt = Titlecase-Letter

             Lu = Uppercase-Letter


   although IDNA prohibits (categorizes as DISALLOWED) all characters in
   the last two categories and several of the characters that fall into
   the other categories.

   This new specification reflects current practice in registration of
   TLD names by the IANA, and allows for IDNs.

3.  Other Limitations on Top Level Domain Labels

   It should be noted that there are many issues that must be considered
   in making any changes to current restrictions on DNS labels,
   especially at the top level.  DNS software is widely deployed, and
   some of that software contains embedded assumptions that may not hold
   if DNS names are used at the top level that differ from the older
   rules.  For example, when TLDs longer than 3 characters became
   available (e.g., .info, .museum, etc.), some deployed systems did not
   process such DNS names properly.  This document does not take the
   position that no problems will result when IDN TLDs are created, but
   does recognize that relaxing the syntax of allowed TLDs is necessary
   in order to allow deployment of IDNs to happen.

   It is also carefully noted that the above specification is not the
   only limiting factor on TLD labels.  There may be other entities than
   the IETF that have influence over TLD names, and which may decide to
   restrict the names further.  The above technical specification is
   just one limiting factor.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo changes the specifications for TLD names registered by the
   IANA, and the IANA is requested to change its registration process to
   use the above specification.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document is believed to have limited security consequences.

   It may introduce stability issues where names registered under this
   new specification may inter-operate badly with old software written
   to enforce a strict interpretation of the old specification.  This
   might also open up attack vectors (e.g. form names being truncated).
   However, it is believed that such software is scarce on the Internet,
   and since TLD names that do not adhere to a strict interpretation of
   the old specification are already used (including test IDNs) without
   apparent problems, it is believed that this change of the
   specification will not create major stability or security problems on
   the Internet.

Appendix A.  To Do

   1.  Clean up references.  Check situation with references to Internet
       Drafts.  Are they/will they be published as RFCs before this
       draft?

   2.  Verify quotations.

   3.  Get rid of the term "jumping digits" and replace with appropriate
       wording.  Also mention additional reasons not to have digits that
       relate to Input Method Editors and localization.
