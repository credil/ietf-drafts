Abstract

   The EDI-INT AS1, AS2 and AS3 messages were designed specifically for
   the transport of EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be
   placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending
   multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption of EDI-INT
   grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport.
   Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted
   together and stored in a single message.  This informational draft
   describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be
   attached and transmitted in a single EDI-INT transport message.  The
   attachments are stored within the MIME Multipart/Related structure.
   A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is
   provided.

Internet-Draft      Multiple Attachments for EDI-INT           June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The primary work of EDI-INT was to develop a secure means of
   transporting EDI documents over the Internet.  This was described in
   the three working group developed standards for secure transport over
   SMTP AS1 [RFC3335], HTTP AS2 [RFC4130] and FTP AS3 [RFC4823].  For
   most uses of EDI, all relevant information to complete a single
   business transaction could be stored in a single document.  As
   adoption of EDI-INT grew, new industries and businesses began using
   AS2 and needing to include multiple documents in a single message to
   complete a trading partner transaction.  These documents were a
   variety of MIME media types.  This informational draft describes how
   to use the MIME multipart/related body structure within EDI-INT
   messages to store multiple document attachments.  Details of
   computing the MIC value over this body is covered.  A minimum listing
   of MIME media types to support within the multipart/related body is
   given along with information on extracting these documents.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Using Multiple-Attachments in EDI-INT

2.1.  Multipart/Related Structure

   Multiple payload attachments for EDI-INT messages are stored within a
   multipart/related MIME body [RFC2387].  The multipart/related
   structure allows an multiple number of MIME attachments or message
   payloads to be communicated in a single structure and message.

   The attached payloads can be of any MIME content-type depending on
   the trading partner agreement, but section 2.4 lists the content-
   types which MUST be supported.  The use and format of the multipart/
   related body follows the rules in RFC 2387, including the required
   type parameter to determine the root body part.  The use of the
   optional start parameter is recommended.

2.2.  EDI-INT Features Header

   To indicate support for multiple-attachments (MA), an EDI-INT
   application MUST use the EDI-INT Features header [RFC6017].  The
   Feature Header indicates the instance application can support various
   features, such as certification exchange.  The header is present in
   all messages from the instance application, not just those which

   feature certification exchange.

   For applications implementing multiple attachments, the MA-Feature-
   Name MUST be used within the EDI-INT Features header as listed in
   this ABNF [RFC5234] syntax:

       MA-Feature-Name = "multiple-attachments"

   An example of the EDI-INT Features header in a message from an
   application supporting MA:

       EDIINT-Features: multiple-attachments

2.3.  MIC Calculation

   MIC calculation in an EDI-INT message with multiple attachments is
   performed in the same manner as for a single EDI payload.  The only
   difference is calculating the message integrity check (MIC) over the
   whole multipart/related body rather than a single EDI payload.
   Section 5.2.1 of AS1 [RFC3335] and section 2 of EDIINT COMPRESSION
   [RFC5402] describe the MIC calculations used for single payload
   document within an EDI-INT message.  The approach is summerized below
   for multipart/related.  Refer to stated sections above for more
   details.

   For a compressed but unsigned message, regardless of encryption, the
   MIC is calculated over the uncompressed multipart/related body
   including any applied Content-Transfer-Encoding.  The body MUST be
   canonicalized according to the procedure described in the underlying
   transport protocol (e.g.  HTTP AS2 [RFC4130]) before the MIC is
   calculated.

   For an encrypted but unsigned and uncompressed message, the MIC is
   calculated on the decrypted multipart/related body, including header
   and all attached documents.  The body MUST be canonicalized according
   to the procedure described in the underlying transport protocol (e.g.
   HTTP AS2 [RFC4130]) before the MIC is calculated.

   For an unsigned and unencrypted message, the MIC is calculated over
   the data inside the multipart/related boundaries prior to Content-
   Transfer-Encoding.  However, unsigned and unencrypted messages SHOULD
   NOT be sent due to lack of security.

   If the expected MIC value differs from the calculated MIC value, all
   attachments MUST be considered invalid and retransmitted.

2.4.  Document Processing

   Upon receipt of an EDI-INT message with multiple attachments, the
   receiving user agent MUST be able to extract the attached payloads
   from the message rather than only removing the multipart/related body
   from the message.  The storing or processing of the documents as they
   relate to the pending transaction is implementation dependent.

2.5.  Content-Types to Support

   Documents of the following MIME media types MAY be found in a
   multipart/related body and MUST be accepted by the user agent.
   However, any media type can be used depending upon industry need, and
   other media types MAY be accepted depending upon trading partner
   agreement.

3.  Example Message

   Here is an example AS2 message which uses two attachments.  The first
   attachment is an XML document which is the root attachment, and the
   second attachment is a PDF document.  For both the XML and PDF
   documents as well as the applied digital signature, their content has
   been omitted for size consideration.  This example is provided as an
   illustration only and is not considered part of the specification.
   If the example conflicts with the definitions specified above or in
   the other referenced RFCs, the example is considered invalid.

4.  Security Considerations

   Multiple attachments have very similar security concerns to what is
   described in the three EDI-INT transport standards.  This includes
   the importance of using strong cryptography and the necessity of
   using valid certificates and chaining to a trusted CA.  Please refer
   to these standards for details of their security considerations.

   The only additional security consideration is that if the MIC
   calculation by user agent differs from expected MIC calculation, all
   the attached documents MUST be considered invalid.  Because the MIC
   calculation is over the multipart/related body, the MIC validates the
   content-integrity of all the documents.
