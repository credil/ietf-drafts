1.   Introduction 

   This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. In particular, it describes managed objects to configure
   and/or monitor Bi-Directional Forwarding Detection for [BFD] and
   [BFD-MH],BFD versions 0 and/or 1, on devices supporting this
   feature.

   -- Ed Note: TBA, support for [BFD-LSP].

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [BFD], [BFD-MH] and [BFD-LSP]. Unless otherwise 
   stated, the mechanisms described therein will not be re-described 
   here.

   Comments should be made directly to the BFD mailing list at
   rtg-bfd@ietf.org.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].
    
2.   Terminology 
             
   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms

3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].
    
4.   Brief Description of MIB Objects 
    
      This section describes objects pertaining to BFD. The MIB objects 
   are derived from [BFD] and [BFD-MH].
    
4.1     General Variables 
    
      The General Variables are used to identify parameters that are 
   global to the BFD process.  
 
4.2    Session Table (bfdSessionTable) 
    
      The session table is used to identify a BFD session between a pair 
   of nodes.  
 
4.3    Session Performance Table (bfdSessionPerfTable) 
    
      The session performance table is used for collecting BFD 
   performance counts on a per session basis. This table is an AUGMENT 
   to the bfdSessionTable. 
    
4.4    BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table (bfdSessDiscMapTable) 
    
      The BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table maps a local
   discriminator value to associated BFD sessions' BfdSessIndexTC used
   in the bfdSessionTable.

4.5    BFD Session IP Mapping Table (bfdSessIpMapTable) 

      The BFD Session IP Mapping Table maps, given bfdSessInterface,
   bfdSessAddrType, and bfdSessAddr, to an associated BFD sessions'
   BfdSessIndexTC used in the bfdSessionTable. This table SHOULD
   contains those BFD sessions are of IP type.

6.   Security Considerations 
    
      There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB 
   module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some 
   network environments. It is thus important to control even GET and/or 
   NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the 
   values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP. 
    
   o The bfdSessTable may be used to directly configure BFD 
     sessions. The bfdSessMapTable can be used indirectly 
     in the same way. Unauthorized access to objects in 
     this table could result in disruption of traffic on 
     the network. This is especially true if an unauthorized 
     user configures enough tables to invoke a denial of 
     service attack on the device where they are configured,
     or on a remote device where the sessions terminate.

      Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects 
   with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus 
   important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects 
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and 
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o The bfdSessPerfTable both allows access to the performance 
     characteristics of BFD sessions. Network administrators not
     wishing to show this information should consider this
     table sensative. 
    
      SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects 
   in these MIB modules.  
    
      It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8", 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
   authentication and privacy".

BFD MIB                                            February 25, 2008



      Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate  
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them. 
    
7.  IANA Considerations

   There is one MIB module contained in this document. The following 
   "IANA Considerations" subsection requests IANA for a new 
   assignment under the mib-2 subtree.  New assignments can only 
   be made via a Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].

7.1.  IANA Considerations for BFD-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the BFD-STD-MIB
   module specified in this document.
