Abstract 
    
   In certain networks there is a dependency on edge-to-edge LSPs setup 
   by LDP, e.g. networks that are used for MPLS VPN applications. For 
   such applications it is not possible to rely on IP forwarding if the 
   MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately. Blackholing of labeled 
   traffic can occur in situations where the IGP is operational on a 
   link but LDP is not operational on that link. While the link could 
   still be used for IP forwarding, it is not useful for MPLS

1. Introduction 
    
   LDP [RFC5036] establishes MPLS LSPs along the shortest path to a 
   destination as determined by IP forwarding.  In a common network 
   design, LDP is used to provide label switched paths throughout the 
   complete network domain covered by an IGP such as OSPF [RFC2328] or 
   IS-IS [ISO.10589.1992], i.e. all links in the domain MAY have IGP 
   as well as LDP adjacencies. 
    
   A variety of services a network provider may want to deploy over an 
   LDP enabled network depend on the availability of edge to edge 
   label switched paths.  In a L2 or L3 VPN scenario for example, a 
   given PE router relies on the availability of a complete MPLS 
   forwarding path to the other PE routers for the VPNs it serves.  
   This means that along the IP shortest path from one PE router to 
   the other, all the links need to have operational LDP sessions and 
   the necessary label binding must have been exchanged over those 
   sessions.  If only one link along the IP shortest path is not 
   covered by an LDP session, a blackhole exists and services 
   depending on MPLS forwarding will fail. This might be a transient

   or a persistent error condition.  Some of the reasons for it could 
   be 
    
     - A configuration error 
      
     - An implementation bug 
      
     - The link has just come up and has an IGP adjacency but LDP has 
        either not yet established an adjacency or session or 
        distributed all the label bindings. 
 
   LDP protocol has currently no way to correct the issue, LDP is not 
   a routing protocol; it can not re-direct traffic to an alternate 
   IGP path. 
 
    
2. Proposed Solution  
    
   The problem described above exists because LDP is tied to IP 
   forwarding decisions but no coupling between the IGP and LDP 
   operational state on a given link exists.  If IGP is operational on 
   a link but LDP is not, a potential network problem exists.  So the 
   solution described by this document is to discourage a link from 
   being used for IP forwarding as long as LDP is not fully 
   operational.   
    
   This has some similarity to the mechanism specified in [RFC3137] 
   which allows an OSPF router to advertise that it should not be used 
   as a transit router.  One difference is that [RFC3137] raises the 
   link costs on all (stub) router links, while the mechanism 
   described in here applies on a per-link basis. 
    
   In detail: when LDP is not "fully operational" (see below) on a 
   given link, the IGP will advertise the link with maximum cost to 
   avoid any transit traffic over it if possible.  In the case of 
   OSPF, this cost is LSInfinity (16-bit value 0xFFFF) as proposed in 
   [RFC3137]. In the case of ISIS, the max metric value is 2^24-2 
   (0xFFFFFE). Indeed, if a link is configured with 2^24-1 (the 
   maximum link metric per [RFC3784]) then this link is not advertised 
   in the topology. It is important to keep the link in the topology 
   to allow for IP traffic to use the link as a last resort in case of 
   massive failure.  
    
   LDP is considered fully operational on a link when an LDP hello 
   adjacency exists on it, a suitable associated LDP session (matching 
   the LDP Identifier of the hello adjacency) is established to the 
   peer at the other end of the link and all label bindings have been 
   exchanged over the session. At the present time, the latter

   condition can not generally be verified by a router and some 
   estimated may have to be used. A simple implementation strategy is 
   to use a configurable hold down timer to allow LDP session 
   establishment before declaring LDP fully operational. The default 
   timer is not defined in this document due to the concerns of the 
   large variations of the LIB table size and the equipment 
   capabilities. In addition, this is a current work in progress on LDP 
   End-of-LIB as specified in [LDP End-of-LIB], it enables the LDP 
   speaker to signal the completion of its initial advertisement 
   following session establish. When LDP End-of-LIB is implemented, the 
   configurable hold down timer is no longer needed. The neighbor LDP 
   session is considered fully operational when the End-of-LIB 
   notification message is received. 
 
   This is typically sufficient to deal with the link when it is being 
   brought up. LDP protocol extensions to indicate the complete 
   transmission of all currently available label bindings after a 
   session has come up are conceivable but not addressed in this 
   document. 
    
   The mechanism described in this document does not entail any 
   protocol changes and is a local implementation issue.   
 
   The problem space and solution specified in this document have also 
   been discussed in an IEEE Communications Magazine paper [LDP-Fail]. 
    
    
3.  Applicability 
    
   In general, the proposed procedure is applicable in networks where 
   the availability of LDP signaled MPLS LSPs and avoidance of 
   blackholes for MPLS traffic is more important than always choosing 
   an optimal path for IP forwarded traffic. Note however that non-
   optimal IP forwarding only occurs for a short time after a link 
   comes up or when there is a genuine problem on a link.  In the 
   latter case an implementation should issue network management alerts 
   to report the error condition and enable the operator to address it. 
    
   Example network scenarios that benefit from the mechanism described 
   here are MPLS VPNs and BGP-free core network designs where traffic 
   can only be forwarded through the core when LDP forwarding state is 
   available throughout. 
    
   The usefulness of this mechanism also depends on the availability 
   of alternate paths with sufficient bandwidth in the network should 
   one link be assigned to the maximum cost due to unavailability of 
   LDP service over it. 
    

     
   M. Jork, Alia Atlas, and L. Fang                           [Page 4] 
    
    
   LDP IGP Synchronization                             November 2008 
    
   On broadcast links with more than one IGP/LDP peer, the cost-out 
   procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole and not an 
   individual peer.  So a policy decision has to be made whether the 
   unavailability of LDP service to one peer should result in the 
   traffic being diverted away from all the peers on the link. 
 
    
4. Interaction With TE Tunnels 
    
   In some networks, LDP is used in conjunction with RSVP-TE which sets 
   up traffic-engineered tunnels.  The path computation for the TE 
   tunnels is based on the TE link cost which is flooded by the IGP in 
   addition to the regular IP link cost.  The mechanism described in 
   this document should only be applied to the IP link cost to prevent 
   any unnecessary TE tunnel reroutes. 
    
   In order to establish LDP LSPs across a TE tunnel, a targeted LDP 
   session between the tunnel endpoints needs to exist.  This presents 
   a problem very similar to the case of a regular LDP session over a 
   link (the case discussed so far): when the TE tunnel is used for IP 
   forwarding, the targeted LDP session needs to be operational to 
   avoid LDP connectivity problems.  Again, raising the IP cost of the 
   tunnel while there is no operational LDP session will solve the 
   problem. When there is no IGP adjacency over the tunnel and the 
   tunnel is not advertised as link into the IGP, this becomes a local 
   issue of the tunnel headend router. 
 
5. Security Considerations 
 
   A DoS attack brings down LDP service on a link or prevents it from 
   becoming operational on a link could be one of the possibilities 
   that causes LDP related traffic blackholing. This document does not 
   address how to prevent LDP session failure. The mechanism described 
   here is to prevent the link to be used when LDP is not operational 
   while IGP is. Assigning the IGP cost to maximum on the link where 
   LDP is failed and IGP is not should not introduce new security 
   threats. The operation is internal in the router to allow LDP and 
   IGP to communicate and react. Making many LDP links unavailable, 
   however, is a security threat which can cause traffic being dropped 
   due to limited available network capacity. This may be trigged by 
   operational error or implementation error. They are considered as 
   general Security issues and should follow the current best security 
   practice.
