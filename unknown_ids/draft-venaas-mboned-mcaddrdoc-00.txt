                 Multicast Addresses for Documentation
                  draft-venaas-mboned-mcaddrdoc-00.txt

Abstract

   This document reserves IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses for use in
   documentation, RFCs etc.  Some multicast addresses are derived from
   AS numbers or unicast addresses.  This document also explains how
   these can be used for documentation purposes by deriving them from AS
   numbers and unicast addresses that are reserved for such purposes.

Internet-Draft    Multicast Addresses for Documentation        July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Often it is useful in documentation to give examples containing IP
   multicast addresses.  To prevent conflicts or confusion, one should
   avoid using multicast addresses that may be in actual use.  For
   unicast there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses reserved for this, see
   [RFC5737] and [RFC3849] respectively.  There are however no multicast
   addresses available for such purposes.  This document reserves such
   addresses.

   There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
   numbers of unicast addresses.  For examples where such addresses are
   desired, one should derive them from AS numbers and unicast addresses
   reserved for documentation purposes.  This document also lists these.

2.  Documentation IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses

   For documentation where examples of general purpose multicast
   addresses are needed, one should use multicast addresses that never
   will be in actual use.

   The IPv4 multicast address allocated for documentation purposes is
   TBD.  The IPv6 multicast address allocated for documentation purposes
   is TBD.

3.  GLOP multicast addresses

   GLOP [RFC3180] is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast group
   addresses from 16 bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP addresses
   are desired, the addresses should be derived from the AS numbers
   reserved for documentation use.  See [RFC5398].

4.  Unicast prefix based multicast addresses

   IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes.
   The two ways currently defined are unicast-prefix based addresses
   [RFC3306] and Embedded-RP addresses [RFC3956].  There is also a
   proposal for doing this with IPv4
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-ipv4-uni-based-mcast].  For examples where these
   types of addresses are desired, the addresses should be derived from
   unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes.  For IPv4, see
   [RFC5737].  For IPv6, see [RFC3849].

5.  Other multicast addresses

   For both IPv4 and IPv6, multicast address ranges have been defined
   for link-local, SSM, admin scoped etc.  It may be considered to
   reserve a multicast address from these ranges for the purpose of
   documentation.  For IPv6 this can be done by assigning a Group ID,
   see [RFC3307].

6.  Security Considerations

   The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes
   has no impact on security.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign both an IPv4 multicast address and an
   IPv6 multicast address for documentation purposes.
