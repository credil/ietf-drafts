                 draft-manral-isis-trill-multi-topo-01


Abstract

   This document describes an optional extensions to the TRILL protocol.
   The extensions uses Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-
   IS) as the control plane, to support multiple topologies (MT) within
   the same TRILL protocol instance of IS-IS.  It describes how to run
   Multiple Independent TRILL topologies, within a single IS-IS domain.

INTERNET-DRAFT                           TRILL Multi Topology Extensions


1. Introduction

   Maintaining Multiple topologies in an Rbridge campus requires
   extensions to the base TRILL protocol and its use of IS-IS.  These
   extensions change the packet encoding on the wire as well as the SPF
   calculation.  This document describes all such extensions so that
   multiple topologies can be supported as described in [RFC5120].



2. Terminology

   IS-IS: Intermediate-System to Intermediate-System

   LSP: Link State Protocol Data Unit (PDU)

   Rbridge: Routing Bridge

   SPF: Shortest Path First Algorithm

   TRILL: Transparent Interconnection with Lots of Links

   TLV: Type, Length and Value



3. TLV enhancement for Multitopology

   Currently the Router Capability TLV is specified in [RFC4971].  For
   TRILL most sub-TLV's are carried in the Router Capability TLV.  The
   Router Capability TLV carries information only for a single Topology.

   The following are the extensions required to TRILL use of IS-IS to
   support multi-topology use:

   1. The Trees sub-TLV, the Tree Identifiers sub-TLV and the VLAN Group
      sub-TLV, MAY be encapsulated in the MT-CAP TLV [ISISieee].

   2. The Multi-Topology TLV [RFC5120] MAY be advertized in the TRILL
      LAN Hellos.  It will contain one or more MT's the Rbridge is
      participating in.

   3. The MTU sub-TLV [ISIStrill] MAY occur in the MT ISN TLV #222
      [RFC5120] as well as in the Extended IS Reachability TLV #22.

4. Multi-Topology changes to Routing

   For unicast, the Multi-Topology SPF routing calculations will be done
   spearately for each topology.  The ingress RBridge and each transit
   RBridge forwarding a unicast frame addressed to a know destination
   will forward the frame in a particular topology.  The method by which
   such known unicast frames are classified as belonging to a particular
   topology is beyond the scope of this document.

   Multi-destination frames (broadcast, multicast, and unicast to an
   unkown destination) are sent over a distribution tree but each
   distribution tree is calculated for a single topology.  Thus, the
   ingress RBridge for a multi-destination frame is the only RBridge
   that must classify that frame as being in a particular topology as
   part of the process of deciding which tree to distribute it over.
   The method by which the ingress RBridge makes this determination is
   beyond the scope of this document.

   Should the information being advertised in the link state by the
   RBridge with the highest priority to be a tree root appear to specify
   that the same tree (i.e., same nickname) be calculated in more than
   one topology, that tree is only calculated in the lowest numbered of
   those topologies.  If it is desired to have two distribution trees
   rooted at the same RBridge in different topologies, then that RBridge
   must be allocated at least two nicknames (a capability already preent
   in TRILL) so that different nicnames can be used for the different
   topology trees.

   The sub-TLV's, if any, present in the Router Capability TLV will be
   used for MT#0 calculations, only if the information is not there for
   MT#0 in the MT-CAP-TLV.



5.  Multi-Topology changes to Appointer Forwarders

   The TRILL ISIS election protocol is a bit different from Layer-3 IS-
   IS.  The DRB is responsible for specifing the designated VLAN for
   communication between the Rbridges on the Link [RFCtrill] [RFCadj].

   The DRB algorithm is changed such that there is an appointed VLAN
   forwarder for each of the topologies for each VLAN.  The appointed
   forwarder sub-TLV is already a part of the MT-PORT-CAP TLV, which is
   Multi-Topology Aware.

6. Security Considerations

   The extensions to TRILL use of IS-IS specified herein add no new
   Security Considerations beyond those already present with multi-
   topology IS-IS and TRILL.  See [RFC5120] for IS-IS multi-topology
   security considerations.  See [RFCtrill] for TRILL base protocol
   security considerations.



7. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the subregistry of the IS-IS TLV Code
   points Registry which shows permitted occurrence of sub-TLVs within
   TLVs #22, #141, and #222 to show that the MTU sub-TLV is permitted in
   TLV #222 as well as in TLV #22.

   IANA is requested to assign sub-TLV numbers within the MT-CAP TLV
   [ISISieee] for the Trees sub-TLV, the Tree Identifiers sub-TLV, and
   the VLAN Group sub-TLV [ISIStrill].  Noting that there is no conflict
   between the numbers of these sub-TLVs within the Router Capabilities
   TLV #242 and with any other number so far assigned within the MT-CAP
   TLV, it is requested that these sub-TLVs be assigned the same number
   within the MT-CAP TLV as they have within the Router Capabilities TLV
   #242.

   It is further suggested that the sub-registries for Router
   Capabilities TLV #242 and the MT-CAP TLV [ISIStrill] might be
   combined in the style of the existing IANA sub-registry for sub-TLVs
   of TLVs #22, #141, and #222.  While there would be some duplication
   of sub-TLV numbers in such a combined registry, there would be no
   duplication within a particular TLV because, where there are two sub-
   TLVs with the same number, one is limited to the Router Capability
   TLV and the other is limited to the MT-CAP TLV.

   IANA is requested to allocate a value in the IS-IS Multi-Topology ID
   Values registry as follows:
