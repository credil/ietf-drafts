Internet-Draft    Forcing Fragmentation of IPv6 Packets    December 2011


1.  Background

   In order to avoid PMTUD [RFC 1191] in IPv6 an application must not
   only force packets to be fragmented at the network MTU it must also
   force the addition of a Fragment header to unfragmented packets
   otherwise PTB ICMPv6 may be sent if the packet goes through a IPv6 to
   IPv4 translating router [RFC 2460].

   The Advanced Sockets API for IPv6 [RFC 3542] provides mechanisms to
   force fragmentation of packet greater than the network MTU
   (IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU).  It also provides mechanisms to prevent
   fragmentation of a packet (IPV6_DONTFRAG).  It however does not
   provide a mechanism to force a fragmentation header to be added.
   This document intends to add such a mechanism.

   There appears to be 3 viable alternatives. 1) extend IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU
   to force the inclusion of a Fragment header. 2) extend IPV6_DONTFRAG
   to signal that a Fragment header needs to be included. 3) add a new
   socket option like IPV6_DOFRAG.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.  Extend IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU

   If IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU is set to 1 then a Fragment header MUST be added
   to both multicast and unicast packets.

   If IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU is set to -1 then a Fragment header MUST be added
   to multicast packets.


3.  Extend IPV6_DONTFRAG

   If IPV6_DONTFRAG is set to -1 (new value) then a Fragment header MUST
   be added to the packet.


4.  Add IPV6_DOFRAG

   This is similar to IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU in that it is a tri-state flag.
   When set to -1 a Fragment header MUST be added to multicast packets.
   When set to 1 a Fragment header MUST be added to both multicast and
   unicast packets.  When set to 0 a Fragment header is only added if

   fragmentation would otherwise happen.

         int on = 1;
         setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_DOFRAG, &on, sizeof(on));

   Setting IPV6_DONTFRAG to 1 will force IPV6_DOFRAG to 0.

   Setting IPV6_DOFRAG to 1 or -1 will force IPV6_DONTFRAG to 0.


5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA Considerations.


6.  Security Considerations
