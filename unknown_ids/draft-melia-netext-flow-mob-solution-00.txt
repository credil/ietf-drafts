         Proxy Mobile IPv6 extensions for flow mobility support
                draft-melia-netext-flow-mob-solution-00

Abstract

   The Netext WG has been recently rechartered to determine what Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 extensions are required for flow mobility support of a MN
   implementing the signle IP interface hiding mechanism.  This document
   briefly introduces the single IP interface hiding mechanism and it
   derives the associated protocol operations to enable seamless flow
   mobility across multiple access networks.  These extensions are
   intended to allow such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on
   multiple physical media in a simultaneous and possibly discriminated
   manner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain.  A typical usage of these
   extensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination through
   multiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MN
   physical media to VOIP traffic and another MN media to HTTP traffic).

   The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backward
   compatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification.  In addition
   these extensions use, when possible, existing specifications related
   to multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statement
   of Netext Working Group.

1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology:

   MIGID  Multi6interfqce Group ID: a set of physical interfaces (two or
      more) belonging to the same MN.  On the same MN multiple MIGID can
      be configured.

   NIC  Network Interface Card: it provides physical access to a
      networking medium and provides a low-level addressing system
      through the use of MAC addresses.

   Bonding  Ethernet bonding: is a computer networking arrangement in
      which two or more network interfaces on a host computer are
      combined for redundancy or increased throughput.

   MASTER  Master of the bonding device.

   SLAVE  Slave of the bonding device.

   UL Up Link: flows sent from the MN to the network.

   DL Down link: flows send from the network to the MN.


2.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provides network
   based mobility management to hosts connecting to a PMIPv6 domain.
   PMIPv6 introduces two functional entities, the Local Mobility Anchor
   (LMA) and the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG).  The MAG is the first
   layer-three hop detecting MN attachment and providing IP
   connectivity.  The LMA is the entity assigning one or more Home
   Network Prefix (HNP) to the MN and is the topological anchor for all
   traffic from/to the MN.

   PMIPv6 allows a MN to connect to the same PMIPv6 domain through
   multiple interfaces.  However in such a case, PMIPv6 requires each
   interface to be assigned a set of distinct IPv6 address(es) and thus
   prevents from flow mobility capabilities.  The revised Netext charter
   imposes that the MN uses a single logical IP interface to hide the
   use of multiple wireless/wired media to the IP stack.  In this
   context the MN is requested to:

   o  configure the logical IP interface (master) and bind to this
      logical interface two or more wireless/wired physical media
      (slaves)

Internet-Draft                Flow Mobility                   March 2010


   o  perform layer two network attachment and co-ordinate neighbor
      discovery mechanisms

   o  configure one or more IPv4 and/or IPv6 HNP on the logical IP
      interface

   o  configure local policies for physical media selection for UL
      traffic

   o  send/receive triggers for flow mobility to/from the network and
      local policy update

   Configuration of a single logical IP interface strictly depends on
   the OS running in the MN.  In Linux/Unix systems virtual interfaces
   can be configured with the bonding technology.  Ethernet bonding (or
   NIC teaming in Windows OS) allows a host equipped with two or more
   Ethernet NICs to be connected to one or more layer two switch and to
   exploit the different NICs for different purposes being reliability,
   load balancing and bandwidth aggregation some of the possible use
   cases.  As an example, a host equipped with 4 NICs can configure its
   bonding module for reliability.  In case one of the NICs notifies a
   link failure the following one in the slaves list can take the relay.
   Alternatively a server, equipped with multiple NICs can be configured
   to optimize bandwidth aggregation.  For an exhaustive list of the
   different bonding modes in Linux please refer to the Ethernet bonding
   driver.  Under the Window OS the NDIS driver type can be used to
   create an NDIS Intermediate Driver.  Intermediate drivers sit in-
   between the MAC and IP layers and can control all traffic being
   accepted by the NIC card.

   Upon logical interface configuration the MN should perform network
   attachment and IPv6 neighbor discovery.  If we consider the Linux
   bonding interface, the logical interface (master) and the physical
   interfaces (slave) share the same MAC address.  The PMIPv6 domain
   where the MN is attaching to can only detect one interface and
   additional intelligence is required to notify the PMIPv6 domain that
   both physical interfaces need to be simultaneously connected to the
   same LMA.  In other words, if the MN attaches the physical interface
   IF1 and configures HNPA, when it attaches physical interface IF2 it
   should always configure HNPA and, accordingly, the LMA should record
   both bindings in the BCE (i.e. this is not an intra-technology
   handover).  Additionally, depending on the configured bonding mode,
   IPv6 neighbor discovery messages should be treated differently than
   data plane (e.g; bonding configured in round robin mode sends packets
   iterating across the interfaces).

   For IP address configuration the MN can exchange DHCP or ND
   signaling.  In case of ND signaling the MN should send RS messages

Internet-Draft                Flow Mobility                   March 2010


   and wait for unicast RA from the MAG.  For DHCP the MN sends a DHCP
   request to the MAG and waits for the DHCP reply carrying the HNP.  In
   both cases, as stated above, the bonding module (given the nature of
   the Ethernet environments where it usually operates) selects any of
   the physical interfaces to send out the packet.  This has
   shortcomings since each for the two links should be carrying DHCP/ND
   messages.  It seems intuitive that layer two interaction is required.

   Upon configuration of one or more HNP on the logical IP interface the
   MN needs to equally configure policies for media selection for UL
   packets routing.  Policies configuration can happen upon network
   attachment ( and transferred to the MN by means of layer two
   signaling) or dynamically via an external channel.  This document
   assumes that L2 signaling can carry such information and that PMIPv6
   signaling can convey the routing policies from/to the LMA to/from the
   MAG.  Along the same lines policies update can occur during the
   lifetime of a binding connection.  Update of such policies may result
   in moving ongoing flows from one access network to another access
   network.

   In principle a MN can have two or more NICs and one or more logical
   interface can be configured.  In this sense logical interface A can
   group IF1 and IF2 and logical interface B can group IF3 and IF4.  The
   document introduces therefore the concept of multi-interface group (a
   logical set of physical interfaces of a MN) and provides the support
   of elementary operations (addition, modification, removal) on a group
   entity for a MN.  This terminology is expected to be more suited to
   the general multi-interface paradigm.  In a first step, a default
   Multi Interface Group ID (MIGID=0) is defined to represent all
   interfaces of a given MN.


3.  OvervieW

   The functional usage of multi-interface MN capabilities in a PMIPv6
   domain is defined by the present specification in a flexible and
   multi-purpose manner.  This allows for various traffic processing in
   a PMIPv6 domain with multi homed MN such as (not limited to): traffic
   blocking, traffic load-balancing or traffic dissemination.  To
   achieve this flexibility, this document uses the concept of "filter"
   to denote a unitary criteria that can be managed between a MAG and a
   LMA in relationship with a MN interface.  Unitary filters can be
   added, deleted and modified on a per multi-interface group basis.
   Flexibility is achieved by allowing an arbitrary filter syntax (or
   grammar) as proposed in [MEXT].  The filter syntax is a matter of
   agreement between MAG and LMA entities.  For the sake of
   understanding, the "flow" and "filter" terminology shall be
   considered equivalent.

            Figure 1: Multi-interface MN with PMIPv6 extensions

   When MN activates if1, MAG1selects the default multi-interface group
   and performs proxy registration toward the LMA.  MAG1 provides
   filters (flow1) during registration.  LMA accepts proxy registration
   from MAG1 and allocates MN addr according to the shared address
   model.  Since proxy registration is requesting flow mobility support,
   LMA stores MAG1 filters that come along with delivery to pCoA1.

   When MN activates if2, MAG2 selects the default multi-interface group
   and perform proxy registration toward the LMA.  MAG2 provides filters
   (flow2) during registration.  LMA accepts proxy registration from
   MAG2 and allocates MN addr according to the shared address model.
   LMA stores MAG2 filters that come along with delivery to pCoA2.  It
   should be noted that for both attachment procedures we assume filters
   can be provided by other means (e..g layer two signaling).

   Later on, LMA receives IP packets destinated to MN addr.  The LMA
   attempts to match each IP packet against filters (flow1, flow2)
   stored for the MN addr.  When a filter match is found (flow1 or
   flow2), the LMA performs the action for the IP packet in the context
   of the matching flow.  In particular if the IP packet is to be
   delivered, the LMA performs delivery using the pCoA associated to the

   filter (pCoA1 on flow1 or pCoA2 on flow2).

   LMA behavior is extended to allow simultaneous transmission of
   downlink (DL) flows to the mobile node across multiple physical
   interfaces.  For UL flows it is assumed that the MN can configure
   local policies base don user preferences, operator policies,
   applications requirements, etc...  This document does not make any
   assumption on the order in which rules should be considered neither
   if some policies have higher priority with respect to others.  This
   document further assumes that the MN is capable of transmitting
   policies at layer two signaling with the MAG., either during network
   attachment or upon reception of specific layer two triggers (e.g.
   Link going down).  In the latter case the MN is said to trigger the
   flow mobility procedure.

   Both LMA and MAG behaviors are extended to provide enhanced Proxy
   Binding management for multi-interface MN.  LMA shall support Binding
   Control Entries (BCE) of multi-interface type.  This includes the
   capability to refer to a multi-interface group id (mhgid) and a set
   of filters in a BCE.  LMA shall support or delegate the downlink
   packet processing and delivery according to flow specifications.
   Both MAG and LMA shall be able to manage flows on a per multi-
   interface group basis.  This document also assumes that the LMA can
   equally start a flow mobility procedure based, for instance, on
   network load conditions.


4.  Conceptual Data Structure

   This specification proposes to extend PMIPv6 to support multiple
   proxy CoAs per mobility session possibly associated with downlink
   transmission criteria using the flow concept.

   Upon MN attachment the MAG determines if the MN should be provided
   with multi-interface service and, if so, selects the flow
   configuration that should be put in place for packet delivery.  The
   MAG can learn this information through a policy store or using
   attachment-specific signaling.  Any of the methods used by the MAG is
   however out of scope of this document.  If the MAG determines that
   the MN can use the multi-interface service it forms a PBU as per
   [RFC5213] and adds a Multi-interface Option (newly defined by this
   document) and possibly one or several Flow Identifier option(s) as
   defined in [MEXT].  The Multi-interface option aims at identifying
   (MHGID) and parameterizing the multi-interface group to be created/
   updated/deleted by the LMA on MAG demand.  The choice of
   identification of the multi-interface group follows the following
   rule:

   All PBUs with the same HNP and MIGID values belong to the same
   mobility session from the LMA perspective.

   In the current revision of the document, only the default multi-
   interface group is supported (id=0).  In addition, multi-interface
   group parameters are left for further study.


        Mobility Session 1                    Mobility Session 1
      +----------------------+              +---------------------+
      | HNP1   PCoA1 MIGID0  |   ========>  | HNP1   PCoA1 migid0 |
      +----------------------+              | HNP1   PCoA2 migid0 |
                                            +---------------------+



          Figure 2: Mobility session extended for multi-interface

   Figure 2 shows how the mobility session is extended to span the same
   HNP across multiple interfaces.  This updates the text in [RFC5213]
   where each single interface is managed under a different mobility
   session.  The MHGID, selected by MAG1 (corresponding to PCoA1) upon
   MN attachment, is stored at the LMA.  When the MN attaches to MAG2
   (corresponding to PCoA2) MAG2 selects its MIGID value.  If both MAG1
   and MAG2 MGHID and HNP values match then the LMA adds PCoA2 -- migid0
   to the already existing mobility session.

   The MAG treats the indication of multi-interface as an explicit
   indication of adding flows to the PBU if any.  Such flows can be
   learned for instance during MN access to the network.

   Upon reception of a PBU containing indication for multi-interface the
   LMA should perform a binding cache lookup and append the information
   to the found BCE.  Filters, if present, are extracted from the PBU
   and processed by the LMA.  The result of Filters processing is
   returned in the PBA by the LMA on an individual basis.


5.  Detailed flow charts

   This section introduces detailed flow charts for multi-interface
   setup, renewal, filters modifications and interface removal/addition.

5.1.  Initial multihoming setup

   Figure 3 shows the attachment of IF1 and subsequently the attachment
   of IF2.  IF1 and IF2 belong to the same multi-interface group ID
   (i.e. the default multi-interface group id 0).

   Filters can also be modified upon reception of an internal or

   filters modification is carried by binding renewal semantics (HI=5).
   The target multi-interface group is set by the MAG in the multi-
   interface option (MHGID field).  This allows MAG to modify at any
   time the downlink filters it is responsible for.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Type
        TBA

    Length

        8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length of the option
        in octets, excluding the type and length fields.  This field
        MUST be set to 2.

    MIGID
        This 8 bit field identifies the multi-interface group the PBU/PBA refer to.
        The value 0 is reserved to the default multi-interface group which includes
        all interfaces of a MN. Only value 0 is currently supported.

    ACT

        This 3-bit field is used to provide optional action to be
        performed by LMA upon removal of an interface from a multi-interface
        group. The field shall only be set by the MAG when HI value in
        PBU is set to 4, otherwise the field shall be set to 0.
        The following bit values are currently defined:

         000: Reserved
         001: Remove filters
         010: Keep filters

    RFU (Reserved for Future Use)

        This 5-bit field is unused for now.  The value MUST be
        initialized to 0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
        receiver.

                     Figure 8: Multi-interface option

   The following considerations on the ACT field apply.  If 001 (Remove
   filters) is set on interface removal, the LMA shall remove all
   filters currently configured.  This might result in downlink traffic
   disruption.  If 010 (Keep filters) is set on interface removal, the
   LMA shall arrange to re-instantiate filters configured on the removed
   interface to existing filters (if any) of other interfaces of the
   multi-interface group if any.  This allows to avoid downlink traffic
   disruption.

   TBD: LMA level decision for flow mobility.

   However, a filter that has been re-instantiated on a interface should
   be advertised by the LMA with a specific status of Flow identifier
   option whenever a MAG performs a filter operation the interface.

6.2.  Flow Identifier Option

   The FID option defined in ID [MEXT] is used in the current
   specification to manage downlink packet delivery across interfaces of
   a multi homed MN.  The option might be used by a MAG to create/
   modify/delete filter(s) on the LMA for a particular multi-interface
   group of a MN.  Upon successful processing and installation of
   filter(s) at LMA level an individual status (Status field) shall be
   returned to the MAG by the LMA.  The LMA should later evaluate
   packets destinated to a MN through filters installed by MAG(s) that
   are proxying the MN under the same mobility session.  The LMA must
   perform the action(s) associated to the matching filter(s).

   In case, the LMA re-instantiates flows on a multi-interface group
   toward a MAG for a given MN, the LMA shall perform the following
   processing:

   o  Allocate a unique FID to the re-instantiated filter within the
      context of existing filters for the multi-interface group of the
      MN toward the target LMA

   o  Set the PRO field to a new reserved value (2: flow binding re-
      instantiated by LMA) of [MEXT] as proposed by the current
      specification

   o  Copy FID-PRI and Action fields from the original filter into the
      re-instantiated filter

   TBD: Since no notification mechanism is currently defined between MAG
   and LMA in [RFC5213], re-instantiated filter(s) will be returned by
   LMA only on MAG demand.  This might happen when MAG renews PBU or
   create/modify/delete its own filters.

   The format of the option is briefly recalled hereafter.  The present
   specification proposes to extend the PRO field value in order to add
   the (2: flow binding re-instantiated by LMA) predefined value.  The
   full specification of the option can be found in [MEXT]

7.  MAG behavior

   The MAG upon MN attachment performs all the steps as per [RFC5213].
   In addition to this it MUST perform the following checks.

   The MAG learns if the MN is requesting a HNP as part of a new
   mobility session or if it is requesting to attach a new interface as
   part of an already existing mobility session.  The MAG retrieves the
   MIGID from e.g.  MN's profile as well as filters.  The MAG can learn
   filters in an access-specific manner or alternatively via other
   infrastructure support.  This is however out of scope of this
   document.  In any case the MAG MUST encode the PBU including at least
   the Multi-interface option as specified before and possibly one or
   more FID option(s).

   The MAG can modify or delete filters attached to a multi-interface
   group by sending a PBU carrying the filter operation(s) to be
   performed.  It shall analyze individual results according to what is
   returned by the LMA.  In addition, MAG should be prepared to handle
   filters that have been re-instantiated by LMA when MN has
   disconnected an interface belonging to the same multi-interface
   group.

   When MAG proxying a MN detects the MN has detached the related
   interface, MAG stops proxying the MN by sending a PBU with lifetime
   set to 0 and includes the multi-interface option that identifies the
   target multi-interface group of the detached interface as well as
   removal behavior regarding filters.  MAG waits for successful PBA to
   release the MN access.


8.  LMA behavior

   The LMA should be modified in the BCE and conceptual data structures.

8.1.  BCE modifications

   The LMA binding cache lookup method should be extended to accommodate
   multi-interface support.  In case the LMA processes the Multi-
   interface Option it SHOULD update existing mobility session as
   defined in [RFC5213].  In addition to this it MUST perform the
   following checks.

   If the Multi-interface option is present in the PBU, the LMA must
   allocate/update/delete the mobility session and the multi-interface
   group ID it refers to.  Flow filters received in the PBU shall be
   created/modified/deleted for the target Multi-interface group ID and
   a result shall be return on an individual filter basis.

   In addition, the LMA shall handle removal of interfaces from multi-
   interface group according to MAG instructions.  In particular, if a
   MAG instructs a LMA to remove an interface from a multi-interface
   group but to keep filters, the LMA should re-instantiate filters on
   existing interface(s) of the multi-interface group according to its
   own mechanisms.

   If a LMA does not support multi-interface extension (as a whole) or
   specific multi-interface option, as proposed by the present document,
   it shall return a status code in PBA as defined in [RFC5213].  The
   later specification might be extended to include multi-homing
   specific statuses, such as:

   MI_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_LMA

   MI_FILTERS_REINSTANCIATION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_LMA


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


10.  Security Considerations

   This document only extends existing options, no security issues are
   introduced.


11.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.
