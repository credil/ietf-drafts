1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a solution to the issues identified in the
   problem statement document [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mis-ps] for the layer 3
   transport of IEEE 802.21 MIH protocols.

   The MIH Layer 3 transport problem is divided in two main parts: the
   discovery of a node that supports specific Mobility Services (MoS)
   and the transport of the information between a mobile node (MN) and
   the discovered node.  The discovery process is required for the MN to
   obtain the information needed for MIH protocol communication with a
   peer node.  The information includes the transport address (e.g., the
   IP address) of the peer node and the types of MoS provided by the
   peer node.

   This document lists the major MoS deployment scenarios.  It next
   describes the solution architecture, including the MSTP reference
   model and MIHF identifiers.  A description follows of MoS discovery
   procedures when the MN is in a home or remote network.  The remainder
   of the document describes the MIH transport architecture, example
   message flows for several signaling scenarios, and security issues.


2.  Terminology

   The following acronyms and terminology are used in this document:

   MIH  Media Independent Handover: the handover support architecture
      defined by the IEEE 802.21 working group that consists of the MIH
      Function (MIHF), MIH Network Entities, MIH Event messages, and MIH
      command messages.

   MIHF  Media Independent Handover Function: a cross-layer function
      that provides handover services including the Event Service (ES),
      Information Service (IS), and Command Service (CS), through
      service access points (SAPs) defined by the IEEE 802.21 working
      group.

   MIHF User  an MIH client that uses the MIH SAPs to access MIHF
      services, and which is responsible for initiating and terminating
      MIH signaling

      required to uniquely identify the MIHF endpoints for delivering
      mobility services (MoS); it is implemented as either a FQDN or
      NAI.

3.  Deployment Scenarios

   This section describes the various possible deployment scenarios for
   the MN and the MoS.  The relative positioning of MN and MoS affects
   resource discovery as well as the performance of the MIH signaling
   service.

3.1.  Scenario S1: Home Network MoS

   In this scenario, the MN and the services are located in the home
   network.  We refer to this set of services as MoSh as in Figure 1.
   The MoSh can be located at the access point the MN uses to connect to
   the home network, or it can be located elsewhere.

3.2.  Scenario S2: Visited Network MoS

   In this scenario, the MN is in the visited network and mobility
   services are also provided by the visited network.  We refer to this
   as MoSv as shown in Figure 2.

3.3.  Scenario S3: Roaming MoS

   In this scenario, the MN is located in the visited network and all
   MIH services are provided by the home network, as shown in Figure 3.

3.4.  Scenario S4: Third party MoS

   In this scenario, the MN is in its home network or in a visited
   network and services are provided by a 3rd party network.  We refer
   to this situation as MoS3 as shown in Figure 4

   Different types of MoS can be provided independently of other types
   and there is no strict relationship between ES, CS and IS, nor is
   there a requirement that the entities that provide these types be co-
   located.  However, while IS tends to involve large amounts of static
   information, ES and CS are dynamic services and some relationship
   between them can be expected, e.g. a handover command (CS) could be
   issued upon reception of a link event (ES).  Hence, while in theory
   MoS can be implemented in different locations, it is expected that ES
   and CS will be co-located, whereas IS can be co-located with ES/CS or
   located elsewhere.  Therefore, having the flexibility at the MSTP to
   discover different services in different locations is an important
   feature that can be used to optimize handover performance.  Resource
   discovery is discussed in more detail in Section 5.


4.  Solution Overview

   As mentioned in Section 1 the solution space is being divided into
   two functional domains: discovery and transport.  The following
   assumptions have been made:

   o  The solution is aimed at supporting 802.21 MIH services, namely
      Information Service (IS), Event Service (ES), and Command Service
      (CS).

   o  If the MIHFID is available, FQDN or NAI's realm is used for
      mobility service discovery.

Internet-Draft                    MSTP                     December 2007


   o  The solutions are chosen to cover all possible deployment
      scenarios as described in Section 3.

   o  MoS discovery can be performed during initial network attachment
      or thereafter.

   For the discovering the location of an MoS, the MN could either be
   pre-configured with the address of the MoS, or this address could be
   dynamically assigned through DHCP or DNS by the network.  The dynamic
   assignation methods are described in Section 5.

   The configuration of the MoS could be executed either upon network
   attachment or after successful IP configuration.  The methodology to
   be used depends on the considered deployment scenario.

   Once the MIHF peer has been discovered, MIH information can be
   exchanged between MIH peers over a trasnport protocol such as UDP or
   TCP.  The usage of transport protocols is described in Section 6.

4.1.  Architecture

   Figure 5 depicts the MSTP reference model and its components within a
   node.  The topmost layer is the MIHF user.  This set of applications
   consists of one or more MIH clients that are responsible for such
   operations as maintaining MIH databases associated with the IS,
   processing Layer 2 triggers as part of the ES, and initiating and
   carrying out handover operations as part of the CS.  Beneath the MIHF
   user set is the MIHF itself.  This function is responsible for MoS
   discovery, as well as creating, maintaining, modifying, and
   destroying MIH signaling associations with other MIHFs located in MIH
   peer nodes.  Below the MIHF are various transport layer protocols as
   well as address resolution functions.

   The MIHF relies on the services provided by TCP and UDP for
   transporting MIH messages, and relies on DHCP and DNS for peer
   discovery.  In cases where the peer MIHF IP address is not pre-
   configured, the source MIHF needs to discover it either via DHCP or
   DNS or a combination of both as described in Section 5.  Once the
   peer MIHF is discovered, MIHF must exchange messages with its peer
   over either UDP or TCP.  Specific recommendations regarding the
   choice of transport protocols are provided in Section 6.

   The above reference architecture however does not include other
   services such as message fragmentation and security.  Depending upon
   the MIH service type (e.g., ES, CS and IS) the message size can be
   very large.  In case where the underlying layers do not support
   fragmentation, this may be an issue.  There are no security features
   currently defined as part of the MIH protocol level.  However,
   security can be provided either at the transport or IP layer where it
   is necessary.  Section 8 provides some guidelines and recommendations
   for security.

4.2.  MIHF Identifiers (FQDN, NAI)

   An MIHFID is an identifier required to uniquely identify the MIHF end
   points for delivering the mobility services (MoS).  Thus an MIHF
   identifier needs to be unique within a domain where mobility services
   are provided and invariant to interface IP addresses.  An MIHFID MUST
   be represented either in the form of an FQDN [RFC2181] or NAI
   [RFC4282].  An MIHFID can be pre-configured or discovered through the
   discovery methods described in Section 5.


5.  MoS Discovery

   The MoS discovery method depends on whether the MN attempts to
   discover an MoS in the home network, in the visited network, or in a

   3rd party remote network that is neither the home network nor the
   visited network.

   In case MoS is provided locally (scenarios S1 and S2) , the discovery
   techniques described in [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options] and
   [I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery] are both applicable and either one MAY
   be used to discover the MoS.

   In case MoS is provided in the home network while the MN is in the
   visited network (scenario S3), the DNS based discovery described in
   [I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery] is applicable, while the DHCP based
   discovery method would require an interaction between the DHCP and
   the AAA infrastructure, similarly to what specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] .  This latter case
   assumes that MoS assignment is performed during access authentication
   and authorization.

   In case MoS is provided in a remote network other than visited or
   home network (scenario S4), only the DNS based discovery method
   described in [I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery] is applicable.

5.1.  MoS Discovery when MN and MoSh are in the home network (Scenario
      S1)

   To discover an MoS in the home network, the MN SHOULD use the DNS
   based MoS discovery method described in
   [I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery].  In order to use that mechanism, the
   MN MUST first find out the domain name of its home network.  Home
   domains are usually pre-configured in the MNs, thus the MN can simply
   read its configuration data to find out the home domain name
   (scenario S1).  The DNS query option is shown in Figure 6b.
   Alternatively, the MN MAY use the DHCP options for MoS
   discovery[I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options] as shown inFigure 6a.

5.2.  MoS Discovery when MIN is in visited network and MoSv is also in
      visited network (Scenario S2)

   To discover an MoS in the visited network, the MN SHOULD attempt to
   use the DHCP options for MoS discovery [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options]
   as shown in Figure 7a.  If the DHCP method fails, the MN SHOULD
   attempt to use the DNS based MoS discovery method described in
   [[I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery] as shown in Figure 7b.  In order to
   use that, the MN MUST first learn the domain name of the local
   network.  There are a number of ways how the domain name of a network
   can be learned:

   DHCP --  In order to find out the domain name of the local network,
      the MN SHOULD use the dhcpv4 option 15 for learning the domain
      name [RFC1533].  A similar solution is available for dhcpv6
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-dnsdomain] .

   Reverse dns query --  When DHCP does not provide the required domain
      name, the MN MAY use reverse DNS (DNS PTR record) to find the
      domain name associated with the IP address it is using in the
      visited network.  Note, that when a NAT device exists between the
      MN and the visited network, the MN will first need to find out the
      external IP address of the NAT device.  Some possible methods for
      determining the NAT's external IP address are STUN [RFC3849] or
      UPnP [UPnP_IDG_DCP].  Once the MN has determined the external IP
      address of the NAT device, it MUST use that address in the reverse

5.3.  MOS Discovery when the MN is in a visited Network and Services are
      at the Home network (Scenario S3)

   To discover an MoS in the visited network when MIH services are
   provided by the home network, both the DNS based discovery method
   described in [I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery] and the DHCP based
   discovery method described in [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options] are
   applicable.

   To discover the MoS at home while in a visited network using DNS, the
   MN SHOULD use the procedures described in section Section 5.1

   Alternatively, the MN MAY also use the DHCP based discovery method.
   Using the DHCP based discovery may be required in deployments where
   the usage of MoS located in the home network is enforced and included
   in the subscription profile.  Similarly to
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] in this integrated
   scenario the mobile node utilizes network access authentication
   process to bootstrap MIH services.  It is assumed that the access
   service authorizer is mobility service aware.  This allows for MoS
   discovery at the time of access authentication and authorization.
   Also, the mechanism defined in this document requires the NAS to
   support MIH specific AAA attributes and a collocated DHCP relay
   agent.  In order to provide the mobile node with information about



Melia, et al.             Expires June 19, 2008                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    MSTP                     December 2007


   the assigned MoS the AAAh conveys the assigned MoS's information to
   the NAS via AAA protocol similarly to [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated]
   and described in Section 11.

   In these deployment scenarios the AAAh sends the MoS address at home
   to the AAAv during the network access authentication.  The relation
   beween functional components supporting such procedure is shown in
   Figure 8.

   The mobile node executes the network access authentication procedure
   (e.g., IEEE 802.11i/802.1X) and it interacts with the NAS.  The NAS
   is in the visited and it interacts with the AAAh to authenticate the
   mobile node.  In the process of authorizing the mobile node the AAAh
   verifies in the AAA profile that the mobile node is allowed to use
   MoS service.  The AAAh assigns the MoS in the home and returns this
   information to the NAS.  The NAS may keep the received information
   for a configurable duration or it may keep the information for as
   long as the MN is connected to the NAS.

   The mobile node sends a DHCPv6 Information Request message [RFC3315]
   to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.  In this
   message the mobile node (DHCP client) SHALL include the Option Code
   for MoS Identifier Option [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options] in the
   OPTION_ORO, MoS Identifier Option with id-type set to 1 and the MoS
   Identifier field set to the network realm of the home.  The mobile
   node SHALL also include the OPTION_CLIENTID to identify itself to the
   DHCP server.

   The Relay Agent intercepts the Information Request from the mobile
   node and forwards it to the DHCP server.  The Relay Agent also
   includes the received MoS information from the AAAh in the MIH Relay
   Agent Option [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options].  If a NAS implementation
   does not store the received information as long as the MN's session
   remains in the visited, and if the MN delays sending DHCP request,
   the NAS/DHCP relay does not include the MIH Relay Agent Option in the
   Relay Forward message.

   The DHCP server identifies the client by looking at the DUID for the
   client in the OPTION_CLIENTID.  The DHCP server also determines that
   the mobile node is requesting MoS information in the home by looking
   at the MoS Identifier Option (id-type 1).  The DHCP server determines
   that the home agent is allocated by the AAAh by looking at the MIH
   sub-option in the MIH Relay Agent Option.  The DHCP server extracts
   the allocated home agent information from the MIH Relay Agent Option
   and includes it in the MoS Information Option
   [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options] in the Reply Message.  If the requested
   information is not available in the DHCP server, it follows the
   behavior described in [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options].

   The Relay Agent relays the Reply Message from the DHCP server to the
   mobile node.  At this point, the mobile node has the home agent
   information that it requested.

   It should be noted that the AAAh does not know the preferences of the
   MN at the time of authentication, i.e. whether the MoS in the home or
   in the local network is to be sent to the MN.  The MoS information
   will anyway be sent to the AAAV, then stored in the relay agent and
   ultimately sent to the MN if the MN asks for it, using the procedures
   defined in [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options].

5.4.  MoS discovery when MIH services are in a 3rd party remote network
      (scenario S4)

   To discover an MoS in a remote network other than home network, the
   MN MUST use the DNS based MoS discovery method described in
   [I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery].  The MN MUST first learn the domain
   name of the network containing the MoS it is searching for.  If the
   MN does not yet know the domain name of the network, learning it may
   require more than one operation, as pre-configuration and DHCP
   methods can not be used.  The MN MAY attempt to first discover an MoS
   in either the local or home network (as in Figure 9 part (a)) and
   query that MoS to find out the domain name of a specific network or
   the domain name of a network at a specific location (as in Figure 9
   part (b)).  Alternatively, the MN MAY query an MoS previously known
   to learn the domain name of the desired network (e.g., via an IS
   Query).  Finally the MN can use DNS queries to find MoS in the remote
   network as inFigure 9 part(c).  It should be noted that step c can
   only be performed upon obtaining the domain name of the remote
   network.

6.  MIH Transport Options

   Once the Mobility Services have been discovered, MIH peers MAY
   exchange information over TCP, UDP or any other transport supported
   by both the server and client, as described in
   [I-D.rahman-mipshop-mih-transport].  The client MAY use the DNS
   discovery mechanism to discover which transport protocols are
   supported by the server in addition to TCP and UDP.  While either
   protocol can provide the basic transport functionality required,
   there are performance trade-offs and unique characteristics
   associated with each that need to be considered in the context of the
   MIH services for different network loss and congestion conditions.
   The objectives of this section are to discuss these trade-offs for
   different MIH settings such as the MIH message size and rate, and the
   retransmission parameters.  In addition, factors such as NAT
   traversal are also discussed.  Given the reliability requirements for
   the MIH transport, it is assumed in this discussion that the MIH ACK



Melia, et al.             Expires June 19, 2008                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                    MSTP                     December 2007


   mechanism is to be used in conjunction with UDP, while it is
   preferred to avoid using MIH ACKs with TCP since TCP includes
   acknowledgement and retransmission functionality

6.1.  MIH Message size

   Although the MIH message size varies widely from about 30 bytes (for
   a broadcast capability discovery request) to around 65000 bytes (for
   an IS MIH_Get_Information response primitive), a typical MIH message
   size for the ES/CS service ranges between 50 to100 bytes [IEEE80221].
   Thus, considering the effects of the MIH message size on the
   performance of the transport protocol brings us to discussing two
   main issues, related to fragmentation of long messages in the context
   of UDP and the concatenation of short messages in the context of TCP.
   Since transporting long MIH messages may require fragmentation that
   is not available in UDP, if MIH is using UDP a limit MUST be set on
   the size of the MIH message, unless fragmentation functionality is
   added to the MIH layer or IP layer fragmentation is used instead.  In
   this latter case, the loss of an IP fragment leads to the
   retransmission of an entire MIH message, which in turn leads to poor
   end-to-end delay performance in addition to wasted bandwidth
   utilization.  Additional recommendations in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines] apply for limiting the size of the
   MIH message when using UDP and assuming IP layer fragmentation.  In
   terms of dealing with short messages, TCP has the capability to
   concatenate very short messages in order to reduce the overall
   bandwidth overhead.  However, this reduced overhead comes at the cost
   of additional delay to complete an MIH transaction, which may not be
   acceptable for CS and ES services.  Note also that TCP is a stream
   oriented protocol and measures data flow in terms of bytes, not
   messages.  Thus it is possible to split messages across multiple TCP
   segments if they are long enough.  Even short messages can be split
   across two segments.  This can also cause unacceptable delays,
   especially if the link quality is severely degraded as is likely to
   happen when the MN is exiting a wireless access coverage area.

6.2.  MIH Message rate

   The frequency of MIH messages varies according to the MIH service
   type.  It is expected that CS/ES message arrive at a rate of one in
   hundreds of milliseconds in order to capture quick changes in the
   environment and/ or process handover commands.  On the other hand, IS
   messages are exchanged mainly every time a new network is visited
   which may be in order of hours or days.  Therefore a burst of either
   short CS/ES messages or long IS message exchanges (in the case of
   multiple MIH nodes requesting information) may lead to network
   congestion.  While the built-in rate-limiting controls available in
   TCP may be well suited for dealing with these congestion conditions,



Melia, et al.             Expires June 19, 2008                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                    MSTP                     December 2007


   this may result in large transmission delays that may be unacceptable
   for the timely delivery of ES/CS messages.  On the other hand, if UDP
   is used, a rate-limiting effect similar to the one obtained with TCP
   may be obtained by adequately adjusting the parameters of a token
   bucket regulator as defined in the MIH specifications [IEEE80221].
   Recommendations for tocken bucket parameter settings are specific to
   the scenario considered.

6.3.  Retransmission

   For TCP, the retransmission timeout is adjusted according to the
   measured RTT.  However due to the exponential backoff mechanism, the
   delay associated with retransmission timeouts may increase
   significantly with increased packet loss.

   If UDP is being used to carry MIH messages, MIH SHOULD use MIH ACKs.
   An MIH message is retransmitted if its corresponding MIH ACK is not
   received by the generating node within a timeout interval set by the
   MIHF.  This approach does not include an exponential backoff and
   therefore tends to degrade more gracefully than TCP when the packet
   loss rate becomes large, in the sense that the expected delay does
   not increase exponentially.  The number of retransmissions is
   limited, which reduces head-of-line blocking of other MIH messages,
   but this can cause important ES/CS messages to be lost.

   Additionally, instead of retransmitting an unacknowledged message,
   the MIH may choose to update the information and transmit a new
   message.

6.4.  NAT Traversal

   There are no known issues for NAT traversal when using TCP.  The
   default connection timeout of 24 hours is considered adequate for MIH
   transport purposes.  However, issues with NAT traversal using UDP are
   documented in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines].  Communication
   failures are experienced when middleboxes destroy the per-flow state
   associated with an application session during periods when the
   application does not exchange any UDP traffic.  Hence, communication
   between the MN and the MoS SHOULD be able to gracefully handle such
   failures and implement mechanisms to re-establish their UDP sessions.
   In addition and in order to avoid such failures, MIH messages MAY be
   sent periodically, similarly to keep-alive messages, to attempt to
   refresh middlebox state (e.g.  ES reports could be used for this
   purpose).  As [RFC4787] requires a minimum state timeout of two
   minutes or more, MIH messages using UDP as transport SHOULD be sent
   once every two minutes.

6.5.  General guidelines

   Since ES and CS messages are small in nature and have tight latency
   requirements, UDP in combination with MIH acknowledgement SHOULD be
   used for transporting ES and CS messages.  On the other hand, IS
   messages are more resilient in terms of latency constraints and some
   long IS messages could exceed the MTU of the path to the destination.
   Therefore, TCP SHOULD be used for transporting IS messages.  For both
   UDP and TCP cases, if a port number is not explicitly assigned (e.g.
   by the DNS SRV), MIH messages sent over UDP, TCP or other supported
   transport MUST use the default port number defined for that
   particular transport..

   The server side MUST support both UDP and TCP for MIH transport, and
   the MN MAY support either UDP or TCP.  Additionally, the server and
   MN MAY support additional transport mechanisms.  The MN MAY use the
   procedures defined in [I-D.bajko-mos-dns-discovery] to discover
   additional transport protocols supported by the server.


7.  Operation Flows

   Figure 10 gives an example operation flow between MIHF peers when an
   MIH user requests for an IS service.  Scenario 1 is in effect, i.e.
   the MoS and the MN are both in the MN's home network.  Thus DHCP is
   used for MoS discovery and TCP is used for establishing a transport
   connection to carry the IS messages.  When MOS is not pre-configured,
   the MIH user needs to discover the IP address of MOS to communicate
   with the remote MIHF.  Therefore the MIH user sends a discovery
   request message to the local MIHF as defined in [IEEE80221]

   In this example, we assume that MoS discovery is performed before a
   transport connection is established with the remote MIHF, and the
   DHCP client process is invoked via some internal APIs.  DHCP Client
   sends DHCP INFORM message according to standard DHCP and with the MoS
   option as defined in [I-D.bajko-mos-dhcp-options].  DHCP server
   replies via DHCP ACK message with the IP address of the MoS.  The MOS
   address is then passed to the MIHF locally via some internal APIs.
   MIHF generates the discovery response message and passes it on to the
   corresponding MIH user.  The MIH user generates an IS query addressed
   to the remote MoS.  MIHF invokes the underlying TCP client which
   establishes a transport connection with the remote peer.  Once the
   transport connection is established, MIHF sends the IS query via MIH
   protocol REQUEST message.  The message and query arrive at the
   destination MIHF and MIH user respectively.  The MoS MIH user
   responds to the corresponding IS query and the MoS MIHF sends the IS
   response via MIH protocol RESPONSE message.  The message arrives to
   the source MIHF which passes the IS response on to the corresponding

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of security issues that need to be taken into
   account during node discovery and information exchange via a
   transport connection [I-D.ietf-mipshop-mis-ps]

   In case where DHCP is used for node discovery and authentication of
   the source and content of DHCP messages are required, it is
   recommended that network administrators should use DHCP
   authentication option described in [RFC3118], where available or rely
   upon link layer security.  This will also protect the denial of
   service attacks to DHCP server.[RFC3118] provides mechanisms for both
   entity authentication and message authentication.

   In case where DNS is used for discovering MoS, fake DNS requests and
   responses may cause DoS and the inability of the MN to perform a
   proper handover, respectively.  Where networks are exposed to such
   DoS, it is recommended that DNS service providers use the Domain Name
   System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) as described in [RFC4033].
   Readers may also refer to [RFC4641] to consider the aspects of DNSSEC
   Operational Practices.

   In case where reliable transport protocol such as TCP is used for
   transport connection between two MIHF peers, TLS [RFC4346] should be



Melia, et al.             Expires June 19, 2008                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                    MSTP                     December 2007


   used for message confidentiality and data integrity.  In particular,
   TLS is designed for client/server applications and to prevent
   eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.  Readers should also
   follow the recommendations in [RFC4366] that provides generic
   extension mechanisms for the TLS protocol suitable for wireless
   environments.

   In case where unreliable transport protocol such as UDP is used for
   transport connection between two MIHF peers, DTLS [RFC4347] should be
   used for message confidentiality and data integrity.  The DTLS
   protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and
   provides equivalent security guarantees.

   Alternatively, generic IP layer security, such as IPSec [RFC2401] may
   be used where neither transport layer security for a specific
   transport is available nor server only authentication is required.

   information from the AAAh to the NAS for scenario 3.  Due to lack of
   time we did not post a separate ID.

11.1.1.  MoS Info

   The MoS-Info AVP (AVP code TBD) is type of Grouped and contains
   necessary information to assign a MoS to the MN.  When the MoS-Info
   AVP is present in a message, it MUST contain either a MIH-MoS-Address
   AVP or a MIH-MoS-FQDN AVP, but not both.  The grouped AVP has the
   following grammar:

   artwork <MoS-Info> ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                [ MIH-MoS-Address ]
                                [ MIH-MoS-FQDN ]
                              * [ AVP ]

11.1.2.  MIH-MoS-Address AVP

   The MIH-MoS-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Address and
   contains the MoS address.  The Diameter server MAY decide to assign a
   MoS to the MN that is in close proximity to the point of attachment
   (e.g., determined by the NAS-Identifier AVP).  There may be other
   reasons for dynamically assigning MoSs to the MN, for example to
   share the traffic load.

   This AVP MAY also be attached by the NAS when sent to the Diameter
   server in a request message as a hint of a locally assigned MoS
   address.

11.1.3.  MIH-MoS-FQDN AVP

   The MIH-MoS-FQDN AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type UTF8String and
   contains the FQDN of a MoS.  The usage of this AVP is equivalent to
   the MIH-MoS-Address AVP but offers an additional level of indirection
   via the DNS infrastructure.

11.1.4.  MoS Capability

   The MoS-Capability AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64 and
   contains a 64 bits flags field of supported capabilities of the NAS/
   ASP.  Sending and receiving the MoS-Capability AVP with value 0 MUST
   be supported.

   The NAS MAY include this AVP to indicate capabilities of the NAS/ASP
   to the Diameter server.  For example, the NAS may indicate that a
   local MoS can be provided.  Similarly, the Diameter server MAY
   include this AVP to inform the NAS/ASP about which of the NAS/ASP
   indicated capabilities are supported or authorized by the ASA/MSA(/
   MSP).

   The following capabilities are defined in this document:

   o  MoS_SERVCE_CAPABILITY (0x0000000000000000) -- The MoS-Capability
      AVP MAY contain value 0 (zero) with the semantics that are defined
      in this document for the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping functionality.
      This 'zero' flag is always implicitly set when the MoS AVP is
      used.

   o  LOCAL_MOS_ASSIGNMENT (0x0000000000000001) -- This flag is set by
      the NAS/ASP when a local MoS can be assigned to the MN.  This flag
      is set by the ASA/MSA(/MSP) when the use of a local MoS is
      authorized.
