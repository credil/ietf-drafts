Internet-Draft                 IPv6 in IXP                     June 2009


1.  Introduction

   Most Internet Exchange Points (IXP) work on the Layer 2 level, making
   the adoption of IPv6 an easy task.  However, IXPs normally implement
   additional services such as statistics, route servers, looking
   glasses, broadcast control and others that may be impacted by the
   implementation of IPv6.  This document gives guidance on the impact
   of IPv6 on a new or an existing IXP that may or may not fit any
   particular deployment.  The document assumes an Ethernet switch
   fabric, algthouh other layer 2 canfigurations can be deployed.


2.  Switch Fabric Configuration

   An Ethernet based IXP switch fabric implements IPv6 over Ethernet as
   described in [RFC2464], therefore the switching of IPv6 traffic
   happens in the same way as in IPv4.  However, some management
   functions require explicit IPv6 support, particularly: switch
   management, SNMP support and flow analysis tools.

   There are two common configurations of IXP switch ports to support
   IPv6:

   1.  dual stack VLAN: both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic share a common VLAN.
       No extra configuration is required in the switch.  In this
       scenario, participants will typically configure dual stack
       interfaces although independent port can be an option.

   2.  independent VLAN: an exclusive IPv6 VLAN is created for IPv6
       traffic.  If IXP participants are already using VLAN tagging on
       their routers interfaces that are facing the IXP switch, this
       only requires passing one additional VLAN tag across the
       interconnection.  If participants are using untagged
       interconnections with the IXP switch and wish to continue doing
       so, they will need to facilitate a separate physical port to
       access the IPv6-specific VLAN.

   The "independent VLAN" configuration provides a physical separation
   for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  This simplifies separate analysis for
   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  However, it can be more costly in both
   capital expenses (if new ports are needed) and operational expends.
   Conversely, the dual stack implementation allows a quick and capital
   cost-free start-up for IPv6 support in the IXP, allowing the IXP to
   avoid transforming untagged ports into tagged ports.  In this
   implementation, traffic split for statistical analysis may be done
   using flows techniques such as in IPFIX [RFC5101] considering the
   different ether-types (0x0800 for IPv4 and 0x86DD for IPv6).

   The support for jumbo frames MTU should be evaluated.  The only
   technical requirement for IPv6 referring link MTUs is that it needs
   to be greater than or equal to 1280 octets [RFC2460].  Common MTU
   sizes in IXPs are 1500, 4470, or 9216 bytes, so typically this
   requires no change of configuration.


3.  Addressing Plan

   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have specific address policies to
   allocate Provider Independent (PI) IPv6 address to IXPs.  Those
   allocations are usually /48 or shorter prefixes [RIR_IXP_POLICIES].
   Depending on the country and region of operation, address allocations
   may be provided by NIRs (National Internet Registries).

   From the allocated prefix, following the recommendations of
   [RFC4291], a /64 prefix should be allocated for each of the exchange
   point Local Area Networks (LANs).  A /48 prefix allows the addressing
   of 65536 LANs.  As IXP will normally use manual address
   configuration, longer prefixes (/65-/127), are technically feasible
   but are normally discouraged because of operational practices.The
   manual configuration of IPv6 addresses allows IXP participants to
   replace network interfaces with no need to reconfigure Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) sessions information and facilitates routing
   management tasks.

   Not only interface auto-configuration is typically disabled in an IXP
   LAN but also on a LAN where all addresses are manually configured, it
   is important to avoid the exchange of router advertisement messages
   described in [RFC4861].

   When selecting the use of static Interface Identifiers (IIDs), there
   are different options on how to "intelligently" fill its 64 bits (or
   16 hexadecimal characters).  A non exhausted list of possible IID
   selection mechanisms follows:

   1.  Some IXPs like to include the participants' ASN number decimal
       encoding inside each IPv6 address.  The ASN decimal number number
       is used as the BCD (binary code decimal) encoding of the upper
       part of the IID such as shown in this example:

       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:DB8::/64

       *  ASN: 64496

       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:DB8::6449:6000:0000:0001/64 or its
          equivalent representation 2001:DB8::6449:6000:0:1/64

Internet-Draft                 IPv6 in IXP                     June 2009


       Please remember that 32 bits ASNs requires a maximum of 10
       characters, as 16 characters are available, up to 2^24 IPv6
       addresses can be configured per ASN.

   2.  Although BCD encoding is more "human-readable", some IXPs prefer
       to use the hexadecimal encoding of the ASNs number as the upper
       part of the IID as follow:

       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:DB8::/64

       *  ASN: 64496 (DEC) or FBF0 (HEX)

       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:DB8::0000:FBF0:0000:0001/64 or its
          equivalent representation 2001:DB8::FBF0:0:1/64

       The four zero before the ASN (bits 63-96) will be used by 32 bits
       ASNs.

   3.  A third scheme for statically assigning IPv6 addresses on an IXP
       LAN could be to relate some portion of a participant's IPv6
       address to its IPv4 address.  In the following example, the last
       three decimals of the IPv4 address are copied to the last
       hexadecimals of the IPv6 address, using the decimal number as the
       BCD encoding for the last three characters of the IID such as in
       the following example:

       *  IXP LAN prefix: 2001:DB8::/64

       *  IPv4 Address: 240.0.20.132/23

       *  IPv6 Address: 2001:DB8::132/64

   4.  A fourth approach might be based on the IXPs ID for that
       participant.

   The current practice that applies to IPv4 about publishing IXP
   allocations to the DFZ (Default Free Zone) should also apply to the
   IPv6 allocation (normally a /48 prefix).  Typically IXPs LANs are not
   globally reachable in order to avoid a Distributed Denial of Service
   (DDoS) attack but participant may route these prefixes inside their
   networks (ex. using no-export communities) to perform fault
   management.  IXP external services (such as dns, web pages, ftp
   servers) needs to be globally routed and due to strict prefix length
   filtering could be the reason to request a shorter than /48
   assignment from an RIR (ex requesting a /47 assignment and using one
   /48 for the IXPs LANs that is not globally routed and one /48 for the
   IXP external services that is globally routed).

4.  Reverse DNS

   PTR records for all addresses assigned to participants should be
   included in the IXP reverse zone under "ip6.arpa".  DNS servers
   should be reachable over IPv6 transport.


5.  Route Server Configuration

   IXPs may offer a Route Server service, either for Multi-Lateral
   Peering Agreements (MLPA) service, looking glass service or route-
   collection service.  IPv6 support needs to be added to the BGP
   speaking router.  The equipment should be able to transport IPv6
   traffic and to support Multi-protocol BGP (MP-BGP) extensions for
   IPv6 address family ([RFC2545] and [RFC4760]).

   A good practice is to have IPv6 SAFI (Subsequent Address Family
   Identifiers) information carried over sessions established also on
   top of the IPv6 IP/TCP stack and independently of the IPv4 sessions.
   This configuration allows that in the event of IPv6 reachability
   issues to any IPv6 peer, the IPv6 session will be turned down and the
   IPv4 session to the same peer will not be affected.  Please consider
   the use of MD5 [RFC2385] or IPSEC [RFC4301] to authenticate the BGP
   sessions.

   The Router-Server or Looking Glass external service should be
   available for external IPv6 access, either by an IPv6 enabled web
   page or an IPv6 enabled console interface.


6.  Internal and External Services support

   Some external services that need to have IPv6 support are Traffic
   Graphics, DNS, FTP, Web, Route Server and Looking Glass.  Other
   external services such as NTP servers, or SIP Gateways need to be
   evaluated as well.  In general, each service that is currently
   accessed through IPv4 or that handle IPv4 addresses should be
   evaluated for IPv6 support.

   Internal services are also important when considering IPv6 adoption
   at an IXP.  Such services may not deal with IPv6 traffic but may
   handle IPv6 addresses; that is the case of provisioning systems,
   logging tools and statistics analysis tools.  Databases and tools
   should be evaluated for IPv6 support.

7.  IXP Policies and IPv6

   IXP Policies may need to be revised as any mention of IP should be
   clarified if it refers to IPv4, IPv6 or both.  The current
   interpretation is that IP refers to the Internet Protocol,
   independently of the its version (i.e. both IPv4 and IPv6).  In any
   case contracts and policies should be reviewed for any occurrence of
   IP and/or IPv4 and replace it with the appropriate IP, IPv4 and/or
   IPv6 language.


8.  Multicast IPv6

   There are two elements that needs to be evaluated when studying IPv6
   multicast in an IXP: multicast support for netighbor discovery and
   multicast peering.

   IXPs are used to control broadcast traffic in the switching fabric in
   order to avoid broadcast storm by allowing limited ARP [RFC0826]
   traffic for address resolution.  In IPv6 there is not broadcast
   support.  ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] implements the
   following necesarry functions in an IXP switching fabric: Address
   Resolution, Neighbor Unreachability Detection and Duplicate Address
   Detection.  In order to perform this functions Neighbor Solicitations
   and Neighbor Advertisments packets are exchange using the link-local
   all-nodes multicast address (FF02::1).  Similarly to the ARP policy
   an IXP may set up a scanning device for link-local multicast traffic
   in order to allow only limited ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation and
   Neighbor Advertisement messages.  Particularly rogue ICMPv6 route
   advertisements may be monitored.

   For IPv6 Multicast Peering sessions (SAFI=2) the IXP may decide to
   use a reserved VLAN or to exchange those prefixes in the same VLAN as
   the unicast IPv6 sessions (SAFI=1) or the same VLAN as the multicast
   IPv4 sessions.  When forwarding inter-domain multicast traffic PIM
   messages in the link-local IPv6 'ALL-PIM-ROUTERS' multicast group
   ff02::d will be present in the selected VLAN.
