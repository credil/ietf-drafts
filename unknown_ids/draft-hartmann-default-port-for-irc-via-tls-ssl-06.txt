Internet Draft      Default Port for IRC via TLS/SSL    October 10, 2010


1. Rationale

   Although system port assignments for both plain text (TCP/UDP port
   194) and TLS/SSL encrypted (TCP/UDP port 994) IRC traffic exist
   [IANALIST], it is common practice amongst IRC networks not to use
   them for reasons of convenience and general availability on systems
   where no root access is granted or desired.

   IRC networks have defaulted to listening on TCP port 6667 for plain
   text connections for considerable time, now.  This is covered by the
   IRCU assignment of TCP/UDP ports 6665-6669.

   Similar consensus has been reached within the IRC community about
   listening on TCP port 6697 for incoming IRC connections encrypted via
   TLS/SSL.

2. Technical Details

   An IRC client connects to an IRC server.  Immediately after that, a
   normal TLS/SSL handshake takes place.  Once the TLS/SSL connection
   has been established, a normal IRC connection is established via the
   tunnel.  Optionally, the IRC server may set a specific umode for the
   client, marking it as using TLS/SSL.  Again optionally, an IRC server
   might offer the option to create channels in such a way that only
   clients connected via TLS/SSL may join.

3. Security Considerations

   The lack of a common, well established listening port for IRC via
   TLS/SSL could lead to end users being unaware of their IRC network of
   choice supporting TLS/SSL.  Thus, they might not use encryption even
   if they wanted to.

   It should be noted that this document merely describes client-to-
   server encryption.  There are still other attack vectors like mali-
   cious administrators, compromised servers, insecure server-to-server
   communication, channels that do not enforce encryption for all chan-
   nel members, malicious clients or comprised client machines on which
   logs are stored.

   Those attacks can by their very nature not be addressed by client-to-
   server encryption.  Additional safe-guards are needed if a user fears
   any of the threats above.

4. IANA Considerations

   An assignment of TCP port 6697 for IRC via TLS/SSL will be requested.
   The proposed keyword is "irc" and the description "Internet Relay

   Additionally, a clean-up of the current naming scheme will be
   requested.  The author is trying to get into contact with the respec-
   tive assignees.

   irc-u4  6668/tcp       Internet Relay Chat
   irc-u5  6669/tcp       Internet Relay Chat

6. Acknowledgements

   Thanks go to the IRC community at large for reaching a consensus.

   Special thanks go to the IRC operators who were eager to support port
   6697 on their respective networks.

APPENDIX A: Supporting data

   As of October 2010, out of the top twenty IRC networks
   [TOP100],[MAVERICK], ten support TLS/SSL.  Only one of those networks
   does not support TLS/SSL via port 6697 and has no plans to support
   it.  All others supported it already or are supporting it since being
   contacted by the author.  A more detailed analysis is available but
   does not fit within the scope of this document.
