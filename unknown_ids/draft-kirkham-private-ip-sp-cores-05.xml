      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the
      potential problems of using private, RFC1918, or non-globally-routable
      addressing within the core of an SP network. The discussion focuses on
      link addresses and to a small extent loopback addresses. While many of
      the issues are well recognised within the ISP community, there appears
      to be no document that collectively describes the issues.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>In the mid to late 90's, some Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
      adopted the practice of utilising private (or non-globally unique) IP
      (i.e. RFC1918) addresses for the infrastructure links and in some cases
      the loopback interfaces within their networks. The reasons for this
      approach centered on conservation of address space (i.e. scarcity of
      public IPv4 address space), and security of the core network (also known
      as core hiding).</t>

      <t>However, a number of technical and operational issues occurred as a
      result of using private (or non-globally unique) IP addresses, and
      virtually all these ISPs moved away from the practice. Tier 1 ISPs are
      considered the benchmark of the industry and as of the time of writing,
      there is no known tier 1 ISP that utilises the practice of private
      addressing within their core network.</t>

      <t>The following sections will discuss the various issues associated
      with deploying private IP (i.e. RFC1918) addresses within ISP core
      networks.</t>

      <t>The intent of this document is not to suggest that private IP can not
      be used with the core of an SP network as some providers use this
      practice and operate successfully. The intent is to outline the
      potential issues or effects of such a practice.</t>

      <t>Note: The practice of ISPs using ‘stolen’ address space has many of
      the same issues (or effects) as that of using private IP address space
      within core networks. The term “stolen IP address space” refers to the
      practice of an ISP using address space for its own infrastructure/core
      network addressing that has been officially allocated by an RIR to
      another provider, but that provider is not currently using or
      advertising within the Internet. Stolen addressing is not discussed
      further in this document. It is simply noted as an associated issue.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conservation of Address Space">
      <t>One of the original intents for the use of private IP addressing
      within an ISP core was the conservation of IP address space. When an ISP
      is allocated a block of public IP addresses (from a RIR), this address
      block was traditionally split in order to dedicate some portion for
      infrastructure use (i.e. for the core network), and the other portion
      for customer (subscriber) or other address pool use. Typically, the
      number of infrastructure addresses needed is relatively small in
      comparison to the total address count. So unless the ISP was only
      granted a small public block, dedicating some portion to infrastructure
      links and loopback addresses (/32) is rarely a large enough issue to
      outweigh the problems that are potentially caused when private address
      space is used.</t>

      <t>Additionally, specifications and equipment capability improvements
      now allow for the use of /31 subnets [RFC3021] for link addresses in
      place of the original /30 subnets – further minimising the impact of
      dedicating public addresses to infrastructure links by only using two
      (2) IP addresses per point to point link versus four (4)
      respectively.</t>

      <t>The use of private addressing as a conservation technique within an
      Internet Service Provider (ISP) core can cause a number of technical and
      operational issues or effects. The main effects are described below.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Effects on Traceroute">
      <t>The single biggest effect caused by the use of private (RFC1918)
      addressing within an Internet core is the fact that it can disrupt the
      operation of traceroute in some situations. This section provides some
      examples of the issues that can occur.</t>

      <t>A first example illustrates the situation where the traceroute
      crosses an AS boundary and one of the networks has utilised private
      addressing. The following simple network is used to show the
      effects.</t>

      <t>Using this example, performing the traceroute from AS200 to AS100, we
      can see the private addresses of the infrastructure links in AS100 are
      returned.</t>

      <t>This effect in itself is often not a problem. However, if
      anti-spoofing controls are applied at network perimeters, then responses
      returned from hops with private IP addresses will be dropped.
      Anti-spoofing refers to a security control where traffic with an invalid
      source address is discarded. Anti-spoofing is further described in BCP
      38/RFC 2827.</t>

      <iref item="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827" primary="true" />

      <t>The effects are illustrated in a second example below. The same
      network as example 1 is used, but with the addition of anti-spoofing
      deployed at the ingress of R4 on the R3-R4 interface (ip address
      2.1.1.10).</t>

      <t>In a third example, a similar effect is caused. If the source IP
      address of the traceroute is within a privately numbered part of the
      network (AS100) and the destination is outside of the ISPs AS (AS200).
      In this situation the traceroute will fail completely beyond the AS
      boundary.</t>

      <t>While it is completely unreasonable to expect a packet with a private
      source address to be successfully returned in a typical SP environment,
      the case is included to show the effect as it can have implications for
      troubleshooting. This case will be referenced in a later section.</t>

      <t>In a complex topology, with multiple paths and exit points, the
      provider will lose their ability to trace paths originating within their
      own AS, through their network, to destinations within other ASs. Such a
      situation could be a severe troubleshooting impediment.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that some solutions to this problem have been
      proposed in RFC 5837 which provides extensions to ICMP to allow the
      identification of interfaces and their components by any combination of
      the following: ifIndex, IPv4 address, IPv6 address, name, and MTU.
      However at the time of writing, little or no deployment was known to be
      in place.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Effects on Path MTU Discovery">
      <t>The Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) process was designed to allow hosts to
      make an accurate assessment of the maximum packet size that can be sent
      across a path without fragmentation. Path MTU Discovery is supported for
      TCP (and other protocols that support PMTUD such as GRE and IPsec) and
      works as follows:</t>

      <t>• When a router attempts to forward an IP datagram with the Do Not
      Fragment (DF) bit set out a link that has a lower MTU than the size of
      the packet, the router MUST drop the packet and return an Internet
      Control Message Protocol (ICMP) 'destination unreachable - fragmentation
      needed and DF set (type 3, code 4)’ message to the source of the IP
      datagram. This message includes the MTU of that next-hop network. As a
      result, the source station which receives the ICMP message, will lower
      the send Maximum Segment Size (MSS).</t>

      <t>It is obviously desirable that packets be sent between two
      communicating hosts without fragmentation as this process imposes extra
      load on the fragmenting router (process of fragmentation), intermediate
      routers (forwarding additional packets), as well as the receiving host
      (reassembly of the fragmented packets). Additionally, many applications,
      including some web servers, set the DF (do not fragment) bit causing
      undesirable interactions if the path MTU is insufficient. Other TCP
      implementations may set an MTU size of 576 bytes if PMTUD is
      unavailable. In addition, IPsec and other tunneling protocols will often
      require MTUs greater than 1500 bytes and often rely on PMTUD.</t>

      <t>While it is uncommon these days for core SP networks not to support
      path MTUs in excess of 1500 bytes (with 4470 or greater being common),
      the situation of 1500 byte path MTUs is still common in many ethernet
      edge or aggregation networks.</t>

      <t>The issue is as follows:</t>

      <t>• When an ICMP Type 3 Code 4 message is issued from an infrastructure
      link that uses a private (RFC1918) address, it must be routed back to
      the originating host. As the originating host will typically be a
      globally routable IP address, its source address is used as the
      destination address of the returned ICMP Type 3 packet. At this point
      there are normally no problems.</t>

      <t>• As the returned packet will have an RFC1918 source address,
      problems can occur when the returned packet passes through an
      anti-spoofing security control (such as Unicast RPF (uRPF)), other
      anti-spoofing ACLs, or virtually any perimeter firewall. These devices
      will typically drop packets with an RFC1918 source address, breaking the
      successful operation of PMTUD.</t>

      <t>As a result, the potential for application level issues may be
      created.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Unexpected interactions with some NAT implementations">
      <t>Private addressing is legitimately used within many enterprise,
      corporate or government networks for internal network addressing. When
      users on the inside of the network require Internet access, they will
      typically connect through a perimeter router, firewall, or network
      proxy, that provides Network Address Translation (NAT) or Network
      Address Port Translation (NAPT) services to a public interface.</t>

      <t>Unpredictable or confusing interactions could occur if traffic such
      as traceroute, PMTUD and possibly other applications were launched from
      the NAT IPv4 ‘inside address’ and it passed over the same address range
      in the public IP core. While such a situation would be unlikely to occur
      if the NAT pools and the private infrastructure addressing were under
      the same administration, such a situation could occur in the more
      typical situation of a NAT'ed corporate network connecting to an ISP.
      For example, say if 10.1.1.0/24 is used to internally number the
      corporate network. A traceroute or PMTUD request is initiated inside the
      corporate network from say 10.1.1.1. The packet passes through a NAT (or
      NAPT) gateway, then over an ISP core numbered from the same range. When
      the responses are delivered back to the originator, the returned packets
      from the privately addressed part of the ISP core could have an
      identical source and destination address of 10.1.1.1.</t>

      <t>This example has been included to illustrate an effect. Whether that
      effect would be problematic would depend on both the deployment scenario
      and the application in use.</t>

      <t>Further complications may arise during the transition to IPv6.
      Scarcity of public IPv4 addresses is forcing many service providers to
      make use of NAT. CGN (Carrier Grade NAT) will enables service providers
      to assign private RFC 1918 IPv4 addresses to their customers rather than
      public, globally unique IPv4 addresses. NAT444 will make use of a double
      NAT process. Minimally, care will need to be taken where these
      transition schemes are used in conjunction with private RFC1918
      infrastructure addressing.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Interactions with edge anti-spoofing techniques">
      <t>Denial of service attacks and distributed denial of attacks can make
      use of spoofed source IP addresses in an attempt to obfuscate the source
      of an attack. RFC2827 (Network Ingress Filtering) strongly recommends
      that providers of Internet connectivity implement filtering to prevent
      packets using source addresses outside of their legitimately assigned
      and advertised prefix ranges. Such filtering should also prevent packets
      with private source addresses from egressing the AS.</t>

      <t>Best security practices for ISPs also strongly recommend that packets
      with illegitimate source addresses should be dropped at the AS
      perimeter. Illegitimate source addresses includes private IP (RFC1918)
      addresses, addresses within the provider's assigned prefix ranges, and
      bogons (legitimate but unassigned IP addresses). Additionally, packets
      with private IP destination addresses should also be dropped at the AS
      perimeter.</t>

      <t>If such filtering is properly deployed, then traffic either sourced
      from, or destined for privately addressed portions of the network should
      be dropped. Hence the negative consequences on traceroute, PMTUD and
      regular ping type traffic.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Peering using loopbacks">
      <t>Although not a common technique, some ISPs use the loopback addresses
      of border routers (ASBRs) for peering, in particular where multiple
      connections or exchange points exist between the two ISPs. Such a
      technique is used by some ISPs as the foundation of fine grained traffic
      engineering and load balancing through the combination of IGP metrics
      and multi-hop BGP. When private or non-globally reachable addresses are
      used as loopback addresses, this technique is either not possible, or
      considerably more complex to implement.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DNS Interaction">
      <t>Many ISPs utilise their DNS to perform both forward and reverse
      resolution for the infrastructure devices and infrastructure addresses.
      With a privately numbered core, the ISP itself will still have the
      capability to perform name resolution of their own infrastructure.
      However others outside of the autonomous system will not have this
      capability. At best, they will get a number of unidentified RFC1918 IP
      addresses returned from a traceroute.</t>

      <t>It is also worth noting that in some cases the reverse resolution
      requests may leak outside of the AS. Such a situation can add load to
      public DNS servers. Further information on this problem is documented in
      the internet draft "AS112 Nameserver Operations". </t>

      <iref item="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-as112-ops-08"
            primary="true" />
    </section>

    <section title="Operational and Troubleshooting issues">
      <t>Previous sections of the document have noted issues relating to
      network operations and troubleshooting. In particular when private IP
      addressing within an ISP core is used, the ability to easily
      troubleshoot across the AS boundary may be limited. In some cases this
      may be a serious troubleshooting impediment. In other cases, it may be
      solved through the use of alternative troubleshooting techniques.</t>

      <t>The key point is that the flexibility of initiating an outbound ping
      or traceroute from a privately numbered section of the network is lost.
      In a complex topology, with multiple paths and exit points from the AS,
      the provider may be restricted in their ability to trace paths through
      the network to other ASs. Such a situation could be a severe
      troubleshooting impediment.</t>

      <t>For users outside of the AS, the loss of the ability to use a
      traceroute for troubleshooting is very often a serious issue. As soon as
      many of these people see a row of "* * *" in a traceroute they often
      incorrectly assume that a large part of the network is down or
      inaccessible (e.g. behind a firewall). Operational experience in many
      large providers has shown that significant confusion can result.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>One of the arguments often put forward for the use of private
      addressing within an ISP is an improvement in the network security. It
      has been argued that if private addressing is used within the core, the
      network infrastructure becomes unreachable from outside the providers
      autonomous system, hence protecting the infrastructure. There is
      legitimacy to this argument. Certainly if the core is privately numbered
      and unreachable, it potentially provides a level of isolation in
      addition to what can be achieved with other techniques, such as
      infrastructure ACLs, on their own. This is especially true in the event
      of an ACL misconfiguration, something that does commonly occur as the
      result of human error.</t>

      <t>There are three key security gaps that exist in a privately addressed
      IP core.<list>
          <t>The approach does not protect against reflection attacks if edge
          anti-spoofing is not deployed. For example, if a packet with spoofed
          source address corresponding to the networks infrastructure address
          range, is sent to a host (or other device) attached to the network,
          that host will send its response directly to the infrastructure
          address. If such an attack was performed across a large number of
          hosts, then a successful large scale denial of service attack on the
          infrastructure could be achieved. This is not to say that a publicly
          numbered core will protect from the same attack, it won’t. The key
          point is that a reflection attack does get around the apparent
          security offered in a privately addressed core.</t>

          <t>Even if anti-spoofing is deployed at the AS boundary, the border
          routers will potentially carry routing information for the privately
          addressed network infrastructure. This can mean that packets with
          spoofed addresses, corresponding to the private infrastructure
          addressing, may be considered legitimate by edge anti-spoofing
          techniques such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding – Loose Mode, and
          forwarded. To avoid this situation, an edge anti-spoofing algorithm
          such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding – Strict Mode, would be
          required. Strict approaches can be problematic in some environments
          or where asymmetric traffic paths exist.</t>

          <t>The approach on its own does not protect the network
          infrastructure from directly connected customers (i.e. within the
          same AS). Unless other security controls, such as access control
          lists (ACLs), are deployed at the ingress point of the network,
          customer devices will normally be able to reach, and potentially
          attack, both core and edge infrastructure devices.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Alternate approaches to core network security">
      <t>Today, hardware-based ACLs, which have minimal to no performance
      impact, are now widespread. Applying an ACL at the AS perimeter to
      prevent access to the network core may be a far simpler approach and
      provide comparable protection to using private addressing, Such a
      technique is known as an infrastructure ACL (iACL).</t>

      <t>In concept, iACLs provide filtering at the edge network which allows
      traffic to cross the network core, but not to terminate on
      infrastructure addresses within the core. Proper iACL deployment will
      normally allow required network management traffic to be passed, such
      that traceroutes and PMTUD can still operate successfully. For an iACL
      deployment to be practical, the core network needs to have been
      addressed with a relatively small number of contiguous address blocks.
      For this reason, the technique may or may not be practical.</t>

      <t>A second approach to preventing external access to the core is IS-IS
      core hiding. This technique makes use of a fundamental property of the
      IS-IS protocol which allows link addresses to be removed from the
      routing table while still allowing loopback addresses to be resolved as
      next hops for BGP. The technique prevents parties outside the AS from
      being able to route to infrastructure addresses, while still allowing
      traceroutes to operate successfully. IS-IS core hiding does not have the
      same practical requirement for the core to be addressed from a small
      number of contiguous address blocks as with iACLs.</t>

      <t>A third approach is the use of either an MPLS based IP VPN, or an
      MPLS based IP Core where the 'P' routers (or Label Switch Routers) do
      not carry global routing information. As the core 'P' routers (or Label
      Switch Routers) are only switching labeled traffic, they are effectively
      not reachable from outside of the MPLS domain. The 'P' routers can
      optionally be hidden such they do not appear in a traceroute. While this
      approach isolates the 'P' routers from directed attacks, it does not
      protect the edge routers - being either a 'PE' router or a Label Edge
      Router (LER). Obviously there are numerous other engineering
      considerations in such an approach, we simply note it as an option.</t>

      <t>These techniques may not be suitable for every network, however,
      there are many circumstances where they can be used successfully without
      the associated effects of a privately addressing the core.</t>
