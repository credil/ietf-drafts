Internet-Draft       Network Management SRV Records         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies how to use Domain Name Service (DNS) SRV
   Resource Records (RRs) to locate network management services.  The
   use of SRV RRs can be useful in network bootstrapping scenarios.  DNS
   SRV RRs may be used for different purposes:

   o  Manageable devices announce their management interfaces using a
      multicast DNS service.  A management system discovers the devices
      and initiates management interactions with them.

   o  Devices discover destinations for event notifications by looking
      up statically configured SRV RRs in the DNS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  SRV Service Labels

2.1.  SYSLOG

   The Reliable Delivery of syslog specification [RFC3195] mentioned the
   usage of DNS SRV RRs to locate SYSLOG collectors.  The more recent
   structured SYSLOG specification [RFC5424] and the associated
   transport mappings [RFC5425] and [RFC5426] do not discuss the usage
   of SRV RRs.

   This specification takes the service label definition from [RFC3195]
   and makes it applicable to structured SYSLOG as defined in [RFC5424].

   _syslog  Identifies a SYSLOG collector.  This SRV RR is primarily for
      discovery of SYSLOG collectors by SYSLOG originators or relays.

   Example: service records

             _syslog._tcp    SRV 0 1 6514 nms.example.com.
             _syslog._udp    SRV 0 1  514 nms.example.com.

2.2.  SNMP

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3410] distinguishes
   between SNMP entities containing command responder and notification
   originator applications (traditionally called agents) and SNMP
   entities containing command generator and/or notification receiver
   applications (traditionally called a managers) [RFC3411].

Internet-Draft       Network Management SRV Records         October 2010


   This specification adds two SRV service labels for SNMP:

   _snmp  Identifies an SNMP entity containing a command responder
      application.  This record is primarily for discovery of SNMP
      agents that announce their presence using multicast DNS protocols.

   _snmp-trap  Identifies an SNMP entity containing a notification
      receiver application.  This SRV RR is primarily for discovery of
      SNMP trap sinks by SNMP notification generator applications.

   Example: service records

             _snmp._udp         SRV 0 1 161 device.example.com.
             _snmp-trap._udp    SRV 0 1 162 nms.example.com.

2.3.  NETCONF

   The NECONF protocol [RFC4741] provides mechanisms to install,
   manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.  The
   mandatory to implement transport uses the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol
   [RFC4742] and SSH sessions are always initiated by the NETCONF
   client.

   This specification adds a new SRV service label for NETCONF:

   _netconf  Identifies a NETCONF server.  This record is primarily for
      discovery of NETCONF servers that announce their presence using
      multicast DNS protocols.

   Example: service records

             _netconf._tcp    SRV 0 1 830 device.example.com.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   1.  draft-gudmundsson-dns-srv-iana-registry-04 proposes a template
       for registering SRV names.  We may have to use this format in
       case draft-gudmundsson-dns-srv-iana-registry-04 moves forward.

   2.  draft-hallambaker-esrv-00 proposes a mechanism to store
       additional information in so called ESRV records (e.g., which
       security protocol to use).  This is traditionally done using TXT
       records.
