Abstract

   This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet
   Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service using BGP for auto-discovery and
   signaling [RFC4761]. The proposed solution is characterized by breaking
   communication channels between Leafs to fulfill the specific E-Tree requirement:
   Leaf cannot communicate with Leaf. Backward compatibility is also considered.

1. Introduction

   A specific Rooted-multipoint service, Ethernet Tree(E-Tree), has been
   defined by Metro Ethernet Forum [MEF6.1]. Compared with MEF Ethernet
   LAN (E-LAN) service where there is no communication restriction
   between its attachment circuits, each attachment circuit of E-tree is
   designated as either a Root or a Leaf. A Root-AC can communicate with
   all other attachment circuit in a E-Tree, however a Leaf-AC can only
   communicate with Root-ACs but not Leafs.

   [Draft VPLS ETree Req] provides the functional requirements for MEF
   E-Tree support in VPLS.

   This document presents a minimal extension to the current VPLS
   standard [RFC4761] to break the "communication channel" between Leaf
   attachment circuits.

   Figure 1 below describes scenario for Leaf-to-Leaf communication
   restriction.

   If PE2 receives one frame from PE1 over Ethernet PW, PE2 does NOT
   know whether the frame comes from Root AC or Leaf AC, so it can not
   decide to forward the frame to AC4 (Leaf AC) or not with the current
   VPLS standards [RFC4761] [RFC4762].

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Terminology

    There are two solutions to restrict Leaf-to-Leaf communication,

   1. Each frame carries additional information to indicate that it is
      originated from a Leaf endpoint or Root endpoint on the ingress PE,
      then egress PE can know forward behavior of the frame, if it comes
      from Leaf, it will NOT be forwarded to the local Leaf ACs.
      [Draft Ext VPLS for ETree] proposes this solution.

   2. If a frame from local Leaf-ACs, one PE in a VPLS will NOT forward
      it to its other local Leaf-ACs; if there is no PW between local
      Leafs and remote Leaf-ACs which are connected to remote PE, a
      frame from local Leafs also cannot be forwarded to remote Leafs.
      Then we can restrict the communication between Leafs.

   The purposed solution in this document prefers to the second and two
   terms are introduced,

   o Root-endpoint. One endpoint which connects only Root-ACs, one or
      more Root-ACs.

   o Leaf-endpoint. One endpoint which connects only Leaf-ACs, one or
      more Leaf-ACs.

   There is no endpoint which connects both Root-ACs and Leaf-ACs in the
   second solution.

4. Reference Model

   Figure 2 below describes a typical reference model where Root ACs
   {AC1, AC5, AC6} can communicate with all other Ethernet ACs in the

   VSI, but Leaf ACs {AC2, AC3, AC4} only can communicate with Root ACs
   {AC1, AC5, AC6}, and can not communicate with each other.

                 Figure 2  E-Tree typical Reference Model

   In most use cases, an E-Tree architecture has only a few Root ACs but
   many Leaf-ACs. On any PE in E-Tree, there are 3 cases,

   o Root-only ACs. All ACs connected to VSI are Root ACs, say AC5 and
      AC6 of PE 3 in Figure 2 and at least one VE ID which stands for
      one Root endpoint is assigned.

   o Leaf-only ACs. All ACs connected to VSI are Leaf ACs, say AC3 and
      AC4 of PE 2 in Figure 2 and at least one VE ID which stands for
      one Leaf endpoint is assigned.

   o Root-Leaf-Mixed ACs. Some ACs connected to VSI are Root ACs and
      some are Leaf ACs, say AC1 and AC2 of PE 1 in Figure 2. Here
      network administrator should at least assign two VE IDs, one for
      Root ACs and called as Root-endpoint, one for Leaf ACs and called
      as Leaf-endpoint.

   Within an E-Tree,

Internet-Draft    Extension to BGP-VPLS for E-Tree          April 2011


   o All Root-ACs of a Root endpoint can receive frame from and
      transmit frame to any other endpoints in an E-Tree.

   o A Root-AC of a Root endpoint can receive frame from and transmit
      frame to its other Root-ACs;

   o A Leaf endpoint can receive frame from and transmit frame to any
      Root endpoints in an E-Tree.

   o A Leaf endpoint cannot receive frame from and transmit frame to
      any other Leaf endpoints in the E-Tree.

   o A Leaf-AC of a Leaf endpoint cannot receive frame from and
      transmit frame to its other Leaf-ACs;

   For one VSI, PE 1 has both Root and Leaf ACs, so on PE 1, PE 1
   establish one PW (PW12) for AC 1 (Root AC, also belongs to a Root
   endpoint) with PE 2 where remote ACs are Leaf-only, two PWs with PE 3
   where PE 1 receives frames from or transmits frames to remote Root
   ACs for local Root ACs over PW13-1 and receives frames from or
   transmits frames to remote Root ACs for local Leaf ACs; PE 2 has
   Leaf-only ACs, so PE 2 establish one PW (PW12) with remote Root ACs
   on PE 1 and one PW (PW23) with remote Root ACs on PE3; PW3 which has
   Root-only ACs can establish PW with remote Leaf ACs and Root ACs, so
   PE 3 establish two PWs with PE 1 and one PW with PE2. However the ACs
   on PE 2 are Leaf, so any Ethernet frame which is received from AC 3
   cannot be transmitted to other local Leaf ACs, say AC4. PE 2 also can
   not transmit Ethernet frame to remote Leaf ACs since there is no PW
   for it.

   This applies to all traffic, including Unicast Known, Unicast Unknown,
   Broadcast or Multicast.

5. Extension to VPLS for E-Tree

5.1. Assumptions

   The PEs are assumed to be (logically) fully meshed with tunnels over
   which packets that belong to a service (such as VPLS or E-Tree) are
   encapsulated and forwarded.

   Any E-Tree endpoint comprises only one AC type. If a PE in a VPLS has
   both Root ACs and Leaf ACs, it SHOULD be configured with at least two
   endpoints, one is composed of Root ACs, and another is composed of
   Leaf ACs. It is illegal for any endpoint to have both at same time.

Internet-Draft    Extension to BGP-VPLS for E-Tree          April 2011


5.2. AC type

   Each AC connected to an E-Tree on PE MUST have an AC attribute, Root
   AC or Leaf AC. For backward compatibility, the default AC type MUST
   be Root for current VPLS standard [RFC4761] [RFC4762].

   o Root AC. It can communicate with all ACs in a VPLS or E-Tree and
      SHOULD belongs to a Root endpoint.

   o Leaf AC. It only can communicate with all Root ACs in a VPLS or E-
      Tree, and SHOULD belongs to a Leaf endpoint

5.3. PW setup Matrix

   Just as mentioned in Section 3, there is no PW between Leaf-endpoints
   and Table 1 describes PW setup matrix,

                     +---------------+-------+------+
                     | endpoint type +  Root + Leaf +
                     +---------------+-------+------+
                     |     Root      + Setup + Setup+
                     +---------------+-------+------+
                     |     Leaf      + Setup +  n/a +
                     +---------------+-------+------+
                          Table 1 PW setup Matrix

   In the following cases PW may be established,

   o Local Root-Remote Root

   o Local Root-Remote Leaf or Local Leaf-Remote Root

   Between PE 1 and PE 2 in Figure 1, we have to setup 3 PWs,

   o PW 1: Communication between Root ACs, i.e., AC 1 and AC 3 in
      Figure 1.

   o PW 2: Communication between Root AC and Leaf AC, i.e., AC 1 and AC
      4 in Figure 1.

   o PW 3: Communication between Root AC and Leaf AC, i.e., AC 2 and AC
      3 in Figure 1.

5.4. VPLS BGP NLRI

   Section 3.2.2 in [RFC 4761] defines VPLS BGP NLRI with a new AFI and
   SAFI to exchange VPLS membership and demultiplexors.

                  Figure 3 BGP NLRI for VPLS Information

   A PE participating in a E-Tree must have at least one VE ID, but for
   a VSI on a PE which has both Root-ACs and Leaf-ACs, it must have at
   least two VE IDs, one is called as Root endpoint and one is called as
   Leaf endpoint.

   Here whole VE ID set is divided into two parts, one is Root VE ID set,
   and one is Leaf VE id set.

   L = {VBO, VBO+1, ......, VBO+LVBS-1},

   R = { VBO+LVBS, VBO+LVBS +1,......, VBO+VBS-1},

   Here VE ID, Leaf VE block Size (LVBS) and VE Block Size (VBO) are
   typically assigned by the network administrator. All Root VE IDs are
   in R set, and all Leaf VE IDs are in L set. If there are Root-only
   ACs on a PE, LVBS SHOULD be set as zero; if there are Leaf-only ACs,
   LVBS SHOLU be equal to VBS.

   The endpoint which is identified by VE ID in L set only can establish
   PW with the endpoint identified by VE ID in R set, but the endpoint
   identified by the VE ID in R set can establish PW with all VPLS
   endpoint identified by VE ID in RUL.

5.5. PW setup and teardown

   Suppose PE-a is part of E-Tree foo and has both Root-ACs and Leaf-ACs.
   For Root ACs, it is assigned with VE ID r which is in Root VE ID set,
   VE Block Offset VBO, VE Block Size VBS, and label base rLB; For Leaf
   ACs, it is assigned with VE ID l which is in Leaf VE ID set, VE block
   offset VBO+LVBS, VE Block Size VBS-LVBS, and label base lLB. If PE-b

   is also part of E-Tree foo with VE ID w (Root or Leaf) and gets NLRI
   advertisement from PE-a, it will do the following,

5.5.1.  Root endpoint

   1. Checks if w is part of PE-a's 'remote VE set': if VBO <= w < VBO+
      VBS, then w is part of PE-a's remote VE set.  If not, PE-b ignores
      this message, and skips the rest of this procedure.

   2. Sets up a PW to PE-a: the demultiplexor label to send traffic from
      PE-b to PE-a is computed as (rLB + W - VBO).

   3. Checks if r is part of any 'remote VE set' that PE-b announced,
      i.e., PE-b checks if r belongs to some remote VE set that PE-b
      announced, say with VE Block Offset VBO', VE Block Size VBS', and
      label base LB'.  If not, PE-b MUST make a new announcement as
      described.

   4. Sets up a PW from PE-a: the demultiplexor label over which PE-b
      should expect traffic from PE-a is computed as: (LB' + r - VBO').

   If PE-a withdraws an NLRI for r that PE-b was using, then PE-b MUST
   tear down its ends of the pseudowire between PE-a and PE-b.

5.5.2.  Leaf endpoint

   1. Checks if w is part of PE-a's 'remote VE set': if VBO+LVBS <= w <
      VBO+ VBS, then w is part of PE-a's remote Root VE set.  If not,
      PE-b ignores this message, and skips the rest of this procedure.

   2. Sets up a PW to PE-a: the demultiplexor label to send traffic from
      PE-b to PE-a is computed as (LB + w - VBO).

   3. Checks if l is part of any 'remote VE set' that PE-b announced,
      i.e., PE-b checks if l belongs to some remote VE set that PE-b
      announced, say with VE Block Offset VBO', VE Block Size VBS', and
      label base LB'. If not, PE-b MUST make a new announcement as
      described.

   4. Sets up a PW from PE-a: the demultiplexor label over which PE-b
      should expect traffic from PE-a is computed as: (LB' + l - VBO').

   If PE-a withdraws an NLRI for l that PE-b was using, then PE-b MUST
   tear down its ends of the pseudowire between PE-a and PE-b.

5.6. Signaling PE Capabilities

   The extended attribute in Section [RFC4761] 3.2.4, the "Layer2 Info
   Extended Community", is used to signal control information about the
   pseudowires to be setup for a VPLS. It also can carry endpoint
   information. It will be extended in later version.

5.7. Backward Compatibility

   Root-ACs and Leaf-ACs are used only in cases where PEs support E-Tree
   and have no impact on VPLS PEs already in operation.

   In a case where a common VPLS is composed of both PEs supporting the
   solution and PEs not supporting it, ACs attached to PEs which don't
   support E-tree are taken as Root-ACs. The Leaf-to-Leaf communication
   restriction will be implemented within the scope of the compliant PEs.

6. Compliance with Requirements

   The proposed solution in this document meets the requirements
   mentioned in [Draft VPLS ETree Req] Section 5.

   The solution prohibits communication between any two Leaf ACs in a
   VPLS.

   The solution allows multiple Root ACs in a VPLS instance.

   The solution allows Root AC and Leaf AC of a VPLS instance co-exist
   on any PE.

   The solution is applicable to BGP-VPLS [RFC4761].

   The solution is applicable to Case 1: Single technology "VPLS-only".

7. Security Considerations

   This will be added in later version.
