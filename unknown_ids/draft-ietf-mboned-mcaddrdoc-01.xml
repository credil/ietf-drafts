  <abstract>
    <t>This document discusses which multicast addresses should be used for
      documentation purposes and reserves multicast addresses for such
      use. Some multicast addresses are derived from
      AS numbers or unicast addresses. This document also explains how
      these can be used for documentation purposes.</t> 
  </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>It is often useful in documentation, IETF documents, etc.,
    to provide examples containing IP multicast addresses.
    For documentation where examples of general purpose multicast addresses
    are needed, one should use multicast addresses that never will be
    assigned or in actual use. There is a risk that addresses used in
    examples may accidentally be used. It is then important that the
    same addresses are not used by other multicast applications or
    services. It may also be beneficial to filter out such addresses
    from multicast signalling and multicast data sent to such addresses.
    </t><t>
    For unicast there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    reserved for this purpose,
    see <xref target="RFC5737"/> and <xref target="RFC3849"/>
    respectively. This document reserves multicast addresses for this
    purpose.
    </t>
    <t>There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
    numbers or unicast addresses. For examples where such addresses are
    desired, one should derive them from the AS numbers and unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes. This document also
    discusses the use of these.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IPv4 multicast documentation addresses">
    <t>
    The type of multicast addresses most commonly used today, are
    addresses used for so-called ASM (Any-Source Multicast). For
    ASM, the IPv4 multicast addresses allocated for documentation purposes
    are 233.252.0.0 - 233.252.0.255 (233.252.0.0/24).
    </t>
    <t>
    Another type of multicast is SSM (Source-Specific Multicast). For
    SSM it is less important which multicast addresses are used, since
    a host/application joins a channel identified by both source and
    group. Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes,
    see <xref target="RFC5737"/>.
    </t>
    <t>Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific
    type of address is desired. E.g. for text about multicast scoping,
    one might want the examples to use addresses that are to be used for
    administrative scoping. See below for guidance on how to construct
    specific types of example addresses.</t>

    <section title="Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses">
      <t>Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses
      <xref target="RFC2365"/> are reserved for scoped multicast. They can
      be used within a site or an organization. Apart from a small set of
      scope relative addresses, these addresses are not assigned. There are
      no specific scoped addresses available for documentation purposes.
      Except for examples detailing the use of scoped multicast, one should
      avoid using them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="GLOP multicast addresses">
      <t>GLOP <xref target="RFC3180"/> is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast
      group addresses from 16 bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP
      addresses are desired, the addresses should be
      derived from the AS numbers reserved for documentation use. See
      <xref target="RFC5398"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses">
    <t>IPv4 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,
    see <xref target="RFC6034"/>. For examples where this type of addresses
    are desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
    reserved for documentation purposes, see <xref target="RFC5737"/>.
    </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="IPv6 multicast documentation addresses">
    <t>
    The type of multicast addresses most commonly used today, are
    addresses used for so-called ASM (Any-Source Multicast). For
    ASM, the IPv6 multicast addresses allocated for documentation purposes
    are TBD.
    </t>
    <t>
    Another type of multicast is SSM (Source-Specific Multicast). For
    SSM it is less important which multicast addresses are used, since
    a host/application joins a channel identified by both source and
    group. Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes,
    see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
    </t>
    <t>Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific
    type of address is desired. E.g. for text about multicast scoping,
    one might want the examples to use addresses that are to be used for
    administrative scoping. See below for guidance on how to construct
    specific types of example addresses.</t>

    <section title="Unicast prefix based IPv6 multicast addresses">
      <t>IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,
      see <xref target="RFC3306"/>. For examples where this type of addresses
      is desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
      reserved for documentation purposes, see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
      </t> 
    </section>
    <section title="Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses">
      <t>There is a type of IPv6 multicast addresses called Embedded-RP
      addresses where the IPv6 address of a Rendezvous-Point is embedded
      inside the multicast address, see <xref target="RFC3956"/>.
      For examples where this type of addresses is desired, the addresses should
      be derived from the unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes,
      see see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
      </t> 
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes has no
impact on security.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>IANA is requested to assign "variable scope" IPv6 multicast addresses
    for documentation purposes. This should be a /96 prefix of the form
    FF0X:...

  <section title="Examples">
    <t>Usually addresses for documentation can simply be selected from the
    addresses reserved for such. But as we discuss in this document, there
    are cases where one wants to use multicast addresses derived from AS
    numbers (GLOP) or from unicast addresses. In this appendix we will
    just provide some examples for how such addresses can be derived.</t>

    <section title="GLOP multicast addresses">
      <t>GLOP <xref target="RFC3180"/> is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast
      group addresses from 16 bit AS numbers. The 16 bit AS numbers
      reserved for documentation use in <xref target="RFC5398"/>
      are 64496 - 64511. By use of <xref target="RFC3180"/>, we then
      get 16 /24 multicast prefixes for documentation use. The first
      one 233.251.240.0/24, and the last 233.251.255.0/24.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses">
      <t>IPv4 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,
      see <xref target="RFC6034"/>. There are three unicast address ranges
      provided for documentation use in <xref target="RFC5737"/>. The ranges
      are 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24. Using
      <xref target="RFC6034"/> this leaves us with the unicast prefix based
      IPv4 multicast addresses 234.192.0.2, 234.198.51.100 and 234.203.0.113.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Unicast prefix based IPv6 multicast addresses">
      <t>IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,
      see <xref target="RFC3306"/>. The IPv6 unicast prefix reserved for
      documentation purposes is 2001:DB8::/32, see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
      This allows a wide range of different IPv6 multicast addresses. Using
      just the base /32 prefix, one get the IPv6 multicast prefixes
      FF3X:20:2001:DB8::/64, one for each available scope X. But also, from
      2001:DB8::/32 one can pick say a /64 prefix 2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/64
      which gives us the multicast prefixes FF3X:40:2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/96,
      one for each available scope X.
      </t> 
    </section>
    <section title="Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses">
      <t>For Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses, the the IPv6 address of
       a Rendezvous-Point is embedded inside the multicast address,
       see <xref target="RFC3956"/>. For documentation purposes, the RP
       address can be any address from the range 2001:DB8::/32,
       see <xref target="RFC3849"/>, that follows the constraints specified
       in <xref target="RFC3956"/>. One example address could be 2001:DB8::1.
       The embedded-RP multicast prefixes might then be
       FF7X:120:2001:DB8::/96. Another example could be the RP address
       2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::7 which gives the prefixes
       FF7X:740:2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::/96. See also the examples in
       <xref target="RFC3956"/>.
