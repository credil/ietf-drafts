Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery                May 2010


1.  Introduction

   As the spam problem continues to expand and potential solutions
   evolve, network operators are increasingly exchanging abuse reports
   among themselves and other parties.  While [MARF-BASE] defines a
   format for these reports, it assumes that the operators will use some
   undefined method to discover each other and enter into any necessary
   agreements.

   The advertisement method defined in this memo is intended to ease the
   process for potential ARF recipients to discover whether a particular
   ADMD has the facility and willingness to generate ARF reports, and
   for ARF generators to discover whether a particular ADMD is able and
   willing to receive ARF reports.  Also included is a facility for end-
   user MUAs to discover whether there is an abuse reporting address
   within their own ADMD.

   This document only defines the process for advertisement and
   discovery of feedback recipients.  Determination of when it is
   appropriate to send feedback or how trust may be established between
   report generators and report recipients is outside the scope of this
   document.  It is assumed that best practices will evolve over time,
   and will be codified in future documents.

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery                May 2010


2.  Purpose

   The reports defined in [MARF-BASE] are intended for multiple
   purposes:

   o  To inform ISPs about email abuse originating from or related to
      their networks;

   o  To inform email service providers or other primarily outbound
      senders that there may be abuse issues regarding their mail; these
      issues include (but are not limited to) reports that the mail may
      be considered to be "spam" by a recipient of the message.

   To support these purposes, this document addresses three primary use
   cases:

   o  Any ADMD may advertise their willingness to receive reports from
      the internet at large, given particular criteria included in or
      referenced by the advertisement;

   o  Any ADMD may advertise their willingness to provide reports to the
      internet at large, given particular criteria included in or
      referenced by the advertisement;

   o  Any ADMD may advertise the method for their own end users to
      report issues directly (likely through their MUA), so that these
      reports may be handled through that ADMD's own policies -- which
      may include distribution to another ADMD in the form of an ARF
      message.

   This specification also inherits from [MARF-BASE] that it is intended
   specifically for communications among providers regarding email abuse
   and related issues, and SHOULD NOT be used for other reports.  For
   example, the [DKIM-REPORTING] extension includes its own ARF
   recipient discovery method which should not be confused with the
   method defined in this memo.

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery                May 2010


3.  Requirements

   The advertisement and discovery process must be easily accessible to
   the software involved in providing email service, preferably using
   concepts and technologies an email operator can be assumed to be
   familiar with.  Thus, following the examples of [DKIM] and
   [DKIM-REPORTING], the advertisement is in the form of a [DNS] TXT
   record.  While this may provide challenges for offline processing,
   this is outweighed by the advantages of security and maintainability.

   In order to reflect current usage, advertisements must also provide
   the ability to reference complex "terms of service" or other
   documents outside of the scope of a simple discovery method.  This is
   accomplished through the inclusion of a URI.

   And finally, the advertisement must be readable by humans (assuming
   they have access to this memo) as well as software specifically
   written for the purpose.

4.  Language

   This section defines various terms used throughout this document.

4.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

4.2.  Email Specific

   [EMAIL-ARCH] introduces several terms and concepts that are used in
   this memo, and thus readers are advised to become familiar with it as
   well.

4.3.  ARF Specific

   [MARF-BASE] introduces terms and concepts that are necessary for a
   full understanding of this memo, and thus readers are advised to read
   it before continuing.

5.  Characteristics of a Feedback Reporting Advertisement

   An advertisement of willingness to generate or receive feedback is
   found in the [DNS] record of a domain associated with the mail
   service, using a construct of _report.domain.

   In the case of a feedback generator, the advertisement will be
   associated with the domain which receives the email for which
   feedback may be generated.  For example, when email is addressed to
   example.com, the advertisement will be located at
   _report.example.com.

   In the case of a feedback consumer, the advertisement will be
   associated with either the [DKIM] d= domain or the [SMTP] MAIL FROM
   domain of the email message for which feedback may be generated --
   preferably both.

   In the case of a feedback generator soliciting reports from their own
   end users, the advertisement will be associated with the host which
   provides [IMAP] or [POP] service to that user.  For example, when the
   user's IMAP server is imap.example.net, the applicable advertisement
   will be found at _report.imap.example.net.

5.1.  Feedback Consumers

      the address to which reports should be sent.  Required; no
      default.

      the format of the report requested; currently only "ARF"
      ([MARF-BASE]) is supported.  Optional; defaults to ARF.

      requested report interval; may not be supported by all
      implementors.  Optional; if omitted, all reports may be sent.

      colon-separated list of ARF ([MARF-BASE]) feedback types for which
      reports are requested.  Optional; if omitted, all report types may
      be sent.

      email address of a person or role account responsible for handling
      any issues related to receiving reports.  Optional, but SHOULD be
      defined; defaults to postmaster@ the domain.

      stated policy, as listed below.  Optional; defaults to "o".

      open to reports from all sources.  This is the default.

      restricted to reports from the domain's own users, as defined in
      additional fields below.

      closed; no reports are requested.  This option is intended for
      testing purposes.

5.2.  Feedback Generators

      the format of reports offered; currently only "ARF" ([MARF-BASE])
      is supported.  Optional; defaults to "ARF".

      colon-separated list of ARF ([MARF-BASE]) feedback types for which
      reports are available.  (Optional; if omitted, any report types

      handling any issues related to receiving reports.  Optional, but
      SHOULD be defined; defaults to postmaster@ the domain.

      stated policy, as listed below.  Optional; defaults to "o".

      URI for additional information.  This field SHOULD be defined for
      a policy of "o" or "c", and MUST be defined when the policy is
      "r".  Otherwise, the field is optional; there is no default.

5.2.1.  Feedback Generator Policies

   Policies are listed in the "gp" tag, described above.

      open to providing reports to any consumer.  This option is the
      default policy.

      open to providing reports only after the prospective consumer has
      completed an application process, which may be found at the URI
      defined by the "gu" tag above.

      closed; no reports are available.  This option is intended for
      testing purposes.

5.3.  Reporting Facility for End Users within an ADMD

   When the advertisement is intended to permit end users to report
   messages, it MUST include "rp=u" and SHOULD define the "re" field.

      a colon-separated list of report formats accepted.  Required.

      the email address to which reports MUST be addressed if using
      either the "ARF" or "822" formats.

      an [SMTP] or [SUBMISSION] server via which reports MUST be
      submitted if using the "ARF" or "822" formats defined above.
      Optional; if not defined, implementors SHOULD use whichever SMTP
      server was configured by the user.

      a URI to which the report MUST be submitted if using the "HTTP"
      format.  Otherwise optional.

5.3.1.  End User Reporting Formats

   The format is defined in the "uf" field, described above.

      an ARF ([MARF-BASE]) report may be sent to the email address
      defined in "ur" above, using the [SMTP] server defined in "us"
      above (if any).

      an email message containing a message/rfc822 [MIME] part may be
      sent to the email address defined in "ur" above, using the [SMTP]
      server defined in "us" above (if any).

      a message/rfc822 [MIME] document may be transmitted via [HTTP]
      POST to the URI defined in "uu" below.

5.4.  Note about URIs

   While this memo assumes that advertisements will contain http:// or
   similar URIs, implementors should be aware that the URI-related
   fields can carry many different types of data depending on the URI
   scheme used.  For more information, please consult the URI Schemes
   registry maintained by IANA.

5.5.  Formal Definition

   The formal definition using [ABNF] is TBD.
