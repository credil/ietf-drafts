Abstract

   The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that access to a
   network has already happened using the traditional network access

   authentication procedures or that no authentication for network
   access is needed (e.g., in case of public hotspots).  Subsequent
   protocol interactions, such as obtaining location information,
   learning the address of the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and
   the emergency call itself are largely decoupled from the underlying
   network access procedures.

   There are, however, cases where a device is not in possession of
   credentials for network access, does not have a VoIP provider, or
   where the credentials are available but became invalid due to various
   reasons (e.g., credit exhaustion, expired accounts, etc.).

   This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology
   and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services
   architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the older technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available that could be used to make a request for help, which are
   not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them
   to be used to place emergency calls.

   Based on the communication model of the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) as excerised in the IETF it is not necessary to deploy SIP
   entities in access networks (or associated to them).  Instead, VoIP
   provider may deploy their SIP entities at any place on the Internet.
   The IETF emergency services architecture acknowledges this deployment
   model and even goes a step further by recognizing that there are
   potentially other, non-SIP VoIP provider, that might want to offer
   emergency service support to their customers.  Hence, the interaction
   between a SIP User Agent and its VoIP provider does not need to be
   standarized although [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] provides best current
   practise recommendations regarding the usage of certain features as
   excerised in the case of SIP.

   This flexibility has implications for the architecture, as briefly
   described in [I-D.tschofenig-ecrit-architecture-overview], but allows
   access networks to be application layer agnostic.  Furthermore, since
   the normal VoIP communication exchanges do not traverse these
   entities in the access network it is quite likely that
   interoperability problems will occur especially in an emergency case.

   There are essentially three environments that need to be considered:

   1.  The emergency caller does not credentials for access to the
       network but it still has credentials for his VoIP provider.

       This is often the case with enterprise networks, home networks,
       or governmental networks.  In other cases the user might be able
       to obtain such credentials, for example in hotspots found in
       hotels, at airports, and in many coffee shops.  Unfortunately,
       users have to go through a lengthy procedure (often involving
       captive portals) to obtain a temporary account in exchange of
       money.  In emergency situations it is certainly not desirable to
       let the user find their way through a number of webpages and to
       type-in their credit card details.

   2.  The emergency caller has credentials for network access but does
       not have credentials for a VoIP provider.  This case is rather
       unlikely.
   3.  The emergency caller has credentials (for either network access
       or it's VoIP provider) but they do not provide enough
       authorization to make a call.  This use case essentially refers
       to lack of authorization.  Examples are: Insufficient credits,
       lack of a roaming agreement (between visited network and home
       network), disabled account, and other authorization failures.

   Scenario (1) is the most likely scenario and the main focus of this
   document.

   In all these cases it is not possible to place an emergency call as
   envisioned in the IETF emergerency services architecture, described
   in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework].

   Note that at the time of writing there is currently no regulation in
   place that demands the functionality described in this memo.  Since
   many SDOs have started their work on this subject in a proactive
   fashion in the anticipation that national regulation in some
   countries might demand this functionality for a subset of network
   types.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   This document introduces new terminology:

   Unauthenticated Emergency Service:  We use this term in this document
      to refer to all the cases where the emergency caller does not have
      credentials or are not authorized to access a network.  This also
      includes cases where a device is not in possession of credentials
      for network access, does not have a VoIP provider (as it is the
      case for uninitialized phones), or where the credentials are
      available but became invalid due to various reasons (e.g., credit
      exhaustion, expired accounts, etc.).

   This document reuses terminology from [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps]
   and [I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements].

3.  Architecture

   For unauthenticated emergency services support it is insufficient to
   provide mechanisms only at the link layer in order to bypass
   authentication.  A modification to the emergency services
   architecture is necessary since the IAP and the ISP need to make sure
   that the claimed emergency caller indeed performs an emergency call
   rather than using the network for other purposes, and thereby acting
   fraudulent by skipping any authentication, authorization and
   accounting procedures.  Hence, without introducing some understanding
   of the specific application the ISP (and consequently the IAP) will
   not be able to detect and filter malicious activities.  This leads to
   the architecture described in Figure 1 where the IAP needs to
   implement extensions to link layer procedures for unauthenticated
   emergency service access and the ISP needs to deploy emergency
   services related entities used for call routing, such as the
   Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP), a Location Configuration
   Server (LCS) and a mapping database.

   On a very high-level, the interaction is as follows starting with the
   end host not being attached to the network and the user starting to
   make an emergency call.

   o  Some radio networks have added support for unauthenticated
      emergency access, some other type of networks advertise these
      capabilities using layer beacons.  The end host learns about these
      unauthenticated emergency services capabilities either from the
      link layer type or from advertisement.
   o  The end host uses the link layer specific network attachment
      procedures defined for unauthenticated network access in order to
      get access to emergency services.
   o  When the link layer network attachment procedure is completed the
      end host learns basic configuration information using DHCP from
      the ISP, including the address of the ESRP, as shown in (2).
   o  When the IP address configuration is completed then the SIP UA
      initiates a SIP INVITE towards the indicated ESRP, as shown in
      (3).  The INVITE message contains all the necessary parameters
      required by Section 4.1.4.
   o  The ESRP receives the INVITE and processes it according to the
      description in Section 4.2.5.  The location of the end host may
      need to be determined using a protocol interaction shown in (4).
   o  Potentially, an interaction between the LCS of the ISP and the LCS
      of the IAP may be necessary, see (5).
   o  Finally, the correct PSAP for the location of the end host has to
      be evaluated, see (6).
   o  The ESRP routes the call to the PSAP, as shown in (7).

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service        August 2007


   o  The PSAP evaluates the initial INVITE and acts according to SIP
      and the description in Section 4.3.4 in order to complete the call
      setup.
   o  Finally, when the call setup is completed media traffic can be
      exchanged between the PSAP operator and the emergency caller,
      according to Section 4.3.5 and Section 4.1.5.

   For editorial reasons the end-to-end SIP and media exchange between
   the PSAP and SIP UA are not shown in Figure 1.

   Two important aspects are worth to highlight:

   o  The IAP/ISP needs to understand the concept of emergency calls and
      the SIP profile described in this document.  No other VoIP
      protocol profile, such as XMPP, Skype, etc., are supported for
      emergency calls in this particular architecture.  Other profiles
      may be added in the future, but the deployment effort is enormous
      since they have to be universally deployed.
   o  The end host has no obligation to determine location information.
      It may attach location information if it has location available
      (e.g., from a GPS receiver).

   Figure 1 shows that the ISP needs to deploy SIP-based emergency
   services functionality.  It is important to note that the ISP itself
   may outsource the functionality by simply providing access to them
   (e.g., it puts the IP address of an ESRP or a LoST server into an
   allow-list).  For editorial reasons this outsourcing is not shown.

4.  Profile

4.1.  End Host Profile

4.1.1.  ESRP Discovery

   The end host MUST use the "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP-
   for-IPv4) Option for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers"
   [RFC3361] (for IPv6) and / or the "Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCPv6) Options for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Servers" [RFC3319].  This SIP proxy located in the ISP network will
   be used as the ESRP for routing emergency calls.  There is no need to
   discovery a separate SIP proxy with specific emergency call
   functionality since the internal procedure for emergency call
   processing is subject of ISP internal operation.

4.1.2.  Location Determination and Location Configuration

   There is no requirement for end hosts to support any Location
   Configuration Protocol.  If clients are in possession of location
   information, for example, based on a built-in GPS receiver then they
   SHOULD attach the location information in a PIDF-LO.  When
   constructing the PIDF-LO the guidelines in PIDF-LO profile
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] MUST be followed.  For civic
   location information the format defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo] MUST be supported.

4.1.3.  Emergency Call Identification

   To determine which calls are emergency calls, some entity needs to
   map a user entered dialstring into this URN scheme.  A user may
   "dial" 1-1-2, but the call would be sent to urn:service:sos.  This
   mapping SHOULD performed at the endpoint device, but MAY be performed
   at an intermediate entity.

   End host MUST use the Service URN mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn] to mark calls as emergency calls for
   their home emergency dial string.  For visited emergency dial string
   the translation into a the Service URN mechanism is not mandatory
   since the ESRP in the ISPs network knows the visited emergency dial
   strings.

4.1.4.  SIP Emergency Call Signaling

   SIP signaling capabilities [RFC3261] are mandated for end hosts.

   The initial SIP signaling method is an INVITE.

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service        August 2007


   1.  The To: MUST be either a service URN in the "sos" tree or the
       visited emergency dial string.  [I-D.rosen-iptel-dialstring] with
       the dialed digits.  The sips URI [RFC3261] MUST NOT be used.
   2.  The From: header MUST be present and SHOULD be the AoR of the
       caller, if available.
   3.  A Via: header MUST be present and SHOULD include the URI of the
       device
   4.  A Route header SHOULD be present with the service URN in the
       "sos" tree, and the loose route parameter.
   5.  A Contact header MUST be present, which might contain a GRUU
       [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu], to permit an immediate call-back to the
       specific device that placed the emergency call.
   6.  Other headers MAY be included as per normal sip behavior
   7.  A Supported: header MUST be included with the 'geolocation'
       option tag [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance], if the device
       understands the concept of SIP Location.  In case that the device
       understands the SIP Location Conveyance
       [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance] extension and has its location
       available, it MUST include location by-value.  In this case, the
       INVITE contains a Supported header with a "geolocation" option
       tag, and a "cid-URL" [RFC2396] as the value in the Geolocation
       header, indicating which message body part contains the PIDF-LO.
       SIP Location Conveyance also requires that the UA MUST support
       multipart message bodies, since SDP will likely be also in the
       INVITE.
   8.  A normal SDP offer SHOULD be included in the INVITE.  The offer
       MUST include the G.711 codec.

4.1.5.  Media

   End points MUST send and receive media streams on RTP [RFC3550].  The
   SIP offer/answer [RFC3264] negotiations MUST be used to agree on the
   media streams to be used.

   End points supporting voice MUST support G.711 A law (and mu Law in
   North America) encoded voice as described in [RFC3551].  It is
   desirable to support wideband codecs in the offer.  Silence
   suppression (Voice Activity Detection methods) MUST NOT be used on
   emergency calls.

   End points SHOULD support Instant Messaging using either [RFC3428] or
   [RFC3920].  End points SHOULD support real-time text [RFC4103].  The
   expectations for emergency service support for the real-time text
   medium, described in [I-D.ietf-sipping-toip], Section 7.1 SHOULD be
   fulfilled.

   Video may be important to support Video Relay Service (Sign language
   interpretation).  End points supporting video MUST support H.264 per

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service        August 2007


   [RFC3984].  Support for video, instant messaging and real-time text
   is optional.

4.1.6.  Testing

   The description in Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] is
   applicable to this document as well.

4.2.  ISP Profile

4.2.1.  ESRP Discovery

   The ISP MUST implement the server side part of "Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP-for-IPv4) Option for Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) Servers" [RFC3361] (for IPv6) and / or the "Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options for Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) Servers" [RFC3319].

4.2.2.  Location Determination and Location Configuration

   The ISP must perform the necesary steps to determine the location of
   the end host.  It is not necessary to standardize a specific
   mechanism.

   The usage of HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] with the
   identity extensions
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions] may be a possible
   choice.  It might be necessary for the ISP to talk to the IAP in
   order to determine the location of the end host.  The work on LIS-to-
   LIS communication may be relevant, see
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-lis2lis-req].

   The ESRP (or a associated entity making location information
   available to the PSAP) MUST understand the PIDF-LO format [RFC4119],
   the PIDF-LO profile [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] and the
   revised civic format [I-D.ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo].

   Note that this architecture also fulfills the requirements for
   location hiding, see
   [I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-location-hiding-requirements].

4.2.3.  Emergency Call Routing

   The ISP must route the emergency call to the PSAP responsible for the
   physical location of the end host.  However, a standardized approach
   for determining the correct PSAP based on a given location may not be
   necessary.




Schulzrinne, et al.     Expires February 20, 2008              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service        August 2007


   For cases where a standardized protocol should be used LoST
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] is a suitable mechanism.

4.2.4.  Emergency Call Identification

   The ESRP MUST understand the Service URN mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn] (i.e., the 'urn:service:sos' tree) and
   additionally the national emergency dial strings.  The ESRP SHOULD
   perform a mapping of national emergency dial strings to Service URNs
   to simplify processing at PSAPs.

4.2.5.  SIP Emergency Call Signaling

   SIP signaling capabilities [RFC3261] are mandated for the ESRP.  The
   ESRP MUST process the messages sent by the client, as indicated in
   Section 4.1.4.  Furthemore, the ESRP MUST be able to add a reference
   to location information, as described in SIP Location Conveyance
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance], before forwarding the call to the
   PSAP.  The ISP MUST be prepared to receive incoming dereferencing
   requests to resolve the reference to the location information.

4.2.6.  Quality of Service

   The ISP may provide QoS mechanisms to ensure the preferential
   treatment of emergency calls.  The specific mechanisms depend on the
   network, may not require standardization and are outside the scope of
   this document.

4.3.  PSAP Profile

4.3.1.  Location Retrieval

   The PSAP MUST act according to SIP Location Conveyance when
   processing a request with location information.  In particular, it
   MUST understand PIDF-LO format [RFC4119], the PIDF-LO profile
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] and the revised civic format
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo].  Furthermore, the PSAP MUST
   understand the SIP or SIPS dereference scheme.

4.3.2.  Emergency Call Routing

   There might be additional emergency call routing applied within the
   PSAP operators network.  This aspect is, however, outside the scope
   of this document.

   LoST [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] might be an appropriate way to determine
   the next ESRP or the final PSAP for routing the emergency call.

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service        August 2007


4.3.3.  Emergency Call Identification

   The ESRP MUST understand the Service URN mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn] (i.e., the 'urn:service:sos' tree) and
   SHOULD understand national emergency dial strings.

4.3.4.  SIP Emergency Call Signaling

   SIP signaling [RFC3261] is expected be supported by the PSAP.  The
   ESRP MUST process the messages sent by the client, as indicated in
   Section 4.1.4.  When receiving an emergency call the ESRP will
   dereference the reference to location information for dispatch.  It
   MUST use the SIP or SIPS derefencing scheme todo so.

4.3.5.  Media

   PSAPs MUST send and receive media streams on RTP [RFC3550].  The SIP
   offer/answer [RFC3264] negotiations MUST be used to agree on the
   media streams to be used.

   PSAPs supporting voice MUST support G.711 A law (and mu Law in North
   America) encoded voice as described in [RFC3551].  It is desirable to
   support wideband codecs in the offer.  Silence suppression (Voice
   Activity Detection methods) MUST NOT be used on emergency calls.

   Depending on national regulations PSAPs MAY need to support Instant
   Messaging.  If they need to provide this support then they MUST us
   either [RFC3428] or [RFC3920].

   Depending on national regulations PSAPs MAY need to support real-time
   text [RFC4103].  If they need to provide this support then they MUST
   fulfill Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-sipping-toip].

   Depending on national regulations PSAPs MAY need to video support for
   Video Relay Service (Sign language interpretation).  If they need to
   provide this support then they MUST support H.264 per [RFC3984].

4.3.6.  Testing

   The description in Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] is
   applicable to this document as well.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security threats discussed in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-security-threats]
   are applicable to this document.  A number of security
   vulnerabilities discussed in [I-D.barnes-geopriv-lo-sec] around faked
   location information are less problematic in this case since location
   information does not need to be provided by the end host itself or it
   can be verified to fall within a specific geographical area.

   There are a couple of new vulnerabilities raised with unauthenticated
   emergency services since the PSAP operator does is not in possession
   of any identity information about the emergency call via the
   signaling path itself.  In countries where this functionality is used
   for GSM networks today this has lead to a significant amount of
   misuse (see [reference-to-be-added]).

   The link layer mechanisms need to provide a special way of handling
   unauthenticated emergency services.  Although this subject is not a
   topic for the IETF itself but there are at least a few high-level
   assumptions that may need to be collected.  This includes security
   features that may be desireable.


7.  Acknowledgments

   We would like to thank the authors of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]
   (James Polk and Brian Rosen) for their good work.  This document
   makes heavy use of their document.

   From an editorial point of view a lot of text in this document can be
   replaced by references to [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].  In order todo
   so it is necessary to make the text in that document easier to
   reference.  This is subject of ongoing work.


8.  Open Issues

   The following three high-level topics have been determined as open
   issues:
   o  NAT Traversal: A certain NAT traversal story needs to be described
      and mandated.  Most likely ICE for both the PSAP and the end host.
   o  A DNS-based discovery procedure that discovers an ESRP in the
      local access network may need to be provided.
   o  Text about link layer requirements are missing.  These are
      necessary to make the "big picture" complete.
