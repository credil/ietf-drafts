Internet-Draft       LSP-Ping extensions for MPLS-TP        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   LSP-Ping [RFC4379]is an OAM mechanism for MPLS LSPs.  This document
   describes extensions to LSP-Ping so that LSP-Ping can be used to
   perform OAM on MPLS-TP LSPs.  It also clarifies the procedures to be
   used for processing the OAM packets.  Further, it describes how LSP-
   Ping can be used to perform Connectivity Verification, Route Tracing
   and Adjacency functions specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements].

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  LSP-Ping for MPLS-TP LSPs using IP encapsulation

   LSP-Ping requires IP addressing on the egress and transit LSRs for
   performing OAM on MPLS signaled LSPs and pseudowires.  In particular,
   in these cases the LSP-Ping packets generated by an ingress LSR are
   encapsulated in an IP/UDP header with the destination address from
   the 127/8 range and then encapsulated in the MPLS label stack
   ([RFC4379] , [I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls]).  Egress LSRs use the presence of
   the 127/8 destination address to identify the OAM packets and rely
   further on the UDP port number to determine whether the packet is a
   LSP-Ping packet.  It is to be noted that this determination does not
   require IP forwarding capabilities.  It requires the presence of an
   IP host stack which enables egress LSRs to process packets with a
   destination address from the 127/8 range.  [RFC1122] allocates the
   127/8 range as "Internal host loopback address" and [RFC1812] states
   that "a router SHOULD NOT forward, except over a loopback interface,
   any packet that has a destination address on network 127".

1.3.  LSP-Ping for MPLS-TP LSPs using non-IP encapsulation

   In certain MPLS-TP deployment scenarios IP addressing might not be
   available or it may be preferred to use non-IP encapsulation for LSP-
   Ping and BFD packets.  In such scenarios, LSP-Ping must be run
   without IP addressing, using the ACH channel type specified in
   [I-D.nitinb-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-bfd-procedures].

   Sections Section 3.2 and Section 4.2 describe the theory of operation
   for performing LSP-Ping over MPLS-TP LSPs with a non-IP
   encapsulation.

2.  LSP-Ping extensions

2.1.  New address type for Downstream Mapping TLV

   [RFC4379] defines the Downstream Mapping TLV.  This document defines
   the following new Address type which is added to the Downstream
   Mapping TLV:

         Type #        Address Type           K Octets
         ------        --------------         --------
             0         Not Applicable                8


             Figure 1: Downstream Mapping TLV new Address Type

   The new address type indicates that no address is present in the
   Downstream Mapping TLV.  Multipath type MAY be set to 0 (no
   multipath) when using this address type.

   When this address type is used, on receipt of a LSP-Ping echo
   request, interface verification MUST be bypassed.  Thus the receiving
   node SHOULD only perform mpls label control-plane/data-plane
   consistency checks.

   The new address type is also applicable to the Detailed Downstream
   Mapping TLV defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-enhanced-dsmap].

2.2.  Source Address TLV

   When sending LSP-Ping packets using ACH, without IP encapsulation,
   there MAY be a need to identify the source address of the packet.
   This source address will be specified via the Source Address TLV,
   being defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ach-tlv].  Only 1 source address
   TLV MUST be present in a LSP-Ping packet.  The source address MUST
   specify the address of the originator of the packet.  If more than 1
   such TLV is present in a LSP-Ping request packet, then an error of
   "Malformed echo request received" SHOULD be returned.  If more than 1
   source address TLV is present, then the packet SHOULD be dropped
   without further processing.

2.3.  Destination Address TLV

   When sending LSP-Ping packets using ACH, without IP encapsulation,
   there MAY be a need to identify the destination address of the
   packet.  This destination address will be specified via the
   Destination Address TLV, being defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ach-tlv].
   One or more of this TLVs MAY be included.  The destination address
   MUST specify the intended receipient(s) of the packet.  If the

Internet-Draft       LSP-Ping extensions for MPLS-TP        October 2009


   destination address specified in any of the Destination Address TLVs
   does not match any address associated with the node which receives
   the LSP-Ping packet, then the LSP-Ping packet SHOULD be dropped
   without further processing.

2.4.  MEP and MIP Identifier

   When sending LSP-Ping packets using ACH, there MAY be a need to
   identify the maintenance end point (MEP) and/or the maintenance
   intermediate point (MIP) being monitored.  The MEP/MIP identifiers
   defined in [I-D.swallow-mpls-tp-identifiers] MAY be carried in the
   ACH TLVs [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ach-tlv] for identification.  Only one
   identifier (MEP or MIP) may be present in a packet.  The MEP/MIP
   identifiers associated with the packet MUST be checked for the
   MPLS-TP LSP path/section that is being monitored.  If the identifier
   does not match the LSP path/section, then the packet MUST be dropped.

2.5.  Specifications for statically provisioned LSPs

   Details of LSP-Ping for statically provisioned LSPs will be specified
   in a future revision of this document.


3.  Performing LSP-Ping over MPLS-TP LSPs

   This section specifies how LSP-Ping ping can be used in the context
   of MPLS-TP LSPs.  The LSP-Ping ping function meets the Connectivity
   Verification requirement specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements].  This function SHOULD be
   performed on-demand.  This function SHOULD be performed between End
   Points (MEPs) and Intermediate Points (MIPs) of PWs and LSPs, and
   between End Points of PWs, LSPs and Sections.  In order for the LSP-
   Ping packet to be processed at the desired MIP, the TTL of the MPLS
   label should be set such that it expires at the MIP to be probed.

3.1.  LSP-Ping with IP encapsulation

   LSP-Ping packets as specified in [RFC4379] are sent over the MPLS LSP
   for which OAM is being performed and contain an IP/UDP packet within
   them.  The IP header is not used for forwarding (since the LSP is
   forward using MPLS label switching).  The IP header is used mainly
   for addressing and can be used in the context of MPLS-TP LSPs.  This
   form of LSP-Ping OAM MUST be supported for MPLS-TP LSPs when IP
   addressing is in use.  The LSP-Ping Reply mode [RFC4379] in the LSP-
   Ping echo request MUST be set to 4 (Reply via application level
   control channel).

   The LSP-Ping echo response message MUST be sent on the reverse path



Bahadur, et al.          Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       LSP-Ping extensions for MPLS-TP        October 2009


   of the LSP.  The reply MUST contain IP/UDP headers followed by the
   LSP-Ping payload.  The destination address in the IP header MUST be
   set to that of the sender of the echo request message.  The source
   address in the IP address MUST be set to a valid address of the
   replying node.

3.2.  Non-IP based LSP-Ping

   The OAM procedures defined in [RFC4379] require the use of IP
   addressing and in some cases IP routing to perform OAM functions.
   When the ACH header is used, IP addressing and routing is not needed.
   This section describes procedures for performing lsp-ping without a
   dependency on IP addressing and routing.

   When using LSP-Ping over the ACH header, the LSP-Ping Reply mode
   [RFC4379] in the LSP-Ping echo request MUST be set to 4 (Reply via
   application level control channel).

   The ingress node MAY attach a Source Address TLV (Section 2.2) to
   identify the node originating the request.

   The LSP-Ping reply message MUST be sent on the reverse path of the
   LSP using ACH.  The LSP-Ping payload MUST directly follow the ACH
   header (and any ACH TLVs) and no IP and/or UDP headers MUST be
   attached.  If the request message contained the Source Address TLV
   and a response is being sent to the originator, then a Destination
   Address TLV (Section 2.3) SHOULD be added to the reply message.  The
   contents of the LSP-Ping request Source Address TLV should be copied
   into the LSP-Ping response Destination Address TLV.  The responding
   node MAY attach a Source Address TLV to identify the node sending the
   response.

   If a node receives an MPLS echo request packet over ACH, without IP/
   UDP headers and if that node does not have a return MPLS LSP path to
   the echo request source, then the node MUST drop the echo request
   packet and not attempt to send a response.

3.3.  P2MP Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping] describes how LSP-Ping can be used for
   OAM on P2MP LSPs with IP encapsulation.  This MUST be supported for
   MPLS-TP P2MP LSPs when IP addressing is used.  When IP addressing is
   not used, then the procedures described in Section 3.2 can be applied
   to P2MP MPLS-TP LSPs as well.

Internet-Draft       LSP-Ping extensions for MPLS-TP        October 2009


4.  Performing LSP Traceroute over MPLS-TP LSPs

   This section specifies how LSP-Ping traceroute can be used in the
   context of MPLS-TP LSPs.  The LSP-Ping traceroute function meets the
   Adjancency and Route Tracing requirement specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements].  This function SHOULD be
   performed on-demand.  This function SHOULD be performed between End
   Points and Intermediate Points of PWs and LSPs, and between End
   Points of PWs, LSPs and Sections.

   When performing lsp-ping traceroute, the ingress node inserts a
   Downstream Mapping TLV to get the downstream node information and to
   enable LSP verification along the transit nodes.  The Downstream
   Mapping TLV can be used as is for performing the traceroute.  If IP
   addressing is not in use, then the Address Type field in the
   Downstream Mapping TLV can be set to "Not applicable" (Section 2.1).
   The Downstream Mapping TLV address type field can be extended to
   include other address types as need be.

4.1.  LSP Traceroute with IP encapsulation

   The mechanics of LSP-Ping traceroute are similar to that described
   for ping in Section 3.1.  Traceroute packets sent by the LSP ingress
   MUST follow procedures described in [RFC4379].  This form of LSP-Ping
   OAM MUST be supported for MPLS-TP LSPs, when IP addressing is used.

4.2.  Non-IP based LSP Traceroute

   This section describes the procedures for performing LSP traceroute
   when using the ACH header and without any dependency on IP
   addressing.  The procedures specified in Section 3.2 with regards to
   Source Address TLV, Destination Address TLV and MEP/MIP identifiers
   apply to LSP traceroute as well.

4.2.1.  Ingress node procedure for sending echo request packets

   Traceroute packets sent by the LSP ingress MUST adhere to the format
   described in Section 3.2.  MPLS-TTL expiry (as described in
   [RFC4379]) will be used to direct the packets to specific nodes along
   the LSP path.

4.2.2.  Ingress node procedure for receiving echo response packets

   The LSP-Ping traceroute responses will be received on the LSP itself
   and the presence of an ACH header with channel type of LSP-Ping is an
   indicator that the packet contains LSP-ping payload.

Internet-Draft       LSP-Ping extensions for MPLS-TP        October 2009


4.2.3.  Transit and egress node procedure

   When a echo request reaches the transit or egress, the presence of
   the ACH channel type of LSP-Ping will indicate that the packet
   contains LSP-Ping data.  The LSP-Ping data, the label stack and the
   MEP/MIP identifier should be able to identify the LSP associated with
   the echo request packet.  In case if there is an error and the node
   is unable to idenfity the LSP on which the echo response should to be
   sent, the node MUST drop the echo request packet and not send any
   response back.  All responses MUST always be sent on a LSP path using
   the ACH header and ACH channel type of LSP-Ping.

4.3.  P2MP Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping] describes how LSP-Ping can be used for
   OAM on P2MP LSPs.  This MUST be supported for MPLS-TP P2MP LSPs when
   IP addressing is used.  When IP addressing is not used, then the
   procedures described in Section 4.2 can be applied to P2MP MPLS-TP
   LSPs as well.

4.4.  ECMP Considerations

   LSP-Ping using ACH SHOULD NOT be used when there is ECMP (equal cost
   multiple paths) for a given LSP.  The addition of the additional ACH
   header may modify the hashing behavior for OAM packets which may
   result in incorrect monitoring of path taken by data traffic.


5.  Applicability

   The non-IP addressing based procedures specified in this document
   apply only to MPLS-TP LSPs.  They also apply to PWs when IP
   encapsulation is not desired.  However, when IP addressing is used,
   as in non MPLS-TP LSPs, procedures specified in [RFC4379] MUST be
   used.


6.  Security Considerations

   The draft does not introduce any new security considerations.  Those
   discussed in [RFC4379] are also applicable to this document.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
