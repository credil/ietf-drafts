		<abstract>
		<t>
		There have been many implementations and deployments of legacy syslog over TCP for many years.  That 
		protocol has evolved without being standardized and has proven to be quite interoperable in practice.
		</t>
		<t>
		The aim of this specification is to document three things: how to transmit standardized syslog over TCP,
		how TCP has been used as a transport for legacy syslog, and how to correlate these usages.
		</t>
		</abstract>
	</front>

	<middle>
		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t>
		Historically, the <xref target="RFC3164">syslog protocol</xref> has been run over UDP.
		This has been replaced with the <xref target="RFC5424">standardized syslog protocol</xref>
		in which the <xref target="RFC5425">TLS transport</xref> is required.  Even so, there are many
		instances of syslog running atop TCP <xref target="RFC0793" />.  This specification documents how the standardized 
		syslog protocol should be run atop TCP.
		</t>
		<t>
		Two primary format options have been observed with legacy 
		syslog being transported over TCP.  These are called octet-stuffing and octet-counting.
		This specification includes descriptions of both format options in an attempt to 
		ensure that standardized syslog transport receivers can receive and properly interpret messages sent from 
		legacy syslog senders. 
		</t>
		<t>
		Diagram 1 shows how all of these syslog transports relate to each other.
		In this diagram three originators are seen, labeled A, B, and C, along with one collector.
		Originator A is using the TCP transport which is described in this document.  Originator
		B is using the UDP transport which is described in <xref target="RFC5426" />.  Originator
		C is using the TLS transport which is described in <xref target="RFC5425" />.  The collector
		is shown with the capability to accept all three transports.

		<section anchor="conventions" title="Conventions Used in This Document">
			<t>
			The terminology defined in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC5424" /> is
			used throughout this specification.  The reader should be familiar with
			that to follow this discussion.
			</t>
			<t>
			This document also references devices that use the syslog message format
			as described in <xref target="RFC3164" />.  Devices that continue to use that 
			message format (regardless of transport) will be described as &quot;legacy
			syslog devices&quot; in this document.  Similarly, devices that use the 
			message format as described in <xref target="RFC5424" /> will be described
			as &quot;standardized syslog devices&quot;.
			</t>
		</section>
		
		<section anchor="using" title="Message Transmission">
			<t>
			Syslog is simplex in nature.  Traditional implementations of syslog over TCP also do not use 
			any backchannel mechanism to convey information to the transport sender, and consequently 
			do not use any application-level acknowledgement for syslog receiver to sender signaling.  
			Message receipt acknowledgement, reliability, and flow control are provided by the 
			capabilities of TCP.
			</t>
		<section anchor="session" title="Session">
			<t>
			A syslog over TCP session is a TCP connection between a syslog transport sender
			and a syslog transport receiver.  The syslog transport sender is the TCP host that sends the 
			original SYN.  The syslog transport receiver is the device that receives the original
			SYN and responds with a SYN+ACK.  After initiation, messages are sent from the transport
			sender to the transport receiver.  No application-level data is transmitted
			from the transport receiver to the transport sender.  The roles of transport
			sender and receiver are fixed once the session is established, and they can
			not be reversed during the session.  However, there can be multiple sessions between
			two TCP hosts, and for each session the role of transport sender and
			transport receiver can be different based upon which device initiates the session.
			</t>
			<t>
			It is valid (but rare) for no syslog messages to be exchanged during a TCP session.
			</t>
			<t>
			If an error occurs that cannot be corrected by TCP, the host detecting the error will 
			gracefully close the TCP session.  There are no application level messages that can be
			sent to notify the other host about the state of the host syslog application.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="sessionInit" title="Session Initiation">
			<t>
			The TCP host that intends to act as a syslog transport receiver listens to TCP port &lt;TBD&gt;.  
			The TCP host that intends to act as the transport sender initiates a 
			TCP session to the syslog transport receiver as specified in <xref target="RFC0793" />.  
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="msgxfer" title="Message Transfer">
			<t>
			During the message transfer phase, the syslog transport sender sends a 
			stream of messages to the transport receiver.  Either of the TCP hosts may initiate 
			session closure at any time as specified in Section 3.5 
			of <xref target="RFC0793" />.  In practice, this is often seen
			after a prolonged period of inactivity.
			</t>
			<t>
			Syslog messages are sent in sequence within a TCP transport stream.  One message is encapsulated inside a frame.
			This method is known as the octet-counting method.  Another method known as the octet-stuffing method
			is described in the Appendix below and it must not be used to transport standardized syslog.
			</t>
			<t>
			All syslog messages must be sent as TCP "data" as per 
			<xref target="RFC0793">Transmission Control Protocol</xref>.
			The syslog message stream has the following <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>
			definition:
			<figure>
			<artwork><![CDATA[
    TCP-DATA = *SYSLOG-FRAME

    SYSLOG-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP SYSLOG-MSG   ; Octet-counting method

    MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

    SP = %d32

    NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

    DIGIT = %d48 / NONZERO-DIGIT

    SYSLOG-MSG is defined in the syslog protocol [RFC5424]

			]]></artwork>
			</figure>
			</t>
			<t>
			MSG-LEN is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the
			SYSLOG-FRAME.  A transport receiver must use the message length to
			delimit a syslog message.  There is no upper limit for a message
			length per se.  However, in order to establish a baseline for
			interoperability, this specification requires that a transport
			receiver must be able to process messages with a length up to and
			including 2048 octets.  Transport receivers should be able to process
			messages with lengths up to and including 8192 octets.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="msg" title="Retaining the Original Message">
			<t>
			In this method, a modification is made to the original message for transmission.  This
			is a temporary transformation performed by the transport sender.  According to
			Section 5 of <xref target="RFC5425" />, this temporary transformation must be
			reversed by the transport protocol receiver so 
			that the relay or collector will see an exact copy of the message
			generated by the originator or relay.
			</t>
			<t>
			In this octet-counting method, a count and a space character are prepended to
			each message.  This is somewhat similar to the framing used in
                        <xref target="RFC5425">Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Mapping for Syslog</xref>.

			The count and space character must be removed by the transport receiver after it 
			has validated that the count is correct.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="sessionClose" title="Session Closure">
			<t>
			The SYSLOG session is closed when one of the TCP hosts decides to do so.  It then initiates a local TCP 
			session closure.  It does not notify its remote TCP host of its intention to close the session, nor does
			it accept any messages that are still in transit.
			</t>
		</section>
		</section>
		<section anchor="appst" title="Applicability Statement">
			<t>
			It is still recommended to use the <xref target="RFC5425">TLS transport</xref> to 
			transport syslog messages.  This specification is provided to ensure interoperability 
			for transporting syslog over TCP.
			</t>
			<t>
			There are several advantages to using TCP: flow control, error recovery, and reliability, to name a few.
			These reasons and the ease of programming have lead people to use this transmission protocol to transmit syslog.
			</t>
			<t>
			One potential disadvantage is the buffering mechanism used by TCP.  Ordinarily, TCP decides when 
			enough data has been received from the application to form a segment for transmission.  This may
			be adjusted through timers but still, some application data may wait in a buffer for a relatively 
			long time.  Syslog data is not normally time-sensitive but if this delay is a concern, the 
			syslog transport sender may utilize the PUSH Flag as described in <xref target="RFC0793" /> to have the 
			sending TCP immediately send all buffered data.
			</t>
			<t>
			Even though it is still recommended to use the <xref target="RFC5425">TLS transport</xref> to
                        convey syslog messages, it is expected that people will still use the TCP transport.

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t>
		Using this specification on an unsecured network is not recommended.
		Several syslog security considerations are discussed in <xref target="RFC5424" />.
		This section focuses on security considerations specific to the
		syslog transport over TCP.  Some of the security issues raised in
		this section can be mitigated through the use of TLS as defined in
		<xref target="RFC5425" />
		</t>

		<section anchor="rfc5426" title="Security Considerations from RFC 5426">
		<t>
		In many security related respects, the transmission of syslog messages over TCP is very similar
		to the transmission of syslog messages over UDP as defined in <xref target="RFC5426" />.
		The reader of this document is encouraged to be familiar with the following security
		threats that are described in that RFC.

		It should be noted that the syslog transport specified in this

		some reason (or closed by the transport receiver), the syslog
		transport sender cannot always know what messages were successfully
		delivered to the syslog application at the other end.

			Syslog over TCP has been around for a number of years.  Just like legacy syslog over UDP,
			several different implementations exist.  The older method of octet-stuffing
			has problems so is not recommended, but should be implemented to ensure interoperability with older
			clients or servers that may only use this method.  The newer

			When implementers do implement both methods, it is recommended that the default method be octet-counting.

                        This framing allows for the transmission of all characters inside SYSLOG-MSG and is 
			similar to the framing used in <xref target="RFC5425" />. 
			MSG-LEN is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the
			SYSLOG-FRAME.  A transport receiver must use the message length to
			delimit a syslog message.  The upper limit for a legacy syslog message
			length is 1024 octets.
			</t>
			<t>
			A transport receiver must assume that octet-counting framing is used
			if a syslog frame starts with a digit.

		</section>
		<section anchor="octet-stuffing-legacy" title="Octet-Stuffing">
			<t>
			A transport receiver must assume that octet-stuffing framing is used if a syslog frame
			starts with the USASCII character "&lt;" (%d60).
			</t>
			<t>
			In this legacy implementation of octet-stuffing, the TRAILER consists of a single
			character and most often is the USASCII LF (%d10) character.
			A transport receiver must accept the USASCII LF character as a TRAILER.
			However, other characters have also been seen occasionally, with
			USASCII NUL (%d00) being a prominent example.  Some devices also
			emit a two-character TRAILER, which is usually CR and LF.  A transport receiver may be
			configurable to accept characters other than LF.
			</t>
			<t>
			The octet-stuffing method is not recommended.
			</t>
			<t>
			The problem with octet-stuffing framing comes from the use of 
			<xref target="RFC3164" /> messages.  In that, the traditional trailer character
			is not escaped within SYSLOG-3164 which causes problems for the receiver.  
			For example, a message in the style of <xref target="RFC3164" />
			containing one or more LF characters may
			be misinterpreted as multiple messages by the transport
			receiver.  There is no method to avoid this problem with the

			It has been observed in legacy implementations that the framing may change on a frame-by-frame
