Abstract

   The IUA protocol described in RFC4233 defines the messages type of
   TEI Query Request messages as 5.  But this number is already used by
   the IUA extension DUA described in RFC4129.  This document updates
   IUA such that the message type of TEI Query Request messages is 8.

Internet-Draft       TEI Query Request Number Change           July 2007


1.  Introduction

   The IUA protocol described in RFC3057 [2] does not define a TEI Query
   Request message.  The IUA extension DUA described in RFC4129 [3]
   introduces DLC Status messages of type 5, 6, and 7.  Then RFC4233 [4]
   was published, which updates RFC3057 [2].  This document also
   introduces the TEI Query Request message and uses the message type of
   5 for it.  This makes it impossible to differentiate the DLC Status
   request from a TEI Query Request.

   This document updates RFC4233 [4]


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].


3.  New Message Type of the TEI Query Message

   This document updates RFC4233 [4] by introducing the following
   change.

   TEI Query messages MUST be encoded with a message type of 8 instead
   of 5 as described in RFC4233 [4].


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should reserve the message type 8 of Management Messages for TEI
   Query Request messages.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not require any security considerations in
   addition to the one given in RFC4233 [4].
