Abstract

   RFC 2872 defines an Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) object for 
   application identifiers.  This document uses that App-ID and gives 
   implementers specific guidelines for differing voice and video 
   stream identifications to nodes along a reservation path, creating 
   specific profiles for voice and video session identification.

1.  Introduction  

   RFC 2872 [RFC2872] describes the usage of policy elements for 
   providing application information in Resource Reservation Protocol 
   (RSVP) signaling [RFC2205]. The intention of providing this 
   information is to enable application-based policy control. However, 
   RFC 2872 does not enumerate any application profiles. The absence 
   of explicit, uniform profiles leads to incompatible handling of 
   these values and also to interoperability problems. An application 
   profile defined by a sender may not be understood by the

   intermediaries or receiver in the same or different domain. 
   Therefore, there is a need to enumerate application profiles that 
   are universally understood and applied for correct policy control. 

   RFC 4594 [RFC4594] defines various traffic types and the specific 
   Differentiated Services (Diffserv) that apply to each of the traffic
   types. The traffic types are classified as application classes and a
   Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) [RFC2474] is associated 
   with each of them. RFC 5865 [RFC5865] adds one more application type
   to the list. 

   This document uses the application classes from RFC 4594 and RFC 
   5865 as an enumeration of application identifiers and uses these 
   values in the APP-ID object defined in RFC 2872.  Thus, the 
   intermediary devices (e.g., routers) processing the RSVP message can
   retrieve the profile, understand the profile correctly and perform 
   the correct admission control.

   Another goal of this document is to the ability to signal an 
   application profile which can then be translated into a DSCP value 
   as per the choice of each domain. While the DCLASS object [RFC2996] 
   allows the transfer of DSCP value in an RSVP message, it does not 
   allow the flexibility of having different domains choosing the DSCP 
   value for the traffic classes that that they maintain.  

   This document will break out each application type and propose how 
   the values in application-id template should be populated for 
   uniformity and interoperability.



2.  Application ID Template

   The template from RFC 2872 is as follows:

            0              1               2               3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    PE Length (8)              |   P-type = AUTH_APP           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Attribute Length           |   A-type =    |  Sub-type =   |
   |                               | POLICY_LOCATOR|   ASCII_DN    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Application policy locator attribute data in X.500 DN format  |
   |                         (see below)                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   In line with how this policy element is constructed in RFC 2872, the
   following is left unchanged for all the profiles defined in this 
   document: 

   - P-type remains "AUTH_APP"


Polk                     Expires April 25, 2011                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft            RSVP APP-ID Profiles                 Oct 2010

   - A-type will remain "POLICY_LOCATOR"

   The first Sub-type will be mandatory for every profile within this 
   document, and will be "ASCII_DN".  No other Sub-types are defined by
   any profile within this document, but can be included by individual 
   implementations - and MUST be ignored if not understood by receiving
   implementations.

   RFC 2872 states the #1 sub-element from RFC 2872 as the "identifier 
   that uniquely identifies the application vendor", which is optional 
   to include.  This document modifies this vendor limitation so that 
   the identifier need only be unique - and not limited to an 
   application vendor (identifier). For example, this specification now
   allows an RFC that defines a well known word or string to be a valid
   identifier. This sub-element is still optional to include.

   The following subsections will define the values within the above 
   template into specific profiles for voice and video identification.


3.  The Voice and Video Application-ID Profiles

   This section contains the elements of the Application ID policy 
   object which is used to signal the application classes defined in 
   RFC 4594. 

3.1 The Broadcast video Profile

   Here is the profile for identifying the Broadcast Video application

      AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
      "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4594.txt", 
      APP=broadcast-video, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string (RFC4594), the APP is 
   the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, but has
   no value.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: we are open to leaving the "VER:" parameter out of 
                   this string, because this specification does not 
                   assign a value to any profile. WG feedback is sought
                   on this open issue, and would apply to all the 
                   profiles here.]


3.2 The Real-time Interactive Profile

   Here is the profile for identifying the Real-time Interactive 
   application

   no value.


3.3 The Multimedia Conferencing Profile

   Here is the profile for identifying the Multimedia Conferencing

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the RFC 
   reference that created this well known string (RFC4594), the APP is 
   the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, but has
   no value.


3.4 The Multimedia Streaming Profile

   Here is the profile for identifying the Multimedia Streaming 
   application

      AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
      "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4594.txt, 
      APP=multimedia-streaming, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string (RFC4594), the APP is 
   the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, but has
   no value.


3.5 The Telephony Profile

   Here is the profile for identifying the VOIP
   application

     AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4594.txt, 
     APP=Telephony, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string (RFC4594), the APP is 
   the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, but has

   no value.

   [Editor's Note: the authors are stuck philosophically as to whether, 
                   with respect to the two voice profiles, should 
                   consider that RSVP is a form of CAC, therefore the 
                   "Telephony" profile should or should not exist. We 
                   are seeking WG consensus on this item.]


3.6 The CAC-Admitted Voice (Voice-Admit) Profile

   Here is the profile for identifying the CAC-Admitted Voice 
   application

      AUTH_APP, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
      "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5865.txt, 
      APP=cac-admitted-voice, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string (RFC5865), the APP is 
   the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, but has
   no value.


4.  Security considerations

   The security considerations section within RFC 2872 sufficiently 
   covers this document, with one possible exception - someone using 
   the wrong template values (e.g., claiming a reservation is 
   Multimedia Streaming when it is in fact Real-time Interactive).  
   Given that each traffic flow is within separate reservations, and 
   RSVP does not have the ability to police the bits within any 
   reservation, solving for this appears to be administratively handled
   at best. This is not meant to be a 'punt', but there really is 
   nothing this template creates that is going to make things any 
   harder for anyone (that we know of now).


5.  IANA considerations

   This document requests IANA create a new registry for the 
   application identification classes similar to the following table 
   within the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters registry:

Registry Name: RSVP APP-ID Profiles
Reference: [this document]
Registration procedures: Standards Track document [RFC5226]

Broadcast video Profile
  P-type = AUTH_APP
  A-type = POLICY_LOCATOR
