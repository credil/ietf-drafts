    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>PCE can determine regions' boundaries. Without cooperating with VNTM or policy configuration, a intermediate LSR has to determine regions' boundaries by using the IGP database and ERO as described in [RFC4206] in order to trigger the lower layer signaling. A centralized routing and distributed signaling application is foreseen in the PCE architecture. Without any or enough TED within the intermediate LSR, it could not determine regions' boundaries during the signaling.</t>     
      <t>This document defines the framework for explicit control of region boundary in PCE-based inter-layer architecture.</t>        
    </section>
    <section title="Explicit Control of Region Boundary">
    	<t>PCE can determine regions' boundaries. After PCE compute an end-to-end paths across multi-layer, multi-layer EROs must be carried in PCRep and Path message in terms of RFC5623. In order to explicit control of regions' boundaries, a new object (ERBO- Explicit Region Boundary Object) could be introduced to be carried in PCRep and Path message. Regions' boundaries should be carried in ERBO. [draft-fuxh-ccamp-region-boundary-explicit-control-rsvp-ext-00] defines the RSVP-TE signaling extension for explicit control of region boundary during the signaling procedure. [draft-fuxh-pce-region-boundary-explicit-control-pcep-ext-00] deinfes the PCEP protocol extension for explicit control of region boundary in PCE-based inter-layer architecture.</t>
