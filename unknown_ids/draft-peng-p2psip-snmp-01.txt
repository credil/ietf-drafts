Abstract

   This document defines a SNMP Usage for REsource LOcation And
   Discovery(RELOAD), The SNMP Usage provides the functionality of
   managing the RELOAD network.  The SNMP Usage provides lookup service
   for the network manager's address stored in the overlay.  The SNMP
   Usage also defines the method that allow the registrations to map a
   network manager'name to a specific node reachable through the
   overlay.  The AppAttach method is used to establish a direct
   connection between nodes through which SNMP messages are exchanged.

Internet-Draft          An SNMP Usage for RELOAD              April 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an SNMP Usage for REsource LOcation And
   Discovery (RELOAD),which can be used to manage the RELOAD network.
   It can provide important network management functions, such as
   adjusting the network configuration, monitoring the performance of
   the network, collecting real-time failure information, etc.  These
   network management functions are essential for stable operation and
   high-quality services of the network.  As traditional network
   management protocols (e.g., SNMP) cannot be directly applied to
   RELOAD network management, it is necessary to introduce new RELOAD
   usage of SNMP.

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base], there are two kinds of nodes in
   RELOAD network: one is centralized servers, such as the Enrollment
   Server; the other is distributed nodes, such as Peer and Client.  The
   management function of centralized servers can be carried out by
   traditional management methods, so we don't discuss the management of
   the centralized server in this document, and only focus on the
   management of the distributed nodes.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   We use the terminology and definitions from Concepts and Terminology
   for Peer to Peer SIP [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and the RELOAD Base
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] extensively in this document.

   SNMP:     Simple Network Management Protocol.

   Manager:     Network Manager.

   Node:     RELOAD Node, including both Peer and Client.

   O-Node:     Objective Node, which is managed by a network manager.

   R-Node:     Responsibility Node, which is responsible for storing the
   data according to P2P algorithm.


3.  Network Management Requirements

   RELOAD network SHOULD provide management functions for RELOAD Nodes.
   At the same time, as the RELOAD network is a provider of resource

   location and discovery services, it SHOULD provide monitoring of the
   resources and its associated operation in the network as an important
   part of the network management.  Therefore, there are two kinds of
   the management targets in the RELOAD network: nodes and resources.
   The management functions of the nodes MAY include setting node name,
   software version or other configuration information, monitoring the
   number of the messages initiated, forwarded or processed by nodes,
   reporting program failure , message forwarding failure or other error
   on nodes.  The management of resources MAY include tracing forwarded
   the RELOAD messages or processing flows of resources.


4.  Basic Operations and SNMP

   The management interactions between nodes can be abstracted into a
   few basic operations: 1). the network manager requests data of nodes
   and resources; 2). the network manager sets data of nodes and
   resources; 3). nodes initiate data reports to the network manager.  A
   variety of management functions can be carried out by these basic
   operations or their combinations.  This document adopts SNMP as a
   RELOAD Usage to achieve the management of the RELOAD network.  The
   basic operations described above can be implemented by messages
   defined in SNMP, such as GetRequest, GetNextRequest, GetBulkRequest,
   Response, SetRequest, Trap, InformRequest.


5.  Overview of SNMP Usage

   The network manager needs to join the RELOAD network as a peer or a
   client before performing management operations.  In other words, the
   manager function is deployed on the managing node, and agent function
   is deployed on managed node.  The manager executes management
   operations of the RELOAD network through the agent deployed on the
   managed nodes.  The protocol is RELOAD between nodes, and the
   protocol is SNMP between manager and agent.  The diagram of system
   composition and protocol is as follow:

6.  Network Manager Registering

   The Node ID of the network manager which acts as a provider of
   management service should be able to be found by other RELOAD nodes,
   thus managed nodes can send messages to the manager.  The Node ID of
   network manager may not be fixed or predefined in advance.  So a
   recognizable name is necessary and the managed nodes should find the
   Node ID of the manager through this fixed name.  Therefore, it is
   necessary for the manager to register itself in the network after
   joining the network.  In other words, the manager needs to store the
   mapping between its name and its Node ID in the RELOAD network.  When
   a managed node wants to contact the manager, it needs to first look
   up the manager's Node ID corresponding to the predefined management
   service name.  This registration is achieved by storing the name of
   the network manager and the structure of SnmpRegistration into the
   RELOAD network.  The corresponding SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID will be
   formally defined in the following chapter.  It is proposed to store

   the mapping of the manager's name to a destination list in this
   document.  Therefore, a single Node ID as a special case for a
   destination list.  The contents of a SnmpRegistration structure are
   as follows:

   struct {

      opaque        contact_prefs<0..2^16-1>;

      Destination        destination_list<0..2^16-1>;

   } SnmpRegistrationData;

   struct {

      uint16        length;

      SnmpRegistrationData        data;

   } SnmpRegistration;

   The contents of the SnmpRegistration PDU are:

   length

      the length of the rest of the PDU

   data

      the contents of the registration data is an opaque string
   containing the network manager's contact preferences and a
   destination list for the peer.


7.  O-Node Looks up Network Manger and Forms a Direct Connection with
    the Manager

   When a target node needs to send messages to a network manager, it
   must check whether a connection has been established between itself
   and the network manager first.  If the connection has been
   established, the target node will directly send messages to the
   manager.  Otherwise, the target node must perform a query of the
   manager's Node ID, then exchanges ICE addresses with the network
   manager and checks connectivity and establishes connection, as shown
   below:

   each other.

   7.  O-Node sends SNMP messages to the network manager through the
   selected connection.


8.  O-Node information Collection

   Before a network manager performs management tasks for nodes, it must
   first collect the Node ID and its status information of managed
   nodes.  The way of a manager collecting the information of RELOAD
   nodes (including Peer and Client) is as follows: when a managed node
   joins the RELOAD network, it needs to get the name of a network
   manager from its configuration or an Enrollment Server; then this
   node connects to the network manager and registers its own
   information, such as node name, Node ID, status, etc., to the
   manager.  The procedure of finding the manager and connecting to it
   has been introduced in the previous section.  There are many other
   ways to collect information of managed nodes, which could be studied
   in future documents.


9.  Manager Forms a Direct Connection with O-Node

   When a network manager needs to send a management task message to a
   target node, it must check whether a connection has been established
   between itself and the target node.  If the connection has been
   established, the network manager will directly send the message to
   the target node.  Otherwise the network manager must exchange ICE
   addresses with the target node, then checks connectivity and
   establishes connection, as shown below:

   1.  Network manager sends an AppAttachReq to the O-Node through the
   overlay.  The AppAttachReq contains the manager's candidate
   addresses.

   2.  O-Node returns an AppAttachAns to the network manager through the
   overlay.  The AppAttachAns contains the O-Node's candidate addresses.

   3.  Network manager and O-Node perform ICE check to select a pair of
   appropriate addresses from candidate addresses to communicate with
   each other.

   4.  Network manager send SNMP messages to O-Node through the selected
   connection.


10.  Network Manger Looks up the O-Node for a Resource

   When a network manager needs to send a management task for resource,
   it is necessary that the network manager first gets the Node ID of
   the O-Node responsible for the resource so as to judge whether there
   is a connection with the O-Node.  One way for the manager to get the
   Node ID of the O-Node responsible for the resource is to acquire the
   Node ID of the O-NODE responsible for the target resource through
   via_list of Forwarding Header in FindAns.  The process is as follows:

   Firstly, the network manager sends an FindReq to the RELOAD network,
   the target Reource ID is put into the destination_list of the
   FindReq.  Then the RELOAD network routes FindReq to the node
   responsible for the target Resource ID according to its routing
   algorithm.

   Secondly, the O-Node returns FindAns to the network manager through
   the RELOAD network.  The first Node ID in the via_list of the
   Forwarding Header of the FindAns is the Node ID of the O-Node
   responsible for the target resource.

   After the network manager gets the Node ID of O-Node, it will be able
   to judge whether there is a connection between itself and the O-Node.
   If the connection exists, the network manager may directly send SNMP
   message to the O-Node, otherwise it is necessary to establish a new
   connection to the O-Node.


11.  SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind Definition

   This section defines the SNMP-REGISTRATION kind.

   Name     SNMP-REGISTRATION

   Kind ID     The Resource Name for the SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is
   the Name of the network manager.  The data stored is a
   SnmpRegistrationData, which can contain a destination list and
   contact preferences to the peer which is acting for the network
   manager.

   Data Model     The data model for the SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is
   single value.

   Access Control     USER-NODE-MATCH.

   Data stored under the SNMP-REGISTRATION kind is of type
   SnmpRegistration.  A destination list can be used to reach the
   network manager.


12.  Security Considerations

   The security requirements of the various application scenarios vary
   tremendously.  They should be discussed in more detail in this
   document.
