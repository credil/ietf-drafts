Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   [DKIM] defines a mechanism for transparent domain-level signing of
   messages for the purpose of declaring that a particular
   Administrative Mail Domain (ADMD) takes some responsibility for a
   message.

   DKIM, however, deliberately makes no binding between the DNS domain
   of the signer and any other identity found in the message.  Despite
   this, there is an automatic human perception that an author domain
   signature (one for which the RFC5322.From domain matches the DNS
   domain of the signer) is more valuable or trustworthy than any other.

   Absent is a protocol by which an ADMD can announce that DKIM
   signatures on its mail added by other ADMDs should also be considered
   trustworthy by verifiers.  This memo presents an experimental
   mechanism for doing so.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  E-Mail Architecture Terminology

   Readers should be familiar with the material and terminology
   discussed in [MAIL] and [EMAIL-ARCH].

3.  Discussion

   Participation in this protocol is divided into three parties:

   o  Authors, whose domains appear in the RFC5322.From field of a
      [MAIL] message;

   o  Signers, who send mail on behalf of Authors and apply [DKIM]
      signatures using their own domains; and

   o  Verifiers, who implement the signature validation procedures
      described in [DKIM].

   An Author participates in this protocol if it wishes to announce that
   a message from it (in the RFC5322.From sense) should be considered
   authentic as long as it bears a signature from any in a set of
   specified domains.  One might, for example, wish to delegate signing

   authority for its DNS domain to an approved messaging service
   provider without doing the work of key transfer described in Appendix
   B.1.1 of [DKIM].  This is communicated to Verifiers via a new tag in
   the DKIM signature.

   A Verifier participates in this protocol if it wishes to ensure that
   a message bears one or more signatures from sources approved to sign
   mail on behalf of the Author, and identify for special treatment mail
   that meets (or does not meet) that criterion.

4.  Queries and Replies

   This section describes in detail the queries issued, the replies
   received, and how they should be interpreted and applied.

4.1.  Extension to DKIM

   [DKIM] signatures contain a "tag=value" sequence.  This protocol will
   add an additional tag called "atps".  When the Signer generates a
   DKIM signature on behalf of an Author, it MUST include this tag in
   the signature and include as its value the Author's domain name.

   The formal syntax definition, per [ABNF]:

           dkim-atps-tag = %x61.74.70.73 *WSP "=" *WSP domain-name

   "domain-name" is imported from [DKIM].

   The registration for this tag can be found in Section 7.

4.2.  ATPS Query Details

   When a [DKIM] signature including an "atps" tag is successfully
   verified, and is considered acceptable to the Verifier according to
   any local policy requirements (which are not discussed here or in
   [DKIM]), the Verifier compares the domain name in the value of that
   tag with the one found in the RFC5322.From field of the message.  The
   match MUST be done in a case-insensitive manner.

   If they do not match, the "atps" tag MUST be ignored.

   If they do match, the Verifier issues a TXT query to the DNS at a
   specific name looking for confirmation by the Author that the Signer
   is authorized by the Author to sign mail on its behalf.  Where
   multiple DKIM signatures are present including valid "atps" tags,
   these queries MAY be done in any order or MAY be done in parallel.

   Where the RFC5322.From field contains multiple addresses, this



Kucherawy                Expires April 15, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment              October 2011


   process SHOULD be applied if the "atps" tag's value matches any of
   the domains found in that field.  These MAY be done in any order.

   The name for the query is constructed as follows:

   1.  Extract the value of the "d=" tag from the signature.

   2.  Convert any upper-case characters in that string to their lower-
       case equivalents.

   3.  Feed the resulting string to the [SHA1] hash algorithm.

   4.  Convert the output of the SHA1 hash to a string of 32
       alphanumeric characters by applying base32 encoding as defined in
       Section 6 of [BASE32].  The base32 encoding is used because its
       output is restricted to characters that are legal for use in
       labels in the DNS, and evaluates the same way in the DNS whether
       encoded using uppercase or lowercase characters.

   5.  Append the string "._atps."

   6.  Append the domain name found in the "atps" tag of the validated
       signature.

   The query's formal syntax definition, per [ABNF]:

           atps-query = 32*BASE32 %x2e.5f.61.74.70.73.2e domain-name

           BASE32 = ( ALPHA / %x32-37 )

   See Appendix A for an example of a query construction.

   Since the size of a [DNS] query is limited to 255 bytes, the size of
   "domain-name" in the ABNF above is constrained to 216 bytes.

4.3.  ATPS Reply Details

   In the descriptions below, the label NOERROR symbolizes DNS response
   code ("rcode") 0, and NXDOMAIN represents rcode 3.  See Section 4.1.1
   of [DNS] for further details.

   At this time, only three possibilities need to be identified in this
   specification:

   o  An answer is returned (i.e.  [DNS] reply code NOERROR with at
      least one answer) containing a valid ATPS reply.  In this case,
      the protocol has been satisfied and the Verifier can conclude that
      the signing domain is authorized by the Author to sign its mail.



Kucherawy                Expires April 15, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment              October 2011


      Further queries SHOULD NOT be initiated.

   o  No answer is returned (i.e.  [DNS] reply code NXDOMAIN, or NOERROR
      with no answers), or one or more answers have been returned as
      described above but none contain a valid ATPS reply.  In this
      case, the Signer has not been authorized to act as a third-party
      signer for this Author, and thus the Verifier MUST continue to the
      next query.

   o  An error is returned (i.e. any other [DNS] reply code).  It is no
      longer possible to determine whether or not this message satisfies
      the Author's list of authorized third-party signers.  The Verifier
      SHOULD stop processing and defer the message for later processing,
      such as requesting temporary failure code from the MTA.

   If all queries are completed and return either NXDOMAIN or NOERROR
   with no answers, then the Signer was not authorized by the Author.

   A valid ATPS reply consists of a sequence of tag-value pairs as
   described in Section 3.2 of [DKIM].  The following tag and value is
   the only one currently supported in ATPS records:

   v: Version (plain-text; REQUIRED) This tag defines the version of
      this specification that applies to the ATPS record.  It MUST have
      the value "ATPS1".  ABNF:

           atps-v-tag = %x76 [FWS] "=" [FWS] %x41.54.50.53.31
                      ; FWS is imported from [DKIM]

5.  Interpretation

   If a Verifier succeeds in confirming that the Author authorized the
   Signer using this protocol, then the Verifier SHOULD evaluate the
   message as though the Signer is the Author.

   This assertion is based on the fact that the Author explicitly
   endorsed the Signer.  Therefore, a module assessing reputation that
   is based on DKIM signature verification SHOULD apply the reputation
   of the Author domain instead of, or in addition to, that of the
   Signer domain.

6.  Relationship to ADSP

   [ADSP] defined a protocol by which an Author can advertise a request
   to message receivers that messages bearing no valid author signature
   be treated with suspicion or even discarded.

   A Verifier implementing both ADSP and ATPS SHOULD treat a message for

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment              October 2011


   which the ATPS test described above passes as if it were signed by
   the author domain.  That is, a pass of ATPS means a pass for ADSP.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No actions are required by IANA at this time.  The following need
   only be applied if and when this specification reaches the Standards
   Track.

7.1.  ATPS Tag Registry

   An Authorized Third Party Signature (ATPS) Tag Registry will be
   created by IANA to enumerate the tags that are valid for use in ATPS
   records.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Specification Required" guidelines described in
   [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].  Such registry changes MUST contain the
   following information:

   1.  Name of the tag being registered or updated

   2.  The document where the specification is created or updated

   3.  The status of the tag, one of "current" (tag is in current use),
       "deprecated" (tag is in current use but its use is discouraged),
       or "historic" (tag is no longer in use)

   The registry's sole initial entry is:

       +-----+--------------+---------+
       | Tag | Specified In | Status  |
       +-----+--------------+---------+
       |  v  | [this memo]  | current |
       +-----+--------------+---------+

7.2.  Email Authentication Method Name Registry Update

   The following should be added to the Email Authentication Method Name
   Registry established by [AUTHRES] as per [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS]:

8.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses potential security issues related to this
   experimental protocol.

8.1.  Transient Security Failures

   Approving a third party signer exposes the Author to the risk that
   the third party signer becomes compromised and then begins to sign
   malicious or nuisance messages on behalf of the Author.  This can
   obviously reflect negatively on the Author, and the impact of this
   can become more severe as automated domain reputation systems are
   developed and deployed.  Thorough vetting and monitoring practices by



Kucherawy                Expires April 15, 2012                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment              October 2011


   Authors of third party signers will likely need to become the norm.

8.2.  Load on the DNS

   A Verifier participating in DKIM, ADSP and ATPS will now issue a
   number of TXT queries to the DNS equal to as many as one (for the
   ADSP query) plus the number of signatures on the message (one for
   each key that is to be verified) plus the number of signatures that
   validated which also bear an "atps" tag.  This is in addition to any
   PTR and A queries the MTA may issue at the time the actual message
   relaying or delivery is initiated.  Obviously this can be burdensome
   on the DNS at both ends, and waiting for that number of queries to
   return when they are issued in parallel could trigger timeouts in the
   MTA.

   An alternative to this that has not yet been explored is the storage
   of the ATPS data at a specific URL tied to the Author's domain name.
   This would alleviate pressure on the DNS at the expense of requiring
   the Author to operate a web server (which has its own security
   implications) and the addition of the establishment of a TCP
   connection.  Moreover, the Verifier would be well advised to
   implement caching of this data to prevent ATPS from being used as a
   denial-of-service vector.

Appendix A.  Example Query and Reply

   This section presents an example of the use of this protocol to query
   for a third-party authorization and discusses the interpretation of
   the result.

   Presume a message for which the RFC5322.From domain is "example.com",
   and it bears two valid signatures, from "one.example.net" and from
   "two.example.net", each with an "atps" whose value is "example.com".
   The following actions are taken:

   1.  A SHA1 hash of "one.example.net" is computed and then converted
       to printable form using base32 encoding, resulting in the string
       "QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6".

   2.  A TXT query is issued to
       "QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6._atps.example.com".

   3.  If a valid reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES]
       result "pass".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is
       returned, the algorithm stops with a result of "temperror" or
       "permerror" as appropriate.

   4.  A SHA1 hash of "two.example.net" is computed and then converted

       "ZTZGRRV3F45A4U6HLDKBF3ZCOW4V2AJX".

   5.  A TXT query is issued to
       "ZTZGRRV3F45A4U6HLDKBF3ZCOW4V2AJX._atps.example.com".

   6.  If a valid reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES]
       result "pass".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is
       returned, the algorithm stops with a result of "temperror" or
       "permerror" as appropriate.

   7.  As there are no valid signatures left to test, the algorithm
       stops with an "unknown" result.
