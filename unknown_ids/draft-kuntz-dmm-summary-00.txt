Abstract

   As stated in the MEXT charter, the working group will "work on
   operational considerations on setting up Mobile IPv6 networks so that
   traffic is distributed in an optimal way".  This topic, referred to
   as Distributed Mobility Management (DMM), has motivated the
   submission of multiple problem statement and solution drafts.  This
   document aims at summarizing the current status of the DMM effort, in
   order to initiate more discussions within the working group.

Internet-Draft                 DMM Summary                      May 2011


1.  Introduction

   In its charter, the MEXT working group mentions the need to work on
   "operational considerations on setting up Mobile IPv6 networks so
   that traffic is distributed in an optimal way".  The expected
   deliverable is an Internet Draft on "Operational considerations for
   distributed use of Mobile IPv6" for publication as an informational
   document.

   This topic of Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) has motivated the
   submission of multiple problem statement and solution drafts, that
   often share common concepts and ideas.  This document first
   summarizes the motivation and problem statement documents submitted
   in the MEXT working group.  Then, we expose an overview of six
   representative proposed approaches.  In the conclusion, we analyze
   the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

   The goal of this document is to initiate discussion within the
   working group towards an agreement on the needed requirements and a
   unified DMM solution.

2.  Summary of the Problem Statement

2.1.  Issues of centralized mobility solutions

   The following Internet Drafts have been considered in this section:

   o  [I-D.chan-distributed-mobility-ps],

   o  [I-D.liu-mext-distributed-mobile-ip] (that shares a vast portion
      of text with the previously mentioned draft),

   o  [I-D.patil-mext-dmm-approaches].

   Centralized mobility solutions (i.e. which rely on the use of a
   single mobility anchor) suffer from the following drawbacks:

   o  Non-optimal routes, especially as Content Delivery Network (CDN)
      servers are being placed closer to the edge of the network.  This
      results in long delays between mobile clients and content servers,
      as well as unnecessary load in the core network.

   o  Low scalability that requires the deployment of several mobility
      anchors along with the increasing number of mobile nodes.
      Furthermore, more and more traffic is to be expected from and to
      these mobile devices, which could result in congestions at the
      mobility anchor.

   o  Mobility support is performed per node, and not per flow, which
      makes offloading (i.e. the possibility to bypass the mobility
      anchor) impossible for some of the traffic.  We cannot expect
      route optimization capabilities to exists at every correspondent
      node.  In such cases, all of the traffic from and towards a mobile
      node has to go through the centralized mobility anchor, which
      worsens the previously mentioned issues.

   o  The mobility anchor is a single point of failure: if a large
      number of mobile nodes share the same mobility anchor, they can
      all be affected by a single outage.  In the specific case of
      Mobile IPv6, this issue is however supposed to be solved by the
      standardization of the Home Agent Reliability Protocol (HARP)
      [I-D.ietf-mip6-hareliability].

   o  Signaling messages of the mobility protocol, as well as
      reliability protocols such as HARP, can represent a significant
      overhead, both for the MN and the mobility anchor.  This is also
      true when considering route optimization modes that involves the
      MN, the mobility anchor and the CN.

2.2.  Requirements of DMM

   The following Internet Drafts have been considered in this section:

   o  [I-D.yokota-dmm-scenario],

   o  [I-D.liu-distributed-mobility],

   o  [I-D.liu-distributed-mobility-traffic-analysis].

   DMM should be achieved by considering the following requirements:

   o  The distribution of the mobility anchors (e.g. the Home Agents) in
      order to achieve a more flat design.  This would improve
      scalability and robustness of the mobility infrastructure.

   o  Placing the mobility management closer to the edge of the network
      (e.g. at the Access Router level) in order to attain routing
      optimality and lower delays.  Beside, offloading near the edge of
      the network would become possible, to the benefit of the core
      network load.

   o  The dynamic use of mobility support by allowing the split of data
      flows along different paths that may travel through either the
      mobility anchor or non-anchor nodes, even though no specific route
      optimization support is available at the correspondent node.  This
      would further improve the previously mentioned benefits.

   o  Separating control and data planes by splitting location and
      routing anchors.  Keeping the control plane centralized while
      distributing the data plane, as previously suggested, could
      minimize the signaling overhead between the mobility anchors.

   o  Reusing existing protocols while minimizing changes, in order to
      allow faster adoption of the technology.

3.  Solution Space

   A number of solutions for distributing mobility management and
   flattening the centralized architecture have been proposed for Mobile
   IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6.  Some of these solutions attempt this
   distribution of mobility management by moving the mobility
   functionality closer to the edge of the network while others
   distribute the same functionality among several mobility agents near
   the core.  In this draft, we summarize six representative approaches
   that all aim at achieving this purpose.

3.1.  Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6)

   When talking about moving mobility functionality closer to the edge
   of the network, mention must be made of Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   (HMIPv6) [RFC5380].  HMIPv6 suggests the implementation of an
   additional mobility agent called the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) in
   addition to or instead of the HA (in case of nomadic operations of
   the MN where a permanent HA is not required).  The MAP can be
   implemented at different levels of the routing hierarchy, even in
   access routers where it can be most beneficial to the MN in reducing
   mobility handoff overhead.  If the MN is mobile but its movements are
   very small, then there is a lot of overhead in binding its new
   location with the HA which could potentially be very far.  In this
   scenario having a MAP closer to the edge of the network and thus
   closer to the MN can help reduce the time for signaling and handoff.

   In HMIPv6, each MN is associated with 3 addresses: the HoA obtained
   from the HA, the Local Care of Address (LCoA) obtained on link and
   the Regional Care of Address (RCoA) obtained from stateless
   configuration using the prefix set advertised by the MAP.  When the
   MN enters the MAP domain, it identifies the MAP it wants to use from
   router updates and configures its LCoA and RCoA.  It then sends a
   local binding update (local BU) to the MAP to bind its LCoA with its
   RCoA.  After the success of this local BU, the MN binds the RCoA with
   its HoA at the HA (and its CNs if the MN wants to perform route
   optimization) (Figure 1).  Once this binding is in place, any
   movement of the MN within the domain of the MAP is hidden from the HA
   and the CNs as only the LCoA of the MN would change and the RCoA
   would remain the same.  Thus only a local BU to the MAP with the new
   LCoA would be required and this is faster than sending a new binding
   update to the HA which could be much further away than the MAP.

    |-------------->|======>|  CN->MN with route optimization
    |<--------------|<======|  MN->CN


   Figure 1: Packet routing when MN is anchored at MAP and acquires LCoA
   on link and RCoA from MAP.

   HMIPv6 allows the MN to bind with multiple MAPs simultaneously.  This
   could allow the MN to use MAPs at different levels of the routing
   hierarchy.  However, although HMIPv6 distributes mobility
   functionality amongst several MAPs, there still remains a centralized
   HA which is a single point of failure and failure of this HA could
   cause the location information of the MNs being serviced by the HA to
   be lost.  The MAP also adds an additional layer of indirection to the
   architecture which may not always be desirable.

3.2.  Flat Access and Mobility Architecture (FAMA)

   In [I-D.bernardos-mext-dmm-cmip], a decentralized architecture called
   the Flat Access and Mobility Architecture (FAMA) is proposed.  FAMA
   suggests moving the functionality of the Home Agent (HA) closer to
   the edge of the network and placing it in the default gateways that
   provide IP connectivity to the mobile nodes (MNs).  Thus the first
   elements to provide access to the internet for these MNs also perform
   mobility management.  These elements are called Distributed Access
   Routers (DARs) in FAMA.

   When an MN attaches to a DAR, it gets a topologically correct IP
   address anchored at that DAR.  The MN uses this IP address for all
   its flows while connected to the DAR.  When the MN moves, it connects
   to a new DAR and gets an IP address anchored to the new DAR and uses
   this IP address for its connections.  If, for some reason, the MN
   decides to retain use of and connectivity to its old IP address
   anchored with the old DAR, then the MN sends a binding update to the
   old DAR and the old DAR would then bind the old IP address with the
   new IP address of the MN (Figure 2).  Thus, in MIPv6 terminology, the
   old DAR becomes the HA of the MN and the old IP address becomes the
   home address (HoA).  Thus any DAR has the potential to act as HA if
   the MN decides to retain use of an IP address anchored at the DAR.

   Figure 2: Packet routing when MN is anchored at DAR2 and uses the HoA
   anchored at DAR2 as well as an HoA anchored at some previously
   visited DAR1.

   FAMA allows an MN to simultaneously use several IP addresses anchored
   at different DARs.  However, FAMA does not specify when and under
   what conditions an MN would want to retain use of its old IP address.
   FAMA also does not specify whether the MN is associated with a
   permanent address that can be used to reach it by default.  The use
   of multiple anchored address mandates a mechanism (such as DNS) on
   the correspondent node side to retrieve a proper and valid
   destination address for the MN.  Care should also be taken to avoid
   routing loops between DARs and routing dead ends whenever the MN
   mutually binds a new and old address to two different DARs.  This
   issue is however not peculiar to FAMA.  [I-D.ng-intarea-tunnel-loop]
   discusses this issue and exposes solutions.

3.3.  Dynamic Mobile IP (DMI)

   Dynamic Mobile IP (DMI) proposed in [I-D.kassi-mobileip-dmi] suggests
   a use case for establishing when an MN would want to retain use of
   its old IP address.  It proposes that an MN only requires use of an
   old IP address when there is an ongoing connection/session that has
   been established using that IP address.  Thus, Mobile IP
   functionality to retain IP address obtained from an old subnet after
   moving to a new subnet is put to use only when there is ongoing
   communication while the MN is in motion between subnets.  At all
   other times, regular IP networking using topologically correct IP
   addresses is used.  Thus DMI suggests a different mode for mobility
   usage in IP networks.  This helps reduce the signaling overhead and
   the number of binding cache entries that have to be maintained by
   Correspondent Node (CN) in regular MIPv6.

   Each MN is associated with a permanent home subnet having a permanent
   HA which gives the MN a permanent HoA.  As long as the MN is anchored
   to the permanent home subnet, usual IP communication takes place
   without any need for Mobile IP.  When the MN moves from the home
   subnet and anchors itself to a new subnet (referred to as the

   temporary home subnet), it identifies the mobility agent in that
   subnet (referred to as the temporary HA) and obtains a temporary HoA
   from it.  The MN sends a binding update to the permanent HA to
   register its current location (Figure 3).  The MN then proceeds to
   use its temporary HoA and regular IP connections for all flows
   initiated after the move has taken place.  Mobility routing functions
   would only be required when there exist flows that have been
   initiated in the permanent home subnet using the permanent HoA.  In
   this case, triangular routing would have to be performed, in order to
   maintain location transparency for the CN which sees only the
   permanent HoA.

    |      |+------------|      |      | Binding update to P-HA
    |      |      |+-----|      |      | Binding update to previous T-HA
    |------------>|=====>|      |      | CN1->MN to old temporary HoA

    |      |      |      |------------>| MN->CN2 from new temporary HoA
    |      |      |      |<------------| CN2->MN to new temporary HoA
    |      |      |      |      |      |


   Figure 3: Packet routing when MN is associated and registered with
   permanent HA (P-HA) and has moved from temporary HA1 (T-HA1) to
   T-HA2.  MN uses the HoA acquired form T-HA1 for ongoing flows with
   CN1 and the HoA acquired from T-HA2 for new flows with CN2.

   Every time the MN moves from one subnet to another, the MN sends a
   binding update to the permanent HA and then continues to use regular
   IP connections using the new temporary HoA obtained at the new subnet
   for all flows initiated after the move.  If there are any ongoing
   flows using an old IP address (from an old temporary or permanent
   subnet), the MN has to additionally perform a binding update with the
   home agent that provided the IP address with which the flow had been
   initiated.  Thus any temporary HA might have to perform binding
   updates and mobility routing if an MN initiates a flow using an IP
   address obtained from that temporary home agent and moves to a
   different subnet.  By ensuring that mobile IP is used only when
   strictly required, DMI reduces the number of control messages
   required in MIPv6.

   In principles, DMI and FAMA are very similar.  FAMA explicitly places
   the mobility anchor at the access router.  DMI better defines when
   the MN retains use of its old IP addresses.  Since the MN is always
   associated with a permanent HoA, it can always be reached by a CN
   that does not know the MN's current location.  Failure of the

Internet-Draft                 DMM Summary                      May 2011


   permanent HA does not cause the MN to lose connectivity to the
   network.  It can still continue flows that have been initiated using
   the temporary HoAs.

3.4.  Dynamic Mobility Anchoring (DMA)

   In Dynamic Mobility Anchoring (DMA) proposed in
   [I-D.seite-netext-dma], the best ideas of FAMA and DMI are combined
   to propose a Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP) approach in a flattened
   architecture where mobility functions are distributed among access
   routers.  The access routers are mobility-enabled and provide traffic
   anchoring and location management functionalities to the MNs.  These
   mobility-enabled access routers (MARs) allocate Home Network Prefixes
   (HNP) for MNs.  When an MN is anchored at a MAR, it uses the HNP
   provided by that MAR and regular IPv6 routing applies for flows
   initiated at the MAR.  When an MN moves to another MAR, it acquires a
   HNP from the new MAR and uses this HNP for new flows.  A routing
   tunnel must now be set up between the old MAR and new MAR if there
   are any ongoing flows during the IP handover.

   The new MAR thus acts as a Home MAR (H-MAR) for flows using HNP
   allocated by itself and as a Visited MAR (V-MAR) for flows using HNP
   allocated by a previously visited MAR (Figure 4).  As a result, any
   MAR can act as both an H-MAR and a V-MAR for flows belonging to the
   same MN.  Even if the MN is moving across several MARs, the tunnel
   endpoints are always on the initial H-MAR (whose HNP is being used)
   and the current V-MAR.


   CN2    CN1    MAR1    MAR2    MN
    |      |       |       |      |

   Figure 4: Packet routing when MN moves from MAR1 to MAR2 but has an
   ongoing flow with CN1 during the movement.  After the movement MN
   initiates flow with CN2.

   DMA's dynamic provision of flow based traffic indirection can also be
   applied to multiple interfaces and IP flow mobility.  However, DMA
   suffers from some of the same issues as FAMA.  It fails to specify
   whether the MN will be associated with a permanent address it can be
   reached with and in the absence of such, how a CN will lookup MN's

   address to initiate communication.  In addition, DMA also requires
   that each MAR advertises different per-MN prefixes set.

3.5.  Global Ha to HA (GHAHA)

   Global HA to HA (GHAHA) [I-D.wakikawa-mext-global-haha-spec] builds
   on the Home Agent Reliability Protocol (HARP) proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hareliability].  HARP provides reliability and
   availability of HAs by having several redundant HAs form a group.
   One HA from the group becomes the active HA and receives binding
   requests and updates from the MNs.  The other HAs in the group are
   standby HAs and are state-synchronized with the active HA.  When the
   active HA fails, one of the HAs in the group takes over as active HA
   and sends a switch message to all the MNs which will cause them to
   bind with the new HA.  The aliveness of the HAs is determined through
   periodic HA-Hello messages exchanged among the HAs in the group.  The
   HAs in the group may be either on the same link or on different links
   (to provide geographic redundancy).  The HA switch may also occur
   when the active HA wants to go offline for maintenance operations.

   GHAHA uses the redundant HA architecture suggested by HARP to provide
   distributed mobility management.  A number of geographically
   distributed HAs form a global HA set and the HAs in the global set
   form HA links among themselves.  All of them advertise the same HA
   subnet prefix to leverage anycast routing.  The MN discovers the
   topologically closest HA using dynamic home agent address discovery
   protocol or DNS and binds to it.  This HA becomes the primary HA for
   that MN.  When the binding registration with the primary HA is
   complete, the primary HA sends a state synchronization message to all
   other HAs in the global set which then create a routing entry for the
   MN with the primary HA as the next hop.

   When a CN anywhere in the internet tries to send a packet to the MN,
   the packet is routed to the HA in the global set that is nearest to
   the CN via anycast routing (Figure 5).  This HA then looks up its
   global binding entries and tunnels the packet to the primary HA of
   the MN.  The primary HA then tunnels the packet to the MN.  When an
   MN tries to send a packet to a CN, the packet is tunneled to the
   primary HA which then routes it to the CN.

   Figure 5: Packet routing when the MN is anchored to HA1 which is now
   the primary HA for the MN.  HA1 and HA2 have HA links established.
   HA2 is the closest HA to CN.

   The HAs in a global set periodically transmit HA-Hello messages that
   can be used for checking the aliveness of the HAs.  When a HA fails,
   the nearest HA takes over as the new primary HA for the MNs anchored
   to the failed HA.

   When the MN moves and reattaches to a different subnet, it sends a
   binding update to its last known primary HA.  This binding update
   gets routed to the currently closest HA via anycast routing.  This HA
   would then forward the binding update to the intended HA.  The
   intended HA would recognize that the packet has been forwarded by a
   different HA and thus informs the MN that it must now switch to the
   topologically closest HA.  The MN sends a binding request to the new
   primary HA.  All the other HAs modify their global binding when the
   binding registration and synchronization process is complete.

   GHAHA eliminates the problem of single point of failure.  Failure of
   the primary HA does not cause the MN to lose connectivity.  The
   synchronization between all the HAs in the global set ensure that the
   MN's flows are not disrupted as another HA takes over as the primary
   HA for the client.  Since the HAs are globally distributed, the
   overhead due to triangular routing is also minimized.  GHAHA's major
   disadvantage is the signaling overhead due to the need to synchronize
   the state all the HAs.  This overhead grows linearly with the number
   of HAs in the system.  The use of anycast routing has also raised
   concerns on security, as IPsec cannot be applied to communications
   which endpoints are anycast addresses, and on its impact on the BGP
   routing system scalability.

3.6.  Dynamic Local Mobility Anchors (DLMA)

   The Dynamic Local Mobility Anchors (DLMA) scheme suggested in
   [I-D.chan-netext-distributed-lma] builds on the distributed
   architecture proposed by GHAHA while offsetting some of the
   disadvantages of GHAHA in requiring complete synchronization of all
   the HAs in a global set and the large amount of signaling traffic

   required for this complete synchronization.  DLMA decouples the
   logical functionalities of a mobility anchor into:

   (1)  Allocation of HoA or HNPs to MNs,

   (2)  Location management which includes managing IP addresses and
        locations of MNs,

   (3)  Mobility routing which includes intercepting and forwarding
        packets.

   DLMA then centralizes functionalities (1) and (2) in a Home Location
   Mobility Anchor (H-LMA) while distributing functionality (3) across
   several Visited Location Mobility Anchors (V-LMAs).  The term Visited
   LMA here is used loosely, regardless of whether the MN has visited
   the subnet or not.  All the LMAs advertise the same prefix using
   anycast routing.  However it is required that the HoA or HNP assigned
   to an MN is unique to an H-LMA, i.e. it is possible to uniquely
   identify the H-LMA of an MN from its HoA.

   An MN acquires a HoA (or HNP) from its H-LMA.  When it moves out of
   the home subnet and anchors itself to a V-LMA, the V-LMA informs the
   H-LMA of the MN that it is the current anchoring point of the MN.
   The H-LMA then maintains this location information for the MN.  When
   a CN anywhere in the Internet tries to send a packet to the MN, the
   packet is intercepted by the V-LMA closest to the CN via anycast
   routing.  This V-LMA, called the O-LMA, tunnels the packet to the
   H-LMA of the MN which then tunnels the packet to the V-LMA where the
   MN is currently anchored.  This V-LMA is called the D-LMA which then
   delivers the packet to the MN (Figure 6).  Thus O-LMA and D-LMA for a
   flow are the V-LMAs that are closest to the CN and MN of that flow
   respectively.  This is the route taken by a packet from the CN to the
   MN when there is no route optimization.  When there is route
   optimization, the O-LMA caches location information about the MN from
   its H-LMA and thereafter directly tunnels the packet to its D-LMA.
   When an MN moves from D-LMA to another, an update must be sent to the
   previous D-LMA in addition to the H-LMA if route optimization is
   used, in case some O-LMA has cached information about the old D-LMA
   of the MN.  The old D-LMA could then tunnel packets to the new D-LMA
   of the MN and also inform the O-LMA to update the location
   information in its cache.  In the reverse direction, a packet sent by
   the MN is captured by its D-LMA and routed to the CN directly.

   Figure 6: Packet routing to and from the MN.  The LMA closest to the
   MN becomes the D-LMA and the LMA closest to the communication CN
   becomes the O-LMA.  The H-LMA is the LMA that handles location
   information for the MN.

   Every LMA acts as a H-LMA for a subset of MNs for which it assigns
   HoAs or HNPs and maintains location information.  It also performs
   mobility routing for MNs not in this subset (i.e.) acts as a V-LMA
   for these MNs.  The DLMA scheme works for both Mobile IPv6 and Proxy
   Mobile IPv6.  The mobility functionalities can also be moved to the
   edge of the routers and packets may be tunneled directly to and from
   the mobile access gateways (MAGs) bypassing the V-LMAs.

   It is worth noting that the Scalable Approach for Wide-Area IP
   Mobility [SAIL] proposes a very similar approach by distributing the
   binding management with one-hop DHT.  Through a performance
   evaluation, it has proven being prone to failure as well as reducing
   GHAHA's overhead while achieving equal or even better end-to-end
   delay in most cases.

   Table 1: Summary of the solution space.

   All of the previously mentioned solutions propose a distributed
   approach for mobility management, by locating multiple mobility
   anchors closer to the edge of the network.  FAMA and DMA locate them
   at the access router, i.e. at the first element to provide access to
   the internet to the MNs.  DMI and DLMA requires that a mobility
   anchor is located in the same IP network than the MN (not necessarily
   co-located with the access router).  HMIPv6 and GHAHA are more
   flexible as mobility anchors do not need to be located in every IP
   network where the MN will travel.  However, having more mobility
   anchors improves performance and reliability in case of a failure and
   decreases latency.  HMIPv6 still relies on a centralized HA, which
   makes it prone to failure and triangular routing.

   The use of multiple mobility anchors raise the question of how the
   IPsec Security Associations (SA) would be deployed and enforced on
   all of them.  This is a matter of concern especially for securing the
   signaling messages.  For that purpose, FAMA proposes to use
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses, as introduced in
   [I-D.laganier-mext-cga].  GHAHA relies on HARP to perform such IPsec



Kuntz, et al.           Expires November 6, 2011               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 DMM Summary                      May 2011


   SA synchronization.  The other solutions do not mention how this
   could be achieved.

   The approaches that grant the MN the capability to register to
   multiple mobility anchors at the same time (HMIPv6, FAMA, DMI) should
   also implement a mechanism to avoid routing loops between them
   (e.g.when the MN mutually binds a new and old address to two
   different mobility anchors).  For example, [I-D.ng-intarea-tunnel-
   loop] discusses this issue and proposes solutions.

   Dynamic mobility (i.e. the ability for flows to travel through either
   the mobility anchor or non-anchor nodes, even though no specific
   route optimization support is available at the correspondent node),
   is only partially supported in FAMA, DMI and DMA.  These protocols
   indeed reduce triangular routing by assigning topologically valid IP
   addresses to the MN every time it moves in a new network.  However,
   it is still unclear how applications could select the desired source
   address for their sessions.  For example, in the case of DMI, one
   could be interested in using the permanent address anchored at the
   permanent HA, or the newly assigned address in the network where the
   MN resides.  In other words, how could one bind a specific address to
   a specific socket?  A mobility-aware API, as described by Section 6
   of [I-D.patil-mext-dmm-approaches], could help making such decisions.
   In addition, more work may be needed to better define use-cases for
   dynamic mobility.  For example, the benefits offered depend on how
   frequently the MN changes its anchor point, how long the sessions
   last, and also where the correspondent nodes are located.

   By design, FAMA, DMI and DMA relies on the use of multiple anchored
   addresses.  With DMI, the MN is always associated with a permanent
   HoA, and thus can always be reached by a CN that does not know the
   MN's current location.  However, FAMA and DMA fail to specify whether
   the MN will be associated with a permanent address.  In the absence
   of such, reachability of the MN from the CN is not guaranteed, so
   mechanisms should be specified for the CN to chose a valid
   destination address.  The dynamic DNS update as specified by
   [RFC5026] cannot be used in this case.  Beside, how HoAs would be
   assigned is not clearly defined by these solutions.  Especially, how
   does it affect the HoA bootstrapping mechanism defined by [RFC5026]?
   Last but not least, how would the HoAs be recycled?  They need to be
   released at some point and put back by the mobility anchor into the
   pool of available HoAs.  As HMIPv6, DLMA and GHAHA always rely on a
   single permanent address, these solutions are not affected by these
   issues.

   The idea of splitting location and routing management as exposed by
   DLMA or SAIL could improve GHAHA scalability by reducing the
   signaling overhead caused by the HA's synchronization.  However, in

   the case of DMLA, care should be taken to avoid that the location
   anchor becomes a single point of failure.

   It is clear that there are several issues that must be kept in mind
   and tradeoffs that have to be made while designing an effective DMM
   solution.  Some (not all) of them are:

   (1)  Ensuring reachability of the MN by the CN,

   (2)  Signaling overhead and binding latency,

   (3)  More vs less mobility agents,

   (4)  Distribution of mobility functions among these mobility agents,

   (5)  Assigning and recycling addresses to MNs,

   We have presented, what we hope would be the first steps to
   reinitiating discussion within the MEXT WG on DMM which in turn would
   lead to a robust and efficient DMM solution.
