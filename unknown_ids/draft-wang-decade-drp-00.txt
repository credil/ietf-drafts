                 An HTTP-based DECADE Resource Protocol
                        draft-wang-decade-drp-00

Abstract

   This document explores the design of an HTTP-based DECADE Resource
   Protocol (DRP), which can be used for content and resource management
   between a DECADE Client and a DECADE Server, or between two DECADE
   Servers. We identify the function entities, and present initial
   protocol message flow and syntax design. The purpose of this document
   is to get design discussions started, not to provide a complete
   solution.

1.  Introduction

   The DECADE Architecture document [I-D.ietf-decade-arch-03] identifies
   a DECADE architecture that consists of two logically independent
   protocols: the DECADE Resource Protocol (DRP) and the Standard Data
   Transport (SDT).  The former provides access control and resource
   scheduling between two DECADE peers, while the latter is used to
   transfer data objects to and from a DECADE Server. The architecture
   document observes that the two protocols may be realized on the same
   wire.

   In this document, we present an initial design of a DRP based on
   HTTP. We use the DECADE requirements [I-D.ietf-decade-reqs-04] to
   guide our design. The purpose of this document is to get design
   discussions started, not to provide a complete solution.

Internet-Draft              HTTP DECADE DRP                     Oct 2011


   Specifically, the DRP we present provides a signaling layer for 
   transport negotiation, content management, access control and
   resource control.  The SDT is responsible for data put, retrieve,
   delete, and metadata update, and the implementation of access control
   and resource control policies.

   We also show that the HTTP based DRP may be extended to include an
   HTTP based SDT, achieving a same-wire design, although it is also
   possible to use another SDT.

2.  Terminologies and concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", "MAY NOT" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This draft uses the terms defined in [I-D.ietf-decade-problem-
   statement-03] and in [I-D.ietf-decade-arch-03].

   DECADE peers: Entities involved in the DECADE protocol, such as a
   DECADE Server or a DECADE Client.


3.  Protocol Overview

3.1.  Overview

   A DECADE Protocol is spoken between a DECADE Client and a DECADE
   Server or between two DECADE Servers to manage, store, and retrieve
   data objects for data distribution. A DECADE Client can be an
   application server, or embedded in a web browser, etc.  

   DECADE needs a mandatory naming scheme, that can be used to achieve
   content security and de-duplication. In this initial design, we
   assume that the name space is flat for simplicity. We anticipate that
   the name scheme should also allow for group operations on a set of
   data objects with a similar/same attribute.

3.2.  Function Entity

   We consider two primary function entities involved in DECADE: the
   DECADE Server and the DECADE Client.

   DECADE Server: A DECADE Server stores DECADE data inside the network,
   and thereafter manages both stored data and access to
   them[I-D.ietf-decade-arch-03].

   DECADE Client: A DECADE Client stores and retrieves data at DECADE

3.4.  Object Naming Scheme

   (To be added...)

3.5.  Protocol Operations

   The DRP we present is a request-response protocol.  Requests and
   corresponding responses are exchanged between DECADE Client and
   Server or between DECADE Servers.

   In particular, we identify the following operations:

      Access Token: This operation allows the DECADE Server to limit
      access and resource control of data objects stored on it via
      authenticated tokens.  The token should limit permitted operations
      to permitted objects by permitted clients during permitted period,
      as well as priority for bandwidth given to requested operation,
      and so on. OAUTH is adopted here to realize access and resource
      control.

      Query Server State (from the system's view): This operation allows
      a DECADE Client to query aggregated server status of a DECADE
      Server, e.g., resource availability, and so on.

      Query Server State (from the user view): This operation allows a
      DECADE Client to query its particular state, e.g., a list of
      objects stored in the Server belonging to the DECADE Client, the
      Client's available resources, and so on.

      Query Object Property: This operation allows a DECADE Client to

Internet-Draft              HTTP DECADE DRP                     Oct 2011


      query properties associated with a data object. Examples include
      TTL of the object, object size, and object type.

      Set Object Property: This operation allows a DECADE Client to set
      data object properties.

      Delete Data Object: This operation is used to delete data objects
      from a DECADE Server.


   Complementing the preceding DRP operations, the following SDT
   operations may be defined for a complete DECADE Protocol:

      Get Data Object: This operation is used to download data objects
      from a DECADE Server.

      Put Data Object: This operation is used to write data objects to a
      DECADE Server.


4.  Message Syntax and Processing

We now present the encoding and processing.

4.1.  Encoding

   The DRP in this document follows the standard request and response
   formats for HTTP Request and Response messages [RFC2616].
   Specifically,  the header fields in both request and response
   messages follows the standard rules for HTTP/1.1 Header fields, which
   MAY be included in the messages if necessary. 

   We use JSON to encode the bodies for both request and response
   messages.

   In the following messages, *** represent numeric data to be insert.
   (To be continued...)

4.2.  Common Message Processing

   After receiving a DRP protocol message, some basic processing will be
   performed, regardless of the message type or the receiving entity.

   Upon receiving a message, the receiver examines the message header to
   ensure that it is properly formed, which is done by the receiver
   itself.  If not, appropriate standard HTTP errors MUST be generated.

   If the message is found to be incorrectly formed or the length does

Internet-Draft              HTTP DECADE DRP                     Oct 2011


   not match the length encoded in the header, the receiver MUST reply
   with an HTTP 400 response.

   If the version number is not supported by the receiver, the receiver
   MUST reply with an HTTP 400 response.

   If the receiver is unable to process the message temporarily because
   it is in an overloaded state, the receiver SHOULD reply with an HTTP
   503 response.

   If the receiver encounters an internal error while attempting to
   process the message, the receiver MUST generate an HTTP 500 response.

4.3.  DECADE Messages

4.3.1.  Transport_Query Message

   After a DECADE Client locates its authenticated DECADE Server, it
   MUST query the SDT capability of the Server. This query is the
   Transport_Query message.  Below is an example Transport_Query
   message:

   GET /decade/transport/ HTTP/1.1
   Host:  example.com
   Content-Type: application/decade-transport-req+json
   X-DECADE-Protocol-Version: 1.0

   If the query message is valid, the DECADE Server sends back a
   response listing the supported SDT protocols. An example is shown
   below:

           ...
   } TransportProtocol;

   object {
       TransportProtocol transport-protocol;
   }


4.3.2.  Access_Token Message

   This operation allows a DECADE CLient to obtain an access token from
   a DECADE Server to limit access and achieve resource control.  

   Specifically, an access token should limit permitted operations to
   permitted objects by permitted clients during permitted period, as
   well as priority for bandwidth given to requested operation, and so
   on.  

   In DECADE architecture, a user delegation scheme is proposed. We
   anticipate that a DECADE Client can generate such Access Token
   locally as well.

   An access token to be generated may be depended on the SDT specified,
   should the token to be carried by the SDT operation. 

4.3.3.  Server_State_Query Message

   This operation allows state query. The state can be either system-
   wide or on a particular user. An example message is:

4.3.4.  Object_Property_Query Message

   This operation allows a DECADE Client to query object properties,
   including TTL of object, object size, and object type.  The request
   message is as following:

   If an object property query message is valid, the DECADE Server
   replies the requested info.  An example of response is:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Length: ***
   Content-Type: application/decade-propquery-ans+json
   X-DECADE-Protocol-Version: 1.0
