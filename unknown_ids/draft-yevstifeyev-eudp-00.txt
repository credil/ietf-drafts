INTERNET DRAFT             EUDP Specification           December 1, 2010


1.  Introduction

   UDP is one of the most widely-used transport-level protocol. One of
   the things which makes it so popular is its simplicity. However in
   some cases this causes lack of facilities, which can be provided  by
   other protocols, such as TCP (see RFC 793 [RFC793]) or DCCP (see RFC
   4340 [RFC4340]). During the history of UDP some attempts have been
   made to improve it by adding some features (for instance UDP-Lite
   (see RFC 3828 [RFC3828])), but these proposals were too specific and
   did not gain popularity.

   EUDP, protocol, proposed by this document, is intended to be a
   universal solution, which combines simplicity of UDP and
   extensibility of TCP.  

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

2.1. Lower Layer Protocols Considerations

   EUDP is a transport-layer protocol, and the protocol directly under
   it is IP. EUDP supports as IPv4, as IPv6 as lower-layer protocol. The
   IP Protocol number to be used with EUDP is XXX

   Note: XXX is to be replaced with assigned Protocol number. This note
   is to be deleted.  

2.2. Packet Format

2.2.1. Header

   The EUDP header is shown in the figure 1.

2.2.2. Fields

   Source Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to be
   used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768]. EUDP uses
   the same port set as UDP.

   Destination Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to
   be used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768]. EUDP
   uses the same port set as UDP.

   Data Offset (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is the number of 32 bit
   words in the EUDP Header.  This indicates where the data begins.  The

INTERNET DRAFT             EUDP Specification           December 1, 2010


   EUDP header (even one including options) is an integral number of 32
   bits long.

   Checksum (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to be used
   as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768].

   Options (variable length) - OPIONAL field. Options may occupy space
   at the end of the EUDP header and are a multiple of 8 bits in length.
   All options are included in the checksum. An option may begin on any
   octet boundary. There are two cases for the format of an option:

   Case 1:  A single octet of option-kind.

   Case 2:  An octet of option-kind, an octet of option-length, and the
   actual option-data octets. The option-length counts the two octets of
   option-kind and option-length as well as the option-data octets. Note
   that the list of options may be shorter than the data offset field
   might imply.  The content of the header beyond the  End-of-Option
   option must be header padding (i.e., zero).

   EUDP MUST support all options. Pre-defied options are specified in
   Section 2.3.

   Padding (variable length) - OPTIONAL field. The EUDP header padding
   is used to ensure that the TCP header ends and data begins on a 32
   bit boundary. The padding is composed of zeros.

2.3. Pre-Defined Options

   This section specifies pre-defined EUDP options.

   Currently following options are pre-defined - see Section 2.3.1 and
   Section 2.3.2.

2.3.1. 'No Operation' Option

   The 'No Operation' option has the following parameters:

   Kind - 0; Length - none (one-octet option);

   This option may be used between options, for example, to align the
   beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary. 

2.3.2. 'End Of Options List' Option

   The 'End of Options List' option has the following parameters:

   Kind - 1; Length - none (one-octet option);

INTERNET DRAFT             EUDP Specification           December 1, 2010


   This option code indicates the end of the option list. This might not
   coincide with the end of the TCP header according to the Data Offset
   field. This is used at the end of all options, not the end of each
   option, and need only be used if the end of the options would not
   otherwise coincide with the end of the EUDP header.

2.4. Pseudo Header

   The EUDP does not use the same pseudo header as UDP. The EUDP pseudo-
   header is shown in the figure 2.

    0      7 8      15
   +--------+---------+
   |Protocol|Reserved |
   +--------+---------+

   The Protocol field is defined and is to be used as described in UDP
   specification - RFC 768 [RFC768].

   The Reserved field MUST be zeros and MUST be ignored by client.

2.5. Compatibility with UDP

   The applications which use UDP can safely use EUDP with no options
   instead.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security issues for UDP concern EUDP as well.

   Additional security can be provided by additional options. This
   document does not define such options.

   UDP itself does not provide any authentication features. Such
   features can be provided by additional options, which are not defined
   by this document. 

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1. EUDP Options Registry

   IANA is asked to create and maintain the registry named 'EUDP Options
   Registry', which consists of 4 values: Option Kind, Option Length,
   Description and Reference. The initial values are given below;
   assignments to this registry are to be made through Specification
   Required policies.

   Option kind  Option length  Description             Reference
   ------------+--------------+-----------------------+---------------
   0            -              No Operation            This document
   1            -              End of Options List     This document
   2-253        -              Unassigned              This document
   254          variable       Private Experimentation This document
   255          -              Reserved                This document  

4.2. EUDP Ports Registry

   As EUDP uses the same port set as UDP, IANA is asked to mark that all
   assigned UDP ports can be used with EUDP as well.

4.3. IP Protocol Number Assignment

   IANA has assigned the IP protocol number XXX to be used with EUDP.

   Note: XXX should be replaced with the number assigned to EUDP. IANA
   is asked to assign such number. This note is to be deleted.
