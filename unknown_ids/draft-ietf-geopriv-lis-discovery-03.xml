    <abstract>
      <t>A method is described for the discovery of a Location Information Server.  The method uses a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option.  DHCP options are defined for both IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP.  A URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR) method is described for use where the DHCP option is unsuccessful.  This document defines a U-NAPTR Application Service for a LIS, with a specific Application Protocol for the HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol.

    <section title="Introduction and Overview">
      <t>Discovering a Location Information Server (LIS) is an important part of the location acquisition process.  The LIS is an access network service that needs to be discovered before it can be used.  This document describes a method that a host can use to discover a URI for a LIS.
      </t>

      <t>The product of a discovery process, such as the one described in this document, is the address of the service.  In this document, the result is a URI, which identifies a LIS.
      </t>

      <t>The URI result from the discovery process is suitable for location configuration only; that is, the client MUST dereference the URI using the process described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">HELD</xref>. URIs discovered in this way are not "location by reference" URIs; dereferencing one of them provides the location of the requester only.  Clients MUST NOT embed these URIs in fields in other protocols designed to carry the location of the client.
      </t>

      <t>The discovery process requires that the host first attempt LIS discovery using Dynamic Host Configuration protocol (DHCP).  If DHCP is not available, or the option is not supported by the network, the host attempts to discover the LIS using the DNS and URI-enabled Naming Authority Pointer (U-NAPTR).  Finally, the host can rely on proprietary methods for determining the address of the LIS, including static configuration.
      </t>

      <section anchor="intro-dhcp" title="DHCP Discovery">
        <t>DHCP (<xref target="RFC2131"/>, <xref target="RFC3315"/>) is a commonly used mechanism for providing bootstrap configuration information allowing a host to operate in a specific network environment.  The bulk of DHCP information is largely static; consisting of configuration information that does not change over the period that the host is attached to the network.  Physical location information might change over this time, however the address of the LIS does not.  Thus, DHCP is suitable for configuring a host with the address of a LIS.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="intro-dns" title="U-NAPTR Discovery">
        <t>Where DHCP is not available, the DNS might be able to provide a URI.  This document describes a method that uses <xref target="RFC4848">URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR)</xref>, a Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) profile that supports URI results.
        </t>

        <t>For the LIS discovery DDDS application, an Application Service tag <spanx style="verb">LIS</spanx> and an Application Protocol tag <spanx style="verb">HELD</spanx> are created and registered with the IANA.  Taking a domain name, this U-NAPTR application uses the two tags to determine the LIS URI.
        </t>

        <t>A domain name is the crucial input to the U-NAPTR resolution process.  <xref target="dn"/> of this document describes several methods for deriving an appropriate domain name.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>

        <t>This document also uses the term "host" to refer to an end host, consistent with its use in DHCP documents.  In <xref target="RFC3693">RFC3693</xref> parlance, the host is the Device, which might also be the Target.
        </t>

        <t>The terms &quot;access network&quot; refers to the network that a host connects to for Internet access.  The &quot;access network provider&quot; is the entity that operates the access network.  This is consistent with the definition in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/> which combines the Internet Access Provider (IAP) and Internet Service Provider (ISP).  The access network provider is responsible for allocating the host a public IP address and for directly or indirectly providing a LIS service.
        </t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="LIS Discovery Using DHCP">

      <t>DHCP allows the access network provider to specify the address of a LIS as part of network configuration.  If the host is able to acquire a LIS URI using DHCP then this URI is used directly; the U-NAPTR process is not necessary if this option is provided.
      </t>

      <t>This document registers DHCP options for a LIS address for both IPv4 and IPv6.

    <section anchor="dn" title="Determining the Access Network Domain Name">
      <t>The U-NAPTR discovery method described in <xref target="u-naptr"/> requires that the domain name applicable to the access network is known.  An unconfigured host might not have this information, therefore it must determine this value before the U-NAPTR method can be attempted.
      </t>

      <t>This section describes several methods for discovering a domain name for the local access network.  Each method is attempted where applicable until a domain name is derived.  If a domain name is successfully derived but that domain name does not produce any U-NAPTR records, alternative methods can be attempted to determine additional domain names.  Reattempting with different methods is particularly applicable when NAT is used, as is shown in <xref target="stun"/>.
      </t>

      <section anchor="dn-dhcp" title="DHCP Domain Name Option">
        <t>For IP version 4, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option 15 <xref target="RFC2131"/> includes the domain name suffix for the host.  If DHCP and option 15 are available, this value should be used as input the U-NAPTR procedure.
        </t>

<!-- If the DHC WG ever start publishing RFCs from their expired drafts, this one might be useful:
     <t>DHCP for IPv6 provides a single domain name suffix that can be used in the same manner, as a described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-dnsdomain"/>.
        </t> -->

        <t>Alternatively, a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the host might be provided by the server (<xref target="RFC4702"/> for DHCPv4, <xref target="RFC4704"/> for DHCPv6).  The domain part of the FQDN can be used as input to the U-NAPTR resolution and is obtained by removing the first label.  If the host has provided a fully qualified domain name using this option, it SHOULD NOT be used - the domain known to the host might not be the same as that of the access network.
        </t>

        <t>Note that these options should only be used if the LIS address option is not available; they SHOULD be used if DHCP is available.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="dn-reversedns" title="Reverse DNS">
        <t>DNS <spanx style="verb">PTR</spanx> records in the <spanx style="verb">in-addr.arpa.</spanx> domain can be used to determine the domain name of a host, and therefore, the name of the domain for that host.  The use of the <spanx style="verb">in-addr.arpa.</spanx> domain is described in <xref target="RFC1034"/> and results in the domain name of the host.  Likewise, IPv6 hosts use the <spanx style="verb">ip6.arpa.</spanx> domain.  In the majority of cases, the domain part of this name (everything excluding the first label) is also the domain name for the access network.  Assuming that this is true, this domain name can be used as input to the U-NAPTR process.
        </t>

        <t>For example, if the for <spanx style="verb">10.1.2.3</spanx> address, if the <spanx style="verb">PTR</spanx> record at <spanx style="verb">3.2.1.10.in-addr.arpa.</spanx> refers to <spanx style="verb">h3-2-1-10.example.com</spanx>, this results in a U-NAPTR search for <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>.
        </t>

        <t>The DNS hierarchy does not necessarily directly map onto a network topology (see <xref target="RFC4367"/>); therefore, this method MUST only be used for the domain name determined by removing the first label only.  This method assumes that the access network provider also provides the reverse DNS record and they control the domain that is indicated in the <spanx style="verb">PTR</spanx> record.
        </t>

        <t>Furthermore, this method might not apply where a host is given a domain name that is different from the domain name of the access network.  This might occur in some hosting configurations, such as where a number of web server hosts, with widely varying domain names, are co-located.  From the above example, the access network provider allocated <spanx style="verb">10.1.2.3</spanx> to the host; therefore, they also need to control the DNS domain <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> and the associated NAPTR records.  <xref target="RFC4033">DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)</xref> provides a cryptographic means of validating this association, through data origin authentication.
        </t>

        <section anchor="stun" title="Determining an External IP Address using STUN">
          <t>Reverse DNS relies on knowing the IP address of a host within the access domain.  Initially, this SHOULD be attempted using the IP address that is assigned to a local interface on the host.  However, when a NAT device exists between the device and the Internet, the public IP address of the NAT device is substituted for the source IP address.  The IP address of the NAT device and the corresponding domain name can be used to discover the LIS.
          </t>

          <t>In order to use reverse DNS in this configuration, the hosts need to know the IP address that the NAT device uses.  A host can use the <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis">Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)</xref> to determine a public IP address.  The host uses the <spanx style="verb">Binding Request</spanx> message and the resulting <spanx style="verb">XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS</spanx> parameter that is returned in the response.
          </t>

          <t>These methods are particularly useful in residential broadband configurations.  A large proportion of residential broadband services employ a NAT device so that several hosts can share the same Internet access.  Since the network behind the NAT device are generally very small, both in numbers and geographical area, it isn't necessary for a LIS to operate within that network; the hosts are able to access a LIS in the access network outside of the NAT device.
          </t>

          <figure>
            <preamble>The following figure shows a typical home broadband deployment scenario.  In this scenario, the public address of the Router/NAT can be used to discover the LIS in the access network.

          <t>Using STUN requires cooperation from a publicly accessible STUN server.  The host also requires configuration information that identifies the STUN server, or a domain name that can be used for STUN server discovery.  To be selected for this purpose, the STUN server needs to provide the public reflexive transport address of the host; STUN servers that provide private addresses for any reason are not appropriate for LIS discovery.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="otherip" title="Alternate Methods for External IP Addresses">
          <t>Alternative methods for determining other IP addresses MAY be used by the host.  <xref target="UPnP-IGD-WANIPConnection1">Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)</xref> and <xref target="I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP)</xref> are both able to provide the external address of a routing device.  Proprietary methods for determining other addresses might also be available.  Because there is no assurance that these methods will be supported by any access network these methods are not mandated.
          </t>

          <t>The source IP address in any IP packet can be used to determine the public IP address of a host.  While the STUN method uses a small part of a more sophisticated protocol, this principle can be applied using any other protocol.  Like STUN, this method requires prior knowledge of the publicly accessible server and the method that it supports.
          </t>

          <t>For instance, a publicly accessible host could be configured to respond to a UDP packet on a predefined port; the data of the response could contain the source IP address that was in the request.  Alternatively, a HTTP server at a particular URL could be configured to respond to a GET request with a <spanx style="verb">text/plain</spanx> body containing the IP address of the requester.  HTTP proxies render this method unusable; in particular, transparent HTTP proxies might affect the results of this method without the knowledge of the host.  Such services already exist on the public Internet.
          </t>

          <t>The discovery procedure assumes that the correct LIS is in a network segment that is closer to the host.  Each network segment between the host and LIS decreases the chance that the LIS is able to correctly determine a location for the host.
          </t>

          <t>Discovery methods follow an order of precedence.  The exception is for alternative methods of determining the hosts IP address in each network segment; precedence is given to addresses in the network segments closer to the host.  Therefore, the host attempts to use the IP address assigned to its local network interface before attempting to determine alternative IP addresses.  Precedence is given to methods that provide an IP address in network segments closer to the host, since these networks are more likely to have knowledge of the physical network access.  Methods for determining addresses on the public Internet are given lower precedence.

    <section anchor="procedure" title="Overall Discovery Procedure">
      <t>To claim compliance with this document, a host MUST support both DHCP discovery and U-NAPTR discovery.  Further, the host MUST support retrieval of domain name from DHCP and reverse DNS, using a local interface address and the reflexive transport address provided by STUN.  Additional methods for determining the IP address of the host in different network segments are optional.
      </t>

      <t>These individual components of discovery are combined into a single discovery procedure.  Some networks maintain a topology analogous to an onion and are comprised of layers, or segments, separating hosts from the Internet through intermediate networks.  Applying the individual discovery methods in the following order provides a higher probability that a host discovers the LIS physically closest to it:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>DHCP LIS URI Option</t>
        <t>DNS U-NAPTR Discovery, using the domain name from:
        <list style="letters">
          <t>DHCP Domain Name Option</t>
          <t>Reverse DNS, using the IP address from:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>the local network interface and immediate network segment</t>
            <t>the public reflexive transport address, as revealed by STUN</t>
          </list>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>any network segment, as revealed by an alternative method</t>
          </list>
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>Static configuration</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>A host that has multiple network interfaces could potentially be served by a different access network on each interface, each with a different LIS.  The host SHOULD attempt to discover the LIS applicable to each network interface, stopping when a LIS is successfully discovered on any interface.
      </t>

      <t>A host that discovers a LIS URI MUST attempt to verify that the LIS is able to provide location information.  For the HELD protocol, the host MUST make a location request to the LIS.  If the LIS responds to this request with the <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> error code (see Section 4.3.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>), the host MUST continue the discovery process and not make further requests to that LIS on that network interface.
      </t>

      <t>DHCP discovery MUST be attempted before DNS discovery.  This allows the network access provider a direct and explicit means of configuring a LIS address.  DNS discovery is used as a failsafe, providing a means to discover a LIS where the DHCP infrastructure does not support the LIS URI option.
      </t>

      <t>Static host configuration MAY be used to provide a LIS address if both DHCP and DNS methods fail.  Note however, that if a host has moved from its customary location, static configuration might indicate a LIS that is unable to provide a location.
      </t>

      <t>If the discovery process fails, user interaction is NOT RECOMMENDED.  The discovery process is not easily diagnosed by a user.
      </t>

      <t>LIS discovery through DNS requires the host to determine the domain name of the local access network.  Where DHCP is available, the DHCP domain name option (<xref target="dn-dhcp"/>) can be used to provide this information.  If the domain name cannot be determined from DHCP, or the resulting domain name fails to yield a valid LIS address then reverse DNS is used.
      </t>

      <section anchor="vpn" title="Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)">
        <t>LIS discovery over a VPN network interface SHOULD NOT be performed since such a LIS does not have the physical presence generally necessary to determine location.  However, since not all interfaces connected to a VPN can be detected by hosts, a LIS SHOULD NOT provide location information in response to requests originating from a VPN pool.  This ensures that even if a host discovers a LIS over the VPN, it does not rely on a LIS that is unable to provide accurate location information.  The exception to this is where the LIS and host are able to determine a location without access network support.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Access Network Guidance">
      <t>In order to successfully discover a LIS, a host relies on information provided by the access network.  DHCP and DNS servers need to be able to provide the data that the device depends on.  This section provides guidance on what information needs to be made available to a host for it to successfully discover a LIS.
      </t>

      <t>Access networks that provide both a LIS and a DHCP server must provide the DHCP option for the LIS address.  Since DHCP must be attempted first, if it can be guaranteed that DHCP can be used by all hosts in the network, no further configuration is necessary.
      </t>

      <t>Unless DHCP can be relied upon for all hosts in the network (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/> for common scenarios where this isn't the case), DNS discovery methods must also be supported.  To support the DNS discovery methods, the access network must provide two sets of DNS records: the (U-)NAPTR records that enable the discovery of a LIS URI from a domain name; and the reverse DNS records that enable the discovery of a domain name based on the IP address of the host.
      </t>

      <t>Access networks that provide a LIS should also provide reverse DNS records for all IP addresses they administer.  For each domain that is referenced in reverse DNS records, a NAPTR record in that domain must be provided for the "LIS:HELD" service that can be used to resolve the address of a LIS.
      </t>

      <t>The requirement for PTR and NAPTR records extends to both public and private addresses used by access networks.  A host that discovers the external address of a router by proprietary means must be able to use the resulting private address as input to a reverse DNS lookup and U-NAPTR discovery.  Similarly, a host that discovers a public reflexive transport address using STUN must be able to use the public address.
      </t>

        <preamble>The following figure shows the addresses that could be revealed by a first hop method, like <xref target="UPnP-IGD-WANIPConnection1">UPnP</xref> or <xref target="I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">NAT-PMP</xref> (the private address marked with '{N}') and STUN (the public address marked with '{S}').

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The primary attack against the methods described in this document is one that would lead to impersonation of a LIS.  The LIS is responsible for providing location information and this information is critical to a number of network services; furthermore, a host does not necessarily have a prior relationship with a LIS.  Several methods are described here that can limit the probablity of, or provide some protection against, such an attack.
      </t>

      <t>The address of a LIS is usually well-known within an access network; therefore, interception of messages does not introduce any specific concerns.</t>

      <t>If DHCP is used, the integrity of DHCP options is limited by the security of the channel over which they are provided.  Physical security and separation of DHCP messages from other packets are commonplace methods that can reduce the possibility of attack within an access network; alternatively, <xref target="RFC3118">DHCP authentication</xref> can provide a degree of protection against modification.
      </t>

      <t>An attacker could attempt to compromise the U-NAPTR resolution.  A description of the security considerations for U-NAPTR applications is included in <xref target="RFC4848"/>.
      </t>

      <t>In addition to considerations related to U-NAPTR, it is important to recognize that the output of this is entirely dependent on its input.  An attacker who can control the domain name can also control the final URI.  Because a number of methods are provided for determining the domain name, a host implementation needs to consider attacks against each of the methods that are used.
      </t>

      <t>Reverse DNS is subject to the maintenance of the <spanx style="verb">in-addr.arpa.</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">ip6.arpa.</spanx> domain and the integrity of the results that it provides.  <xref target="RFC4033">DNSSEC</xref> provides some measures that can improve the reliability of DNS results.  In particular, DNSSEC SHOULD be applied to ensure that the reverse DNS record and the resulting domain are provided by the same entity before this method is used.  Without this assurance, the host cannot be certain that the access network provider has provided the NAPTR record for the domain name that is provided.
      </t>

      <t>Hosts behind NAT devices are also subject to attacks when retrieving their public IP address.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis"/> describes some means of mitigating this attack for STUN.

   <t>In this example, the host sits behind a home router that includes a NAT function.  The host is assigned an address from the private 192.168.x.x address range, in this case 192.168.0.55.  The outbound IP address provided to the home router is public and and belongs to the my.isp.net domain; in this example the home router is assigned 192.0.2.75, which is also given the domain name 192-0-2-75.my.isp.net.
   </t>

   <t>In this example, several methods are not possible due to the configuration of the devices and network.  The DHCP server on the home router does not support the LIS URI option, and a domain name is not configured on the router.  In addition to this, the UPnP service on home router is disabled.  Therefore, the host attempts these methods and is unsuccessful.
   </t>

   <t>The example first covers the unsuccessful attempts to discover the LIS, followed by a successful application of DNS discovery based on an address provided by a STUN server.  In this situation, the STUN server is provided by a Voice Service Provider (VSP) that the owner of the host purchases a voice service from.  The address of the STUN server is configured on the host.  The VSP is a separate entity on the public Internet with no relation to the access network provider.
