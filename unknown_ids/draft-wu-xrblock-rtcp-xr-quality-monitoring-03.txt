Internet-Draft        RTCP XR Quality Report Blocks       September 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on multimedia quality using
   one of several standard metrics.

   The metrics belong to the class of application level metrics defined
   in [MONARCH] (work in progress).


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   The Multimedia Quality Metrics Report Block can be used in any real-
   time AV application.

   The factors that affect real-time AV application quality can be split
   into two categories.  The first category consists of transport-
   dependent factors such as packet loss, delay and jitter (which also
   translates into losses in the playback buffer).  The factors in the
   second category are application-specific factors that affect real
   time application (e.g., video) quality and are sensitivity to network
   errors.  These factors can be but not limited to video codec and loss
   recovery technique, coding bit rate, packetization scheme, and
   content characteristics.

   Compared with application-specific factors, the transport-dependent
   factors sometimes are not sufficient to measure real time data
   quality, since the ability to analyze the real time data in the
   application layer provides quantifiable measurements for subscriber
   Quality of Experience (QoE) that may not be captured in the
   transmission layers or from the RTP layer down.  In a typical
   scenario, monitoring of the transmission layers can produce
   statistics suggesting that quality is not an issue, such as the fact
   that network jitter is not excessive.  However, problems may occur in
   the service layers leading to poor subscriber QoE.  Therefore
   monitoring using only network-level measurements may be insufficient
   when application layer content quality is required.

Internet-Draft        RTCP XR Quality Report Blocks       September 2011


   In order to provide accurate measures of real time application
   quality when transporting real time contents across a network, the
   synthentical multimedia quality Metrics is highly required which can
   be conveyed in the RTCP XR packets[RFC3611] and may have the
   following three benefits:

   o  Tuning the content encoder algorithm to satisfy real time data
      quality requirements
   o  Determining which system techniques to use in a given situation
      and when to switch from one technique to another as system
      parameters change
   o  Verifying the continued correct operation of an existing system


4.  Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Block

   This block reports the multimedia application performance or quality
   metrics beyond the information carried in the standard RTCP packet
   format.  Information is recorded about multimedia application QoE
   metric which is expressed as a MOS ("Mean Opinion Score"), MOS is on
   a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents excellent and 1 represents
   unacceptable.  MOS scores are usually obtained using subjective
   testing or using objective algorithm to estimate the multimedia
   quality.  However Subjective testing is not suitable for measuring
   the multimedia quality since the results may vary from test to test.
   Therefore using objective algorithm to calculate MOS scores is
   recommended.  ITU-T recommendation [G.1082][P.NAMS][P.NBAMS] defines
   a methodology for verifying the performance of QoE estimation
   algorithms for video and audio.  Hence this document recommends
   vendors and implementers to use these International Telecommunication
   Union (ITU)-specified methodologies to measure parameters when
   possible.


4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
   carried in the first part of the header.  Not all parameters need to
   be reported in each block.  Flags indicate which are and which are
   not reported.  The fields corresponding to unreported parameters MUST
   be present, but are set to zero.  The receiver MUST ignore any
   Perceptual Quality Metrics Block with a non-zero value in any field
   flagged as unreported.

   The Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Block has the following
   format:

4.2.  Definition of Fields in Multimedia Quality Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The Perceptual Quality Metrics Block is identified by the constant
      <SMQM>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Basic Loss/Discard
      metrics are Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).

   MoS Class (MC): 4 bits

      This field is used to indicate the MOS type to be reported.  The
      MOS type is defined as follows:

         0000 MOS-A - Audio Quality MOS [G.107][P.564].
         0001 MOS-V - Video Quality MOS [P.NAMS][P.NBAMS].
         0010 MOS-AV - Audio-Video Quality MOS[P.NAMS][P.NBAMS].
         0100~1111 - Reserved for future definitions.

      If new MOS types are defined, they can be added by an update to
      this document.  If the receiver does not understand the MOS type
      defined in this document it should discard this report.

   Rsd.:3 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

Internet-Draft        RTCP XR Quality Report Blocks       September 2011


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   MOS Value: 32 bits

      The estimated mean opinion score for Audio Qulity, Video Quality
      or Audio-Video quality is defined as including the effects of
      delay and other effects that would affect Audio-Video quality
      [G.1082][P.NAMS][P.NBAMS].  It is expressed as an integer in the
      range 10 to 50, corresponding to MOS x 10, as for MOS.  A value of
      127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable.  Values other
      than 127 and the valid range defined above MUST NOT be sent and
      MUST be ignored by the receiving system.



5.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameter is defined for the report block defined in this
   document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  It has the
   following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute [RFC3611]:

   rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                     [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
         xr-format = multimedia-quality-metrics
            multimedia-quality-metrics = "multimedia-quality-metrics"
                                  ["=" stat-flag *("," stat-flag)]
               stat-flag = "Interval Metrics"
                            /"Cumulative metrics"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns one new block type value in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

   This document also registers one new SDP [RFC4566] parameter for the
   "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:
