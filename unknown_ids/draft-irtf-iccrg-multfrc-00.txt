                  MulTFRC: TFRC with weighted fairness
                    draft-irtf-iccrg-multfrc-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies the MulTFRC congestion control mechanism.
   MulTFRC is derived from TFRC and can be implemented by carrying out a
   few small and simple changes to the original mechanism.  Its behavior
   differs from TFRC in that it emulates a number of TFRC flows with
   more flexibility than what would be practical or even possible using
   multiple real TFRC flows.  Additionally, MulTFRC better preserves the
   original features of TFRC than multiple real TFRCs do.

1.  Introduction

   "TCP-friendliness", the requirement for a flow to behave under
   congestion like a flow produced by a conformant TCP (introduced by
   the name of "TCP-compatibility" in [RFC2309]), has been put into
   question in recent years (cf. [Bri07]).  As an illustrative example,
   consider the fact that not all data transfers are of equal importance
   to a user.  A user may therefore want to assign different priorities
   to different flows between two hosts, but TCP(-friendly) congestion
   control would always let these flows use the same sending rate.
   Users and their applications are now already bypassing TCP-
   friendliness in practice: since multiple TCP flows can better
   saturate a bottleneck than a single one, some applications open
   multiple connections as a simple workaround.  The "GridFTP" [All03]
   protocol explicitly provides this function as a performance
   improvement.

   Some research efforts were therefore carried out to develop protocols
   where a weight can directly be applied to the congestion control
   mechanism, allowing a flow to be as aggressive as a number of
   parallel TCP flows at the same time.  The first, and best known, such
   protocol is MulTCP [Cro+98], which emulates N TCPs in a rather simple
   fashion.  Improved versions were later published, e.g.  Stochastic
   TCP [Hac+04] and Probe-Aided (PA-)MulTCP [Kuo+08].  These protocols
   could be called "N-TCP-friendly", i.e. as TCP-friendly as N TCPs.

   MulTFRC, defined in this document, does with TFRC [RFC5348] what
   MulTCP does with TCP.  In [Dam+09], it was shown that MulTFRC
   achieves its goal of emulating N flows better than MulTCP (and
   improved versions of it) and has a number of other benefits.  For
   instance, MulTFRC with N=2 is more reactive than two real TFRC flows
   are, and it has a smoother sending rate than two real MulTFRC flows
   do.  Moreover, since it is only one mechanism, a protocol that uses
   MulTFRC can send a single data stream with the congestion control
   behavior of multiple data streams without the need to split the data
   and spread it over separate connections.  Depending on the protocol
   in use, N real TFRC flows can also be expected to have N times the
   overhead for, e.g., connection setup and teardown, of a MulTFRC flow
   with the same value of N.

   The core idea of TFRC is to achieve TCP-friendliness by explicitly
   calculating an equation which approximates the steady-state
   throughput of TCP and sending as much as the calculation says.  The
   core idea of MulTFRC is to replace this equation in TFRC with the
   algorithm from [Dam+08], which approximates the steady-state
   throughput of N TCP flows.  MulTFRC can be implemented via a few
   simple changes to the TFRC code.  It is therefore defined here by
   specifying how it differs from the TFRC specification [RFC5348].

2.  Specification

   This section lists the changes to [RFC5348] that must be applied to
   turn TFRC into MulTFRC.  The small number of changes ensures that
   many original properties of a single TFRC flow are preserved, which
   is often the most appropriate choice (e.g. it would probably not make
   sense for a MulTFRC flow to detect a data-limited interval
   differently than a single TFRC flow would).  It also makes MulTFRC
   easy to understand and implement.  Experiments have shown that these
   changes are enough to attain the desired effect.

2.1.  Section 3 of RFC 5348

   While the TCP throughput equation requires the loss event rate,
   round-trip time and segment size as input, the algorithm to be used
   for MulTFRC additionally needs the number of packets lost in a loss
   event.  The equation, specified in [RFC5348] as

                                s
   X_Bps = ----------------------------------------------------------
           R*sqrt(2*b*p/3) + (t_RTO * (3*sqrt(3*b*p/8)*p*(1+32*p^2)))

   is replaced with the following algorithm, which returns X_Bps, the
   average transmit rate of N TCPs in bytes per second:

   If (N < 12) {
       af = N * (1-(1-1/N)^j);
   }
   Else {
       af = j;
   }
   af=max(min(af,ceil(N)),1);
   a = p*b*af*(24*N^2+p*b*af*(N-2*af)^2);
   x= (af*p*b*(2*af-N)+sqrt(a))/(6*N^2*p);
   q=min(2*j*b/(x*(1+3*N/j)),N);
   z=t_RTO*(1+32*p^2)/(1-p);
   q=min(q*z/(x*R),N);
   X_Bps = ((1-q/N)/(p*x*R)+q/(z*(1-p)))*s;


   Where:

      s is the segment size in bytes (excluding IP and transport
      protocol headers).

      R is the round-trip time in seconds.

      b is the maximum number of packets acknowledged by a single TCP
      acknowledgement.

      p is the loss event rate, between 0 and 1.0, of the number of loss
      events as a fraction of the number of packets transmitted.

      j is the number of packets lost in a loss event.

      t_RTO is the TCP retransmission timeout value in seconds.

      N is the number of TFRC flows that MulTFRC should emulate.  N is a
      positive rational number; a discussion of appropriate values for
      this parameter, and reasons for choosing them, is provided in
      Section 3.2.

      ceil(N) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to N.

      x, af, a, z and q are temporary floating point variables.

   Appendix A contains an argument that shows why the calculations in
   the algorithm will not overflow, underflow or produce significant
   rounding errors.

   Section 3.1 of [RFC5348] contains a recommendation for setting a
   parameter called t_RTO, and a simplification of the equation as a
   result of setting this parameter in a specific way.  This part of the
   TFRC specification is irrelevant here, as the t_RTO parameter no
   longer exists.  Section 3.1 of [RFC5348] also contains a discussion
   of the parameter b for delayed acknowledgements and concludes that
   the use of b=1 is RECOMMENDED.  This is also the case for MulTFRC.

   Section 3.2.2 of [RFC5348] specifies the contents of feedback
   packets.  In addition to the information listed there, a MulTFRC
   feedback packet also carries j, the number of packets lost in a loss
   event.

2.2.  Section 4 of RFC 5348

   The procedure for updating the allowed sending rate in section 4.3 of
   [RFC5348] ("action 4") contains the statement:

   Calculate X_Bps using the TCP throughput equation.

   which is replaced with the statement:

   If (p==1) {
       X_Bps=s/t_mbi;
   } Else {
       Calculate X_Bps using the algorithm defined in section 3.
   }

2.3.  Section 5 of RFC 5348

   Section 5.2 of [RFC5348] explains how a lost packet that starts a new
   loss event should be distinguished from a lost packet that is a part
   of the previous loss event interval.  Here, additionally the number
   of packets lost in a loss event is counted, and therefore this
   section is extended with:

   If S_new is a part of the current loss interval LP_0 (the number of
   lost packets in the current interval) is increased by 1.  On the
   other hand, if S_new starts a new loss event, LP_0 is set to 1.

   Section 5.4 of [RFC5348] contains the algorithm for calculating the
   average loss interval that is needed for calculation of the loss
   event rate, p.  MulTFRC also requires the number of lost packets in a
   loss event, j.  In [RFC5348] the calculation of the average loss
   interval is done using a filter that weights the n most recent loss
   event intervals, and setting n to 8 is RECOMMENDED.  The same
   algorithm is used here for calculating the average loss interval.
   For the number of lost packets in a loss event interval, j, the
   weighted average number of lost packets in the n most recent loss
   intervals is taken and the same filter is used.

   For calculating the average number of packets lost in a loss event
   interval we use the same loss intervals as for the p calculation.
   Let LP_0 to LP_k be the number of lost packets in the k most recent
   loss intervals.  The algorithm for calculating I_mean in Section 5.4
   of [RFC5348] (page 23) is extended by adding, after the last line ("p
   = 1 / I_mean;"):

   LP_tot = 0;
   If (I_tot0 > I_tot1) {
       for (i = 0 to k-1) {
             LP_tot = LP_tot + (LP_i * w_i);
       }
   }
   Else {
       for (i = 1 to k) {
             LP_tot = LP_tot + (LP_i * w_i);
       }
   }
   j = LP_tot/W_tot;

   In section 5.5 of [RFC5348] (page 25), the algorithm that ends with
   "p = min(W_tot0/I_tot0, W_tot1/I_tot1);" is extended by adding:

   LP_tot = 0;
   If (I_tot0 > I_tot1) {
       for (i = 0 to k-1) {
           LP_tot = Lp_tot + (LP_i * w_i * DF_i * DF);
       }
       j = LP_tot/W_tot0;
   }
   Else {
       for (i = 1 to k) {
           LP_tot = LP_tot + (LP_i * w_(i-1) * DF_i);
       }
       j = LP_tot/W_tot1;
   }


2.4.  Section 6 of RFC 5348

   The steps to be carried out by the receiver when a packet is received
   in section 6.1 of [RFC5348] ("action 4") contain the statement:

   3)  Calculate p: Let the previous value of p be p_prev.  Calculate
   the new value of p as described in Section 5.

   which is replaced with the statement:

   3)  Calculate p and j: Let the previous values of p and j be p_prev
   and j_prev.  Calculate the new values of p and j as described in
   Section 5.

   The steps to be carried out by the receiver upon expiration of
   feedback timer in section 6.2 of [RFC5348] ("action 1") contain the
   statement:

   1)  Calculate the average loss event rate using the algorithm
          described in Section 5.

   which is replaced with:

   1)  Calculate the average loss event rate and average number of
   lost packets in a loss event using the algorithm described in
   Section 5.

   This statement is added at the beginning of the list of initial steps
   to take when the first packet is received, in section 6.3 of
   [RFC5348]:

   o  Set j = 0.

   Section 6.3.1 of [RFC5348] discusses how the loss history is
   initialized after the first loss event.  TFRC approximates the rate
   to be the maximum value of X_recv so far, assuming that a higher rate
   introduces loss.  Therefore j for this rate is approximated by 1 and
   the number of packets lost in the first interval is set to 1.  This
   is accomplished by the following change.  The first sentence of the
   fourth paragraph (in section 6.3.1) is:

   TFRC does this by finding some value, p, for which the throughput
   equation in Section 3.1 gives a sending rate within 5% of X_target,
   given the round-trip time R, and the first loss interval is then set
   to 1/p.

   which is replaced with:

   TFRC does this by finding some value, p, for which the throughput
   equation in Section 3.1 gives a sending rate within 5% of X_target,
   given the round-trip time R, and j equal to 1. The first loss
   interval is then set to 1/p.

   The second last paragraph in section 6.3.1 ends with:

   Thus, the TFRC receiver calculates the loss interval that would be
   required to produce the target rate X_target of 0.5/R packets per
   second, for the round-trip time R, and uses this synthetic loss
   interval for the first loss interval.  The TFRC receiver uses 0.5/R
   packets per second as the minimum value for X_target when
   initializing the first loss interval.


   which is replaced with:

   Thus, the TFRC receiver calculates the loss interval that would be
   required to produce the target rate X_target of 0.5/R packets per
   second, for the round-trip time R, and for j equal to 1. This
   synthetic loss interval is used for the first loss interval. The TFRC
   receiver uses 0.5/R packets per second as the minimum value for
   X_target when initializing the first loss interval.


2.5.  Section 8 of RFC 5348

   Section 8.1 explains details about calculating the original TCP
   throughput equation, which was replaced with a new algorithm in this
   document.  It is therefore obsolete.

2.6.  Appendix A of RFC 5348

   This section provides a terminology list for TFRC, which is extended
   as follows:

   N:  number of emulated TFRC flows.

   j:  number of packets lost in a loss event.


3.  Usage Considerations

   The "weighted fairness" service provided by a protocol using MulTFRC
   is quite different from the service provided by traditional Internet
   transport protocols.  This section intends to answer some questions
   that this new service may raise.

3.1.  Which applications could use MulTFRC?

   Like TFRC, MulTFRC is suitable for applications that require a
   smoother sending rate than standard TCP.  Since it is likely that
   these would be multimedia applications, TFRC has largely been
   associated with them (and [RFC5348] mentions "streaming media" as an
   example).  Since timely transmission is often more important for them
   than reliability, multimedia applications usually do not keep
   retransmitting packets until their successful delivery is ensured.
   Accordingly, TFRC usage was specified for the Datagram Congestion
   Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4342], but not for reliable data
   transfers.

   MulTFRC, on the other hand, provides an altogether different service.
   For some applications, a smoother sending rate may not be
   particularly desirable but might also not be considered harmful,
   while the ability to emulate the congestion control of N flows may be
   useful for them.  This could include reliable transfers such as the
   transmission of files.  Possible reasons to use MulTFRC for file
   transfers include the assignment of priorities according to user
   preferences, increased efficiency with N > 1, the implementation of
   low-priority "scavenger" services and resource pooling [Wis+08].

3.2.  Setting N

   N MUST be set at the beginning of a transfer; it MUST NOT be changed
   while a transfer is ongoing.  The effects of changing N during the
   lifetime of a MulTFRC session on the dynamics of the mechanism are
   yet to be investigated; in particular, it is unclear how often N
   could safely be changed, and how "safely" should be defined in this
   context.  Further research is required to answer these questions.



Welzl, et al.            Expires January 6, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   MulTFRC                       July 2010


   N is a positive floating point number which can also take values
   between 0 and 1, making MulTFRC applicable as a mechanism for what
   has been called a "Lower-than-Best-Effort" (LBE) service.  Since it
   does not reduce its sending rate early as delay increases, as some
   alternative proposals for such a service do (e.g.  TCP-LP [Kuz+06],
   TCP Nice [Ven+02] or 4CP [Liu+07]), it can probably be expected to be
   more aggressive than these mechanisms if they share a bottleneck at
   the same time.  This, however, also means that MulTFRC is less likely
   to be prone to starvation.  Values between 0 and 1 could also be
   useful if MulTFRC is used across multiple paths to realize resource
   pooling [Wis+08].

   Setting N to 1 is also possible.  In this case, the only difference
   between TFRC and MulTFRC is that the underlying model of TFRC assumes
   that all remaining packets following a dropped packet in a "round"
   (less than one round-trip time apart) are also dropped, whereas the
   underlying model of MulTFRC does not have this assumption.  Whether
   it is correct or not depends on the specific network situation; large
   windows and other queuing schemes than Drop-Tail make it less likely
   for the assumption to match reality.  This document does not make any
   recommendation about which mechanism to use if only one flow is
   desired.

   Since TCP has been extensively studied, and the aggression of its
   congestion control mechanism is emulated by TFRC, we can look at the
   behavior of a TCP aggregate in order to find a reasonable upper limit
   for N in MulTFRC.  From [Alt+06], N TCPs (assuming non-sychronized
   loss events over connections) can saturate a bottleneck link by
   roughly 100-100/(1+3N) percent.  This means that a single flow can
   only achieve 75% utilization, whereas 3 flows already achieve 90%.
   The theoretical gain that can be achieved by adding a flow declines
   with the total number of flows - e.g., while going from 1 to 2 flows
   is a 14.3% performance gain, the gain becomes less than 1% beyond 6
   flows (which already achieve 95% link utilization).  Since the link
   utilization of MulTFRC can be expected to be roughly the same as the
   link utilization of multiple TCPs, the approximation above also holds
   for MulTFRC.  Thus, setting N to a much larger value than the values
   mentioned above will only yield a marginal benefit in isolation but
   can significantly affect other traffic.  Therefore, the maximum value
   that a user can set for MulTFRC SHOULD NOT exceed 6.

   Note that the model in [Alt+06], and hence the above discussion,
   considers the long-term steady-state behavior of TCP, which may not
   always be seen when the bandwidth*delay product is very large
   [RFC3649].  This is due to TCP's slow congestion window growth in the
   congestion avoidance phase.  While a MulTFRC flow with N > 1 can
   generally be expected to outperform a single standard TCP flow if N
   is large enough, such usage of MulTFRC is not recommended as a fix to

   the problem of saturating very large bandwidth*delay product paths:
   in order to always achieve good bottleneck utilization with MulTFRC
   under such conditions, N would have to be a function of the
   bandwidth*delay product.  In other words, the mechanism does not
   scale with bandwidth and delay; very large bandwidth or delay values
   may require very large values for N, leading to a behavior which is
   overly aggressive but possibly worse in terms of performance than
   mechanisms such as HighSpeed TCP [RFC3649], which are specifically
   designed for such situations.  The same argument applies for running
   multiple TCP flows, as in [All03].


4.  Security Considerations

   It is well known that a single uncontrolled UDP flow can cause
   significant harm to a large number of TCP flows that share the same
   bottleneck.  This potential danger is due to the total lack of
   congestion control in UDP.  Because this problem is well known, and
   because UDP is easy to detect, UDP traffic will often be rate limited
   by service providers.

   If MulTFRC is used within a protocol such as DCCP, which will
   normally not be considered harmful and will therefore typically not
   be rate-limited, its tunable aggression could theoretically make it
   possible to use it for a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.  In order to
   avoid such usage, the maximum value of N MUST be restricted.  If, as
   recommended in this document, the maximum value for N is restricted
   to 6, the impact of MulTFRC on TCP is roughly the same as the impact
   of 6 TCP flows would be.  It is clear that the conjoint congestion
   control behavior of 6 TCPs is far from being such an attack.

   With transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP or DCCP, users can already
   be more aggressive than others by opening multiple connections.  If
   MulTFRC is used within a transport protocol, this effect becomes more
   pronounced - e.g., 2 connections with N set to 6 for each of them
   roughly exhibit the same congestion control behavior as 12 TCP flows.
   The N limit SHOULD therefore be implemented as a system wide
   parameter such that the sum of the N values of all MulTFRC
   connections does not exceed it.  Alternatively, the number of
   connections that can be opened could be restricted.

Appendix A.  X_Bps implementation considerations

   In this appendix we show why the algorithm for calculating X_Bps in
   Section 2.1 contains integer and floating point arithmetic that will
   not give underflow, overflow or rounding errors that will adversely
   affect the result of the algorithm.  Note that the algorithm is not
   invoked when p == 1. p is computed in section 5.4 of [RFC5348].  If p
   is equal to 1 there is exactly one packet in each loss interval (and
   this will be an ECN-marked packet).

   Assuming that the rest of the parameters are not outside their
   conceivable values, the calculation of X_Bps in Section 2.1 could
   lead to arithmetic errors or large imprecision only if p is very
   close to 1.  However this will never happen because p is calculated
   as 1/I_mean in section 5.4 of [RFC5348].  The algorithm that
   calculates I_mean does so by a weighted average of the number of

   packets in the last n loss events.  If n == 8 and the weights are set
   as defined in [RFC5348], the smallest possible value of I_mean will
   be 1.033333.  The reason for this is that the number of packets in a
   loss event is a positive integer and the smallest value (not equal to
   1) is found when all recent intervals are of length 1, but the oldest
   interval (number 8 in this case) is of length two.  All other sizes
   of loss intervals and smaller values of n will give higher values for
   I_mean and hence lower values for p.

   Below we analyze the algorithm that calculates X_Bps, and see that it
   will always execute without any overflow, underflows or large
   rounding errors.  In this analysis we assume that no parameter has an
   improper value.  We say that a calculation is "sound" when no
   overflow, underflow or significant rounding may occur during the
   calculation.

   In the first lines of the algorithm, af is calculated, and it is easy
   to see that the calculation is sound and that the value of af will
   end up between 1 and N+1.  In the calculation of a, N may be equal to
   or close to af/2, and then the expression (p*b*af*(N-2*af)^2) may
   evaluate to a number very close to 0.  However, (24*N^2) is added,
   and hence the calculation of a is sound, as the values of p, b and N
   are neither extremely small nor extremely large.  Note that a will be
   a smaller value when p is a smaller value.

   When x is calculated there will be no problem to find the root of a,
   and then add it to (af*p*b*(2*af-N)), which again might be a very
   small value.  The final calculation of x involves a division by
   (6*p*N^2).  However when p is small, the dividend is not very large
   (dominated by p and a), hence the calculation of x is sound and the
   result will neither be a very large nor a very small number.
   However, we need to show that x will not be 0 or negative, otherwise
   the algorithm will try a division by 0, or, if x is negative, the
   calculation of X_Bps could turn out to be a negative value.

   We show that x is a positive rational number (and not 0) by defining
   W=p*b*af, Y=2*af-N and D=6*N^2*p.  Then the assignment to x can be
   written as x= (W*Y + sqrt(W*24*N^2 + W^2 * (-Y)^2 )) / D. If we
   subtract W*24*N^2 from the argument to the sqrt-function, we get an
   expression that is obviously smaller, hence after the assignment to
   x, this inequality holds: x > (W*Y + sqrt(W^2 * (-Y)^2) ) / D.
   Simplifying the right hand side gives: x > (W*Y - W*Y) / D, that is:
   x > 0.

   From this argument it is also clear that x is not close to 0, so that
   the divisons by x (or x*R) that we will see later in the algorithm
   will give a sound result.  Since neither x nor j is 0, or close to 0,
   when the right hand side in the first assignment to q is executed,

   the calculation of the first parameter to the min function is sound.
   Then z is found by division by 1-p, witch is sound when p is not
   close to 1 (which we have argued above it is not).  When q is
   assigned a value the second time, again the calculation of the first
   parameter of the min function is sound because x*R is not a value
   close to 0.

   Finally X_Bps is calculated and since p is not close to one (and
   hence (1-p) is not close to 0), and since (p*x*R) is not close to 0,
   this final calculation is also sound.
