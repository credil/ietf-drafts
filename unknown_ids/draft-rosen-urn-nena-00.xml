<abstract>
<t>This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform Resource Namespace (URN) resources published by National Emergency Number Association (NENA).  NENA defines and manages resources that utilize this URN name model.  Management activities for these and other resource types are provided by the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) Registry System (NRS).  For the processes that NRS uses to manage this and other registries, see NENA ??-???</t>

<section title="Introduction">	
<t>NENA is the "Voice of 9-1-1" in North America. NENA's mission is to foster the technological advancement, availability and implementation of a universal emergency telephone number system (9-1-1). In carrying out its mission, NENA promotes research, planning, training and education. The protection of human life, the preservation of property, and the maintenance of general community security are among NENA's objectives. NENA serves as a link in the delivery of emergency services. 9-1-1 has, throughout its evolution, become recognized as an asset of the North American public.</t>
<t>NENA is currently in the process of setting standards, processes and procedures for the use of an IP-based Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) for all public safety entities in North America. This activity is supported by a membership composed of private and public sector entities that have an interest in 9-1-1 and public safety.   This effort, dubbed "Next Generation 9-1-1" (NG9-1-1) is based in large part on IETF standards for interactive media session establishment and emergency calling.
</t><t>
Some of the solutions being developed by NENA need XML namespaces that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  
To assure that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific Namespace ID (NID) for use by NENA was deemed 
appropriate.  Therefore, a full and complete registration will follow the namespace specification process as defined in 
<xref target="RFC3406"/>.</t>
</section>
<section title='URN Specification for "nena" NID'>
<figure><artwork>
Namespace ID:   
The NID "nena" is requested.

Registration Information:   
  registration version number: 1
  registration date: YYYY-MM-DD  [RFC Editor, please replace with the 
                                      data of publication of this RFC]

Declared registrant of the namespace:
  Registering organization
    Name:       National Emergency Number Association (NENA)
    Address:    4350 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 750
                Arlington, VA 22203-1695

Designated contact:
  Role:    NENA Registry Services Administrator
  Email:   nrs-admin@nena.org

Declaration of syntactic structure:
The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "nena" 
NID will have the following structure:

urn:nena:{NENAresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}
</artwork></figure><t>
where the "NENAresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
syntax requirements <xref target="RFC2141"/> and defines a specific class of resource
type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme that is 
covered by "ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming
requirements of <xref target="RFC2141"/>.
</t><t>
NENA maintains a naming authority, the National Emergency Number 
Association (NENA) Registration System (NRS) that will manage the
assignment of NENAresources" and the specific registration values
assigned for each resource class.  Other NENA Standards documents will
define the "ResourceSpecificStrings" for a given "NENAresource".
</t><t>
Relevant ancillary documentation:<vspace/>
The National Emergency Number Association Registration System (NRS)
provides information on the registered resources and the registrations
for each.  More information about NRS and the registration activities
and procedures to be followed are defined in "Managing Registries for
NENA Next Generation Data Elements Technical Standard Document", 
NENA 02-XXX, Version 1, DRAFT March 22, 2009, which is available at: 
http://www.nena.org/technical-standards. 
</t><t>
Identifier uniqueness considerations:<vspace/>
The NRS will manage resources using the "nena" NID and will be the 
authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
associated.  In the associated procedures, NRS will ensure the 
uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary
responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.
</t><t>
NENA may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only intended
for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.
</t><t>
Identifier persistence considerations:<vspace/>
NRS will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of the 
"nena" NID.  NRS will establish a registry for NENAresources. Each 
NENAresource will have a separate description in the registry and 
may have its own sub-registry.
</t><t>
The registries and information will be published and maintained by
NRS on its web site.
</t><t>
Process of identifier assignment:<vspace/>
NRS will provide procedures for registration of each type of resource
that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three types of 
registration activities:
<list style='numbers'>
         <t>Registered values associated with NENA specifications or
            services</t>
         <t>Registration of values or sub-registries to other
            entities</t>
         <t>Name models for use in experimental purposes</t>
</list></t><t>
Process for identifier resolution:<vspace/> 
The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.
</t><t>
Rules for Lexical Equivalence:<vspace/>
No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
<xref target="RFC2141"/> apply.
</t><t>
Conformance with URN Syntax:<vspace/>
	No special considerations.
</t><t>
Validation mechanism:<vspace/>
None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures 
implemented in support of NRS activities.
</t><t>
Scope:<vspace/>
	Global

<section title="Examples">
<t>The following examples are representative urns that could be
assigned by NRS.  They may not be the actual strings that would be assigned.</t>

<figure><artwork>
NENAresource "psaproute"
Syntax: "urn:nena.emergencyresponders:&lt;responder name&gt;"
ResourceSpecificString: simple string with name of responder,
                        defined in a sub-registry
Use: Defines the urn to be used for queries to an NG9-1-1 Emergency
Call Routing Function that provides URIs for responding agencies. 

Examples:
urn:nena.emergencyresponders:ambulance
urn:nena.emergencyresponders:fire
urn:nena.emergencyresponders:ambulance
urn:nena.emergencyresponders:police
urn:nena.emergencyresponders:poison
urn:nena.emergencyresponders:coastguard
urn:nena.emergencyresponders:marine

<section title="Namespace Considerations">
<t>The National Emergency Number Association is developing a variety of applications and services.  
Some of these services require that supporting information (e.g., data descriptions, attributes, etc.) be fully specified.  
For proper operation, descriptions of the needed supporting information must exist and be available in a unique, reliable, 
and persistent manner.  These dependencies provide the basis of need for namespaces, in one form or another.
</t><t>
As the National Emergency Number Association work is ongoing and covers many technical areas, the possibility of binding 
to various other namespace repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each object or description, as defined in NENA, could 
possibly be related to multiple different other namespaces, so further conflicts of association could occur.  
Thus the intent is to utilize the National Emergency Number Association Registration System, operated by NENA, as the 
naming authority for NENA-defined objects and descriptions.</t>
</section>
<section title="Community Considerations">
<t>The objects and descriptions required for services defined by NENA are generally available for use by other organizations.  
The National Emergency Number Association will provide access and support for name requests by these organizations.  
This support can be enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new objects and descriptions are produced.  
These will be enabled in a fashion similar to current IANA processes.</t>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>There are no additional security considerations other than those normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs 
in general.</t>
</section>
<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>This document adds a new entry in the urn-namespaces registry.  The namespace should be "nena".  The defining document 
is this RFC.   The entry can be found at:  http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any associated mirrors.</t>
