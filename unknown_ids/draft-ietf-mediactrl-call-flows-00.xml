	<!-- Intro -->
	<section title="Introduction" anchor="sec-intro">
		<t>
			This document provides a list of typical MEDIACTRL Media Control Channel Framework
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/> call flows.
			The motivation for this comes from our implementation experience
			with the framework and its protocol. This drove us to writing a simple
			guide to the use of the several interfaces between Application Servers
			and MEDIACTRL-based Media Servers and a base reference
			documentation for other implementors and protocol researchers.
		</t>
		<t>
			Following this spirit, this document covers several aspects of the
			interaction between Application Servers and Media Servers. However, in the
			context of this document, the call flows almost always depict the interaction
			between a single Application Server (which, for the sake of conciseness,
			is called AS from now on) and a single Media Server (MS). To ease the understanding
			of all the flows (for what concerns both SIP dialogs and CFW transactions),
			the domains hosting the AS and the MS in all the scenarios are called,
			respectively, 'cicciopernacchio.com' and 'pippozzoserver.org'.
		</t>
		<t>
			In the next paragraphs a brief overview of our implementation approach
			is described, with particular focus on protocol-related
			aspects. This involves state diagrams for what concerns both the client side
			(the AS) and the server side (the MS). Of course, this section is not at all to be
			considered a mandatory approach to the implementation of the framework. It
			is only meant to ease the understanding of how the framework works from
			a practical point of view.
		</t>
		<t>
			Once done with these preliminary considerations, in the subsequent sections
			real-life scenarios are faced. In this context, first of all, the establishment
			of the Control Channel is dealt with: after that, some use case
			scenarios, involving the most typical multimedia applications, are depicted
			and described.
		</t>
		<t>
			It is worth pointing out that this document is not meant in any way to be
			a self-sustained guide to implementing a MEDIACTRL-compliant framework. The specifications
			are a mandatory read for all implementors, especially considering that this
			document by itself follows their guidelines but does not delve into the
			details of every aspect of the protocol.

	<section title="A Practical Approach" anchor="sec-overview-implementation">
		<t>
			In this document we embrace an engineering approach to the description of a 
			number of interesting scenarios that can be realized through the careful
			orchestration of the Media Control Channel Framework entities, namely the
			Application Server and the Media Server. We will demonstrate, through detailed
			call flows, how a variegated bouquet of services (ranging from very simple scenarios
			to much more complicated ones) can be implemented with the functionality currently
			offered, within the main MEDIACTRL framework, by the control packages that have
			been made available to date.
			
			The document aims at representing a useful guide for those interested in 
			investigating the inter-operation among MEDIACTRL components, as well as
			for application developers willing to build advanced services on top of 
			the base infrastructure made available by the framework.  
		</t>
		<section title="State Diagrams" anchor="sec-overview-state">
			<t>
				In this section we present an "informal" view of the main MEDIACTRL protocol
				interactions, in the form of state diagrams. Each diagram is indeed a classical
				representation of a Mealy automaton, comprising a number of
				possible protocol states, indicated with rectangular boxes. Transitions between
				states are indicated through edges, with each edge labeled with a slash-separated
				pair representing a specific input together with the associated output (a dash in
				the output position means that, for that particular input, no output is generated
				from the automaton). Some of the inputs are associated with MEDIACTRL protocol 
				messages arriving at a MEDIACTRL component while it is in a certain state: this
				is the case of 'CONTROL', 'REPORT' (in its various "flavors" -- pending, terminate, etc.),
				'200', '202', as well as 'Error'. Further inputs represent triggers arriving at the
				MEDIACTRL automaton from the upper layer, namely the Application Programming Interface
				used by programmers while implementing MEDIACTRL-enabled services: such inputs have
				been indicated with the term 'API' followed by the message that the API itself is 
				triggering (as an example, 'API terminate' is a request to send a 'REPORT' message with
				a status of 'terminate' to the peering component).
				
				Four diagrams are provided, which
				can be divided in two main categories, associated, respectively, with normal
				operation of the framework (<xref target="fig-state-ms"/> and <xref target="fig-state-as"/>) 
				and with asynchronous event notifications (<xref target="fig-state-event"/>).
				
				As to the former category, in <xref target="fig-state-ms"/> we embrace the MS perspective, 
				whereas in <xref target="fig-state-as"/> we stand on the AS side. The latter category is dealt 
				with in <xref target="fig-state-event"/>, which illustrates how notifications are managed.
				In particular, the upper part of the figure shows how events are generated, on the MS side, 
				by issuing a CONTROL message addressed to the AS; events are acknowledged by the AS through
				standard 200 responses. Hence, the behavior of the AS, which mirrors that of the MS, is 
				depicted in the lower part of the picture.
				
				Coming back to <xref target="fig-state-ms"/>, the diagram shows that the MS activates
				upon reception of CONTROL messages coming from the AS, which typically instruct it about
				the execution of a specific command, belonging to one of the available control packages.
				The execution of the received command can either be quick, or require some time. In the 
				former case, right after completing its operation, the MS sends back to the AS a 200
				message, which basically acknowledges correct termination of the invoked task. In the 
				latter case, the MS first sends back an interlocutory 202 message, which lets it enter
				a different state ('202' sent). While in the new state, the MS keeps on performing the
				invoked task: if such task does not complete in a predefined timeout, the server will 
				update the AS on the other side of the control channel by periodically issuing 'REPORT/update'
				messages; each such message has to be acknowledged by the AS (through a '200' response).
				Eventually, when the MS is done with the required service, it sends to the AS a 'REPORT/terminate'
				message, whose acknowledgment receipt concludes a transaction. Again, the AS behavior, depicted in 
				<xref target="fig-state-as"/>, mirrors the above described actions undertaken at the MS side.
				Figures also show the cases in which transactions cannot be successfully completed due to
				abnormal conditions, which always trigger the creation and expedition of a specific 'Error'
				message.

	<section title="Control Channel Establishment" anchor="sec-comedia">
		<t>
			As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>,
			the preliminary step to any interaction between
			an AS and a MS is the establishment of a control
			channel between the two. As explained in the next
			subsection, this is accomplished by
			means of a so-called COMEDIA <xref target="RFC4145"/>
			negotiation. This negotiation allows for a reliable
			connection to be created between the AS and the MS: it is here
			that the AS and the MS agree on the transport level protocol to
			use (TCP/SCTP) and whether any application level security
			is needed or not (e.g. TLS). For the sake of simplicity, we
			assume that an unencrypted TCP connection is negotiated between
			the two involved entities. Once they have connected, a SYNC message sent
			by the AS to the MS consolidates the control channel.

		<section title="COMEDIA Negotiation" anchor="sec-comedia-neg">
			<t>
				As a first step, the AS and the MS establish a
				Control SIP dialog. This is usually originated
				by the AS itself. The AS generates a SIP
				INVITE message containing in its SDP body
				information about the TCP connection it wants
				to establish with the MS. In the provided
				example (see <xref target="fig-comedia"/>
				and the attached call flow), the AS wants
				to actively open a new TCP connection, which
				on his side will be bound to port 5757.
				If the request is fine, the MS answers
				with its own offer, by communicating to the
				AS the transport address to connect to in
				order to establish the TCP connection.
				In the provided example, the MS will listen
				on port 7575. Once this negotiation
				is over, the AS can effectively connect
				to the MS.
			</t>
			<t>
				The negotiation includes additional attributes,
				the most important being the 'cfw-id' attribute,
				since it specifies the Dialog-ID which will be
				subsequently referred to by both the AS and the
				MS, as specified in the core framework draft.
			</t>
			<t>
				Note that the provided example also includes
				the indication, from both the AS and the MS,
				of the supported control packages. This is
				achieved by means of a series of 'ctrl-package'
				attributes as specified in
				<xref target="I-D.boulton-mmusic-sdp-control-package-attribute"/>.
				In the example, the AS supports (or is only
				interested to) two packages: IVR (Interactive Voice Response) and
				Mixer (Conferencing and Bridging). The MS replies with
				the list of packages it supports, by adding
				a dummy example package to the list provided
				by the AS. It is worth noting that this exchange
				of information is not meant as a strict or formal
				negotiation of packages: in case the AS realizes
				that one or more packages it needs are not
				supported according to the indications sent by
				the MS, it may, or may not, choose not to open a control channel
				with the MS at all, if its application logic leads
				to such a decision. The actual negotiation of control
				packages is done subsequenty through the use of
				the framework SYNC transaction.

				Once the AS and the MS have successfully
				established a TCP connection, an additional
				step is needed before the control channel
				can be used. In fact, as seen in the previous
				subsection, the first interaction between
				the AS and the MS happens by means of a
				SIP dialog, which in turns allows for the
				creation of the TCP connection. This
				introduces the need for a proper correlation
				between the above mentioned entities (SIP dialog and
				TCP connection), so that the MS can be sure
				the connection came from the AS which
				requested it. This is accomplished by
				means of a dedicated framework message
				called SYNC. This SYNC message makes
				use of a unique identifier called Dialog-ID
				to validate the control channel. This identifier,
				as introduced in the previous paragrah, is
				meant to be globally unique and as such
				is properly generated by the caller (the AS in the
				call flow), and added as an SDP media attribute
				(cfw-id) to the COMEDIA negotiation in order
				to make both entities aware of its value:

							]]>
					</artwork>
				</figure>
		        </t><t>
				Besides, it offers an
				additional negotiation mechanism.
				In fact, the AS uses the SYNC not only
				to properly correlate as explained before,
				but also to negotiate with the MS the
				control packages it is interested in,
				as well as to agree on a Keep-Alive timer
				needed by both the AS and the MS to
				understand if problems on the connection
				occur. In the provided example (see
				<xref target="fig-sync"/> and the related
				call flow), the AS sends a SYNC with a
				Dialog-ID constructed as needed (using the
				'cfw-id' attribute from the SIP dialog)
				and requests access to two control packages,
				specifically the IVR and the Mixer
				package (the same packages the AS previously
				indicated in its SDP as specified in
				<xref target="I-D.boulton-mmusic-sdp-control-package-attribute"/>,
				with the difference that this time they are
				reported in the context of a binding negotiation).
				Besides, it instructs the MS that a 100 seconds timeout
				is to be used for Keep-Alive messages. The MS
				validates the request by matching the
				received Dialog-ID with the SIP dialog
				values and, assuming it supports the
				control packages the AS requested access to
				(and for the sake of this document we assume
				it does), it answers with a 200 message.
				Additionally, the MS provides the AS with
				a list of other unrequested packages it supports (in this
				case just a dummy package providing testing functionality).

			Note well: this is only an example of a possible approach involving
			a 3PCC negotiation among the UAC, the AS and the MS, and as such is
			not at all to be considered as the mandatory way or as best common
			practice either in the presented scenario. <xref target="RFC3725"/> provides several
			different solutions and many details about how 3PCC can be realized,
			with pros and cons.			
		</t>
		<t>
			The UAC first places a call to a SIP URI the AS is responsible of.
			The specific URI is not relevant to the examples, since the application
			logic behind the mapping between a URI and the service it provides
			is a matter that is important only to the AS: so, a generic
			&apos;sip:mediactrlDemo@cicciopernacchio.com&apos; is used in all the examples, whereas
			the service this URI is associated with in the AS logic is mapped
			scenario by scenario to the case under exam. The UAC INVITE is treated
			as envisaged in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-architecture"/>: the
			INVITE is forwarded by the AS to the MS in a 3PCC fashion, without the SDP
			provided by the UAC being touched, so to have the session fully negotiated
			by the MS for what concerns its description. The MS matches the UAC's offer
			with its own capabilities and provides its answer in a 200 OK. This answer
			is then forwarded, again without the SDP contents being touched, by the
			AS to the UAC it is intended for. This way, while the SIP signaling from
			the UAC is terminated in the AS, all the media would start flowing directly
			between the UAC and the MS.
		</t>
		<t>
			As a consequence of this negotiation, one or more media connections are
			created between the MS and the UAC. They are then addressed, when needed,
			by the AS and the MS by means of the tags concatenation as specified in
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>. How the identifiers
			are created and addressed is explained by making use of the sample signaling
			provided in <xref target="fig-uac2as2ms-sip"/>.

			very important considering the AS is responsible for all the business logic of

					The first, obvious difference that comes out when looking at the diagram is that,
					unlike what happened in the Direct Echo example, the MS does not reply with a 200
					message to the CONTROL request originated by the AS. Instead, a 202 provisional message
					is sent first, followed by a REPORT message. The 202+REPORT(s) mechanism is used
					whenever the MS wants to tell the AS that the requested operation might take some
					more time than expected. So, while the &lt;join&gt; operation in the Direct Echo
					scenario was expected to be fulfilled in a very short time, the IVR request was
					assumed to last longer instead. A 202 message provides a timeout value and
					tells the AS to wait a bit, since the preparation of the dialog might not be an
					immediate task. In this example, the preparation ends before the timeout, and so
					the transaction is concluded with a 'REPORT terminate', which acts as the 200
					message in the previous example. In case the preparation took longer than the
					timeout, an additional 'REPORT update' would have been sent with a new timeout
					value, and so on until completion by means of a 'REPORT terminate'.
				</t>
				<t>
					About the dialog itself, notice how the
					AS-originated CONTROL transactions are terminated as soon as the requested dialogs
					start: as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-ivr-control-package"/>,
					the MS makes use of a framework CONTROL message to report the result of the dialog
					and how it has proceeded. The two transactions (the AS-generated CONTROL request and
					the MS-generated CONTROL event) are correlated by means of the associated dialog
					identifier, as it will be clearer from the following lines.
					As before, all the transaction steps have been numbered to ease the understanding
					and the following of the subsequent explanation lines. Besides, the two transactions
					are distinguished by the preceding letter (A,B=recording, C,D=playout).
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>The AS, as a first transaction, invokes a recording on the UAC
						connection by means of a CONTROL request (A1); the body is for the IVR
						package (msc-ivr/1.0), and requests the start (dialogstart) of
						a new recording context (&lt;record&gt;); the recording
						must be preceded by an announcement (&lt;prompt&gt;), must not last longer
						than 10s (maxtime), and cannot be interrupted by a DTMF tone (dtmfterm=false);
						this has only to be done once (repeatCount), which means that if the recording
						does not succeed the first time, the transaction must fail; a video recording
						is requested (type), which is to be fed by both the negotiated media streams;
						a beep has to be played (beep) right before the recording starts to
						notify the UAC;</t>
						<t>As seen before, the MS sends a provisional 202 response, to let the AS know
						the operation might need some time;</t>
						<t>In the meanwhile, the MS prepares the dialog (e.g. by retrieving the
						announcement file, for which a HTTP URL is provided, and by checking that
						the request is well formed) and if all is fine it starts it, notifying the
						AS about it with a new REPORT (A3) with a terminated status; as explained
						previously, interlocutory REPORT messages with an update status would have
						been sent in case the preparation took longer than the timeout provided in the
						202 message (e.g. if retrieving the resource via HTTP took longer than expected);
						once the dialog has been prepared and started, the UAC connection
						is then passed to the IVR package, which first plays the announcement on the
						connection, followed by a beep, and then records all the incoming frames to
						a buffer; the MS also provides the AS with an unique dialog identifier (dialogid)
						which will be used in all subsequent event notifications concerning the
						dialog it refers to;</t>
						<t>The AS acks the latest REPORT (A4), thus terminating this transaction,
						waiting for the result to come;</t>
						<t>Once the recording is over, the MS prepares a notification CONTROL (B1); the &lt;event&gt;
						body is prepared with an explicit reference to the previously provided dialogid identifier,
						in order to make the AS aware of the fact that the notification is related to that specific
						dialog; the event body is then completed with the recording related information (&lt;recordinfo&gt;)
						, in this case the path to the recorded file (here a HTTP URL) which can be used
						by the AS for whatever it needs to; the payload also contains information about the prompt
						(&lt;promptinfo&gt;), which is however not relevant to the scenario;</t>
						<t>The AS concludes this first recording transaction by acking the
						CONTROL event (B2).</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
					Now that the first transaction has ended, the AS has the 10s recording of
					the UAC talking. It can let the UAC hear it by having the MS play it to the
					MS as an announcement:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>The AS, as a second transaction, invokes a playout on the UAC
							connection by means of a new CONTROL request (C1); the body is once againg
							for the IVR package (msc-ivr/1.0), but this time it
							requests the start (dialogstart) of a new announcement context
							(&lt;prompt&gt;); the file to be played is the one
							recorded before (prompts), and has only to be played once (iterations);</t>
						<t>Again, the usual provisional 202 (C2) takes place;</t>
						<t>In the meanwhile, the MS prepares the new dialog and starts it, notifying the
							AS about it with a new REPORT (C3) with a terminated status: the connection
							is then passed to the IVR package, which plays the file on it;</t>
						<t>The AS acks the terminating REPORT (C4), now waiting for the announcement to end;</t>
						<t>Once the playout is over, the MS sends a CONTROL event (D1) which
							contains in its body (&lt;promptinfo&gt;) information about
							the just concluded announcement; as before, the proper dialogid is
							used as a reference to the correct dialog;</t>
						<t>The AS concludes this second and last transaction by acking the
							CONTROL event (D2).</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
					As in the previous paragraph, the whole CFW interaction is provided for a
					more in depth evaluation of the protocol interaction.

			<t>
				Another scenario that might involve the interaction between an AS and a MS
				is the classic phone call between two UACs. In fact, even though the most
				straightforward way to achieve this would be to let the UACs negotiate
				the session and the media to make use of between themselves, there are
				cases when the services provided by a MS might prove useful for phone
				calls as well.
			</t>
			<t>
				One of these cases is when the two UACs have no common supported codecs:
				having the two UACs directly negotiate the session would result in a
				session with no available media. Involving the MS as a transcoder would
				instead allow the two UACs to communicate anyway. Another interesting
				case is when the AS (or any other entity the AS is working in behalf of)
				is interested in manipulating or monitoring the media session between
				the UACs, e.g. to record the conversation: a similar scenario will be
				dealt with in <xref target="sec-call-conf"/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				Before proceeding in looking at how such a scenario might be accomplished
				by means of the Media Control Channel Framework, it is worth spending a couple of
				words upon how the SIP signaling involving all the interested parties
				might look like. In fact in such a scenario a 3PCC approach is absolutely
				needed. An example is provided in <xref target="fig-call-3pcc"/>. Again, the
				presented example is not at all to be considered best common practice when
				3PCC is needed in a MediaCtrl-based framework. It is only described in order
				to let the reader more easily understand what are the requirements on the
				MS side, and as a consequence which information might be required.
				<xref target="RFC3725"/> provides a much more detailed overview on
				3PCC patterns in several use cases. Only an explanatory sequence diagram
				is provided, without delving into the details of the exchanged SIP messages.

				In the example, the UAC1 wants to place a phone call to UAC2. To do so,
				it sends an INVITE to the AS with its offer A. The AS sends an offerless
				INVITE to UAC2. When the UAC2 responds with a 180, the same message is
				forwarded by the AS to the UAC1 to notify it the callee is ringing. In
				the meanwhile, the AS also adds a leg to the MS for UAC1, as explained
				in the previous sections: to do so it of course makes use of the offer A
				the UAC1 made. Once the UAC2 accepts the call, by providing its own offer
				B in the 200, the AS adds a leg for it too to the MS. At this point,
				the negotiation can be completed by providing the two UACs with the
				SDP answer negotiated by the MS with them (A' and B' respectively).
			</t>
			<t>
				This is only one way to deal with the signaling, and shall not absolutely
				be considered as a mandatory approach of course.
			</t>
			<t>
				Once the negotiation is over, the two UACs are not in communication yet.
				In fact, it's up to the AS now to actively trigger the MS into attaching
				their media streams to each other someway, by referring to the connection
				identifiers associated with the UACs as explained previously. This document
				presents two different approaches that might be followed, according to what
				needs to be accomplished. A generic media perspective of the phone call
				scenario is depicted in <xref target="fig-call-rtp"/>: the MS is
				basically in the media path between the two UACs.

					The framework transactions needed to accomplish this 
					scenario are very trivial and easy to understand. They
					basically are the same as the ones presented in the 
					Direct Echo Test scenario, with the only difference
					being in the provided identifiers. In fact, this time the MS
					is not supposed to attach the UACs' media connections
					to themselves, but has to join the media connections
					of two different UACs, i.e. UAC1 and UAC2. This means
					that, in this transaction, id1 and i2 will have to
					address the media connections of UAC1 and UAC2. In case
					of a successful transaction, the MS takes care of forwarding
					all media coming from UAC1 to UAC2 and vice versa, transparently
					taking care of any required transcoding steps, if necessary.

					Such a simple approach has its drawbacks. For instance, with such
					an approach recording a conversation between two users might be
					tricky to accomplish. In fact, since no mixing would be involved,
					only the single connections (UAC1&lt;-&gt;MS and UAC2&lt;-&gt;MS)
					could be recorded. If the AS wants a conversation recording service
					to be provided anyway, it needs additional business logic on its side.
					An example of such a use case is provided in <xref target="sec-call-record"/>.

			<section title="Conference-based Approach" anchor="sec-call-conf">
				<t>
					The approach described in <xref target="sec-call-direct"/> surely works for
					a basic phone call, but as already explained might have some drawbacks whenever
					more advanced features are needed.
					For intance, you can't record the whole conversation, only the single connections, since
					no mixing is involved. Besides, even the single task of playing an announcement over
					the conversation could be complex, especially if the MS does not support implicit mixing
					over media connections. For this reason, in more advanced cases a different approach
					might be taken, like the conference-based approach described in this section.
				</t>
				<t>
					The idea is to make use of a mixing entity in the MS that acts as a bridge between
					the two UACs: the presence of this entity allows for more
					customization on what needs to be done on the conversation, like the recording
					of the conversation that has been provided as an example. The approach is
					depicted in <xref target="fig-call-conf"/>. The mixing functionality in the MS
					will be described in more detail in the following section (which deals with many
					conference-related scenarios), so only some hints will be provided here for
					a basic comprehension of the approach.

					The AS makes use of two different packages to accomplish
					this scenario: the mixer package (to create the mixing
					entity and join the UACs) and the IVR package (to record
					what happens in the conference). The framework transaction
					steps can be described as follows:
				</t>
				<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>First of all, the AS creates a new hidden conference
					by means of a 'createconference' request (A1); this conference
					is properly configured according to the use it is assigned to;
					in fact, since only two participants will be joined to it, both
					'reserved-talkers' and 'reserved-listeners' are set to 2, just as
					the 'n' value for the N-best audio mixing algorithm; besides,
					the video layout as well is set accordingly (single-view/dual-view);</t>
					<t>the MS notifies the successful creation of the new conference in
					a 200 framework message (A2); the identifier assigned to the conference,
					which will be used in subsequent requests addressed to it, is 6013f1e;</t>
					<t>the AS requests a new recording upon the newly created conference; to
					do so, it places a proper request to the IVR package (B1); the AS is
					interested in a video recording (type=video/mpeg), which must not last
					longer than 3 hours (maxtime=1800s), after which the recording must end;
					besides, no beep must be played on the conference (beep=false), and the recording
					must start immediately whether or not any audio activity has been reported
					(vadinitial=false);</t>
					<t>the transaction is extended by the MS (B3), and when the dialog has been
					successfully started, a REPORT terminate is issued to the AS (B4); the message
					contains the dialogid associated with the dialog (00b29fb), which the AS
					must refer to for later notifications;</t>
					<t>at this point, the AS attaches both UACs to the conference with two
					separate 'join' directives (C1/D1); when the MS confirms the success of both
					operations (C2/D2), the two UACs are actually in contact with each other
					(even though indirectly, since a hidden conference they're unaware of is on
					their path) and their media contribution is recorded.</t>

				<t>The recording of the conversation can subsequently be accessed by the AS by waiting

				AS actively requests the recording to be interrupted since the call between the UACs ended).</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Recording a conversation" anchor="sec-call-record">
				<t>
					The previous section described how to take advantage of the conferencing
					functionality of the mixer package in order to allow the recording of
					phone calls in a simple way. However, making use of a dedicated mixer
					just for a phone call might be considered overkill. This section shows
					how recording a conversation and playing it out subsequently can be
					accomplished without a mixing entity involved in the call, that is by using the
					direct connection approach as described in <xref target="sec-call-direct"/>.
				</t>
				<t>
					As already explained previously, in case the AS wants to record a phone call
					between two UACs, the use of just the &lt;join&gt; directive without a mixer
					forces the AS to just rely on separate recording commands. That is, the
					AS can only instruct the MS to separately record the media flowing on each
					media leg: a recording for all the data coming from UAC1, and a different
					recording for all the data coming from UAC2. In case someone wants to access
					the whole conversation subsequently, the AS may take at least two different
					approaches:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>
							it may mix the two recordings itself (e.g. by delegating it to an
							offline mixing entity) in order to obtain a single file containing the
							combination of the two recordings; this way, a simple playout
							as described in <xref target="sec-echo-recording"/> would
							suffice;
						</t>
						<t>
							alternatively, it may take advantage of the mixing functionality
							provided by the MS itself; a way to do so is to create a hidden
							conference on the MS, attach the UAC as a passive participant
							to it, and play the separate recordings on the conference as
							announcements; this way, the UAC accessing the recording would
							experience both the recordings at the same time.
						</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
					It is of course option 2 that is considered in this section. The framework
					transaction as described in <xref target="fig-call-record"/> assumes that
					a recording has already been requested for both UAC1 and UAC2, that the
					phone call has ended and that the AS has successfully received the URIs
					to both the recordings from the MS. Such steps are not described again
					since they would be quite similar to the ones described in
					<xref target="sec-echo-recording"/>. As anticipated, the idea is to make
					use of a properly constructed hidden conference to mix the two separate
					recordings on the fly and present them to the UAC. It is of course up to
					the AS to subsequently unjoin the user from the conference and destroy
					the conference itself once the playout of the recordings ends for any reason.

					The diagram above assumes a recording of both the channels has already taken
					place. It may have been requested by the AS either shortly before joining UAC1
					and UAC2, or shortly after that transaction. Whenever that happened, a recording
					is assumed to have taken place, and so the AS is supposed to have both the
					recordings available for playback. Once a new user, UAC, wants to access the
					recorded conversation, the AS takes care of the presented transactions.
					The framework transaction steps are only apparently more complicated than
					the ones presented so far. The only difference, in fact, is that transactions
					C and D are concurrent, since the recordings must be played together.
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>First of all, the AS creates a new conference to act as a mixing entity (A1); the
						settings for the conference are chosen according to the use case, e.g. the video layout
						which is fixed to 'dual-view' and the switching type to 'controller'; when the conference
						has been successfully created (A2) the AS takes note of the conference identifier;</t>
						<t>At this point, the UAC is attached to the conference as a passive user (B1); there would
						be no point in letting the user contribute to the conference mix, since he will only
						need to watch a recording; in order to specify his passive status, both the audio
						and video streams for the user are set to 'recvonly'; in case the transaction succeeds,
						the MS notifies it to the AS (B2);</t>
						<t>Once the conference has been created and UAC has been attached to it, the AS can request
						the playout of the recordings; in order to do so, it requests two concurrent &lt;prompt&gt;
						directives (C1 and D1), addressing respectively the recording of UAC1 and UAC2; both the
						prompts must be played on the previously created conference and not to UAC directly, as
						can be deduced from the 'conferenceid' attribute of the &lt;dialog&gt; element;</t>
						<t>The transactions live their life exactly as explained for previous &lt;prompt&gt;
						examples; the originating transactions are first prepared and started (C2-4, D2-4),
						and then, as soon as any of the playout ends, a realted CONTROL message to notify
						this is triggered by the MS (E1, F1); the notification may contain a &lt;promptinfo&gt;
						element with information about how the playout proceeded (e.g. whether the playout
						completed normally, or interrupted by a DTMF tone, etc.).</t>

				One of the most important services the MS must be able to provide is mixing. This
				involves mixing media streams from different sources, and delivering the resulting
				mix(es) to each interested party, often according to per-user policies, settings
				and encoding. A typical scenario involving mixing is of course media conferencing.
				In such a scenario, the media sent by each participant is mixed, and each participant
				typically receives the overall mix excluding its own contribtion and encoded in
				the format it negotiated. This example points out in a quite clear way how mixing
				must take care of the profile of each involved entity.

				The next subsections will cover several typical scenarios involving mixing and
				conferencing as a whole, specifically:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>Simple Bridging, where the scenario will be a very basic (i.e. no &quot;special effects&quot;,
						just mixing involved) conference involving one or more participants;</t>
					<t>Rich Conference Scenario, which enriches the Simple Bridging scenario by adding additional
						features typically found in conferencing systems (e.g. DTMF collection for PIN-based conference
						access, private and global announcements, recordings and so on);</t>
					<t>Coaching Scenario, a more complex scenario which involves per-user mixing (customers, agents
						and coaches don't get all the same mixes);</t>
					<t>Sidebars Scenario, which adds more complexity to the previous conferencing scenarios by
						involving sidebars (i.e. separate conference instances that only exist within the
						context of a parent conference instance) and the custom media delivery that follows.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				All of the above mentioned scenarios depend on the availability of a mixing entity. Such an
				entity is provided in the Media Control Channel Framework by the conferencing package. This package
				in fact, besides allowing for the interconnection of media sources as seen in the
				Direct Echo Test section, enables the creation of abstract connections that can be joined to
				multiple connections: these abstract connections, called conferences, mix the contribution
				of each attached connection and feed them accordingly (e.g. a connection with 'sendrecv' property
				would be able to contribute to the mix and to listen to it, while a connection with a
				'recvonly' property would only be able to listen to the overall mix but not to actively
				contribute to it).
			</t>
			<t>
				That said, each of the above mentioned scenarios will start more or less in the same way: by the
				creation of a conference connection (or more than one, as needed in some cases) to be
				subsequently referred to when it comes to mixing. A typical framework transaction to
				create a new conference instance in the Media Control Channel Framework is depicted in
				<xref target="fig-conf-common-cfw"/>:

			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>The AS invokes the creation of a new conference instance by means of a CONTROL
					request (1); this request is addressed to the conferencing package (msc-mixer/1.0)
					and contains in the body the directive (createconference) with all the desired
					settings for it; in the example, the mixing policy is to mix the five (reserved-talkers)
					loudest speakers (nbest), while ten listeners at max are allowed; video settings are configured,
					including the mechanism used to select active video sources (controller, meaning the AS will
					explicitly instruct the MS about it) and details about the video layouts to make available; in this
					example, the AS is instructing the MS to use a single-view layout when only one video source is active,
					to pass to a quad-view layout when at least two video sources are active, and to use a 5x1 layout whenever
					the number of sources is at least five; finally, the AS also
					subscribes to the &quot;active-talkers&quot; event, which means it wants to be informed
					(at a rate of 4 seconds) whenever an active participant is speaking;</t>
					<t>The MS creates the conference instance assigning a unique identifier to it
						(6146dd5), and completes the transaction with a 200 response (2);</t>
					<t>At this point, the requested conference instance is active and ready to be used
						by the AS; it is then up to the AS to integrate the use of this identifier
						in its application logic.</t>

					As already introduced before, the simplest use an AS can make of a
					conference instance is simple bridging. In this scenario, the conference
					instance just acts as a bridge for all the participants that are attached
					to it. The bridge takes care of transcoding, if needed (in general,
					different participants may make use of different codecs for their streams),
					echo cancellation (each participant will receive the overall mix excluding
					its own contribution) and per-participant mixing (each participant may
					receive different mixed streams, according to what it needs/is allowed to
					send/receive). This assumes of course that each interested participant
					must be joined somehow to the bridge in order to indirectly communicate
					with the other paricipants. From the media perspective, the scenario
					can be seen as depicted in <xref target="fig-conf-simple"/>.

					In the framework, the first step is obviously to create a new conference
					instance as seen in the introductory section (<xref target="fig-conf-common-cfw"/>).
					Assuming a conference instance has already been created, bridging participants to
					it is quite straightforward, and can be accomplished as already seen in the
					Direct Echo Test Scenario: the only difference here is that each participant
					is not directly connected to itself (Direct Echo) or another UAC (Direct Connection)
					but to the bridge instead. <xref target="fig-conf-simple1-cfw"/> shows the
					example of two different UACs joining the same conference: the example, as usual, hides the
					previous interaction between each of the two UACs and the AS, and instead focuses
					on what the AS does in order to actually join the participants to the bridge so that
					they can interact in a conference.

					The framework transaction steps are actually quite trivial to
					understand, since they're very similar to some previously described
					scenarios. What the AS does is just joining both UAC1 (id1 in A1)
					and UAC2 (id1 in B1) to the conference (id2 in both transactions).
					As a result of these two operations, both UACs are mixed
					in the conference. Since no &lt;stream&gt; is explicitly provided
					in any of the transactions, all the media from the UACs (audio/video)
					are attached to the conference (as long as the conference has been
					properly configured to support both, of course).

					The directive used to modify an existing join configuration
					is &lt;modifyjoin&gt;, and its syntax is exactly the same
					as the one required in &lt;join&gt; instructions. In fact,
					the same syntax is used for identifiers (id1/id2). Whenever
					a modifyjoin is requested and id1 and id2 address one or
					more joined connections, the AS is requesting a change of
					the join configuration. In this case, the AS instructs the MS
					to mute (stream=audio, direction=recvonly) UAC1 (id1=UAC1)
					in the conference (id2) it has been attached to previously.
					Any other connection existing between them is left untouched.
				</t>
				<t>
					It is worth noticing that the &lt;stream&gt; settings are
					enforced according to both the provided direction AND
					the id1 and id2 identifiers. For instance, in this example
					id1 refers to UAC1, while id2 to the conference in the MS.
					This means that the required modifications have to be applied
					to the stream specified in the &lt;stream&gt; element of the
					message, along the direction which goes from 'id1' to 'id2' (as
					specified in the &lt;modifyjoin&gt; element of the message). In the provided example,
					the AS wants to mute UAC1 with respect to the conference.
					To do so, the direction is set to 'recvonly', meaning
					that, for what concerns id1, the media stream is only
					to be received. If id1 referred to the conference and
					id2 to the UAC1, to achieve the same result the direction
					would have to be set to 'sendonly', meaning 'id1 (the conference)
					can only send to id2 (UAC1), and no media stream must be received'.
					Additional settings upon a &lt;stream&gt; (e.g. audio volume,
					region assignments and so on) follow the same approach, as
					it is presented in subsequent sections.

					and recording of the whole conference), private and global announcements and so

					As it can be deduced from the sequence diagram above, the AS, in
					its business logic, correlates the results of different transactions,
					addressed to different packages, to implement a more complex
					conferencing scenario than the Simple Bridging previously described.
					The framework transaction steps are the following:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>Since this is a private conference, the UAC is to be presented with
						a request for a password, in this case a PIN number; to do so, the AS
						instructs the MS (A1) to collect a series of DTMF digits from the specified
						UAC (connectionid=UAC); the request includes both a voice message (&lt;prompt&gt;)
						and the described digit collection context (&lt;collect&gt;); the PIN is assumed
						to be a 4-digit number, and so the MS has to collect at max 4 digits (maxdigits=4);
						the DTMF digit buffer must be cleared before collecting (cleardigitbuffer=true) and
						the UAC can make use of the star key to restart the collection (escapekey=*), e.g.
						in case it is aware he miswrote any of the digits and wants to start again;</t>
						<t>the transaction goes on as usual (A2, A3, A4), with the transaction
						being extended, and the dialog start being notified in a REPORT terminate; after
						that, the UAC is actually presented with the voice message, and is subsequently
						requested to insert the required PIN number;</t>
						<t>we assume UAC wrote the correct PIN number (1234), which is reported by the MS
						to the AS by means of the usual MS-generated CONTROL event (B1); the AS correlates
						this event to the previously started dialog by checking the referenced dialogid
						(06d1bac) and acks the event (B2); it then extracts the information it needs from
						the event (in this case, the digits provided by the MS) from the &lt;controlinfo&gt;
						container (dtmf=1234) and verifies if it is correct;</t>
						<t>since the PIN is correct, the AS can proceed towards the next step, that is
						asking the UAC to state his name, in order to play the recording subsequently
						on the conference to report the new participant; again, this is done with a
						request to the IVR package (C1); the AS instructs the MS to play a voice message
						("say your name after the beep"), to be followed by a recording of only the audio
						from the UAC (in stream, media=audio/sendonly, while media=video/inactive); a beep
						must be played right before the recording starts (beep=true), and the recording
						must only last 3 seconds (maxtime=3s) since it is only needed as a brief announcement;</t>
						<t>without delving again into the details of a recording-related transaction (C2/C3/C4),
						the AS finally gets an URI to the requested recording (D1, acked in D2);</t>
						<t>at this point, the AS attaches the UAC (id1) to the conference (id2) just as explained for
						Simple Bridging (E1/E2);</t>
						<t>finally, to notify the other participants that a new participant has arrived, the AS
						requests a global announcement on the conference; this is a simple &lt;prompt&gt; request
						to the IVR package (F1) just as the ones explained in previous sections, but with
						a slight difference: the target of the prompt is not a connectionid (a media connection)
						but the conference itself (conferenceid=6146dd5); as a result of this transaction, the
						announcement would be played on all the media connections attached to the conference
						which are allowed to receive media from it; the AS specifically requests two media files
						to be played:
						<list style="numbers">
						<t>the media file containing the recorded name of the new user as retrieved in D1 ("Simon...");</t>
						<t>a pre-recorded media file explaining what happened ("... has joined the conference");</t>
						</list>
						the transaction then takes its usual flow (F2/F3/F4), and the event notifying the end
						of the announcement (G1, acked in G2) concludes the scenario.
						</t>
					</list>

					such a scenario, a customer (called A in the following example) places a call to
					a business call center. An agent (B) is assigned to the customer. Besides, a
					coach (C), unheard from the customer, provides the agent with whispered suggestions
					about what to say. This scenario is also described in RFC4579 <xref target="RFC4579"/>.
				</t>
				<t>
					As it can be deduced from the scenario description, per-user policies for media mixing
					and delivery, i.e who can hear what, are very important. The MS must make sure that
					only the agent can hear the coach's suggestions. Since this is basically a multiparty
					call (despite what the customer might be thinking), a mixing entity is needed in
					order to accomplish the scenario requirements. To summarize:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="symbols">
						<t>the customer (A) must only hear what the agent (B) says;</t>
						<t>the agent (B) must be able to hear both the customer (A) and the coach (C);</t>
						<t>the coach (C) must be able to hear both the customer (A), in order to give the
						right suggestions, and the agent (B), in order to be aware of the whole conversation.</t>
					</list>
				</t>
				<t>
					From the media and framework perspective, such a scenario
					can be seen as it is depicted in <xref target="fig-coach-rtp"/>.

					mixing and joining entities are needed. The needed steps can be summarized in
					the following list:
				</t>
				<t>
					<list style="numbers">
						<t>first of all, a hidden conference is created;</t>
						<t>then, all the three participants are attached to it, each with a custom mixing policy, specifically:
							<list style="symbols">
							<t>the customer (A) as 'sendonly';</t>
							<t>the agent (B) as 'sendrecv';</t>
							<t>the coach (C) as 'sendrecv' and with a -3dB gain to halve the volume of its own contribution (so that
							the agent actually hears the customer louder, and the coach whispering);</t>
							</list></t>
						<t>finally, the customer is joined to the agent as a passive receiver (recvonly).</t>
					</list>
				</t>

		<section title="Additional Scenarios" anchor="sec-bonus">
		<t>
			This section includes additional scenarios that can be of interest
			when dealing with AS&lt;-&gt;MS flows. The aim of the following subsections
			is to present the use of peculiar features provided by the IVR package,
			specifically variable announcements, VCR prompts, parallel playback, recurring
			dialogs and custom grammars. To describe how call flows involving such
			features might happen, three sample scenarios have been chosen:
		</t>
		<t>
			<list style="numbers">
				<t>Voice Mail (variable announcements for digits, VCR controls);</t>
				<t>Current Time (variable announcements for date and time, parallel playback).</t>
				<t>DTMF-driven Conference Manipulation (recurring dialogs, custom grammars).</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<section title="Voice Mail" anchor="sec-voicemail">
			<t>
				An application that typically makes use of the
				services an MS can provide is Voice Mail. In fact, while
				it is clear that many of its features are part of the
				application logic (e.g. the mapping of a URI with a
				specific user's voice mailbox, the list of messages
				and their properties, and so on), the actual media
				work is accomplished through the MS. Features needed
				by a VoiceMail application include the ability to
				record a stream and play it back anytime later,
				give verbose announcements regarding the status
				of the application, control the playout of
				recorded messages by means of VCR controls and so
				on, all features which are supported by the MS
				through the IVR package.
			</t>
			<t>
				Without delving into the details of a full VoiceMail
				application and all its possible use cases, this section
				will cover a specific scenario, trying to deal with
				as many interactions as possible that may happen
				between the AS and the MS in such a context. The
				covered scenario, depicted as a sequence diagram
				in <xref target="fig-voicemail-cfw"/>, will be the following:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>The UAC INVITEs a URI associated with his mailbox, and the AS follows
						the already explained procedure to have the UAC negotiate a new
						media session with the MS;</t>
					<t>The UAC is first prompted with an announcement giving him the amount of
						available new messages in the mailbox; after that, the UAC can choose
						which message to access by sending a DTMF tone;</t>
					<t>The UAC is then presented with a VCR controlled announcement, in which
						the chosen received mail is played back to him; VCR controls allow
						him to navigate through the prompt.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>This is a quite oversimplified scenario, considering it doesn't even allow the UAC
				to delete old messages or organize them, but just to choose which received
				message to play. Nevertheless, it gives us the chance
				to deal with variable announcements and VCR controls, two typical features a
				Voice Mail application would almost always take advantage of. Besides, other
				features a Voice Mail application would rely upon (e.g. recording streams,
				event driven IVR menus and so on) have aready been introduced in previous
				sections, and so representing them would be redundant. This means the presented
				call flows assume that some messages have already been recorded, and that they
				are available at reachable locations. The example also assumes that the AS has
				placed the recordings in its own storage facilities, considering it is not safe
				to rely upon the internal MS storage which is likely to be temporary.

				The framework transaction steps are described in the following:
			</t>
			<t>
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>The first transaction (A1) is addressed to the IVR package (msc-ivr); it is basically
				a 'promptandcollect' dialog, but with a slight difference: some of the prompts to
				play are actual audio files, for which a URI is provided (media loc="xxx"), while
				others are so-called 'variable' prompts; these 'variable' prompts are actually
				constructed by the MS itself according to the directives provided by the AS; in this
				example, this is the sequence of prompts that is requested by the AS:
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>play a wav file ("you have...");</t>
					<t>play a digit ("five..."), by building it (variable: digit=5);</t>
					<t>play a wav file ("messages...");</t>
				</list>
				a DTMF collection is requested as well (&lt;collect&gt;) to be taken after the prompts have
				been played; the AS is only interested in a single digit (maxdigits=1);
				</t>
				<t>the transaction is extended by the MS (A2) and, in case everything works fine (i.e. the
				MS retrieved all the audio files and successfully built the variable ones), the dialog is started;
				its start is reported, together with the associated identifier (5db01f4) to the AS in a
				terminating REPORT message (A3);</t>
				<t>the AS acks the REPORT (A4), and waits for the dialog to end in order to retrieve the results
				it is interested in (in this case, the DTMF tone the UAC chooses, since it will affect which
				message will have to be played subsequently);</t>
				<t>the UAC hears the prompts and chooses a message to play; in this example, he wants to listen
				to the first message, and so digits 1; the MS intercepts this tone, and notifies it to the AS in
				a newly created CONTROL event message (B1); this CONTROL includes information about how each
				single requested operation ended (&lt;promptinfo&gt; and &lt;collectinfo&gt;); specifically,
				the event states that the prompt ended normally (termmode=completed) and that the subsequently
				collected tone is 1 (dtmf=1); the AS acks the event (B2), since the dialogid provided in
				the message is the same as the one of the previously started dialog;</t>
				<t>at this point, the AS makes use of the value retrieved from the event to proceed in its
				business logic; it decides to present the UAC with a VCR-controllable playout of the
				requested message; this is done with a new request to the IVR package (C1), which contains
				two operations: &lt;prompt&gt; to address the media file to play (an old recording), and
				&lt;control&gt; to instruct the MS about how the playout of this media file shall be
				controlled via DTMF tones provided by the UAC (in this example, different DTMF digits are
				associated with different actions, e.g. pause/resume, fast forward, rewind and so on); besides,
				the AS also subscribes to DTMF events related to this control operation (matchmode=control),
				which means that the MS is to trigger an event anytime a DTMF associated with a control
				operation (e.g. 7=pause) is intercepted;</t>
				<t>the MS prepares the dialog, notifying about the transaction being extended (C2) and,
				when the playout starts, notifies it in a terminating REPORT (C3), which is acked by the AS (C4);
				at this point, the UAC is presented with the prompt, and can make use of DTMF digits to control
				the playback;</t>
				<t>as explained previously, any DTMF associated with a VCR operation is then reported to the AS,
				together with a timestamp stating when the event happened; an example is provided (D1)
				in which the UAC pressed the fast forward key (6) at a specific time; of course, as for any
				other MS-generated event, the AS acks it (D2);</t>
				<t>when the playback ends (whether because the media reached its termination, or because any
				other interruption occurred), the MS triggers a concluding event with information about the
				whole dialog (E1); this event, besides including information about the prompt itself (&lt;promptinfo&gt;),
				also includes information related to the VCR operations (&lt;controlinfo&gt;), that is, all the
				VCR controls the UAC made use of (in the example fastforward/rewind/pause/resume) and
				when it happened; the final ack by the AS (E2) concludes the scenario.</t>

			<t>
				An interesting scenario to realize with the help of the
				MS provided features is what is typically called 'Current Time'.
				A UAC calls a URI, which presents the caller with the current
				date and time. As it can easily be deduced by the very nature
				of the application, variable announcements play an important
				role in this scenario. In fact, rather than having the AS
				build different framework messages according to the current
				time to build an announcement, it is much easier to rely
				upon the variable announcements mechanism provided by the
				IVR package, which includes ways to deal with dates and times
				in several fashions.
			</t>
			<t>
				To make the scenario more interesting and have it cover
				more functionality, the application is also assumed to
				have a background music played during the announcement.
				Considering that most of the announcements will be variable,
				a means is needed to have more streams played in parallel on
				the same connection. This can be achieved in two different ways:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>two separate and different dialogs, playing respectively the variable announcements and the background track;</t>
					<t>a single dialog implementing a parallel playback.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				The first approach assumes the available MS implements implicit mixing, which may or may not
				be supported, since it's a recommended feature but not a mandatory one. The second approach
				instead assumes the MS implements support for more streams of the same media type (in this
				case audio) in the same dialog, which, exactly as implicit mixing, is not to be given for granted.
				Considering the first approach is quite straightforward to understand, the presented scenario
				makes use of the second one, and assumes the available MS supports parallel playback of more
				audio tracks within the context of the same dialog.
			</t>
			<t>
				That said, the covered scenario, depicted as a sequence diagram
				in <xref target="fig-curtime-cfw"/>, will be the following:

				The framework transaction steps are described in the following:
			</t>
			<t>
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>The first transaction (A1) is addressed to the IVR package (msc-ivr); it is basically
				a 'playannouncement' dialog, but, unlike all the scenarios presented so far, it includes
				directives for a parallel playback, as indicated by the 'par' element; there are three
				flows to play in parallel:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>a sequence ('seq') of variable and static announcements (the actual time and date);</t>
					<t>a music track ('media=music.wav') to be played in background at a lower volume (soundLevel=50%);</t>
					<t>a mute background video track (media=clock.mpg).</t>
				</list>
				The global announcement ends when the longest of the three parallel steps ends (endsync=last); this means that,
				if one of the steps ends before the others, the step is muted for the rest of the playback. About the series of
				static and variable announcements, in this example this is requested by the AS:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>play a wav file ("Tuesday...");</t>
					<t>play a date ("16th of december 2008..."), by building it (variable: date with a ymd=year/month/day format);</t>
					<t>play a time ("5:31 PM..."), by building it (variable: time with a t12=12 hour day format, am/pm).</t>
				</list>
				</t>
				<t>the transaction is extended by the MS (A2) and, in case everything went fine (i.e. the
				MS retrieved all the audio files and successfully built the variable ones, and it supports parallel playback
				as requested), the dialog is started; its start is reported, together with the associated identifier (415719e)
				to the AS in a terminating REPORT message (A3);</t>
				<t>the AS acks the REPORT (A4), and waits for the dialog to end in order to conclude the application,
				or proceed to further steps if required by the application itself;</t>
				<t>when the last of the three parallel announcements ends, the dialog terminates, and an event (B1) is
				triggered to the AS with the relevant information (promptinfo); the AS acks (B2) and terminates the scenario.</t>

		<section title="DTMF-driven Conference Manipulation" anchor="sec-dtmf-conf">
			<t>
				To complete the scenarios presented in <xref target="sec-conference"/>, this section
				deals with how the AS can make use of the MS in order to detect DTMF tones from
				conference participants, and take actions on the conference accordingly. A typical
				example is when participants in a conference are provided with specific codes to:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>mute/unmute themselves in the conference;</t>
					<t>change their volume in the conference, or the volume of the conference itself;</t>
					<t>change the video layout in the conference, if allowed;</t>
					<t>kick abusing users from the conference;</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				and so on. To achieve all this, the simpliest thing an AS can do is to prepare a recurring
				DTMF collection for each participant with specific grammars to match. In case the collected tones
				match the grammar, the MS would notify them to the AS, and start the collection again. Upon
				receival of &lt;collectinfo&gt; events, the AS would in turn originate the proper related request,
				e.g. a &lt;modifyjoin&gt; on the participant's stream with the conference. This is made possible
				by three features provided by the IVR package:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>the 'repeatCount' attribute;</t>
					<t>the subscription mechanism;</t>
					<t>the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS).</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				The first allows for recurring instances of the same dialog without the need of additional requests
				upon completion of the dialog itself. In fact, the 'repeatCount' attribute indicates how many
				times the dialog has to be repeated: when the attribute has the value 0, it means that the
				dialog has to be repeated indefinitely, meaning that it's up to the AS to destroy it by means
				of a &lt;dialogterminate&gt; request when the dialog isn't needed anymore. The second, instead,
				allows the AS to subscribe to events related to the IVR package without waiting for the dialog to
				end, e.g. matching DTMF collections in this case. The last, finally,
				allows for custom matching grammars to be specified: this way, only a subset of the possible
				DTMF strings can be specified, so that only the matches the AS is interested in are reported. Different
				grammars other than SRGS may be supported by the MS, which achieve the same result: anyway, this document
				will only describe the use of an SRGS grammar, since support for SRGS is mandated in the IVR package
				specification.
			</t>
			<t>
				To identify a single sample scenario, we assume a participant has already successfully
				joined a conference, e.g. as detailed in <xref target="fig-conf-rich-cfw"/>. Besides, we
				assume the following codes are to be provided within the conference to participants in order
				to let them take advantage of advanced features:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>*6 to mute/unmute themselves (on/off trigger);</t>
					<t>*1 to lower their own volume in the conference, and *3 to raise it;</t>
					<t>*7 to lower the volume of the conference stream they are receiving, and *9 to raise it;</t>
					<t>*0 to leave the conference.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				This means that six different codes are supported, and are to be matched in the requested
				DTMF collection. All other codes are collected by the MS, but discarded, and no event is
				triggered to the AS. Considering all the codes have the '*' (star) DTMF code in common, the following
				is an example of an SRGS grammar that may be used in the request by the AS:
			</t>

  <grammar mode="dtmf" version="1.0" \
           xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/grammar">
    <rule id="digit">
      <one-of>
        <item>0</item>

      </item>
    </rule>
  </grammar>
						]]>
					</artwork>
				</figure>
			</t>
			<t>
				As it can be deduced by looking at the grammar, the presented SRGS XML code specifies exactly
				the requirements for the collections to match: the rule is to match any string which has a
				star ('*') followed by just one of any supported digit (0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9). Such grammar, as
				stated in the IVR package specification, may be provided either inline in the request itself
				or referenced externally by means of the 'src' attribute. In the scenario example, we'll
				put it inline, but an external reference to the same document would achieve exactly the
				same result.
			</t>
			<t>
				<xref target="fig-dtmf-conf-cfw"/> shows how the AS might request the recurring collection
				for a UAC: as already anticipated before, the example assumes the UAC is already a participant
				in the conference.

				As it can be deduced from the sequence diagram above, the AS, in
				its business logic, correlates the results of different transactions,
				addressed to different packages, to implement a more complex
				conferencing scenario: in fact, 'dtmfnotify' events are used
				to take actions according to the purpose the DTMF codes are meant for.
				The framework transaction steps are the following:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
				<t>The UAC is already in the conference, and so the AS starts a recurring collect
				with a grammar to match; this is done by placing a CONTROL request addressed to
				the IVR package (A1); the operation to implement is a &lt;collect&gt;, and we are
				only interested in two-digits DTMF strings (maxdigits); the AS is not interested in
				a DTMF terminator (termchar is set to a non-conventional DTMF character), and
				the DTMF escape key is set to '#' (the default is '*', which would conflict with
				the code syntax for the conference, and so needs to be changed); a custom SRGS grammar
				is provided inline (&lt;grammar&gt; with mode=dtmf); the whole dialog is to be
				repeated indefinitely (dialog has repeatCount=0), and the AS wants to be notified
				when matching collections occur (dtmfsub with matchmode=collect);</t>
				<t>the request is extended by the MS as already explained in previous sections (A2-4),
				and then successfully started (dialogid=01d1b38); this means the MS has started collecting
				DTMF tones from UAC;</t>
				<t>the MS collects a matching DTMF string from UAC (*1); since the AS subscribed to this
				kind of event, a CONTROL event notification (dtmfnotify) is triggered by the MS (B1), including
				the collected tones; since the dialog is recurring, the MS immediately restarts the collection;</t>
				<t>the AS acks the event (B2), and in its business logic understands that the code '*1'
				means that the UAC wants its own volume to be lowered in the conference mix; the AS is able to
				associate the event with the right UAC by referring to the attached dialogid (01d1b38); it then acts
				accordingly, by sending a &lt;modifyjoin&gt; (C1) which does exactly this: the provided
				&lt;stream&gt; child element instructs the MS into modifying the volume of the UAC--&gt;conference
				audio flow (setgain=-3dB sendonly); notice how the request also includes directives upon the
				inverse direction; this verbose approach is needed, since otherwise the MS would not only change
				the volume in the requested direction, but also disable the media flow in the other direction; having
				a proper &lt;stream&gt; addressing the UAC&lt;--conf media flow as well ensures that this doesn't happen;</t>
				<t>the MS successfully enforces the requested operation (C2), changing the volume;</t>
				<t>a new matching DTMF string from UAC is collected (*9); as before, an event is triggered to the AS (D1);</t>
				<t>the AS acks the event (D2), and matches the new code ('*9') with its related operation (raise the
				volume of the conference mix for UAC), taking the proper action; a different &lt;modifyjoin&gt; is
				sent (E1) with the new instructions (setgain=+3dB recvonly);</t>
				<t>the MS successfully enforces this requested operation as well (E2), changing the volume in the specified direction; again,
				a &lt;stream&gt; for the inverse direction is provided again, which basically confirms the directives of (C1);</t>
				<t>at this point, a further matching DTMF string from UAC is collected (*6), and sent to the AS (F1);</t>
				<t>after the rquired ack (F2), the AS reacts by implementing the action associated with the new code ('*6'),
				by which UAC requested to be muted within the conference; a new &lt;modifyjoin&gt; is sent (G1) with
				a properly constructed payload (setstate=mute sendonly), and the MS enforces it (G2);</t>
				<t>a last (in the scenario) matching DTMF string is collected by the MS (*0); as with all the previous codes,
				this string is notified to the AS (H1);</t>
				<t>the AS acks the event (H2), and understands the UAC wants to leave the conference now (since the code is *0);
				this means that a series of actions must be taken, namely:
				<list style="symbols">
				<t>actually stopping the recurring collection, since it's not needed anymore;</t>
				<t>unjoin UAC from the conference it is in;</t>
				<t>additional operations might be considered, e.g. a global announcement stating UAC is leaving, but are left out for
				the sake of conciseness);</t>
				</list>
				the former is accomplished by means of a &lt;dialogterminate&gt; request (I1) to the IVR
				package (dialogid=01d1b38); the latter by means of an 'unjoin' request (K1) to the Mixer package instead;
				</t>
				<t>the &lt;dialogterminate&gt; request is extended by the MS (I2-4), and the dialog is terminated successfully;
				as soon as the dialog has actually been terminated, a 'dialogexit' event is triggered as well to the AS (J1); this
				event has no report upon the result of the last iteration (since the dialog was
				terminated abruptly with an immediate=true) and is acked by the AS (J2) to finally complete the dialog lifetime;</t>
				<t>the &lt;unjoin&gt; request, instead, is immediately enforced (K2); as a consequence of the unjoin operation,
				an 'unjoin-notify' event notification is triggered by the MS (L1) to confirm to the AS that the requested entities
				are not attached to each other anymore; the status in the event is set to 0 which, as stated in the specification,
				means the join has been terminated by an &lt;unjoin&gt; request; the ack of the AS (L2) concludes this scenario.</t>
				</list>
