Internet-Draft     Kerberos V5 Reply Key Strengthening        March 2009


Abstract

   This document describes how to strengthen the Kerberos V5 reply key
   using keying material derived from TLS, by using a pre-authentication
   mechanism.  The goals are to 1) allow clients to securely learn a
   realm's KDC X.509 certificate, 2) distribute the X.509 trust anchors
   used by the KDC, and 3) make it possible for clients to use Kerberos
   V5 over TLS without having to validate the server certificates.

Internet-Draft     Kerberos V5 Reply Key Strengthening        March 2009


1.  Introduction and Background

   This document describes a Kerberos V5 [RFC4120] pre-authentication
   mechanism that uses Kerberos V5 over TLS
   [I-D.josefsson-kerberos5-starttls] to achieve:

   o  Allow Kerberos V5 clients to securely learn a Kerberos V5 realm's
      Key Distribution Center (KDC) certificates.  This is achieved by
      having the client connect to a KDC, take a note of the server's
      certificate, and verify them as belonging to the KDC the user
      trusts by properly decrypting the Kerberos V5 response using the
      user's password.  Only the correct KDC will be able to generate a
      Kerberos V5 response using the user's password and the secrets
      derived from the TLS channel.

   o  Securely distribute the trust anchors used by the Key Distribution
      Center (KDC) in a Kerberos V5 realm.  This is achieved the same
      way as before, but rather than remembering the server certificate,
      it remembers the trust anchor.

   o  The ability to use Kerberos V5 over TLS without having to validate
      the server certificates.

   The mechanism to achieve the above goals is for the KDC to strengthen
   the Kerberos V5 reply key using keying material derived from the TLS
   channel [RFC5246] using the algorithm specified in Keying Material
   Exporters for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [I-D.ietf-tls-extractor].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol

   The client and KDC MUST support Kerberos V5 over TLS
   [I-D.josefsson-kerberos5-starttls].  If the client do not (yet) have
   trust anchors for the KDC, it should disable verification of the
   server certificate.

   To signal that the client wishes the KDC to strengthen the reply key
   using keying material derived from the TLS session, it sends a pre-
   authentication mechanism called "pa-krb5starttls-bootstrap".  It has
   a pdata-type integer value of #TBD.

   The pre-authentication structure is defined in RFC 4120 as:

     PA-DATA         ::= SEQUENCE {
             -- NOTE: first tag is [1], not [0]
             padata-type     [1] Int32,
             padata-value    [2] OCTET STRING -- might be encoded AP-REQ
     }

   The content of the padata-value should be the DER encoding of the
   empty string.

   When receiving the request to use the "pa-krb5starttls-bootstrap"
   pre-authentication message, the KDC needs to decide whether to honor
   it or not.  This is a policy decision that can depend on several
   reasons, including the content of the request.  If the KDC decides
   that it does not wish to honor the "pa-krb5starttls-bootstrap"
   request, the KDC MUST fail the request by returning
   KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED.

   When the KDC decides to honor the client's request, it will process
   the incoming request as usual except that the KDC-REP reply key is
   post processed as follows.  The post processing uses Keying Material
   Exporters for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [I-D.ietf-tls-extractor].  The channel binding input "tlscb" value
   MUST be the client's TLS Finished message data as described in the
   "tls-unique" channel binding registration.

      StrengthenKrb5ReplyKeyUsingTLS (inkey, inkey_len,
                                      tlscb, tlscb_len)

      Input:          inkey      encryption key, an octet string
                      inkey_len  length of encryption key,
                                 a positive integer
                      tlscb      channel binding data, an octet string,
                      tlscb_len  length of channel binding data,
                                 a positive integer

      Output:         outkey   derived key, a inlen-octet string

      Steps:

         1. Perform the TLS Exporter step:

             outkey = PRF(master_secret, label,
                          SecurityParameters.client_random +
                          SecurityParameters.server_random +
                          context_value_length + context_value
                         )[length]

            The "context_value" should be the concatenation of "inkey"
            followed by "tlscb".

            Consequently, the length of "context_value" (which used to
            derived "context_value_length") will be the sum of
            "inkey_len" and "tlscb_len".

            Use the value of "inkey_len" as the value of the "length"
            variable.

         3. Output the derived key "outkey".

   The client will strengthen the KDC-REP reply key using the same
   procedure.

   On successful decryption of the KDC-REP, the clients is certain that
   it is talking to a KDC that knows the client's shared key without any
   man-in-the-middle.  The client can then remember the KDC server
   certificate and/or trust anchors transferred during the TLS
   handshake, to be used during future Kerberos V5 over TLS connections.
   The client MAY skip using this protocol for future connections, and
   instead rely on the standard Kerberos V5 over TLS protocol with
   proper validation of server certificate.
