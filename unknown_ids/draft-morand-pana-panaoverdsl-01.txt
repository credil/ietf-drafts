Internet-Draft           PANA over DSL networks            February 2008


1.  Introduction

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) design
   provides support for various types of deployments.  DSL networks were
   identified as a typical example of such a deployment.  This document
   provides guidelines for PANA deployment over DSL access networks.
   The document specifically describes the introduction of PANA in DSL
   networks migrating from a traditional PPP access model to a pure IP-
   based access environment.  In such environment, additional
   authentication mechanisms are required to provide a complete secure
   network access solution to Network Access Providers (NAP) willing to
   overtake inadequate methods such as basic DSL link-layer
   identification or application-layer ad-hoc authentication mechanisms
   (e.g., HTTP redirects with web-based login).


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the PANA terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].
   This document uses the DSL Forum terminology defined in [TR25],
   [TR59], [TR101] and [WT146].


4.  PANA Framework Overview

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a
   link-layer agnostic transport for EAP [RFC3748] to enable network
   access authentication between clients and access networks.

   The motivation to define such a protocol and the requirements are
   described in [RFC4058].  Protocol details are documented in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].  There are components that are part of a
   complete secure network access solution but are outside of the PANA
   protocol specification.  These components include PANA Authentication
   Agent (PAA) discovery mechanisms, based either on DHCP
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-paa-option] or a simple multicast-based protocol
   [I-D.fajardo-pana-paa-discovery], as well as IP address
   configuration, authentication method choice, filter rule
   installation, data traffic protection, and PAA-EP protocol
   [I-D.ietf-pana-framework].

5.  PANA in DSL environment

5.1.  Evolution of DSL Environment

   Traditional DSL deployments followed the architectural guidelines
   provided in [TR25] or [TR59].  Theses architectures use ATM to
   aggregate the access networks into a regional broadband network.  The
   traffic aggregated from the access nodes (DSLAM) is steered to an IP
   node, the Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS).  In this
   environment, PPP sessions are set-up between the CPN (Customer
   Premises Network) and the BRAS, which acts as either a PPP
   termination point or a L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) tunnelling
   multiple subscriber PPP sessions directly to an Internet/Corporate
   Service Provider.  The CPN is usually defined as the combination of
   the DSL Modem or Residential Gateway (RG), acting as termination

   The devices at the customer premises have been shown as "hosts" in
   the above network.


   DSL architectures are now emerging from a "low" speed best effort
   delivery network to an infrastructure capable of supporting higher
   subscriber bit rates.  At the application layer, DSL service
   providers are looking to support enhanced services layered on top of
   basic Internet access, including entertainment video services
   (Broadcast TV and VoD), video conferencing, VoIP, gaming, and
   business class services (e.g.  IP VPN), that have prohibitive
   requirements to deploy them in a pure ATM based environment.  Moving
   to on a Gigabit Ethernet instead of an ATM aggregation network offers
   an highly efficient transport technology for delivering large amounts
   of bandwidth to a highly distributed access node topology.  Migration
   from ATM-based to an Ethernet based aggregation network in the
   context of TR-25 and TR-59 based architectures is described in
   [TR101].

   In this evolution path towards Giga Ethernet, there is in parallel a
   growing interest in migrating from the traditional PPP access model
   to one relying on an network access control of IP sessions
   establishment.  The "IP Sessions" model is a concept introduced in
   DSL Forum that covers a cycle consisting of IP session Detection and
   creation, application of IP session policies, and IP session
   termination.  Details of this work are documented in [WT146].
   Basically, an IP session represents subscriber IP traffic which is
   associated with a subscriber's IP address parameters.  A subscriber
   may have multiple IP addresses (or sessions) in simultaneous use.  An
   IP session may in turn be associated with multiple IP flows.  The
   relation between subscribers and policies associated with it are
   described in [WT134].  The policy relationships in this document show
   that subscribers have services that are governed by policies.  Thus,
   the same subscriber policies govern all IP sessions/flows belonging
   to the subscriber.

5.2.  Advisability of Introducing PANA in DSL Environment

   Among other challenges for DSL environment migrating from pure PPP
   based networks, one is the need for the creation of an IP session
   subscriber authentication model to secure network access and IP
   address management provided by a DHCP infrastructure.  Indeed,
   contrary to PPP environment, an IP sessions model has no built-in
   mechanisms for authentication purposes in a DHCP based environment.
   If location-based authentication relying on access line
   identification is actually possible (see in [TR101] the use of the
   DHCP Relay Agent Information option, aka DHCP option 82, inserted by
   the Access Node), additional mechanisms are required to provide
   Network Access Providers (NAP) with an explicit per-subscriber access
   authentication solution, in order to .

   Providing a native support of EAP frames over IP, PANA is therefore a
   natural candidate to provide the protocol support of an IP subscriber
   authentication model.  Moreover, PANA provides functionalities
   fulfilling basic and advanced security requirements within an IP
   session based environment (as described in [WT146]) , such as:

   o  IP address based session management mechanisms, using an explicit
      session identifier;

   o  Authentication mechanism independent of the physical medium type;

   o  Enabling per-session enforcement policies (i.e. filters) depending
      on the creation and deletion of the PANA session;

   o  Enabling session keep-alive and session monitoring functionalities
      to optimize the use of resources and provide an accurate picture
      of the state of a subscriber session (as described in [WT146]).


   In this new context for DSL networks, PANA may be introduced to
   authenticate the credentials of a user prior to the setup of an IP
   session.  The user selects the service provider and authenticates
   itself.  During IP session setup, policies for the use of connection
   resources related to the IP session are established in the BRAS.
   These policies govern the subscriber's use of network resources.  IP
   flows are accounted for and associated with the IP session and the
   service session that triggered it.

   Based on the content of the Liaison Statement sent by the DSL Forum
   to the IETF, the specific subscriber authentication requirements were
   discussed at the PANA WG meeting at IETF70 in Vancouver (Dec 5,
   2007).  The result of this analysis confirmed the applicability of
   the PANA protocol for the DSL Forum's subscriber authentication

   requirements.  PANA WG Meeting analysis can be found in the 70th IETF
   meeting proceedings
   (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/07dec/slides/pana-3/sld1.htm).


6.  Applicability of PANA to IP Session based DSL Environment

6.1.  Functional Architecture

6.1.1.  Location of PAA and EP

   In a PPP based environment, the BRAS is in charge of interfacing with
   CPE for authenticating and authorizing them for the network access
   service as well as performing policy control by acting as en
   enforcement point.  In an IP session based environment, such
   functionalities may be provided at the same level by locating the PAA
   and EP entities in the BRAS.  One advantage provided by this
   implementation is to preserve a improved and well-established DSL
   network configuration.  Moreover, PAA and EP being collocated, there
   is no need to rely on an external interface between them to carry the
   authorized client attributes i.e. filters, an API being sufficient in
   that case.

   The PANA design providing also the support for network configuration
   in which PAA and EP are not collocated, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-framework], the PAA may be located in the BRAS while
   the EP function is the DSLAM.  In that specific case, the PAA-EP
   interface implemented between the BRAS and the DSLAM may be based on
   the current DHCP triggering or on a dedicated API.

   In an IP session based environment, the PAA will have to verify the
   credentials provided by a PaC located in the CPN and authorize
   network access to the host/gateway associated with the client.

6.1.2.  Location of the PaC

6.1.2.1.  Bridged Mode

   In the Bridged mode, the DSL Modem/RG acts as a simple link-layer
   bridge.  The DSL Modem/RG is here transparent at the IP layer.  The
   hosts (e.g.  PC) connected to the DSL Modem/RG in the CPN and the
   BRAS are then on the same IP link.  Hosts may have a statically
   configured IP address or obtain an IP address from a DHCP server
   through the DSLAM (acting as a Layer-2 DHCP Relay agent as described
   in [TR101]) and the BRAS (filtering DHCP requests towards the DHCP
   server).

   In this model, the PaC can be easily implemented in the hosts.  Any

   host connected to the DSL Modem/RG will be authenticated by the PAA
   locating in the BRAS.  It is therefore possible to perform a network
   access control on a per-host basis, as required by the IP session
   model.

6.1.2.2.  Routed Mode

   In the Routed mode, the DSL Modem/RG acts as an IP router for the
   CPN.  In this configuration, only the DSL Modem/RG and BRAS are on
   the same IP link.  The DSL Modem/RG may have a statically configured
   IP address or obtain an IP address from a DHCP server through the
   DSLAM (acting as a Layer-2 DHCP-Relay agent as described in [TR101])
   and the BRAS (filtering DHCP requests towards the DHCP server).
   Hosts connected to the DSL Modem/RG may use either (1) either private
   IP addresses in an IPv4 environment with the DSL Modem/RG implemented
   a Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) function or (2) routable IP
   addresses if the modem is an IPv6 router.

                                   IPv4 Case (1)

               (PaC)

                              Figure 4: Routed Mode

   In the IPv4 case (1), the simplest method is to implement the PaC in
   the DSL Modem/RG.  Only the DSL Modem/RG will be authenticated/
   authorized by the PAA.  All hosts at the customer premises will then
   have access to the service provider's network using private IP
   addresses obtained from the DSL Modem/RG.

   (NOTE: Per-host authentication may be achieved also in the Routed
   mode if the EP function is performed by the DSL Modem/RG.  However,
   it is for further studies to see how to introduce such a
   configuration in the global DSL Forum "IP Sessions" model.)

   In the IPv6 case (2), the BRAS will detect any new IP address used by
   the DSL Modem/RG and the hosts connected to the DSL Modem/RG when
   using global scope IPv6 addresses.  To allow a suitable network
   access rights management based on the IP address, PANA clients will
   have to be therefore implemented in the DSL Modem/RG and the hosts.
   The network access control is therefore performed on a per-host
   basis, in addition to the handling of the DSL Modem/RG 's own IP
   sessions.

6.2.  IP Address Configuration

   As described in [I-D.ietf-pana-framework], the PaC MUST obtain an IP
   address prior to performing PANA-based authentication, called pre-
   PANA address (PRPA).

   In the context of PANA deployment in DSL environment based on the IP
   Sessions model, the PRPA MAY be configured by the following methods:


   1.  The PaC MAY be statically configured with an IP address.  This
       address is therefore used as a PRPA.

   2.  The PaC MAY dynamically configure the PRPA using DHCPv4 [RFC2131]
       or DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   3.  In IPv6, the PaC MAY configure non-link-local address(es) using
       IPv6 stateless auto-configuration [RFC2461] if router
       advertisements with prefixes are made available.

   4.  PaC MAY also use an IPv4 link-local address [RFC3927] and/or an
       IPv6 link-local address [RFC2461].


   After a successful authentication, the PaC MAY have to configure a
   new IP address for communication with other nodes if the PRPA is a
   local-use (e.g., a link-local or private address) or a temporarily
   allocated IP address.  This IP address is called a post-PANA address
   (POPA).  An operator might choose allocating a POPA only after
   successful PANA authorization either to prevent waste of premium
   (e.g., globally routable) IP resources until the PaC is authorized
   (especially in the IPv4 case), or to enable PaC identity based
   address assignment.  POPA can be configured using DHCP [RFC2131]
   [RFC3315] or using IPv6 stateless auto-configuration [RFC2461].

6.3.  Authorized Device ID

   The MAC address of the PaC can be used as a session attribute of the
   subscriber and used by EP for packet filtering once the PANA
   authentication successfully completed.  The MAC address can also be
   used by the network to assign a subscriber-dependent IP address using
   DHCP.  Therefore, the association between the subscriber ID that was
   used with the PANA authentication and the session attributes (MAC and
   IP addressess) can be formed.

6.4.  Cryptographic Protection

   DSL networks are protected by physical means.  Eavesdropping and
   spoofing attacks are prevented by keeping the unintended users
   physically away from the network media.  Therefore, generally
   cryptographic protection of data traffic is not common.
   Nevertheless, if enhanced security is deemed necessary for any
   reason, IPsec-based access control can be enabled on DSL networks as
   well by using the method described in [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].

   deployments.

   Section 6.5.1 describes the basic components of generic message flow.

                       Figure 5. Generic PANA over DSL call flow

   Depending on the deployment, either the DSL Modem acts as a RG and
   therefore only that node is authenticated; or the DSL Modem acts as a
   bridge and hosts connected to that bridge gets individually
   authenticated.

      Step 1: The DSL Modem/RG or host, acting as PaC, configures a pre-
      PANA IP address (PRPA).

      Step 2: PaC discovers the IP address of the PAA.  PaC may use DHCP
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-paa-option] or the discovery mechanism provided by
      PANA [I-D.fajardo-pana-paa-discovery].

      Step 3: PaC and PAA performs authentication using EAP and AAA
      protocols (RADIUS, Diameter, etc.)

      Step 4: In case the PRPA was a temporary address or limited-use
      address, the PaC configures a post-PANA IP address (POPA).  This
      is the service IP address.

      Step 5: PAA instructs the EP to allow authorized IP traffic of
      PaC.  This step may be implicitly part of step 4 (e.g.  DHCPACK
      with IP address configuration) or performed using a specific API.

      Step 6: PaC can transmit and receive IP data packets.


   Note that the step 4 is optional.  Depending on the network
   configuration and the IP address resource management, it may not be
   needed for the PaC to configure a new IP address after the PANA
   authentication.

6.5.2.  Specific Example

   These are the message flows for a specific example where:

      - DSL modem/RG is authenticated,

      - PRPA is a link-local IPv4 address,

      - PAA discovery is based on DHCP,

      - Authentication method used is EAP-MD5,

      - POPA is configured using DHCPv4,

      - EP is triggered by DHCPACK whose 'yiaddr' field is filled.

                      Figure 6. Specific example message flow.

      Step 1: The DSL Modem/RG configures an IPv4 link-local address
      [RFC3927].  It is assumed that, if the DSL network does not allow
      modems sending and receiving ARP requests/responses to each other,
      then the network allows IP address collision among the modems and
      deals with it by using auxiliary information such as MAC address,
      VLAN, etc.

      Steps 2-3: the DSL Modem/RG discovers the IPv4 address of the PAA
      using the PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv4 Option



Morand, et al.           Expires August 28, 2008               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           PANA over DSL networks            February 2008


      [I-D.ietf-dhc-paa-option].  The DSL Modem/RG uses its IPv4 link-
      local address with DHCP and it does not request IP address
      allocation (i.e., DHCP server will not fill 'yiaddr' in DHCP ACK
      in response to DHCP Inform).  Option 82 is inserted into the DHCP
      Inform message by the DSLAM.

      Step 4: The DSL Modem/RG initiates PANA with the newly-discovered
      PAA.  Alternatively, the PAA could initiate PANA in unsolicited
      fashion.  In that latter case, Step 4 may be skipped or run in
      parallel with Step 5.

      Steps 5-10: PANA and RADIUS carrying out EAP-MD5 authentication.
      BRAS can utilize the Option 82 value discovered during Step 2.

      Steps 11-14: Now that the DSL Modem/RG is authenticated, it
      proceeds to configuring service IP address using DHCPv4.  As soon
      as the new IP address is confirmed by the DHCP ACK, the DSL
      Modem/RG can stop using the IPv4 link-local address.  In Step 14,
      the DHCP ACK message carrying the IP address triggers the DSLAM to
      update its filters with the authorized IP/MAC address of the DSL
      Modem/RG.

      Step 15: The DSL Modem/RG can transmit and receive IP data packets
      using the service IP address.


   Note that, during steps 1-14, the DSLAM (acting as EP) allows only
   DHCP and PANA messages,and depending on deployment, address
   resolution messages such as ARP and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messges.

   A variation of this call flow can be generated using PANA-based PAA
   discovery [I-D.fajardo-pana-paa-discovery] instead of DHCP for the
   Steps 2 and 3.  If Option 82 value is needed by the BRAS, it can be
   inserted into the PANA messages as they go through the DSLAM.


7.  Security Considerations

   The DSL infrastructure that connects the CPE to the DSLAM/BRAS is
   assumed to run over a physically-secured non-shared media.  For that
   reason, neither the use of a key-generating EAP method nor a secure
   L2/L3 channel bootstrapped by PANA is required.  The current DSL
   deployments are satisfied by using non-key-generating client-only
   authentication methods (e.g., CHAP and its EAP equivalent EAP-MD5).
   The same model can be maintained even with the PANA-based
   deployments.  If next generation deployments prefer key-generating
   mutual authentication methods, they can be naturally used with PANA
   too.
