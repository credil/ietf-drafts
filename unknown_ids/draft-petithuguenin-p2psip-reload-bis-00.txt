Internet-Draft                 RELOAD Bis                      June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document presents some extensions to RELOAD.  The RELOAD authors
   are free to take whatever they want in this document.  Anything else
   will be either proposed as separate extensions or in reload-bis after
   RELOAD is published as an RFC.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Client connected to bootstrap node

   Section 3.2.1 of [RELOAD] describes how a client can connect to an
   overlay, either to its responsible peer or to an arbitrary peer, but
   does not describes the case where the client just wants to connect to
   a bootstrap node with a certificate containing multiple Node-IDs.

   This documents permits this, by having the client immediately sending
   a Ping with a wildcard Node-ID, and the bootstrap node waiting for
   receiving the Ping if the (D)TLS connection contains a remote
   certificate with multiple Node-IDs.


4.  Service Name and Path

   Section 10.2 of [RELOAD] uses a Service Name of "p2psip-enroll" and a
   path of "/.well-known/p2psip-enroll".

   RELOAD is now a generic P2P protocol, no longer tied to SIP so this
   document defines the Service Name "p2p-enroll" as an alias for
   "p2psip-enroll" and "/.well-known/p2p-enroll" as an alias for
   "/.well-known/p2psip-enroll".


5.  Multiple Node-IDs for self-signed certificates

   Section 10.3.1 does not define an algorithm to create self-signed
   certificates that contain multiple Node-IDs.

   This document permits to create self-signed certificates by
   prepending the index (from 1 to the number of Node-IDs needed) as a 4
   bytes big endian integer to the public key of the user before
   applying the digest.

6.  Re-sign certificates

   Section 10.5 explains that the enrollment server must return
   certificates that contain Node-IDs that are cryptographically random,
   preventing the possibility to provide new certificates for Node-IDs
   already assigned, for example because a certificate will expire soon.

   This documents permits to extend the lifetime of a Node-ID by
   reissuing new certificates.  This is done by sending the old
   certificate in the request to the enrollment server instead of the
   certificate signing request.  The enrollment server MUST still check
   that the username and password are consistent with the certificate.
   If the nodeids parameter is different from the value used when
   issuing the previous certificate, then the number of Node-IDs in the
   new certificate must be adjusted, by either removing Node-IDs or by
   assigning new Node-IDs.

   This mechanism does not permit to change the RSA keys and keep the
   same Node-ID(s), but this is consistent with the self-signed
   certificates mechanism that does not permit this either.


7.  Security Considerations

   TBD


8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
