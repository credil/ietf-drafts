  <abstract>
    <t>
	Traditional mail systems handle only ASCII characters in SMTP
	envelope and mail header fields.
	The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension allows
	UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields.
	To avoid rejecting internationalized Email messages when a server
	in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP extension,
	some sort of converting mechanism is required.
	This document describes a downgrading mechanism
	for Email Address Internationalization.
	Note that this is a way to downgrade, not tunnel.  There is no
	associated up-conversion mechanism, although internationalized
	email clients might use original internationalized addresses or
	other data when displaying or replying to downgraded messages.
    </t>
  </abstract>

<middle>
  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>
	Traditional mail systems which are defined
	by <xref target="RFC5321" /> and <xref target="RFC5322" />
	allow ASCII characters in SMTP envelope and mail header field values.
	The UTF8SMTP extension
		<xref target="RFC4952" />,
		<xref target="RFC5335" /> and
		<xref target="RFC5336" />
	allows UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header field values.
    </t>
    <t>

If an envelope address or header field contains non-ASCII 
characters, the message cannot be delivered unless every system
in the delivery path supports UTF8SMTP. 

This document describes a downgrading mechanism to avoid rejection of
such messages when a server which does not support the UTF8SMTP
extension is encountered.

Downgrading mechanism converts envelope and header fields to an
all-ASCII representation.
    </t>
    <t>     
<xref target="RFC5335" />
allows UTF-8 characters to be used in
mail header fields and MIME header fields.  The downgrading
mechanism specified here converts mail header fields and MIME
header fields to ASCII.
    </t>
    <t>
	This document does not change any protocols
	except by defining new header fields. It describes the conversion
	method from the internationalized email envelopes/messages
	which are defined in 
		<xref target="RFC4952" />
		<xref target="RFC5335" />
		<xref target="RFC5336" />
	to the traditional email envelopes/messages
	which are defined in
		<xref target="RFC5321" />
		<xref target="RFC5322" />.
    </t>
    <t>
	<xref target="RFC5336"/> section 2.2 defines when
	downgrading occurs.
	If the SMTP client has an UTF8SMTP envelope or an internationalized message
	and the SMTP server doesn't support the UTF8SMTP SMTP extension,
	then the SMTP client MUST NOT send a UTF8SMTP envelope
	or an internationalized message to the SMTP server.
	The section shows 4 choices.
	The fourth choice is downgrading, as described here.
    </t>
    <t>
	Downgrading may be implemented
	in MUAs, MSAs, MTAs which act as the SMTP client,
	or in MDAs, POP servers, IMAP servers which store or offer
	UTF8SMTP envelopes or internationalized messages
	to non-UTF8SMTP compliant systems
	which include message stores.
    </t>
    <t>
	This document tries to define the downgrading process clearly and
	it preserves the original information as much as possible.
    </t>
    <t>
	Downgrading in UTF8SMTP consists of the following four parts:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>New header fields definition</t>

	<vspace blankLines="1" />
    </t>
    <t>
	In <xref target="downgradedheader" />,
	many header fields starting with "Downgraded-"
	are introduced.
	They preserve the original envelope information and the original header fields.
	</t>
    <t>
	The SMTP downgrading is described in <xref target="smtpdowngrading" />.
	It generates ASCII only envelope information from an UTF8SMTP envelope.
    </t>
    <t>
	The Email header fields downgrading is described in <xref target="HeaderDowngrading" />.
	It generates ASCII only header fields.
    </t>
    <t>
	The MIME header fields are expanded in <xref target="RFC5335" />.
	The MIME header fields downgrading is described in <xref target="MIMEheaderdowngrading" />.
	It generates ASCII only MIME header fields.
    </t>
    <t>
	Displaying downgraded messages
	which originally contain internationalized E-mail addresses
	or internationalized header fields 
	is described in an another document (<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-downgraded-display" />).

  <section title="New header fields definition" anchor="downgradedheader">
  <t>
New header fields starting with "Downgraded-" are defined here to
preserve those original envelope and header field values which contain
UTF-8 characters.  During downgrading, one new "Downgraded-"
header field is added for each original envelope or header field
which cannot be passed as-is to a server which does not support
UTF8SMTP.  The original envelope or header field is removed or
rewritten.  Only those envelope and header fields which contain
non-ASCII characters are affected.  The result of this process
is a message which is compliant with existing email
specifications <xref target="RFC5321" /> and <xref target="RFC5322" />.
The original internationalized information can be retrieved by examining the
"Downgraded-" header fields which were added.

    <section title="Path element downgrading" anchor="pathdowngrading">
    <t>
	Downgrading the &lt;path&gt; of MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands uses ALT-ADDRESS parameter defined in
	<xref target="RFC5336"/>.  A SMTP command is downgradable if
	the &lt;path&gt; contains non-ASCII address and the command has an ALT-ADDRESS parameter which specifies an ASCII address.
	Since only non-ASCII addresses are downgradable, specifying an
	ALT-ADDRESS value for an all-ASCII address is invalid for use
	with this specification, and no interpretation is assigned to
	it. This restriction allows for future extension of the
	specification even though no such extensions are currently
	anticipated.
    </t>
    <t>
	Note that even if no downgrading is performed on the envelope,
	message header fields and message body MIME header fields
	 that contain non-ASCII characters MUST be downgraded.
	This is described in <xref target="HeaderDowngrading" /> and <xref target="MIMEheaderdowngrading" />.
    </t>
    <t>
	When downgrading, replace each &lt;path&gt; which contains non-ASCII mail address
	with its specified alternative ASCII address
	and preserve the original information using "Downgraded-Mail-From"
	and "Downgraded-Rcpt-To" header fields as defined in <xref target="downgradedheader" />.
	Before replacing, decode the ALT-ADDRESS parameter
	value because it is encoded as xtext <xref target="RFC3461" />.
     </t>
     <t>
	To avoid disclosing recipient addresses,
	the downgrading process MUST NOT add "Downgraded-Rcpt-To:" header field
	if the SMTP downgrading targets multiple recipients.
	See <xref target="security" /> for more detail.
     </t>
     <t>
	As a result of the recipient address downgrading,
	the domain part of the recipient address prior to downgrading
	might be different from the domain part of the new recipient address.
	If the result of address resolution
	for the domain part of the new recipient address contains
	the server at the connection destination of the SMTP session for the
	recipient address prior to downgrading,
	the SMTP connection is valid for the new recipient address.
	Otherwise, the downgrading process MUST NOT send the downgraded message
	to the new recipient address via the connection

	<t>
	A Downgraded message's header fields contain ASCII characters only.
	But they still contain MIME encapsulated header fields which contains
	non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
	Furthermore, the body part may contain UTF-8 characters.
	Implementations parsing Internet messages need
	 to accept UTF-8 body parts and UTF-8 header fields which are MIME encoded.
	Thus it inherits the security considerations of MIME encoded header fields <xref target="RFC2047" /> and <xref target="RFC3629" />.

	</t>
	<t>
		Rewriting header fields increases the opportunities for
		undetected spoofing by the malicious senders.
		However rewritten header fields are preserved into Downgraded-*
		header fields and parsing Downgraded-* header fields enables
		detecting spoofing caused by downgrading.
	</t>
	<t>
   Addresses that do not appear in the message header fields may appear in the
   RCPT commands to an SMTP server for a number of reasons.  Copying
   information from the Envelope into header fields risks inadvertent information
   disclosure (see <xref target="RFC5321" /> and 
		<xref target="smtpdowngrading" />).
   Mitigating inadvertent information disclosure is discussed in same place.
	</t>
	<t>
	The techniques described here invalidates methods that depend
	on digital signatures over the envelope or any part of the message
	which includes the top-level header fields or body part header fields.
	Depending on the specific message being downgraded, DKIM
	especially, but also possibly S/MIME, PGP, and similar
	techniques are all likely to break.
	The two obvious mitigations are to stick to 7-bit transport when using these techniques
	(as most/all of them presently require),
	or make sure you have UTF8SMTP end-to-end when needed.
	</t>
	<t>
	Many gateways and servers on the Internet will
	discard header fields with which they are not familiar.
	To the extent to which the downgrade procedures depend on
	new header fields (e.g., "Downgraded-") to avoid information
	loss, the risk of having those header fields dropped and
	its implications must be identified.  In particular,
	if the Downgraded header fields are dropped,
	there is no possibility of
	reconstructing the original information
	at any point (before, during, or after delivery).
	Such gateways violate <xref target="RFC2979" /> and can be upgraded to correct the problem.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Even though the information is not lost, the original
	  message cannot be perfectly reconstructed
	  because some downgrading methods remove information
	  (see <xref target="element:received" /> and
	  <xref target="element:mimevalue" />).
	  Hence, downgrading is a one-way process.
	</t>
	<t>
   While information in any email header field should usually treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   Currently, information in the new Downgraded-* header fields is usually
   not inspected by these mechanisms, and may be even less trustworthy
   than the traditional header fields.
   Note that the Downgraded-* header fields could have been inserted with malicious intent.
   (and with content unrelated to the traditional header fields).
	</t>
	<t>
   If an internationalized MUA would simply try to "upgrade" the message for
   display purposes (that is, display the information in the
   Downgraded-* header fields instead of the traditional header fields), the
   effectiveness of the deployed mechanisms and protocols is likely to
   be reduced, and the user may be exposed to additional risks.
   More guidance on how to display downgraded messages will be given
   in <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-downgraded-display" />.
	</t>
	<t>
   Concerns about the trustworthiness of the Downgraded-* header fields
   are not limited to displaying and replying in MUAs, and should be carefully
   considered before using them for other purposes as well.

  <section title="Implementation notes">
    <section title="RFC 2047 encoding">
    <t>
  While <xref target="RFC2047" /> has a specific algorithm to deal with whitespace in
  adjacent encoded-words, there are a number of deployed implementations
  that fail to implement the algorithm correctly.  As a result, whitespace
  behavior is somewhat unpredictable in practice when multiple encoded words
  are used.  While RFC 5322 states that implementations SHOULD limit lines
  to not more than 78 characters, implementations MAY choose to allow
  overlong encoded words in order to work around faulty <xref target="RFC2047" /> 
  implementations.  Implementations that choose to do so SHOULD have an
  optional mechanism to limit line length to 78 characters.

    <section title="Trivial downgrading">
    <t>
Downgrading is an alternative to avoid the rejection of messages
which require UTF8SMTP support by a server which does not provide
this. Implementing the full specification of this document is
desirable, but a partial implementation is also possible.
    </t>
    <t>
If a partial downgrading implementation confronts an unsupported
downgrading target, the implementation MUST NOT send the message
to a server which does not support UTF8SMTP.  Instead, it MUST
reject the message or generate a notification of
non-deliverability.
    </t>
    <t>
	A partial downgrading, Trivial downgrading is discussed.
	It does not support non-ASCII addresses
	   in SMTP envelope and address header fields,
	   unknown header fields downgrading,
	   the MIME body part header fields downgrading.
	It supports 
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>some simple header fields downgrading: Subject</t>
	    <t>comments and display name downgrading: From, To, Cc</t>
	    <t>trace header field downgrading: Received</t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	Otherwise, the downgrading fails.
    </t>
	<t>
	Trivial downgrading targets mail messages which are generated by
	UTF8SMTP aware MUAs and contain
	non-ASCII characters in comments, display names, unstructured parts
	without using non-ASCII E-mail addresses.
	This mail message does not contain non-ASCII E-mail addresses in the SMTP Envelope
	and its header fields. But it is not deliverable via a UTF8SMTP un-aware SMTP server.
	Implementing full specification downgrading may be hard,
	but trivial downgrading saves mail messages without using non-ASCII 
	addresses.

	This section shows an SMTP Downgrading example.
	Consider a mail message where:

	  <t>
	    The sender address is "NON-ASCII-local@example.com" which is a non-ASCII
	    address. Its ASCII alternative is "ASCII-local@example.com" and its display-name is "DISPLAY-local".
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The "To:" address is "NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net" which is a non-ASCII address. Its
	    ASCII alternative is "ASCII-remote1@example.net" and its display-name is "DISPLAY-remote1".
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The "Cc:" address is a non-ASCII address "NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org"
		without alternative ASCII address.
		Its display-name is "DISPLAY-remote2".
	  </t>
	  <t>Three display-names contain non-ASCII characters.</t>
	  <t>
	    The Subject header field is "NON-ASCII-SUBJECT" which contains non-ASCII
	    characters.
	  </t>
	  <t>Assuming the "To:" recipient's MTA (example.net) does not support UTF8SMTP.</t>
	  <t>assuming the "Cc:" recipient's MTA (example.org) supports UTF8SMTP.</t>

	The example SMTP envelope/message is shown in <xref target="example-originaleaismtpsession" />.
	In this example, the "To:" recipient's session is the focus.

	In many cases, the sender wants to use non-ASCII address and
	the recipient is a traditional mail user.
	The SMTP server handing mail for the recipient and/or the recipient's MUA does not support UTF8SMTP extension.
	Consider a mail message where:  
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	    The sender address is "NON-ASCII-local@example.com" which is a non-ASCII

	  </t>
