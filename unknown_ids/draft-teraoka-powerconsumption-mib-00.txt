Internet-Draft            Power Consumption MIB             October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for monitoring power consumption with IP network element that
   has a function of dynamic performance control.  The router with a
   dynamic performance control lowers the operation clock frequency when
   the amount of traffic decreases and suppresses a surplus performance.
   As a result, power consumption is decreased.  The amount of traffic
   is forecast according to the schedule of day of the week
   specification.  This MIB is used to know the situation of power
   consumption, traffic and the state of the engine.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The purpose of this MIB is to provide monitoring power consumption
   and traffic information.

   The Power Consumption MIB module (POWER-CONSUMPTION-MIB) is designed
   to:

   o  Provide property information about rated power consumption and
      traffic on network device.

   o  Support querying of the module constitution of the network device.

Internet-Draft            Power Consumption MIB             October 2009


   o  Support monitoring of modules' measured power consumption
      information.

   o  Support monitoring of modules' measured traffic information.

4.1.  The module constitution of the network device

   In order to understand the current power consumption of the entire
   router, you can accomplish with a simple configuration of MIB
   objects.  But if you try to reduce the power consumption of the
   router, you need to get more detailed information.

   This MIB assumes that the router is composed of control plane,
   forwarding plane and network interface.  It thinks about these three
   pieces as an element to control the electric power.  Individual
   information is collected from these modules, and the operational
   condition of each module is understood.  The judgment whether an
   appropriate setting can be achieved becomes possible by knowing
   operation information, and it is possible to reflect it in the policy
   decision in the future.  As a result, the engine control of three
   modules achieves reduction of the consumption electricity.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the POWER CONSUMPTION MIB
   module.  The objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  pconObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the POWER
      CONSUMPTION MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into
      the following groups:

      *  General Group - This group contains the objects which describe
         power consumption and transfer capacity to network device.

      *  Module Information Group - Contains information describing the
         details of the module.

      *  Power Consumption Group - Contains information describing the
         power consumption.

      *  Traffic Group - Contains information describing the traffic.

   o  pconConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this POWER CONSUMPTION MIB.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The POWER CONSUMPTION MIB
   does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The POWER CONSUMPTION MIB module requires following MIB modules for
   IMPORTS:

   o  SNMPv2-SMI defined in [RFC2578]

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT



Teraoka, et al.          Expires April 21, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            Power Consumption MIB             October 2009


   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------
