1. Introduction and Scope
   This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.  The motivation and 
   applicability for this benchmarking is described in [Po09a].  
   The terminology to be used for this benchmarking is described 
   in [Po09t].  Service Providers use IGP Convergence time as a key 
   metric of router design and architecture.  Customers of Service 
   Providers observe convergence time by packet loss, so IGP Route 
   Convergence is considered a Direct Measure of Quality (DMOQ).  The 
   test cases in this document are black-box tests that emulate the 
   network events that cause route convergence, as described in 
   [Po09a].  The black-box test designs benchmark the data plane and 
   account for all of the factors contributing to convergence time, 
   as discussed in [Po09a].  Convergence times are measured at the 
   Tester on the data plane by observing packet loss through the DUT.  
   The methodology (and terminology) for benchmarking route 
   convergence can be applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS 
   [Ca90] and OSPF [Mo98] and others.  These methodologies apply to 
   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and IGPs.

   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.  

   This document adopts the definition format in Section 2 of RFC 1242 
   [Br91]. This document uses much of the terminology defined in 
   [Po09t].  This document uses existing terminology defined in other 
   BMWG work.  Examples include, but are not limited to: 
            
             Throughput                [Ref.[Br91], section 3.17] 
             Device Under Test (DUT)   [Ref.[Ma98], section 3.1.1] 
             System Under Test (SUT)   [Ref.[Ma98], section 3.1.2] 
             Out-of-order Packet       [Ref.[Po06], section 3.3.2] 
             Duplicate Packet          [Ref.[Po06], section 3.3.3]
             Packet Loss               [Ref.[Po09t], Section 3.5] 
      
3.  Test Setup	

   3.1 Test Topologies	

   Convergence times are measured at the Tester on the data plane 
   by observing packet loss through the DUT.  Figure 1 shows the test 
   topology to measure IGP Route Convergence due to local Convergence 
   Events such as Link Failure, Layer 2 Session Failure, IGP  
   Adjacency Failure, Route Withdrawal, and route cost change.  These 
   test cases discussed in section 4 provide route convergence times 
   that include the Event Detection time, SPF Processing time, and 
   FIB Update time.  

   Figure 2 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence 
   time due to remote changes in the network topology.  These times 
   are measured by observing packet loss in the data plane at the  
   Tester.  In this topology the three routers are considered a System 
   Under Test (SUT).  A Remote Interface [Po09t] failure on router R2 
   MUST result in convergence of traffic to router R3.  NOTE: All 
   routers in the SUT must be the same model and identically 
   configured.

   Figure 3 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence 
   time with members of an Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) Set.  These 
   times are measured by observing packet loss in the data plane at
   the Tester.  In this topology, the DUT is configured with each 
   Egress interface as a member of an ECMP set and the Tester emulates 
   multiple next-hop routers (emulates one router for each member).

   Figure 4 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence 
   time with members of a Parallel Link.  These times are measured by 
   observing packet loss in the data plane at the Tester.  In this 
   topology, the DUT is configured with each Egress interface as a 
   member of a Parallel Link and the Tester emulates the single 
   next-hop router.

   3.2 Test Considerations
   3.2.1 IGP Selection
   The test cases described in section 4 MAY be used for link-state
   IGPs, such as ISIS or OSPF.  The Route Convergence test methodology 
   is identical.  The IGP adjacencies are established on the Preferred 
   Egress Interface and Next-Best Egress Interface.

   3.2.2 Routing Protocol Configuration
   The obtained results for IGP Route Convergence may vary if 
   other routing protocols are enabled and routes learned via those 
   protocols are installed.  IGP convergence times MUST be benchmarked
   without routes installed from other protocols.

   When performing test cases, advertise a single IGP topology from 
   Tester to DUT on the Preferred Egress Interface [Po09t] and 
   Next-Best Egress Interface [Po09t] using the test setup shown in 
   Figure 1.  These two interfaces on the DUT must peer with 
   different emulated neighbor routers for their IGP adjacencies.  
   The IGP topology learned on both interfaces MUST be the same 
   topology with the same nodes and routes. 

   3.2.3 IGP Route Scaling
   The number of IGP routes will impact the measured IGP Route 
   Convergence.  To obtain results similar to those that would be 
   observed in an operational network, it is RECOMMENDED that the 
   number of installed routes and nodes closely approximates that 
   of the network (e.g. thousands of routes with tens of nodes).  
   The number of areas (for OSPF) and levels (for ISIS) can impact 
   the benchmark results.

INTERNET-DRAFT          Benchmarking Methodology for      March 2009
               Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   3.2.4 Timers
   There are some timers that will impact the measured IGP Convergence 
   time. Benchmarking metrics may be measured at any fixed values for 
   these timers.  It is RECOMMENDED that the following timers be 
   configured to the minimum values listed: 

        Timer                                   Recommended Value
        -----                                   -----------------
        Link Failure Indication Delay           <10milliseconds
        IGP Hello Timer                         1 second
        IGP Dead-Interval                       3 seconds
        LSA Generation Delay                    0 
        LSA Flood Packet Pacing                 0
        LSA Retransmission Packet Pacing        0
        SPF Delay                               0

   3.2.5 Interface Types
   All test cases in this methodology document may be executed with any 
   interface type.  All interfaces MUST be the same media and Throughput 
   [Br91][Br99] for each test case.  The type of media may dictate which 
   test cases may be executed.  This is because each interface type has 
   a unique mechanism for detecting link failures and the speed at which 
   that mechanism operates will influence the measure results.  Media 
   and protocols MUST be configured for minimum failure detection delay 
   to minimize the contribution to the measured Convergence time.  For 
   example, configure SONET with the minimum carrier-loss-delay.  All 
   interfaces SHOULD be configured as point-to-point.

   3.2.6 Packet Sampling Interval
   The Packet Sampling Interval [Po09t] value is the fastest measurable 
   convergence time.  The RECOMMENDED value for the Packet Sampling 
   Interval to be set on the Tester is 10 milliseconds.  The Packet 
   Sampling Interval MUST be reported.  
   
   3.2.7 Offered Load
   The offered load MUST be the Throughput of the device as defined in 
   [Br91] and benchmarked in [Br99] at a fixed packet size.  At least 
   one packet per route in the FIB for all routes in the FIB MUST be 
   offered to the DUT within the Packet Sampling interval.  Packet 
   size is measured in bytes and includes the IP header and payload.  
   The packet size is selectable and MUST be recorded.  The Throughput
   MUST be measured at the Preferred Egress Interface and the 
   Next-Best Egress Interface.  The duration of offered load MUST be 
   greater than the convergence time.  

   The destination addresses for the offered load MUST be distributed 
   such that all routes are matched and each route is offered an equal 
   share of the total Offered Load.  This requirement for the Offered 
   Load to be distributed to match all destinations in the route table 
   creates separate flows that are offered to the DUT.  The capability 
   of the Tester to measure packet loss for each individual flow

INTERNET-DRAFT          Benchmarking Methodology for      March 2009
               Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   (identified by the destination address matching a route entry) and 
   the scale for the number of individual flows for which it can 
   measure packet loss should be considered when benchmarking 
   Route-Specific Convergence [Po09t].  

   3.2.8 Selection of Convergence Time Benchmark Metrics and Methods

   The methodologies in the section 4 test cases MAY be applied to 
   benchmark Full Convergence Time, First Route Convergence Time, 
   Reversion Convergence Time, and Route-Specific Convergence Time
   [Po09t].  The First Route Convergence Time benchmark metric MAY 
   be measured while measuring any of these convergence benchmarks.
   The benchmarking metrics may be obtained using either the 
   Loss-Derived Convergence Method or Rate-Derived Convergence 
   Method.  It is RECOMMENDED that the Rate-Derived Convergence 
   Method be measured when benchmarking convergence times.  The
   Loss-Derived Convergence Method is not the preferred method to 
   measure convergence benchmarks because it can produce a result 
   that is faster than the actual convergence time.  When the  
   Packet Sampling Interval is too large, the Rate-Derived 
   Convergence Method may produce a larger than actual convergence 
   time.  In such cases the Loss-Derived Convergence Method may 
   produce a more accurate result. 

   3.2.9 Tester Capabilities
   It is RECOMMENDED that the Tester used to execute each test case
   have the following capabilities:
      1. Ability to establish IGP adjacencies and advertise a single 
         IGP topology to one or more peers.
      2. Ability to produce convergence Event Triggers [Po09t].
      3. Ability to insert a timestamp in each data packet's IP
         payload.
      2. An internal time clock to control timestamping, time 
         measurements, and time calculations.
      3. Ability to distinguish traffic load received on the 
         Preferred and Next-Best Interfaces [Po09t].
      4. Ability to disable or tune specific Layer-2 and Layer-3
         protocol functions on any interface(s).

    It is not required that the Tester be capable of making non-data 
    plane convergence observations nor to use those observations for 
    measurements.

   For each test case, it is recommended that the reporting table below
   is completed and all time values SHOULD be reported with resolution 
   as specified in [Po09t].

4. Test Cases
   It is RECOMMENDED that all applicable test cases be performed for
   best characterization of the DUT.  The test cases follow a generic 
   procedure tailored to the specific DUT configuration and Convergence 
   Event[Po09t].  This generic procedure is as follows:

      1. Establish DUT configuration and install routes.
      2. Send offered load with traffic traversing Preferred Egress 
         Interface [Po09t].
      3. Introduce Convergence Event to force traffic to Next-Best 
         Egress Interface [Po09t].
      4. Measure First Route Convergence Time.
      5. Measure Full Convergence Time and, optionally, the 
         Route-Specific Convergence Times.
      6. Wait the Sustained Convergence Validation Time to ensure there 
         is no residual packet loss.
      7. Recover from Convergence Event.
      8. Measure Reversion Convergence Time, and optionally the First 
         Route Convergence Time and Route-Specific Convergence Times.

      the Preferred Egress Interface [Po09t] and Next-Best Egress 
      Interface [Po09t] using the topology shown in Figure 1.  Set the

      DUT on Ingress Interface [Po09t].
   3. Verify traffic is routed over Preferred Egress Interface.
   4. Remove link on DUT's Preferred Egress Interface. This is the 
      Convergence Event Trigger[Po09t] that produces the Convergence 
      Event Instant [Po09t].
   5. Measure First Route Convergence Time [Po09t] as DUT detects the 
      link down event and begins to converge IGP routes and traffic
      over the Next-Best Egress Interface.
   6. Measure Full Convergence Time [Po09t] as DUT detects the 
      link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic over 
      the Next-Best Egress Interface.  Optionally, Route-Specific 
      Convergence Times [Po09t] MAY be measured.   
   7. Stop offered load.  Wait 30 seconds for queues to drain.  
      Restart offered load.
   8. Restore link on DUT's Preferred Egress Interface.
   9. Measure Reversion Convergence Time [Po09t], and optionally 
      measure First Route Convergence Time and Route-Specific 
      Convergence Times, as DUT detects the link up event and 
      converges all IGP routes and traffic back to the Preferred 
      Egress Interface.

      Interface is the preferred next-hop.  
   2. Send offered load at measured Throughput with fixed packet 
      size to destinations matching all IGP routes from Tester to 
      SUT on Ingress Interface [Po09t].
   3. Verify traffic is routed over Preferred Egress Interface.
   4. Remove link on Tester's Neighbor Interface [Po09t] connected to

      Trigger [Po09t] that produces the Convergence Event Instant 
      [Po09t].

      link down event and begins to converge IGP routes and traffic
      over the Next-Best Egress Interface.
   6. Measure Full Convergence Time [Po09t] as SUT detects 
      the link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic 
      over the Next-Best Egress Interface.  Optionally, Route-Specific 
      Convergence Times [Po09t] MAY be measured. 
   7. Stop offered load.  Wait 30 seconds for queues to drain.  
      Restart offered load.
   8. Restore link on Tester's Neighbor Interface connected to 
      DUT's Preferred Egress Interface.
   9. Measure Reversion Convergence Time [Po09t], and optionally 
      measure First Route Convergence Time [Po09t] and Route-Specific 
      Convergence Times [Po09t], as DUT detects the link up event and 
      converges all IGP routes and traffic back to the Preferred Egress 
      Interface. 

   Results
   The measured IGP Convergence time is influenced by the link failure 
   indication, LSA/LSP Flood Packet Pacing, LSA/LSP Retransmission 
   Packet Pacing, LSA/LSP Generation time, SPF delay, SPF Hold time, 
   SPF Execution Time, Tree Build Time, and Hardware Update Time 
   [Po09a].  This test case may produce Stale Forwarding [Po09t] due to 
   microloops which may increase the measured convergence times.

      Egress Interface [Po09t] and Next-Best Egress Interface [Po09t] 
      using the test setup shown in Figure 1.  These two interfaces 
      on the DUT must peer with different emulated neighbor routers 
      for their IGP adjacency.  The IGP topology learned on both 
      interfaces MUST be the same topology with the same nodes and 
      routes. It is RECOMMENDED that the IGP routes be IGP external 
      routes for which the Tester would be emulating a preferred and

      Preferred Egress Interface [Po09t] and Next-Best Egress 
      Interface [Po09t] using the test setup shown in Figure 1.  
      These two interfaces on the DUT must peer with different 
      emulated neighbor routers for their IGP adjacency.  The

      topology with the same nodes and routes. It is RECOMMENDED
      that the IGP routes be IGP external routes for which the 
      Tester would be emulating a preferred and a next-best 
      Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR).  Set the cost of

      all IGP routes at DUT's Preferred Egress Interface so that the 
      Next-Best Egress Interface has lower cost and becomes preferred 
      path.  The update message advertising the higher cost MUST be a 
      single unfragmented packet.  This is the Convergence Event 
      Trigger [Po09t] that produces the Convergence Event Instant 
      [Po09t].  The Tester MAY record the time it sends the message 
      advertising the higher cost on the Preferred Egress Interface.

      cost change event and converges all IGP routes and traffic 
      over the Next-Best Egress Interface.  Optionally, Route-Specific

      the link down event and begins to converge IGP routes and 
      traffic over the other ECMP members.  
   7. Measure Full Convergence Time [Po09t] as SUT detects 
      the link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic 
      over the other ECMP members.  At the same time measure 
      Out-of-Order Packets [Po06] and Duplicate Packets [Po06].
      Optionally, Route-Specific Convergence Times [Po09t] MAY be 
      measured. 
   8. Stop offered load.  Wait 30 seconds for queues to drain.  
      Restart offered load.
   9. Restore link on Tester's Neighbor Interface to R2 or R3.
   10. Measure Reversion Convergence Time [Po09t], and optionally 
      measure First Route Convergence Time [Po09t] and 
      Route-Specific Convergence Times [Po09t], as SUT detects 
      the link up event and converges IGP routes and some 
      distribution of traffic over the restored ECMP member.

   Results
   The measured IGP Convergence time is influenced by Local link 
   failure indication, Tree Build Time, and Hardware Update Time 
   [Po09a].

   4.10 Convergence Due to Parallel Link Interface Failure 

   Objective
   To obtain the IGP Route Convergence due to a local link failure 
   event for a Member of a Parallel Link.  The links can be used 
   for data Load Balancing

   Procedure 
   1. Configure Parallel Link as shown in Figure 4.	
   2. Advertise matching IGP routes and topology from Tester to DUT 
      on each Parallel Link member.

   3. Send offered load at measured Throughput with fixed packet 
      size to destinations matching all IGP routes from Tester to 
      DUT on Ingress Interface [Po09t].
   4. Verify traffic is routed over all members of Parallel Link.
   5. Remove link on Tester's Neighbor Interface [Po09t] connected to 
      one of the DUT's Parallel Link member interfaces.  This is the 
      Convergence Event Trigger [Po09t] that produces the Convergence 
      Event Instant [Po09t].
   6. Measure First Route Convergence Time [Po09t] as DUT detects the 
      link down event and begins to converge IGP routes and traffic
      over the other Parallel Link members.  
   7. Measure Full Convergence Time [Po09t] as DUT detects the 
      link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic over 
      the other Parallel Link members.  At the same time measure 
      Out-of-Order Packets [Po06] and Duplicate Packets [Po06].  
      Optionally, Route-Specific Convergence Times [Po09t] MAY be 
      measured. 
   8. Stop offered load.  Wait 30 seconds for queues to drain.  
      Restart offered load.
   9. Restore link on Tester's Neighbor Interface connected to 
      DUT's Parallel Link member interface.
   10. Measure Reversion Convergence Time [Po09t], and optionally 
      measure First Route Convergence Time [Po09t] and 
      Route-Specific Convergence Times [Po09t],  as DUT 
      detects the link up event and converges IGP routes and some 
      distribution of traffic over the restored Parallel Link member.

   Results
   The measured IGP Convergence time is influenced by the Local
   link failure indication, Tree Build Time, and Hardware Update 
   Time [Po09a].

5. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.

6. Security Considerations
   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to production networks.
   Security threats and how to counter these in SIP and the media 
   layer is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and RFC3711 and various 
   other drafts.  This document attempts to formalize a set of 
   common methodology for benchmarking IGP convergence performance 
   in a lab environment.
