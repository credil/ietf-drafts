Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009


Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
   provide a reference to the alternative ringback tone (RBT) for
   caller, or ring tone (RT) for callee using the Alert-Info header.
   However, the reference addresses only the network resources with
   specific rendering properties.  There is currently no support for
   predefined standard identifiers for ringback tones or semantic
   indications without tied rendering.  To overcome this limitations and
   support new applications a family of the URNs is defined in this
   specification.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] allows for user agent
   servers (UAS) and proxies to provide the specific ringback or ring
   tone to the user agent (UA).  In RFC 3261 this is done by including a
   URI reference in the Alert-Info header field, that points to the
   tone.  The URI reference is most commonly the HTTP URI to the audio
   file.  On the receipt of the Alert-Info header the user agent may
   fetch the referenced ringback or ring tone and play it to the user.

   This mechanism does not ensure interoperability when there is no
   common understanding of the referenced content (different countries
   or vendors, hearing impaired) or when the user wants his own tones
   configured in the end device.  If caller and callee are from the
   different countries, the understanding of the tones may vary
   significantly.  Hearing impaired users may not sense the specific
   tone if it is provided as an audio file.  The tone per se is also not
   useful for automata.

   There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
   Alert-Info header field when not-using an external ring file.  For
   example, consider the PBX special ringtone for an external (to the
   PBX) caller.  Different vendors use different approaches such as:
   Alert-Info: <file://ring.pcm>;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a dummy
   file or: Alert-Info: <file://normal.ring.pcm> or: Alert-Info:
   <sip:normal-ringtone@example.com> As a result, Alert-Info currently
   only works when the same vendor provides proxy and UA, as only then
   is the same "fake" proprietary URI convention is used.

   Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
   tones are tied to particular rendering.  It is not possible to
   provide a semantic indication that signals the intent and allows the
   recipient to decide how to render the received information in an
   appropriate way.

   To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new URN
   namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info header that can be understood by
   an automaton, would allow for programmatic handling including user
   interface adaptation, or conversion to equivalent protocol parameters
   in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) when the client is a
   gateway.  The work to standardize an Alert-Info URN will increase SIP
   interoperability for this header field by replacing proprietary
   conventions.

   Using 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different
   application spaces:

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009


   o  Names for services such as call waiting or automatic callback, not
      tied to any particular rendering.

   o  Names for common ring-tones generated by PBX phone for cases such
      as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback after
      a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.

   o  Names for country-specific tones.

   o  Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
      audio.  They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.

   Some advantages of a URN rather than a URI reference to a
   downloadable resource:

   o  Do not need to download it or deal with security issues associated
      with dereferencing.

   o  No formatting or compatibility issues.

   o  No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
      undesirable.

   o  The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at whatever
      quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by name"
      rather than "by value".

   o  It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it or
      not.

   o  It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.

   The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the URN
   then it will only be able to render a default ringback or ring-tone.
   To provide the general awareness about the Alert-Info URNs this
   document provides IANA template for registering the URNs and defines
   several typical identifiers.


2.  Requirements

   This section discusses the requirements for an identifier to
   transport the semantic of a specific ring or ringback tone.

   REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to o
   provide a semantic indication in the Alert-Info SIP-header that
   signals the intent of the rendering and allows the recipient to
   decide how to render the received information.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009


   REQ-2: The mechanism will allow to ensure interoperability for
   services as call waiting, forward, call forwarding, transfer-recall,
   auto-callback, hold-recall, crisis.

   REQ-3: The mechanism will allow to render common PBX ring tone types.

   REQ-4: The mechanism will allow to render specific country ring- and
   busy-tones.

   REQ-5: The mechanism will allow to render tones for emergency alerts.

   REQ-6: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
   tones, e.g. text or images.

   REQ-7: The mechanism will allow rendering to be semantic, not biased
   towards a a particular representation which might not be suitable for
   all devices or users.

   REQ-7: The mechanism will allow to store the actual encoding locally
   rather than fetching it.

   REQ-9: The mechanism will allow the identifier to be specified "by
   name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy decisions
   whether to use it or not .

   REQ-10: The mechanism will be flexible and can be used for use cases
   not described in this specification .

   REQ-11: The mechanism will allow transmission in SIP requests and
   responses.


3.  Registration template

   Below is the registration template for the 'alert' URN scheme
   according to the RFC 3406 [RFC3406]

   Namespace ID:  alert

   Registration Information:

      Registration version:  1

      Registration date:  TBD

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization:  IETF

      Designated contact:  Laura Liess

      Designated contact email:  l.liess@telekom.de

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is called
      alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure.  The left-most
      label is called "alert-category" and is separated from right-side
      of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a semicolon.  In
      this specification, two categories of alert-identifiers are
      described: the "tone" alert-identifiers and the "service" alert-
      identifiers.

      The "tone" alert-identifier has the general form:

         urn:alert:tone:{tone-indication}

      where the tone-indication identifies the semantic of a tone.



      The "service" alert-identifier has the general form:

         urn:alert:service:{service-indication}

      where the service-indication is a unique identifier for a service
      as call-waiting or transfer-recall.

      The tone-indication and service-indication are hierarchical
      identifiers, consisting of one label or a sequence of labels
      separated by periods.  The left-most label is the most significant
      one and is called 'top-level indication' , while names to the
      right are called 'sub-indication'.  The set of allowable
      characters is the same as that for domain names [RFC1123].  Labels
      are case-insensitive, but MUST be specified in all lower-case.

      Labels can be removed right-to-left excepting the left-most label;
      the resulting tone-indication or service-indication is still
      valid, referring to a more generic tone-indication or service-
      indication.  In other words, if a tone 'x.y.z' exists, the tones
      'x' and 'x.y' are also valid tones.  Each alert indication
      identifier SHALL explicitly define it's validity respective the
      sub-indications.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009




      The ABNF [RFC4234] for the "tone" and "service" alert URNs is
      shown below:



        alert-URN       = "URN:alert:" alert-identifier
        alert-identifier= alert-category ":" alert-indication
        alert-category  = "tone"/" "service"
        alert-indication= top-level *("." sub-indication)
        top-level       = let-dig [ *25let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
        sub-indication  = let-dig [ *let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
        let-dig-hyp     = let-dig / "-"
        let-dig         = ALPHA / DIGIT
        ALPHA           = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z
        DIGIT           = %x30-39 ; 0-9


   Relevant ancillary documentation:  None

   Community considerations:  The alert URN is believed to be relevant
      to a large cross-section of Internet users, including both
      technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and
      with a variety of perception capabilities.  The 'alert' URN will
      allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them
      to better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get
      better feedback on the progress of a call they have made.  User
      interfaces for the perception impaired users can better render the
      ringback indication based on the 'alert' URN.  The assignment of
      identifiers is described in Section 7.  The 'alert' URN does not
      prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but it is assumed
      that a number of different entities could operate and offer such
      mechanisms.

   Namespace considerations:  There do not appear to be other URN
      namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely identifying
      'alert' communication and information services.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:  An 'alert' URN identifies a
      logical service or tone, specified in the 'alert' indication
      registration (see Section 7).  Resolution of the registered URN
      will return a particular instance of the alert identifier.  Alert
      identifier URNs MUST be unique for each unique indication; this is
      guaranteed through the registration of each alert indication
      within this namespace, described in Section 7.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009


   Identifier persistence considerations:  The 'alert' URN for the same
      indication is expected to be persistent, as long as it is
      registered with IANA.

   Process of identifier assignment:  The process of identifier
      assignment is described in Section 7.

   Process for identifier resolution:  'alert' URNs are statically
      resolved according to the IANA registry.

   Rules for lexical equivalence:  'alert' URNs are compared according
      to case-insensitive string equality.

   Conformance with URN syntax:  The BNF in the 'Declaration of
      syntactic structure' above constrains the syntax for this URN
      scheme.

   Validation mechanism:  Validation determines whether a given string
      is currently a validly-assigned URN [RFC3406].  Static validation
      is performed based on the currently registered 'alert' URNs at
      IANA.

   Scope:  The scope for this URN is public and global.


4.  Top Level Alert URN Indication Definitions

   This section describes the use cases that are supported by the
   'alert' URNs.

4.1.  PBX Tones

   This section defines some commonly encountered ring-tones on PBX or
   business phones.  They are as follows:

4.1.1.  normal

   This tone indicates that the default or normal ring-tone should be
   rendered.  This is most useful when Alert-Info header field
   parameters are being used.  For example, in
   [I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances], an Alert-Info header field needs
   to be present containing the "appearance" parameter, but no special
   ringtone need be specified.  If no special alerting is to be used,
   urn:alert:tone:normal should be used.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009


4.1.2.  external

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  This could be a call from the PSTN or from
   a SIP trunk.  For this case, urn:alert:tone:external should be used.

4.1.3.  internal

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  The call could have been originated from
   another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the enterprise.
   For this case, the urn:alert:tone:internal should be used.

4.2.  Public telephone network tones

   This section defines some commonly encountered tones in the public
   telephone service, according to the [E.180] and [E.182].  They are as
   follows.

4.2.1.  ringing

   This tone indicates that the default or normal ring-tone should be
   rendered.  For this case, urn:alert:tone:ringing should be used.

4.2.2.  busy

   This tone indicates that a tone should be rendered that indicates to
   the caller that the callee is busy.  For this case,
   urn:alert:tone:busy should be used.

4.2.3.  intrusion

   This tone indicates that a tone should be rendered that indicates to
   the participants in a call that the privacy of the conversation has
   been breached.  For this case, urn:alert:tone:intrusion should be
   used.

4.2.4.  record

   This tone indicates that a tone should be rendered which advises the
   caller when to begin a message which will be recorded.  For this
   case, urn:alert:tone:record should be used.

4.3.  Service Tones

   These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and telephony services.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                October 2009


4.3.1.  call-waiting

   The call waiting Service [TS24.615] permits a callee to be notified
   of an incoming call whilst the media resources are not available for
   the incoming call and the callee is engaged in an active or held
   call.  Subsequently, the callee can either accept, reject, or ignore
   the incoming call.  There is an interest on the caller side to be
   informed about the call waiting situation on the callee side.  Having
   this information the caller can decide whether to continue waiting
   for callee to pickup or better to call some time later when it is
   estimated that the callee could have finished the ongoing
   conversation.  To provide this information, the callee's UAS or proxy
   aware of the call waiting condition can add the call-waiting
   indication URN to the Alert-Info header.  As call-waiting information
   may be subject to the callee's privacy concerns, the exposure of this
   information SHALL be done only if explicitly required by the user.
   The urn:alert:service:call-waiting should be used for this case.

4.3.2.  forward

   This feature is used in a 180 response when a call forwarding feature
   has been initiated on an INVITE.  Many PBX system implement a
   forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate this.  The
   urn:alert:service:forward should be used for this case.  Note that a
   181 response can be used in place of this URN.

4.3.3.  transfer-recall

   This feature is used when a blind transfer [RFC5589] has been
   performed by a server on behalf of the transferor and fails.  Instead
   of failing the call, the server calls back the transferor, giving
   them another chance to transfer or otherwise deal with the call.
   This service tone is used to distinguish this INVITE from any other
   normal incoming call.  The urn:alert:service:transfer-recall should
   be used for this case.

4.3.4.  auto-callback

   This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to implement
   an automatic callback service.  When the user is available, the
   server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
   distinguish this from any other normal incoming call.  The
   urn:alert:service:auto-callback should be used for this case.

4.3.5.  hold-recall

   This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer on
   behalf of an endpoint.  After a certain period of time of being on

   hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
   retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call.  This service
   tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
   call.  The urn:alert:service:hold-recall should be used for this
   case.

4.3.6.  crisis

   This feature is used for emergency announcements sent over PBX
   systems such as building evacuations, alarms, etc.  This service tone
   is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming call.
   The urn:alert:service:crisis should be used for this case.

4.3.7.  priority

   This sub-level is used to indicate that a priority level alert should
   be applied for the type of alerting specified.  For example,
   urn:alert:tone:priority would be used to generate priority alerting.

4.3.8.  short

   This sub-level is used to indicate that the alert type specified
   should be rendered shorter than normal.  In contact centers, this is
   sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone".  For
   example, urn:alert:tone:short would generate a shorter than normal
   ring-tone.

4.3.9.  delayed

   This sub-level is used to indicate that the alerting type specified
   show be rendered after a short delay.  In some bridged line/shared
   line appearance implementations, this is used so that the bridged
   line does not ring at exactly the same time as the main line, but is
   delayed a few seconds.  For example, urn:alert:tone:delayed would
   generate an external ring-tone, delayed by a few seconds.

4.4.  National Variant Indications for public telephone network tones

   In the PSTN, different tones are used in different countries.  End
   users are accustomed to hear the callee's country ringing or busy
   tone.

   The ISO 3166-1 country code [ISO 3166-1] is used as a top-level to
   indicate which country specific tone should be rendered.  For
   example, to indicate tones from South Africa, the following URN would
   be used: <urn:alert:tone:za>

   The particular rendering for many country specific ringing and busy

   tones is described in [TR 101041] :

4.5.  Combinations of URNs

   In some cases, more than one URN will need to be specified to fully
   define a particular tone.  This is done by including multiple URNs.
   For example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-
   Info: <urn:alert:tone:internal>, <urn:alert:tone:priority>.  A
   priority call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:
   <urn:alert:service:call-waiting>, <urn:alert:tone:priority>.  And
   finally, a short Albanian auto-callback tone could be indicated
   Alert-Info: <urn:alert:service:auto-callback>,
   <urn:alert:tone:short>, <urn:alert:tone:al>.


5.  User Agent Behavior

   Upon receiving a SIP request or a SIP 180 Ringing response with an
   Alert-Info header that contains a single or multiple 'alert' URNs,
   the User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received URNs with the
   known indications.  If no match is found, the User Agent (UA) ignores
   the received 'alert' URNs and proceeds with the normal operation.  If
   the one or multiple URNs matches a known indication, the User Agent
   (UA) renders the indication(s) to the user according to the tone or
   service identifier in the received alert URN.  The User Agent (UA) is
   responsible for the non disturbing rendering if multiple indications
   and network resources are to be rendered simultaneously.


6.  Proxy Behavior

   A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
   in a SIP request or a 180 Ringing provisional response when it needs
   to provide additional information about the call or about the
   provided service.  A SIP Proxy SHOULD NOT add a mixture of the
   'alert' URNs and URIs to the Alert-Info header that may cause
   disturbing rendering interference at the recepient's User Agent (UA).

   Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
   the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service
   transported by the Alert-Info header in a 180 Ringing provisional
   response.

      Alert-Info: <http://www.example.com/sound/moo.wav>,
       <urn:alert:service:call-waiting>

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new URN scheme with the registration
   template provided in section Registration Template.

   Below, the section 7.1 details how to register new alert-identifiers.
   Descriptions of alert-indications for the first two alert-identifiers
   described in this document , service and tone, are given in Section
   7.2 and Section 7.3, respectively.  Finally, Section 7.4 contains the
   initial registration table.

7.1.  New alert-identifiers

   Alert URNs are identified by labels managed by IANA, according to the
   processes outlined in [RFC2434] in a new registry called "Alert URN
   Labels".  Thus, creating a new alert-identifier requires IANA action.
   The policy for adding a new alert-identifier category is 'Standards
   Action'.  (This document defines the alert-identifier categories
   'service' and 'tone'.)  The policy for assigning labels to alert top-
   level indications or sub-indications and the rules to combine top-
   level indications and sub-indications may differ for each alert-
   identifier category and MUST be defined by the document describing
   the coresponding alert indications.  The entries in the registration
   table have the following format:

   Category/             Reference    Description
   Top-Indication/
   Sub-Indication
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   foo                   RFC XXXX     Description of the 'foo' alert-category
   bar                   RFC YYYY     Description of the 'bar' alert-indication
                               of the foo alert-category

   Each alert-category or alert-indication label MUST NOT exceed 27
   characters.

7.2.  Alert-category

   This section defines the alert-identifier registration within the
   IANA registry defined in Section 7.1, using the alert-category labels
   'service' and 'tone'.

   The 'tone' alert-category label provides information about ringing
   tones generated by a UAS and rendered to the callee in response to an
   INVITE.

   The 'service' alert-category label describes tones that should be
   generated by the UAC or UAS and rendered to the caller or calee upon

   receipt of a 180 response or a request.  The normal rendering is
   audio, however there can be other renderings applicable if needed by
   the user interface specifics.

7.3.5.  Indications for "service" alert-indications

   The following table contains the initial IANA registration for
   "service" alert-indications.


        Top-level Indication   Reference   Description
        --------------------------------------------------------
        call-waiting           RFC XXXX    Call waiting service indication
        forward                RFC XXXX    Call forwarding service indication
        transfer-recall        RFC XXXX    Transfer Recall service indication
        auto-callback          RFC XXXX    Auto Callback service indication
        hold-recall            RFC XXXX    Hold Recall service indication
        crisis                 RFC XXXX    Crisis alerting indication

   Editor's Note: RFC XXXX should be replaced with this specification.

7.3.6.  Combination Rule for Alert URN Indications

   Alert URN Indications from the same group should not be combined.


8.  Internationalization Considerations

   The alert-identifier labels are protocol elements [RFC3536] and are
   not normally seen by users.  Thus, the character set for these
   elements is restricted, as described in Section 6.


9.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
   particular security issues.  The indications described by the 'alert'
   URN are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do not
   apply to the URN.

   Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
   privacy issues.  Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised
