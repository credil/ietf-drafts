              Route Flap Damping Deployment Status Survey
             draft-shishio-grow-isp-rfd-implement-survey-02

Abstract

   BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route
   stability.  It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing
   CPU load on the routers.

   But it has side-effects.  Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended not to use
   Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]).

   Now, some researchers propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive
   parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable].

   This document describes results of a survey conducted amoung service
   provider on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.

3.8.1.  Japan

   -Our peer seems to have damping enabled, and our prefix gets damped
   sometimes.

Internet-Draft            RFD Depoyment Survey                 June 2011


   -We do not enable damping because we think that customers want a non-
   damped route.

   -From the perspective of a downstream ISP, if our upstream told us
   that an outage occurred because a route was damped, I may call and
   ask "is it written in the agreement that you will do this?"

   -We use damping pretty heavily

   -I had RFD turned on until this morning when I discovered our router
   has CSCtd26215 issues.  I would like to turn on a "useful" RFD.

3.8.2.  Global

   -Statistical reports from big Service Providers may better visualize
   the situation.

   -best current practices is nice, but always needs to be adjusted to
   reflect local network settings.

   -We used RFD in the past and came to the conclusion that we do not
   want to use RFD any more.  We still have it configured to be able to
   get Flap statistics out of our Cisco boxes, but no prefixes get
   dampended

   -We recently removed all RFD from the configs due to the information
   read on the topic among the preso's on the NANOG Archive.

   -after seeing this survey, I read the draft; sounds promising; would
   be nice to see vendors start to implement it.

   -Q3, other: Juniper RFD is broken, default values count penalty for
   both update and withdrawal, and they would not fix that.  No clear
   motivation for us, has caused outage when our customers (with
   primiary and backup connection to us) had a flapping link.

   -Strong desire to see the path vector penalized rather than the
   prefix.


4.  Summary of data

   From the survey we see that there are many service providers with RFD
   disabled.  The reason varies among providers, but it is clear that
   there are those who wish that RFD was made useful.
   [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable] describes how to improve RFD with minor
   changes to some parameters.  From the comments in the survey, the
   most significant fear of enabling RFD is its impact on customers.
