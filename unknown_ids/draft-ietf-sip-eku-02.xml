</figure>

<t>An user, alice@example.com, invites bob@example.net for a multimedia
communication session.  Her user agent routes the request to a proxy,
in her domain.  Assume also that example.com is a large organization 
that maintains several SIP proxies, and normal request forwarding rules 
cause her invitation to be sent to an outbound proxy, Proxy-A.example.com.
This proxy uses RFC 3263 <xref target="RFC3263"/> resolution to discover
that Proxy-B.example.net offers TLS support and can accept the request
on behalf of the example.net domain.  Proxy-A establishes a TLS
connection to Proxy-B, each proxy presents a X.509 certificate to 
authenticate and protect the confidentiality of the connection.
This is the basic mututal authentication model explored in depth in
<xref target="I-D.domain-certs"/>.</t>

<t>However, there arise certain cases where one SIP proxy needs to know
whether it has reached an authoritative proxy in target SIP domain.  For
instance, billing transactions may be triggered when an authoritative SIP 
proxy in one domain sends messages to its equivalent in another domain.
In <xref target="sip-trapezoid"/>, Proxy-A.example.com performs certain DNS
queries to arrive at Proxy-B.example.net.  Because of the answers to the
DNS queries, Proxy-A has a certain expectation that Proxy-B is a valid
proxy in the example.net domain and is authorized to receive inbound
requests targeted to that domain.</t>

<t>The problem for Proxy-B is different: it accepts a connection from a 
specific host (Proxy-A.example.com) but what it needs to determine is
whether or not that connection can be treated as coming authoritatively
from a particular SIP domain.  If Proxy-B receives a certificate tha
only contains the identity "sip:Proxy-A.example.com", it is unable to
make a determination that Proxy-A is authorized to act as a SIP outbound
proxy for the example.com domain (note that example.com domain may
use different inbound proxies, so SIP DNS resolution of "sip:example.com"
may not lead to "Proxy-A.example.com".)  Certificate usage in SIP 
cannot require that every outbound proxy for a domain also serve as
its inbound proxy.  Thus, there is a need for an extra attribute that 
allows an inbound proxy to know that its peer is an authorized proxy for 
that domain.  This document discusses such an attribute as part of the
X.509 certificate exchanged by the proxies when a TLS connection is 
first established.</t>

</section> <!-- Problem statement -->

<section title="Restricting usage to SIP" anchor="sipusage">

<t>This memo defines a certificate profile for binding a SIP
domain name to an entity.  A SIP domain name is frequently textually 
identical to the same DNS name used for other purposes.  For example, the DNS 
name example.com may serve as a SIP domain name, an email domain name, and 
web service name.  Since these different services within a single organization 
might be administered independently and hosted separately, it should be 
possible to create a certificate that binds the DNS name to its usage as a 
SIP domain name without creating the implication that the usage is also valid 
for some other purpose.  RFC5280 <xref target="RFC5280"/> section 
4.2.1.12 defines a mechanism for this purpose: an "Extended Key Usage" 
attribute.  Certificates whose purpose is to bind a SIP domain 
identity without binding other non-SIP identities MUST include an 
id-kp-SIPdomain attribute.
</t>

<section title="Extended Key Usage values for SIP domains">
  <t>
    RFC 5280 <xref target="RFC5280"/> specifies the EKU
    X.509 certificate Extension for use in the Internet.  The 
    extension indicates one or more purposes for which the certified public 
    key may be used.  The EKU extension can be used in conjunction with 
    the key usage extension, which indicates how the public key in the 
    certificate may be used, in a more basic cryptographic way.
  </t>
  <figure>
    <preamble>
      The EKU extension syntax is repeated here for
      convenience:
    </preamble>
    <artwork>
      ExtKeyUsageSyntax  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

      KeyPurposeId  ::=  OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    </artwork>
  </figure>
  <t>
    This specification defines the KeyPurposeId id-kp-sipDomain. 

  <figure>
    <artwork>
      id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=
         { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
           security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) 3 }

      id-kp-sipDomain  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp VALUE-TBD }
    </artwork>
  </figure>

    Inclusion of this KeyPurposeId in a certificate indicates that 
    any DNS subject names in the certificate are intended to identify 
    the holder as authoritative for a SIP service in the domain named by 
    the subjectAltName values.  Whether or not to include this restriction 
    is up to the certificate issuer, but if it is included, it SHOULD 
    be marked as critical.
    <list style="empty">
     <t>This is so that implementations that understand this extension
     will honor it while those that do not are not impeded by its 
     presence.</t>
    </list>
   </t>

  <t>See <xref target='using-eku'/> for how the presence of an
  id-kp-sipDomain value affects the interpretation of the certificate.</t>

</section> <!-- problem-mutual -->

<section title="Using the SIP EKU in a certificate" anchor="using-eku">

<t>Section 7.1 of <xref target="I-D.domain-certs"/> contains two steps
for finding an identity (or a set of identities) in an X.509 certificate.
In order to determine whether the SIP entity presenting the certificate
is authoritative for its domain, implementations MUST perform the 
step given below first, and then proceed with the steps in 
Section 7.1 of <xref target="I-D.domain-certs"/>.
</t>

<t>The Extended Key Usage value(s), if any, MUST be examined to determine
whether or not the certificate is valid for use in SIP (note that in
the steps below, we assume that the certificate is otherwise valid 
following the checks in RFC5280 <xref target="RFC5280"/>):

<list style='symbols'>

  <t>If the certificate does not contain any EKU values (the Extended Key
  Usage extension does not exist), it is a matter of local policy whether
  or not to accept the certificate for use as a SIP certificate.</t>

  <t>If the certificate contains the id-kp-sipDomain EKU extension, then
  the certificate MUST be acceptable as valid for use as a SIP
  certificate.</t>

  <t>If the certificate does not contain the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value, but
  does contain the id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU value, it is a matter of
  local policy whether or not to accept it for use as a SIP
  certificate.</t>

  <t>If the certificate does not contain the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value, but
  does contain either the id-kp-serverAuth or id-kp-clientAuth EKU values,
  it is a matter of local policy whether or not to accept it for use as a
  SIP certificate.
   <list style="empty">
    <t>id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth EKU values are defined in
    Section 4.2.1.12 of RFC 5280 <xref target="RFC5280"/>.</t>
   </list>
  </t>

  <t>If EKU extension exists but does not contain any of the
  id-kp-sipDomain, id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth, or
  id-kp-clientAuth EKU values, then the certificate MUST NOT be 
  considered acceptable as being authoritative for the domain portion 
  of the SIP domain identities contained in the certificate.
   <list style="empty">
    <t>The term "SIP domain identity" is defined in RFC XXXX <xref
    target="I-D.domain-certs"/>.</t>
   </list>
  </t>
</list>
</t>

</section> <!-- using-eku -->

<section title="Guidelines for a Certification Authority" anchor="ca">

<t>The procedures and practices employed by the certification authority
MUST ensure that the correct values for the EKU extension and subjectAltName 
are inserted in each certificate that is issued.  For certificates that
indicate authority over a SIP domain, but not over services other than
SIP, certificate authorities SHOULD include the id-kp-sipDomain EKU 
extension.</t>

</section> <!-- ca -->

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-cons">

<t>This memo defines an EKU X.509 certificate extension that enables
the holder of a certificate to be authoritative for a SIP service
belonging to an autonomous domain.  Relying parties may execute applicable
policies (such as those related to billing) on receiving a certificate
with the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value.  An id-kp-sipDomain EKU value
does not introduce any new security or privacy concerns.  At the very most,
it simply allows the relying party to know that the holder of the certificate
is authoritative for the SIP service in a certain domain.  In the absence
of the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value, this information can be collected over
time by a peer in any case.</t>

</section> <!-- Security Considerations -->

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana-cons">

<!-- This text is taken from rfc5055, S10. -->

<t>The id-kp-sipDomain purpose requires an object idenitifier (OID).
The objects are defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX 
working group.  No further action is necessary by IANA.</t>
