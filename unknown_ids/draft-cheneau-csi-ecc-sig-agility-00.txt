   Cryptography (ECC) alongside with Cryptographically Generated
   Addresses (CGA) and the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND).  This

Internet-Draft   ECC PK and sig. support in CGA and SEND    October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The usage scenarios associated with neighbor discovery have recently
   been extended to include environments with mobile or nomadic nodes.
   Many of these nodes have limited battery power and computing
   resources.  Therefore, heavy public key signing algorithms like RSA
   are not feasible to support on such constrained nodes.  Fortunately,
   more lightweight yet secure signing algorithms do exist and have been
   standardized, e.g.  Elliptic Curve based algorithms.

   It is then a worthwhile goal to extend secure neighbor discovery to
   support this signing algorithm.

   The aim of this memo is to outline options for allowing Elliptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for nodes configured to perform
   secure neighbor discovery operations.  The present document exposes
   how to use and deploy Elliptic Curve Cryptography in [RFC3972],
   [cheneau-csi-cga-pk-agility] and [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility].  It
   should be noted that the two latter documents have impacts on
   existing specifications [RFC3971] and [RFC3972].

2.  Choice of Elliptic Curve

   This document follows NIST's recommendation on the usage of various
   Elliptic Curves as per [FIPS-186-3].  For the sake of simplicity,
   this document only describes the use of three proposed curves, namely
   curve P-256 (aka secp256r1), curve P-384 (aka secp384r1) and curve
   P-521 (aka secp521r1).

3.  Using ECC in CGA

   The CGA generation and verification processes remain unmodified from
   the processes described in [RFC3972].  However, we extend section 3
   of [RFC3972], as it contains RSA specific text.  We add that, when
   ECDSA is used, the AlgorithmIdentifier, contained in ASN.1 structure
   of type SubjectPublicKeyInfo, must be the (unrestricted) id-
   ecPublicKey algorithm identifier, which is OID 1.2.840.10045.2.1, and
   the subjectPublicKey MUST be formatted as an ECC Public Key,
   specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].

   Note that the ECC key lengths are determined by the namedCurves
   parameter stored in ECParameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier.

4.  Using ECC in the Public Key extension field

   The optional Public Key extension field of the CGA Parameters data
   structure, defined in [cheneau-csi-cga-pk-agility], enables a node to
   generate CGA addresses with more than one Public Key. The encoding of
   the Public Key inside the Public Key extension field is the same
   encoding as the one presented in Section 3.

5.  Signature Type Identifier for ECC

   In the document [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility], a field named
   Signature Type Identifier is used by the Supported Signature
   Algorithm Option and the Universal Signature Option (that replaces
   the RSA Signature Option).  This field indicates the Signature
   Algorithm available on the node to generate or verify the Digital
   Signature field of the Universal Signature Option.

   This document describes new values for three different signature
   algorithms.  This value are extracted from the IANA-defined numbers
   for the IKEv2 protocol, i.e.  IANA registry named "IKEv2
   Authentication Method" and are the following:

   o  Value 9 is ECDSA with SHA-256 on the P-256 curve

   o  Value 10 is ECDSA with SHA-384 on the P-384 curve

   o  Value 11 is ECDSA with SHA-512 on the P-521 curve

6.  Using ECDSA with Universal Signature Option

   The document [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility] proposes the Universal
   Signature Option (extended from the RSA Signature Option of
   [RFC3971]).  This option adds a new Signature Type Identifier field
   that identifies the signature algorithm used during the generation of
   the digital signature field.

   When the value of the Signature Type Identifier field is 9, 10 or 11,
   this Digital Signature field is computed and verified using the ECDSA
   signature algorithm (as defined on [SEC1]) and hash function
   corresponding to the Signature Type Identifier field.  The data on
   which the signature is performed are described in
   [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility].

7.  Security Considerations

   This memo defines the usage of the ECC Public Key and Signature
   Algorithm in CGA and SEND.  As recommended in
   [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility], when a node is using a multiple-key
   CGA (according to [cheneau-csi-cga-pk-agility]), the weakest key
   determines the strength of a multiple-key CGA.  Table 1 (from
   [SP800-57]), presents a comparison between the length of the RSA keys
   and their equivalent (security-wise) ECC keys.

             +-----------------------+-----------------------+
             | RSA key length (bits) | ECC key length (bits) |
             +-----------------------+-----------------------+

   Table 3: Common sizes of the Digital Signature field when using ECDSA
                             (+ DER encoding)

   Appendix A of document [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility] emphasises the
   impact of the Public Key size on size of the final message.  This
   Appendix proposes to extend previous document and to add values for
   ECC.  Table 2 provides size for the commonly used DER-encoded ECC
   Public Keys.  Table 3 presents common sizes for Digital Signature
   field when using ECDSA.

   Reusing the value computed in [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility], we
   deduce that a Router Advertisement carrying a Prefix Information
   Option and a Source Link-Layer Option sent from a CGA formed with a
   P-256 EC Public and protected by a corresponding ECDSA signature is
   328 bytes long.  This can be compared with the same message using a
   CGA carrying a 1024 bits RSA whose length is 456 bytes.

   We can also evaluate the cost of the transformation of a legacy CGA
   to a multiple-key CGA.  Using a 1024 RSA Public Key (as described in
   Appendix A of [cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility]) and a ECC P-521 key in
   a CGA Option, the original message, signed with a Universal Signature
   option generated by RSA and a Universal Signature Option signed by

   ECDSA, the Router Advertisement message is 768 bytes long.  Note this
   example illustrates the potential burden of (transitional) multiple
   key CGAs, and also that EC P-521 and 1024-bits RSA keys should not be
   used together because they do not present the same security level
   (see Section 7).  They are shown here to provide an indication on the
   sizes of messages in heterogeneous environments.

Appendix B.  Note for future work

   When specifying a new type of Signature Algorithm, a new draft may
   reuse the skeleton of this document by replacing ECC/ECDSA by the
   appropriate terminology.  In this case, the new draft should include
   an appendix similar to Appendix A for a comparison with already
   specified signature algorithms.
