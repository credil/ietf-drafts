Internet-Draft              Atompub Features                October 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document introduces an extension to the Atom Publishing Protocol
   (Atompub) service document [RFC5023] format that allows for the
   documentation and discovery of behaviors, functions or capabilities
   supported by an Atompub collection.  Examples of such capabilities
   can include the preservation of certain kinds of content, support for
   draft entries, support for the scheduled publication of entries, use
   of a particular set of Atom format extensions, and so on.

   Describing features using the mechanisms defined in this
   specification is currently considered to be largely experimental.
   While there are examples of such mechanisms being put to practical
   use in deployed applications, there is currently not enough
   collective implementation experience to determine whether the
   mechanism defined here is sufficient to fully address the general
   needs of Atom Publishing Protocol client and server implementations.
   Implementations and feedback are encouraged.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-20060816]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

     "f": "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset
   [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a
   shorthand; the phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming
   Element Information Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses
   the terms "element" and "attribute" it is referring, respectively, to
   the Element and Attribute Information Items in Infoset terms.

   This specification uses the terms "atomUri" and
   "atomCommonAttributes" from the non-normative RELAX NG Compact schema
   included in [RFC4287].  Where used, these serve the same purpose and
   have the same meaning as their use in [RFC4287].

   Atom allows the use of IRIs [RFC3987].  Every URI [RFC3986] is also
   an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever below an IRI is named.  There
   are two special considerations: (1) when an IRI that is not also a
   URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a URI using the

Internet-Draft              Atompub Features                October 2007


   steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987] and (2) when an IRI is serving as
   an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.

   Any element defined by this specification MAY have an xml:base
   attribute [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627].  When xml:base is used, it
   serves the function described in section 5.1.1 of [RFC3986],
   establishing the base URI (or IRI) for resolving any relative
   references found within the effective scope of the xml:base
   attribute.

   Any element defined by this specification MAY have an xml:lang
   attribute, whose content indicates the natural language for the
   element and its descendents.  The language context is only
   significant for elements and attributes declared to be "Language-
   Sensitive".  Requirements regarding the content and interpretation of
   xml:lang are specified in XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20060816], Section
   2.12.


3.  The f:feature element

   The f:feature element is used in an app:collection element to declare
   the collection's support for a feature.

     namespace f = "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0"

     feature = element f:feature {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute ref    { atomUri },
       attribute href   { atomUri }?,
       attribute label  { text }?,
       (anyElement)*
     }

     anyElement = element * - f:feature {
       (attribute * { text }
         | text
         | anyElement)*
     }

   The ref attribute specifies a globally unique IRI identifying a
   feature.  The value of the ref attribute MUST be compared on a case-
   sensitive, character-by-character basis.  Relative references MUST
   NOT be used.  The IRI is used strictly for identification and cannot
   be assumed to be dereferenceable.

   An optional href attribute MAY be used to specify a dereferenceable
   IRI of a human-readable description of the feature.  Relative

Internet-Draft              Atompub Features                October 2007


   references MAY be used.

   The optional label attribute MAY be used to specify a human-readable
   label for the feature.  The value of the label attribute is Language-
   Sensitive as defined by Section 2 of [RFC4287].

   The f:feature element MAY contain a mix of text and any number of
   child elements and attributes from any XML namespace, with the
   exception of the f:feature element itself.  Such markup is considered
   to be metadata applicable to the feature identified.  Software agents
   MUST NOT stop processing or signal an error or change their behavior
   as a result of encountering such markup.

   An app:collection element MAY contain any number of f:feature
   elements but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same ref
   attribute value.  The order in which f:feature elements appear within
   the app:collection element is insignificant.

   The presence of a f:feature element is an indication that the
   collection supports the feature identified.  The lack of a f:feature
   element identifying a particular feature indicates that support for
   that feature is unspecified.  This does not mean that the feature is
   not supported, only that the server has not explicitly declared
   support.  There are no means by which a server can indicate that a
   given feature is unsupported.

3.1.  Example

   The following is an example of a collection using the f:feature
   element to indicate its support for the app:draft element as defined
   by [RFC5023].

     <service
       xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
       xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
       xmlns:f="http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0">
       <workspace>
         <atom:title>My Workspace</atom:title>
         <collection href="...">
           <atom:title>My Atom Collection</atom:title>
           <accept>application/atom+xml;type=entry</accept>
           <f:feature
             ref="http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0/supportsDraft" />
         </collection>
       </workspace>
     </service>

4.  The "supportsDraft" Feature

   The "supportsDraft" feature is used to indicate that a collection
   supports the use of the app:draft control element as defined by
   Section 13.1.1 of [RFC5023].  The IRI of the "supportsDraft" feature
   is:
     http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0/supportsDraft


5.  The "ignoresDraft" Feature

   The "ignoresDraft" feature is used to indicate that a collection will
   ignore the use of the app:draft control element as defined by Section
   13.1.1 of [RFC5023].  The IRI of the "ignoresDraft" feature is:
     http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0/ignoresDraft

   A server MUST NOT declare support for both the "supportsDraft" and
   "ignoresDraft" features within the a single app:collection element.


6.  Security Considerations

   Specific features supported by a collection may introduce security
   considerations and concerns beyond those discussed by the Atom
   Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format specifications.
   Implementors must refer to the specifications and description of each
   feature to determine the security considerations relevant to each.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not define any actions for IANA.
