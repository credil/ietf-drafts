    The MOVE extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol <xref
      target="IMAP4"/>
    provides a feature intended to reduce the amount of time and 
    resources used by usual complicated methods of moving messages 
    between mailboxes by providing the capability of directly moving 
    messages.

<section title="Conventions Used in this Document">
<t>
    In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
    server respectively.
</t>
<t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are
    to be interpreted as described in <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Introduction and Overview">
<t>    Most of IMAP clients are moving messages between mailboxes by use of
    sequence of COPY, STORE +FLAGS (\Deleted) and EXPUNGE commands. This,
    though functionally equivalent to moving messages, is a lot more
    complicated on the server side than simple move.  When moving 
    large amounts of messages this can create unnecessary loads and 
    delays on server side.  It also prohibits user from moving a message
    larger than remainings of his quota.
</t><t>
    The MOVE extension allows simple single-command moving of messages 
    between mailboxes without creating additional unnecessary server-side 
    loads and without requiring user consideration about his quota limits 
    when simply moving message and not changing the overall amount of 
    data stored in his account.
</t><t>    
    The MOVE extension is present in any IMAP server implementation which
    returns "MOVE" as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY 
    command.
</t><t>
    The MOVE extension defines one additional command which MUST be
    supported by server that returns supports MOVE extension.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Additional commands">
<t>
The following command definition is an extension to <xref
target="IMAP4"/> section 6.4.
</t>
<section title="MOVE command">

    Arguments:  sequence set
                mailbox name

    Data:       untagged responses: EXPUNGE

    Result:     OK - move completed
                NO - move error: can't move those messages or to that 
                     mailbox
                BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
       The MOVE command moves messages from the currently selected
       mailbox to the end of the specified mailbox.  Messages that are 
       moved are expunged from selected mailbox.  Any messages that are 
       not included in the sequence set or do not exists are unaffected.  
       All flags (including \Deleted) and message internal date are 
       persistent through move.
</t><t>
       If the server does not support the MOVE capability, the client
       should fall back to using the regular COPY, STORE, EXPUNGE
       sequence. 
</t><t>
       Additionally, MOVE command can be directly preceeded by UID
       command, the sequence set argument is then treated as unique
       identifiers sequence instead of message sequence numbers as
       defined in <xref
       target="IMAP4"/> paragraph 6.4.8.
</t><t>
       Command EXPUNGE untagged responses reports that the specified
       message sequence number has been permanently removed from selected
       mailbox (and moved to specified mailbox) as defined in <xref
       target="IMAP4"/>
       paragraph 7.4.1.
</t>
<!-- <t>
       The MOVE command requires server to keep both mailboxes in
       consistent state at all times, at no time should the moved message
       be visible by any concurrent session in both source and destination
       mailboxes or in none of these mailboxes.  If server cannot provide this
       level of consistency this extension MUST NOT be supported.
</t>

    Example:    C: A003 MOVE 3000:3002 Trash
                S: * 3002 EXPUNGE
                S: * 3001 EXPUNGE
                S: * 3000 EXPUNGE
                S: A003 OK MOVE completed
                C: A004 UID MOVE 4000:* Trash
                S: * 3010 EXPUNGE
                S: * 3009 EXPUNGE
                S: * 3008 EXPUNGE
                S: A004 OK MOVE completed

</section>
</section>
<section title="Response Codes">
<t>
    If server supports both UIDPLUS and MOVE extensions it SHOULD return
    COPYUID response code as a part of tagged OK response to a MOVE
    command, as defined in <xref target="UIDPLUS"/> paragraph 4.3.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Formal Syntax"><t>
    Formal syntax is defined using ABNF <xref target="ABNF"/>, extending the ABNF rules
    defined in <xref target="IMAP4"/>.  The IMAP4 ABNF should be imported first before
    attempting to validate these rules.

<title>INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1</title>
<author initials='M.' surname='Crispin' fullname='M. Crispin'>
<organization /></author>
<date year='2003' month='March' />
<abstract>
<t>The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.  IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244.  IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<t>
   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.
