Abstract

   This document updates RFC 3315 to allow the Rebind message type to
   appear in the Reconfigure Message option of a Reconfigure message,
   which allows DHCPv6 servers to instruct clients to perform a Rebind
   operation as well as a Renew operation.

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 Reconfigure with Rebind        November 2007


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] allows a server to send an unsolicited Reconfigure
   message to a client.  The client's response to a Reconfigure message,
   according to [RFC3315] is either a Renew or an Information-Request
   message, depending on the contents of the msg-type field in the
   Reconfigure Message option of the Reconfigure message.

   In a network with multiple DHCPv6 servers, the Reconfigure message
   may not be sent by the same server as the one from which the client
   last obtained configuration and/or addressing information.  If the
   Reconfigure message commands the client to perform a Renew, [RFC3315]
   does not specify to which server the client should send the Renew.
   This difficulty is avoided if the server commands the client to
   perform an Information-Request, since such messages are multicast.
   However, Information-Request messages do not cause addressing
   configuration to be returned.

   This document expands the allowed values of the msg-type field to
   allow the server to indicate that the client is to attempt to perform
   a Rebind; since Rebind messages are multicast, this avoids the
   necessity of the client contacting a particular server.  Rebind
   messages also cause all configuration information, including
   addresses, to be returned from a server.

   This document updates section 19 of RFC 3315.


2.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The Reconfigure Message option of the DHCPv6 Reconfigure Message

   A server includes a Reconfigure Message option in a Reconfigure
   message to indicate to the client whether the client responds with a
   Renew, an Information-request, or a Rebind message.
