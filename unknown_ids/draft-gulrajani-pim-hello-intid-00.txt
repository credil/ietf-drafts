Internet-Draft    An Interface ID Hello Option for PIM     February 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new option for use in PIM Hello messages
   [RFC4601] to carry an Interface Identifier.  A router generates
   identifiers for each of its PIM enabled interfaces so that each
   interface has a different identifier.  The identifiers can optionally
   be generated so that they are unique within, e.g., an administrative
   domain.

   An example where this Interface Identifier can be used is with PIM
   PORT [I-D.ietf-pim-port], where a single Transport connection is used
   between two routers that have multiple interfaces connecting them.
   If these interfaces have unnumbered or IPv6 Link local addresses, the
   Interface Identifier included in the PORT Join/Prune message will
   identify which interface the message is associated with.  For PIM
   PORT the Router Identifier is not needed, and it can be set to zero.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Interface Identifier Option

   The Interface Identifier option is used to identify which interface
   of a neighboring router a PIM Hello [RFC4601] is sent on.  This
   allows PIM protocols to refer to, or identify, a particular interface
   on a neighboring router.

   The Interface Identifier option need only be included in PIM Hello
   messages if the router supports protocols that require it.  An
   implementation MAY choose to always include it.  How exactly the
   Interface Identifier is used, and the uniqueness requirements, is
   left to the specifications of the PIM protocols that make use of it.
   It is assumed that different protocols may have different minimum
   requirements for stability and uniqueness, but that they have no
   maximum requirement.  When specified, these protocols should indicate
   what their minimum requirements are.

   The Interface Identifier consists of 64 bits.  The lower 32 bits form
   a Local Interface Identifier, and the high 32 bits a Router
   Identifier.

2.1.  Local Interface Identifier

   The 32 bit Local Interface Identifier is selected so that it is
   unique among the router's PIM enabled interfaces.  That is, there
   MUST NOT be two PIM interfaces with the same Local Interface
   Identifier.  While an interface is up, the Identifier MUST always be
   the same once it has been allocated.  If an interface goes down and
   up, the router SHOULD use the same Identifier.  Many systems makes
   use of an ifIndex [RFC1213], which can be used as a Local Interface
   Identifier.

   The Local Interface Identifier MUST be non-zero.  The reason for
   this, is that some protocols may want to only optionally refer to an
   Interface using the Interface Identifier Hello option, and use the
   value of 0 to show that it is not referred to.  Note that the value
   of 0 is not a valid ifIndex as defined in [RFC1213].

2.2.  Router Identifier

   The 32 bit Router Identifier may be used to uniquely identify the
   router.  It may be selected to be unique within some administrative
   domain, or possibly globally unique.  In which scope it needs to be
   unique depends on the protocol utilizing it.  Routers often have such
   an identifier derived from an IPv4 address or manual configuration.
   Protocols like BGP [RFC4271] and OSPFv2 [RFC2328] are other protocols
   making use of 32 bit identifiers for routers.  One may use the same
   identifier to construct the Interface Identifier option, provided it

   meets the stability and uniqueness requirements of protocols making
   use of this option.

   The value 0 has a special meaning for the Router Identifier.  It
   means that no Router Identifier is used.  If a router only supports
   protocols that require the Interface Identifier to be unique for one
   router (only making use of the Local Interface Identifier), then the
   implementation MAY set the Router Identifier to zero.

       |           Type = TBD          |         Length = 8            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                       Router Identifier                       |

   Allocated Hello Type values can be found in [HELLO-OPT].

   Length:   In bytes for the value part of the Type/Length/Value
      encoding.  The Interface Identifier will be 8 bytes long.

   Local Interface Identifier:   The Local Interface Identifier is a 4
      byte identifier that is unique among all PIM enabled interfaces on
      a router.

   Router Identifier:   The Router Identifier is a 4 byte identifier
      uniquely identifying the router within some scope.  It MAY be 0
      when no protocols require a Router Identifier.

4.  Security Considerations

   The Interface Identifier is included in PIM Hello Messages.  Apart
   from the general security considerations for PIM messages, the only
   additional concern is what may happen if a spoofed PIM message is
   received with the wrong Interface Identifier.  That is, if a Hello is
   sent with a spoofed source address so that it appears to come from a
   known neighbor, and the Interface Identifier is different from what
   that neighbor is sending.  Also, including this identifier in a
   spoofed message when the real neighbor is not sending it, or omitting
   it when the real neighbor is sending it.  The effects of such attacks
   depend on how this Interface Identifier is used by other protocols.

   IANA is requested to assign a PIM Hello Option value for the
   Interface Identifier option defined in this document.
