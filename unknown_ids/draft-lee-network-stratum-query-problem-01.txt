Abstract

   This document describes the general problem of network stratum query
   for application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability to
   query the network from an application controller such as those used
   in Data Centers so that application controller decisions such as
   server assignment or virtual machine instantiation/migration can be
   performed with better knowledge of the underlying network conditions.

   As application servers are distributed geographically across Data
   Centers, many application-related decisions such as which server to
   assign a new client or where to instantiate/migrate virtual machines
   will suffer from sub-optimality unless the underlying network
   conditions are factored in the decision process. The lack of network
   awareness may result in not meeting the end-user service objective
   for some key applications like video gaming/conferencing that require
   stringent latency and bandwidth requirement.

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010


1. Introduction

   Cross Stratum Optimization is a joint optimization effort in
   allocating resources to end-users that involves both the Application
   Stratum and Network Stratum.

   The application stratum is the functional block which manages and
   controls application resources and provides application resources to
   a variety of clients/end-users. Application resources are non-network
   resources critical to achieving the application service
   functionality. Examples include: application specific servers,
   storage, content, large data sets, and computing power. Data Centers
   are regarded as a tangible realization of the application stratum
   architecture.

   The network stratum is the functional block which manages and
   controls network resources and provides transport of data between
   clients/end-users to and among application resources. Network
   Resources are resources of layer 3 or below (L1/L2/L3) such as
   bandwidth, links, paths, path processing (creation, deletion, and
   management), network databases, path computation, admission control,
   and resource reservation capability.

   Application services by their very nature utilize application
   resources (e.g., servers, storage, memory, etc...) in Data Centers,
   and the underlying network resources provided by LANs, MANs, and
   carrier's transport networks. By "data center" is any location in the
   network where applications resources, such as servers or storage, are
   aggregated. We include in this definition extremely large data
   centers with 10,000 or more servers, all the way down to small points
   of presence co-located in network carrier facilities.

   As the application servers are distributed geographically across many
   Data Centers, decisions such as server assignment or new virtual
   machine instantiation/migration will suffer from sub-optimality
   unless the underlying network conditions are factored in the decision
   process. The lack of network awareness may result in not meeting the
   end-user service objective for some key applications like video
   gaming/conferencing that require stringent latency and bandwidth
   requirement.

   This document describes the general problem of network stratum query
   (NS Query) in Data Center environments. Network Stratum query is an
   ability to query the network from application controllers in Data
   Centers so that application server assignment or virtual machine
   instantiation/migration decision would be jointly performed based on
   both the application resource/load status and the network
   resource/load status.

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010


   The NS query is different from what is called "horizontal network
   queries" performed as part of network management. These horizontal
   queries are carried out by an entity (network management systems)
   within the network and would have fairly complete access to network
   information.

   NS Query can be thought of as a two-stage query that consists of:

     . First Stage: A vertical query from an application entity (i.e.,
        the Application Control Gateway (ACG) in Data Center) to an
        entity representing the network (i.e., the Network Control
        Gateway (NCG))for highly summarized and abstracted network
        related information; and

     . Second Stage: Internal "horizontal queries" at the network work
        layer along with summarization and abstraction of the network
        information in a form that preserves network confidentiality
        and significantly reduces the amount of information that needs
        to be transferred. The raw information needed to perform this
        summarization/abstraction is defined in existing and emerging
        network management standards and protocols (SNMP, Netflow,
        sFlow, IPPM, IGP, RIB, etc...).

   NS Query would not necessarily standardize how the above "internal
   horizontal queries" and summarization would be performed but would
   illustrate how such processes can be accomplished via standards,
   emerging standards or common commercial practices.

2. Network and Application Contexts

   Figure 1 shows a typical application architecture where an end-user
   (the point of consuming resource) needs to be connected for its
   application (e.g., gaming) to a server located in one of the
   geographically distributed data centers.

                    Figure 1. Data Center Architecture



   Figure 1 shows that the user application can be served by any of the
   servers in DC1, DC2 or DC3. When the initial request arrives to the
   application controller, the controller (aka, a global load balancer)
   would ideally assign an "optimal" server based on both server
   resource/load status and the network resources/load status. This
   server assignment decision today, however, is limited due to the lack
   of network awareness in this decision making process in the
   application.

   For example, the application controller needs to find a good server
   that can serve the client. Assume that this particular application
   requires x amount of minimum bandwidth guarantee and with less than y
   ms of latency limit. The route that serves Data Center 1 traffic to
   the end-user (PE1 - PE4) may not have enough capacity at a moment of
   service instantiation and therefore the service objective of the end-
   user may not be satisfied had such route been taken.

   On the other hand, there may be good servers available in Data
   Centers 2 and 3 and their routes (PE2-PE4 and PE3-PE4) may have
   enough capacity to meet the service requirement.

   This example illustrates the benefit of and the need for the joint
   optimization across the application and network strata. NS Query is
   the ability to query the network from an application controller to
   collect a certain level of network information. No such mechanisms
   exist in the today's Internet Protocol technologies.

   Figure 2 shows the context of NS Query in a more detail within the
   overarching data center architecture shown in Figure 1.

                      Figure 2. NS Query Architecture

   Figure 2 shows key architectural components that enable NS Query
   capability. The application controller, e.g., global load balancer,


   Lee   Expires April 20, 2011  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010


   utilizes the Application Control Gateway (ACG) to interface with the
   network and generate queries to network. The ACG can query various
   metric values that may contribute to meeting the overall service
   objective of an application. This is a vertical query (Stage 1).

   In the network stratum, the Network Control Gateway (NCG) serves the
   interface to the network stratum. The NCG receives the query request
   from the ACG, makes use of current and/or historical network
   information (IPPM, IGP, MIB, TED, etc...), abstracts and summaries
   this information implemented in the network stratum. This is the
   horizontal query and summarization stage (Stage 2).

   Further, the NCG provides the responses to the original query sent
   from the ACG. The data collected by the NCG needs to be abstracted.
   This abstraction is needed on two grounds.

   First, the network does not usually reveal its details to the
   outside entity. Although the Data Center providers and the carriers
   are business partners in providing application services to the end-
   users and to the application providers (e.g., gaming providers),
   detail network data may not be leaked to the Data Centers, and vice
   versa.

   Secondly, detail network data may not be understood by the
   application. Link or node level data in and of themselves may not
   help the application to process the detail data. For instance,
   latency or bandwidth on a link level is too detail for application
   to handle. Instead, latency or bandwidth on a route level (i.e., PE1
   - PE4 in Figure 1) will help the application make its server
   selection/instantiation decision.

   The abstraction function needs to be provided by the NCG. Note that
   NCG plays gate keeper role to information concerning the network. a
   Within the network the NCG collects and or probes network
   performance/management data (e.g., IPPM, MIB, etc.) or routing data
   [MRT] (e.g., LSDB, TED, BGP-RIB, etc.) and others. Once the basic
   data is collected, the NCG will need to abstract/summary before it
   sends to the application.



3. Problem Statement

         3.1. Limitation of existing probing schemes

   The current state-of-the art application network awareness schemes
   for an entity external to the network are based on ping, trace route,
   or vendor specific probing mechanisms based on the assumption that


   Lee   Expires April 20, 2011  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010


   the underlying transport network is L3 network and that the routing
   is simple IP forwarding.

   In reality, the carrier's routing schemes are likely to include IP
   tunneling or MPLS tunneling on top of or in place of IP forwarding.
   In some cases, the actual network may be VPN, MPLS-TE or GMPLS-TE
   networks where trace route does not work.

   This implies that network status estimation technique made from
   application stratum may have limited accuracy. Thus, application
   resource allocation to end-users can suffer sub-optimality and fail
   to meet performance objective for the application.

         3.2. Lack of vertical query schemes

   There is no standard "vertical" query scheme that allows an
   application control gateway in a Data Center to query network stratum
   in a way suitable for a third party (i.e. an entity "outside" the
   network).

   Due to the lack of standard vertical query scheme, there is a
   limitation on exchanging information between application and network
   that would increase efficiency of joint optimization across
   application to network. For instance, the ability to exchange the
   application profile information (defined in Section 4.1) or network
   capability information between application and network would increase
   efficiency of resource allocation across application to network.

         3.3. Limitation of SNMP MIB network monitoring techniques

   SNMP MIB Network Monitoring lacks a whole network query capability. A
   whole network query is a query to gather information across many
   boxes simultaneously under the control of a single administration
   domain (AD) as defined in RFC 1136. A single AD means the single AS
   or multiple ASes under the control of a single AD.

         3.4. Lack of abstraction mechanisms

   Most of the information needed to provide NS Query is currently
   available from the network; however, it is not aggregated into a form
   suitable for use by the application stratum. For example from
   commonly monitored SNMP based link statistics and current routing
   tables one can easily compute average available bandwidth and many
   other statistical performance measures such as packet loss, latency,
   etc.

   However, neither the raw SNMP nor routing table data should be
   delivered to the application stratum since (a) this reveals too much


   Lee   Expires April 20, 2011  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010


   information concerning the carriers network, (b) presents too much
   information to transfer to each application. This warrants some work
   on abstraction from network side to preserve the privacy of network
   stratum details from the application stratum.



4. High-level requirements

   This section discusses high-level requirements to support NS Query in
   the Data Center environments.

   The ACG plays the key role functioning as an application gateway to
   network and runs the NS Query. The ACG has access to the end-user
   profile for the application and the candidate servers' locations
   locally and remotely located. How the ACG access these information is
   beyond the scope of this work.

         4.1. Application Profile

   The application Stratum needs to provide the application profile to
   network as part of a query.

   Example service profile information that can be useful to network to
   understand is as follows:

      . End user IP address;

      . User access router IP address;

      . Authentication Profile: Authentication Key;

      . Bandwidth Profile: Minimum bandwidth required for the
        application;

      . Connectivity Profile: P-P, P-MP, Anycast (Multi-destination);

      . Directionality of the connectivity: unidirectional, bi-
        directional;

      . Path Estimation Objective Function: Min latency, etc.

   Additional profile information can be added depending on the network
   capability.

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010


         4.2. Network Load Data to be queried

   For a given location mapping information (i.e., from the server
   location to end-user location), the query from an application can ask
   the following network load data:

     . Type of networks and the technical capabilities of the networks;
     . Bandwidth capabilities and availability;
     . latency;
     . jitter;
     . packet loss;
     . And other Network Performance Objective (NPO) as defined in
        section 5 of [ITU-T Y.1541].


   Note that this can be asked in a different way. For example, the
   query can simply ask:

     . Can you give me a route with x amount of b/w (from server to
       end-user) within y ms of latency?
     . Can you give me a route with x amount of b/w (from server to
       end-user) with no packet loss?


         4.3. A Whole Network Query capability

   Upon the request from application (specifically, the ACG in Figure
   2), the network (specifically the NCG in Figure 2) should perform "a
   whole network query" of information.

   A whole network query is a query to gather information across many
   boxes simultaneously under the control of a single administration
   domain (AD) as defined in RFC 1136. A single AD means the single AS
   or multiple ASes under the control of a single AD.

   The scope of a whole network query can include the topology of the
   network, the bandwidth availability for the routes of interest, the
   capabilities and congestion of links and routes, and an indication of
   the contribution to delay and jitter that each link and route will
   contribute and so on.

         4.4. Data Synchronization Mechanism

   When querying the network there are two general categories of
   information that are of interest (a) current data, and (b) historical

   data. Current data information tells us information about the current
   state of the network, this data represent current network "state" and
   over time is subject to change. Application servers would use
   abstracted versions of this information to make decisions regarding
   current application activities.

   Historical data can be used by the application controller to schedule
   application events at future times. Such historical data must be time
   stamped so that inferences can be drawn from the data. For example,
   consider the backup and synchronization of large application
   databases between two data centers. Not only would we like to know
   how much bandwidth is available, and importantly when is the best
   time to perform such synchronization (given there is flexibility on
   when to perform the backup).

         4.5. Responses to NS Query from network to application

   Given the network query from application, the network should provide
   the following mechanisms:


  - For a given location mapping information from application (i.e.,
     from the server location to end-user location) and the gathered
     information by the second stage query discussed in section 4.3.,
     the network needs to present the requested information in a
     standard format and respond to the application.

   The actual abstraction mechanism is beyond the scope of this
   document.




5. Security Considerations

   TBD

6. IANA Considerations

   This informational document does not make any requests for IANA
