             4over6 for IPv6 host connecting IPv4 Internet
                   draft-cui-softwire-host-4over6-00

Abstract

   This draft proposes a mechanism for bidirectional communication
   between IPv4 Internet and hosts in IPv6 access networks.  Adopting
   the Softwire hub & spoke model, this mechanism uses IPv4-over-IPv6
   tunnel to traverse the IPv6 networks.

Internet-Draft                 Host 4over6                     July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Global public IPv4 addresses are running out fast.  The recent
   simulation result by ipv4.potaroo.net says the exact exhaustion date
   will be in two years.  Meanwhile, the demand for address allocation
   is still growing and may even burst in potential situations like the
   "Internet of Things".  To satisfy the network users, operators have
   to push IPv6 to the front, by building IPv6 networks and providing
   IPv6 services.

   When IPv6 begins to serve the large number of end users as native
   network, IPv4 service for these users rises as a critical requirement
   simultaneously.  This is because before the whole world switch to
   IPv6, there'll still be a portion of resources, applications and
   users to communicate persisting in IPv4.  So the end users in IPv6
   network desires to get connected with IPv4 Internet, especially in
   the early period when IPv4 is still dominant.

   The IPv4 service which network operators provided for IPv6 users
   differs IPv4 address.  If the IPv6 clients don't have IPv4
   addresses(e.g., new network users join this ISP and ISP don't have
   enough unused IPv4 address for them), then they have to use private
   IPv4 address in client side and an IPv4 private-to-global translation
   is required in the carrier side.  Otherwise the IPv6 clients can get
   global IPv4 addresses, then they can use them for IPv4 communication,
   and hence translation shouldn't be involved.  Without translation,
   the network users and operators can avoid all the problems introduced
   by it, such as application translation, port allocation, state
   maintenance, etc., and get/provide better IPv4 services.  Note that
   this situation is actually quite popular.  There're up to 2^32
   networks users who are using IPv4 global address or can get an IPv4
   global IPv4 address.  Most of them will switch to IPv6 sooner or
   later, and will require IPv4 services after the switching.  This
   draft will focus on this situation, i.e., to provide IPv4 access for
   hosts in IPv6 network where IPv4 global addresses are available.

   We can take CERNET(China Education and Research Network) as an
   example.  CERNET has two backbone using different address families,
   the IPv4-only backbone is known as CERNET and the IPv6-only backbone
   is known as CERNET2.  There are hundreds of Campus networks attaching
   to CERNET and some of them have got attached to CERNET2 as well.  All
   these Campus networks have got their IPv4 prefixes allocated from
   CERNET and the end hosts in these networks are using IPv4 global
   addresses at present.  Now imagine one day all these campus networks
   get attached to CERNET2 and turn into IPv6-only.  Then the end hosts
   in them have to switch to IPv6 accordingly, but they'll naturally
   continue to require IPv4 services.  In this scenario, the end hosts
   can use their previous IPv4 addresses for the new type of IPv4

   services, since the addresses are already possessed by the campus
   network and the clients basically remains the same.

2.  Terminology

   Host 4over6

   Host 4over6 is the technology proposed by this draft, to support the
   bidirectional communication between IPv4 Internet and a host in IPv6
   access network.

   4over6 host

   The host that supports Host 4over6 in IPv6 access network. 4over6
   host is also called 4over6 initiator. 4over6 host is a 4over6 tunnel
   endpoint in Host 4over6.

   4over6 concentrator

   4over6 concentrator is the dual stack router which connecting the
   IPv6 access network to IPv4 Internet. 4over6 concentrator is also a
   4over6 tunnel endpoint in Host 4over6.

3.  Scenario description and analysis

   The scenario is shown in Figure 1.  Hosts in an IPv6 network take
   IPv6 as their native service.  At the same time, these hosts want to
   get IPv4 services as well, i.e., they want to connect to IPv4
   Internet.  However, the reality is that the network these hosts get
   attached to is IPv6-only rather than dual-stack.  Fortunately,
   network operators can connect a small number of routers to IPv4
   Internet, so a large number of end hosts can get IPv4 connectivity
   through these v4-v6 border routers.  So generally, it's an IPv4-over-
   IPv6 Hub & spoke problem[RFC4925].

   Figure 1 Host 4over6 scenario

   Under this scenario, let's make some basic assumptions on the user
   expectations.  First and the most important one, the end users want
   an IPv4 access method, so they expect a tunnel mechanism rather than
   a translation mechanism.  Second, end users require global IPv4
   address.  As is analyzed earlier, lack of IPv4 addresses isn't a
   concern in this scenario.  Third, users expect no translations along
   the IPv4 path, so there're no problems like NAT traversing, so the
   IPv4 service can be better, various applications can be supported
   well.  As to network operators, they expect the method to be simple,
   useful and scalable.  They don't want to maintain state on their
   devices unless they have to.

4.  Host 4over6 Framework

   Host 4over6 is a traversing mechanism for hosts in IPv6 network to
   reach IPv4 Internet and get IPv4 service.  Host 4over6 adopts the Hub
   & Spoke model, and uses IP-in-IP tunnel as the encapsulation method.
   The IPv6 hosts requiring IPv4 service act as tunnel initiator, and
   the IPv4-IPv6 border router acts as tunnel concentrator.  Host 4over6
   allocates IPv4 global address to the hosts by embedding it in the
   IPv6 address of the hosts.  This way tunnel concentrator can figure
   out the IPv6 encapsulation destination address automatically when
   sending an IPv4 packet through 4over6 tunnel, therefore no
   information maintenance is required on concentrator.

4.1.  addressing and routing in Host 4over6

   Host 4over6 has specialized requirement on address allocation.
   Network operator should have a network-specific prefix(NSP), and a
   global IPv4 address pool(usually aggregated as an IPv4 prefix) for
   Host 4over6 usage.  The IPv6 hosts requiring Host 4over6 service
   should be allocated with IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   address[I-D.ietf-behave-address-format], in which the prefix part is
   filled with NSP, and the v4 address part is filled with one 32bit
   address from the IPv4 address pool.  Different hosts get different
   IPv6 addresses with the same prefix (i.e.  NSP) and different IPv4
   addresses.  The prefix length is flexible and decided by the
   operators.  By this IPv6 address allocation process, one host
   possesses a global IPv4 address and the corresponding mapped IPv6
   address.

   Besides address allocation, the corresponding routing should be done.
   In IPv4 scope, the 4over6 Concentrator on the IPv4-IPv6 border should
   advertise the IPv4 prefix(consists of the addresses allocated to IPv6
   hosts) into the IPv4 network on Internet side, so that packet
   destined to these addresses can be routed to the concentrator and
   then reach the hosts by tunnel.  In IPv6 scope, the routing in IPv6
   network should support the IPv6 address allocation.  This is no
   different from regular IPv6 allocation and routing.

4.2.  4over6 Initiator

   4over6 initiator represents the IPv6 hosts requiring IPv4 service.
   These hosts are in the IPv6-only network, they're not provisioned
   with native IPv4 access, but the protocol stack on the hosts supports
   IPv4.  The protocol stack should have an tunnel interface, supporting
   IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation.

   4over6 Initiator should get its IPv6 address by DHCPv6.  When it
   learns the IPv6 address and bind it to the IPv6 interface, it will

Internet-Draft                 Host 4over6                     July 2010


   also extract the IPv4 address from the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address,
   and bind it to the tunnel interface.  This address will work as the
   native IPv4 address for this host.

   When the host want to send an IPv4 packet, this packet will be handed
   to the tunnel interface.  The tunnel interface will put an IPv6
   header on this packet, using the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address as the
   source address and the concentrator IPv6 address as the destination
   address.  Then the packet will be sent on the IPv6 interface.  When
   the host receives an encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6 packet, it will
   decapuslate it by dropping the IPv6 header and handed it to the
   tunnel interface, and then handed up to higher layer.

   4over6 Initiator should learn the NSP(or the NSP length) and the
   concentrator IPv6 address before the data process begins.  This can
   be done by manual configuration, new DHCP option, etc.

   Actually, when performing encapsulation, there is another way to form
   the destination address.  We can use an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address with
   NSP as prefix and actual destination IPv4 address as v4 address to be
   the IPv6 destination address, and then have the Concentrator
   advertise the default route for NSP, so as to route the encapsulated
   packet to the Concentrator.  However, when there exists multiple
   Concentrators, this will leads to asymmetric routing.

   This draft mainly discusses the situation that the Initiator is the
   IPv6 host.  See section 5.3 for the situation where there is an IPv4
   home network behind the Initiator.

4.3.  4over6 Concentrator

   4over6 Concentrator represents the IPv4-IPv6 border router working as
   tunnel endpoint for the IPv6 hosts.  Its IPv6 interface is connected
   to the IPv6 network, and its IPv4 interface is connected to the IPv4
   Internet.

   When the Concentrator receives an encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6 packet
   from the IPv6 side, it will decapsulated the packet by dropping the
   IPv6 header.  If the decapsulated IPv4 packet is destined to the IPv4
   Internet, then it'll be sent on the IPv4 interface.  Else the packet
   is destined to another IPv6 host, then the Concentrator will
   encapsulate it by IPv6, using the IPv6 address of itself as the
   source address, and use the IPv4 destination address and the NSP to
   form the IPv6 destination address automatically.  Note that if the
   Initiator uses the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address as the destination
   address for encapsulation, this type of packets won't go through the
   Concentrator.

   When the Concentrator receives an IPv4 packet from the IPv4 side, it
   will check the destination address.  For our concern, the destination
   will fall into the address pool for IPv6 hosts.  Then the 4over6
   Concentrator will encapsulate the packet by IPv6, using the IPv6
   address of itself as the source address, and use the IPv4 destination
   address and the NSP to form the IPv6 destination address
   automatically.  Then the IPv6 packet will be sent on the IPv6
   interface.

5.  Further Discussion

5.1.  Technical advantage of Host 4over6

   Since a 4over6 host uses a global IPv4 address, host 4over6 supports
   bidirectional communication between IPv4 Internet and a host in IPv6
   access network.

   By coupling the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address of the IPv6 host,
   the encapsulation in the Concentrator can be simple and scalable.
   The Concentrator can automatically form the destination IPv6 address
   for encapsulation, rather than maintain a table of per-user IPv4-IPv6
   address mapping and look it up for every encapsulation.

5.2.  Application Scenario of Host 4over6

   Since a host 4over6 support bidirectional communication between a
   host in IPv6 network and IPv4 Internet, this technology can provide
   the solution for data center networks or those hosts which need to
   provide IPv4 service in IPv6 access networks.

   In order to improve save the reuse rate of IPv4 address, host 4over6
   can support dynamically reuse of a single IPv4 address between
   multiple hosts based on their dynamical requirement of communicating
   with IPv4 Internet.  A 4over6 host can use IPv6 protocols (e.g.  ND)
   to have an ordinary IPv6 address rather than 4over6 address when it
   starts up.  When it needs to communicate with IPv4 Internet, it then
   requires a new 4over6 address from the 4over6 DHCPv6 to have a global
   IPv4 address in the short time it needs.

   Host 4over6 is mainly suited for IPv6 hosts that can get IPv4
   addresses, such as legacy IPv4 users switching to IPv6.  Network
   operators can take back the IPv4 addresses from the existing users,
   have the network switched to IPv6 and re-allocate the IPv4 addresses
   to them in a Host 4over6 way

5.3.  Home network consideration

   Host 4over6 is mainly facing IPv6 hosts.  If the Initiator is a CPE
   with an IPv4 home network behind it, then the situation will be more
   complicated.  One solution is to update the home network to support
   IPv6, and have each host in this network to get IPv4-Embedded
   address(The CPE can require an IPv6 block and distribute the
   addresses in home network, or working as an DHCP relay).  If this
   can't be done, then a normal IPv4 NAT is required on the CPE.  Hosts
   in home network will use IPv4 private addresses.  Packets from home
   network will be translated by the IPv4 NAT, so as to use the global
   IPv4 address of the CPE as source address, and then use the tunnel
