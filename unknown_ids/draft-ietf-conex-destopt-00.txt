                   IPv6 Destination Option for Conex
                      draft-ietf-conex-destopt-00

Abstract

   Conex is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the
   congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
   document specifies an IPv6 destination option that is capable of
   carrying conex markings in IPv6 datagrams.

1.  Introduction

   Conex [CAM] is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about
   the congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
   document specifies an IPv6 destination option [RFC2460] that can be
   used for performing conex markings in IPv6 datagrams.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Background

   The Conex working group came up with a list of requirements that had
   to be met by any marking mechanism.  It then considered several
   alternative mechanisms and evaluated their suitability for conex
   marking.  There were no mechanisms found that were completely
   suitable, but the only mechanism that came close to meeting the
   requirements was IPv6 destination options.  The analysis of the
   different alternatives can be found in [draft-krishnan-conex-ipv6].

4.  Conex Destination Option (CDO)

   The Conex Destination Option (CDO) is a destination option that can
   be included in IPv6 datagrams that are sent by conex-aware senders in
   order to inform conex-aware nodes on the path about the CDO has an
   alignment requirement of (none).

                 Figure 1: Conex Destination Option Layout


   Option Type

      8-bit identifier of the type of option. The option identifier
      for the conex destination option will be allocated by the IANA.

   Option Length

      8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (excluding
      the Option Type and Option Length fields). This field MUST be
      set to the value 4.

   X Bit
      When this bit is set, the transport sender is using ConEx with
      this packet. If it is reset, the sender is not using ConEx.

   L Bit

      When this bit is set, the transport sender has experienced a loss.
      If it is reset, the sender has not experienced a loss.

   E Bit

      When this bit is set, the transport sender has experienced
      ECN-signaled congestion. If it is reset, the sender has not
      experienced ECN-signaled congestion.

   C Bit

      When this bit is set, the transport sender is building up
      congestion credit. Otherwise it is not.

   Johansson, Joel Halpern and John Leslie for the discussions that led
   to this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not bring up any new security issues.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 destination option for carrying
   conex markings.  IANA is requested to assign a new destination option
   type in the Destination Options registry maintained at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-parameters <TBA1> Conex
   Destination Option [RFCXXXX] The act bits for this option need to be
   10 and the chg bit needs to be 0.
