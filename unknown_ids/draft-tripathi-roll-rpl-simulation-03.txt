1.  Terminology

      PDR - Packet Delivery Ratio

   Please refer to additional terminology in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology].


2.  Introduction

   Designing a routing protocol in Low power and Lossy link Networks
   (LLNs) imposes great challenges, mainly due to low data rates, high
   probability of packet delivery failure, and strict energy constraint
   in nodes.  The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified the Routing
   Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   RPL is designed to meet the core requirements specified in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs],[I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-req
   s],[RFC5873] and [RFC5548].

   This document's contribution is to provide several routing
   performance metrics of RPL using a decrete event simulator in various
   real-life deployment scenarios.  Each result has been checked against
   several real-life deployed networks.

   Simulation results are purely indicative since they may vary
   according to the discrete event simulator used to perform the
   simulations, the choice of the RPL parameter and so on.  Still this
   document provides valuable inputs and the specific context in which
   these simulations were performed are explicitly indicated.

   Several routing metrics are evaluated in this document:

   o  Path quality metrics;

   o  Control plane overhead;

   o  End to End delay between nodes;

   o  Ability to cope with unstable situations (link churns, node
      dying);

   o  Required resource constraints on nodes (routing table size, etc.).

   Feedback from the ROLL Working Group are welcome to add new
   evaluation metrics of potential interest in further revisions of this
   document.

   Although simulation cannot prove formally that a protocol operates
   properly in all situations, it could give a good level of confidence
   in protocol behavior in highly stressful conditions, if and only if
   real life data are used.  Simulation is particularly useful
   especially because theoretical model assumptions may not be
   applicable to LLNs.  Therefore, real deployed network data traces
   have been used to model link behaviors.


3.  Method

   RPL was simulated using OMNET++ [OMNETpp], a well-known discrete
   event based simulator written in C++ and NED.  Castalia-2.2
   [Castalia-2.2] has been used as Wireless Sensor Network Simulator
   framework within OMNET++.  The output and events in the simulating
   are visualized with the help of the Network AniMator or NAM, which is
   distributed with NS (Network Simulator). [NS-2]

   Note that NS or any of its versions were not used in this simulation
   study.  Only the visualization tool was borrowed for verification
   purposes.  As noted, real link layer data gathered from networks
   deployed on the field were used to compute the PDR (Packet Delivery
   Ratio) for each of the links in the network.  By contrast with
   theoretical models (e.g.  Markov Chains) which may have assumptions
   not applicable to lossy links, real-life data has been used for two
   aspects of the simulations:

   * Link failure model: Time varying real network traces containing
   packet delivery probability for each link and over all channels for
   both indoor network deployment and outdoor network deployment were
   used.  Thus, different types of link characteristics are used in the
   study.

   * Topology: The topologies are gathered from real-life deployment
   (traces mentioned above) as opposed to random topology simulations.


4.  Simulation Setup

   A 45 node topology, shown in Figure 1, gathered from a real
   deployment, was used in the simulations.

   Figure 1
   Figure 1: Network topology for preliminary simulation results.

   Note that this is just a start to validate the simulation before
   using large scale networks.

Internet-Draft    draft-tripathi-roll-rpl-simulation-03       March 2010


   A database of time varying link quality data, gathered from real
   network deployment, was created.  Each link in the topology randomly
   'picks up' a link model from the database, and the link's Packet
   Delivery Ratio (PDR) varies according to the gathered data.  Figure 2
   shows some typical temporal characteristics of some links in the
   network for the indoor network trace used in the simulations.
   Packets are dropped randomly from that link with probability (1 -
   PDR).  Each link has a PDR that varies with time (in the simulation,
   the new PDR is read from the database every 10 minutes).  Each time a
   packet is about to be sent, the module generates a random number
   using the Mersenne Twister Random number generation method.  The
   random number is compared to the PDR to determine whether the packet
   should be dropped or not.  Note that each link use a different random
   number generator to maintain true randomness in the simulator, and to
   avoid correlation between links.  Also, the packet drop applies to
   all kinds of data and control packets (RPL) such as the DIO, DAO, DIS
   packets defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].
   Figure 2
   Figure 2: Example of link characteristics.

   In simulating RPL, the LBR first initiates sending out DIO messages,
   and the DAG is gradually constructed.  The trickle time interval for
   emitting DIO message assumes the initial value of 1 second, and then
   changes over simulation time as mentioned in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   RPL makes use of trickle timers: I_min is initially set to 1 second
   and I_doubling is equal to 16, so that maximum time between two
   consecutive DIO emissions by a node (under a steady network
   condition) is 18.2 hours.  Another objective of this study is to give
   insight to the network administrator on how to tweak the trickle
   values.  These recommendations could then be used in applicability
   statement documents.  Further revision of this document will include
   simulations for large scale networks with varied parameters and show
   how quickly the network will stabilize, comparing data/control
   traffic and studying the tradeoff between reactivity and lifetime.

   Each node in the network, other than the LBR, also emits DAO messages
   as specified in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], to initially populate the
   routing tables with the prefixes received from children via the DAO
   messages in support of the Point to Point (P2P) and Point to
   Multipoint traffic (P2MP) in the "down" direction.  In this revision
   of the document, it is assumed that each node is capable of storing
   route information for other nodes in the network.  In further
   revision of this document nodes without storage capability will be
   added to the network to see the influence of extra states on the
   nodes and the additional control plane overhead to propagate the
   route records thanks to Reverse Route Stacks in the DAO messages.

   For nodes implementing RPL, as expected, the routing table memory
   requirement varies according to the position in the DAG.  The worst-
   case assumption that there is no route summarization in the network
   is made.  Thus a node closer to the DAG will have to store more
   routing entries.  Further revision of this document will explore the
   influence of performing route summarization along the DAG, which
   could be performed thanks to a newly defined Objective Function or
   new address provisioning techniques.  It is also assumed that all
   nodes have equal memory capacity to store the routing states,
   therefore no source routing is required.

   Each node sends traffic according to a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) to all
   other nodes in the network over the simulation period.  To simulate a
   more realistic scenario, 20% of the generated packets by each node
   are destined to the root, and the remaining 80% of the packets are
   uniformily assigned as destined to nodes other than the root.
   Therefore the root receives a considerably larger amount of data than
   other nodes.  These values may be revised when studying the P2P
   traffic so as to have a majority of traffic going to all nodes as
   opposed to the root.  In the later part of the simulation, a typical
   home/building routing scenario was also simulated and different path
   quality metrics were computed for that traffic pattern.

   The packets are routed through the DAG built by RPL according to the
   mechanisms specified in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   Since RPL is an IP routing protocol, no assumption is made on the
   link layer, thus potential gains in terms of header compression
   provided by 6loWPAN is not under consideration [draft-iphc].

   A number of RPL parameters are used (such as Packet Rate from each
   source, Time Period of the LBR emitting new DAG Sequence Number) to
   observe their effect on the RPL performance metric of interest.


5.  Metrics to evaluate RPL

5.1.  Common Assumptions

   Routing Table Size: as the DAO messages are used to feed the routing
   tables in the network, routing table size for each node are recorded.
   Currently, the routing table size is not expressed in terms of Kbyte
   of memory usage but measured in terms of number of entries for each
   node.  Each entry has next hop node and path cost associated with the
   destination node.  In further revision of this document, a single
   full 128-bit address per leaf plus a few bits to store other
   information and flags will be used.

   The link ETX (Expected Transmission Count) metric is used to build
   the DAG as specified in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics].  Further
   revisions of this document will include other metrics and constraints
   such as the Hop count.

5.2.  Path Quality

   Number of Hops: For each pair of source and destination, the average
   number of hops for both RPL and shortest path routing is computed.
   Shortest path routing refers to an hypothetical ideal routing
   protocol that would always provide the shortest path in term of path
   cost ETX (or whichever metric is used) in the network.  The
   Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of hop distance for all paths
   (which is equal to n*(n-1) in an n node network) in the network with
   respect to number of hops is plotted in Figure 3 for both RPL and
   shortest path routing.  One can observe that the CDF corresponding to
   4 hops is around 80% for RPL and 90% for shortest path routing.  In
   other words, for the given topology, 90% of paths will have path
   length of 4 hops or less with an ideal shortest path routing
   methodology, whereas in RPL Point-to-Point (P2P) routing, 90% of
   paths will have a length shorter or equal to 5 hops.  This result
   shows that despite having a non optimized P2P routing scheme, the
   path quality of RPL is not much worse than an optimized one for the
   topology in consideration.  Another reason may be, the sink is at the
   center of the network, so routing through the sink is often close to
   an optimal (shortest path) routing.  This result may be different in
   a topology where the sink is located at one end of the network.
   Figure 3
   Figure 3: CDF: hop distance versus number of hops.

   Path Cost ETX: When optimizing the path using the link ETX metric,
   the path cost ETX along the path is computed for each pair.  Figure 4
   shows the CDF of the total number of ETX to deliver a packet from a
   source to any destination node with respect to path cost ETX of the
   path from each source to each destination in the network, for both
   RPL, and shortest path routing.  Here also one observes that path
   cost ETX along the path from all source to all destination is close
   to that of a shortest path routing for the network in the simulation.
   Figure 4
   Figure 4: CDF: Total ETX along path versus link ETX value.

   Path Stretch: In this simulation, the path stretch is also calculated
   for each packet that traversed the network.  The path stretch is
   determined as the difference between the number of hops taken by a
   packet while following a route built via RPL and the number of hops
   taken by shortest path routing (by using link ETX as the metric).
   Once again, the CDF of path stretch is plotted against the value of
   path stretch for different packets in Figures 5 and 6 for hop count

   stretch and ETX metric stretch respectively.
   Figure 5
   Figure 5: CDF: Hop count stretch versus hop count of a packet.
   Figure 6
   Figure 6: CDF: ETX metric stretch versus ETX value.

5.3.  Routing Table Size

   The objective of this metric is to observe the distribution of the
   number of entries per node.  Figure 7 shows the CDF of required
   number of routing table entries for all nodes.  One can see, that 90%
   of the nodes need to store less than 10 entries in their routing
   cache.
   Figure 7
   Figure 7: CDF of routing table size with respect to number of nodes.

5.4.  Delay bound for P2P Routing

   For delay sensitive applications, such as home and building routing,
   etc., it is also important to limit the end-to-end delay.  Figure 8
   shows the upperbound and distributions of delay in Point to Point
   (P2P) routing between any two given nodes when RPL is employed for
   different hop counts between source and destination.  Here, the hop
   count refers to the hop distance when RPL is employed and not
   shortest path distance between two nodes.  Each packet has a length
   of 127 bytes, with a 240 kbps radio, which makes the transmission
   time to be approximately 4 ms.
    Figure 8
   Figure 8: Comparison of packet latency for different hop count in
   RPL.

5.5.  Control Packet Overhead

   The control plane overhead is an important routing metric in Low
   power and Lossy Networks (LLNs).  Indeed, it is imperative to bound
   the control plane overhead.  One of the distinctive charateristics of
   RPL is that it makes use of trickle timers so as to reduce the number
   of control plane packets by eliminating redundant messages.  The aim
   of this metric is thus to analyse the control plane overhead in
   stable condition (no network element failure overhead) and in the
   presence of failures.

   Data and control plane traffic comparison for each node: Figure 9
   shows the comparison of the amount of data packets transmitted
   (including forwarded) and control packets (DIO and DAO messages)
   transmitted for each node when minimizing ETX is used by the OCP
   along the DAG.  Here one can observe that considerable amount of
   traffic is routed through the sink itself.  And also the fact that



Tripathi, et al.       Expires September 24, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    draft-tripathi-roll-rpl-simulation-03       March 2010


   the amount of control traffic is really negligible in the protocol is
   reinforced.  As expected, the nodes closer to sink and that act as
   forwarders handle much more data traffic than other nodes.  The leaf
   nodes have comparable amount of data and control packet transmission,
   as they do not take part in routing the data.
   Figure 9
   Figure 9: Amount of data and control packets transmitted for each
   node when minimizing ETX is used OCP along the DAG.

   Data and Control Packet Transmission with respect to time: In Figures
   10, 11 and 12, the amount of data and control packets transmitted for
   node 12 (low rank in DAG, closer to the root), node 43 (in the
   middle) and node 31 (leaf node)are shown, respectively.  These values
   stand for number of packets transmitted for each 10 minutes
   intervals, to help understand what is the density of data and control
   packet exchange in the network.  One can observe as the node is
   closer to the sink, the amount of data is larger, and the amount of
   control traffic is negligible in comparison to the data traffic.
   Also, the variation in data traffic is much larger for a node closer
   to sink, because the destination of the packets varies over time, and
   20% of the packets are destined to sink only.  For the nodes that are
   further away from sink, the variation in data traffic becomes lesser,
   and the amount of data traffic is also smaller.

   The control traffic for the nodes has a wave-like pattern.  The
   amount of control packets for each node drops quickly as the DAG
   stabilizes due to the effect of trickle timer.  However, as a new DAG
   Sequence is advertised, the trickle timers are reset and the nodes
   start emiting DIO frequently again to stabilize the DAG.  One can
   see, for a node closer to sink, the data packet amount is much higher
   than control packet, and somewhat oscillatory around a mean value.
   The control packet amount exhibits a 'saw-tooth' behavior, mainly
   because as the ETX link metric was used, and as when PDR changes, the
   ETX path cost for a child node to its parent changes, which results
   in changing DAG rank of the child.  This event resets the trickle
   timer and emit new DIO.  Also, issue of a new DAG Sequence Number
   triggers DAG recomputation and resets the trickle timers.  Therefore,
   one can observe that the number of control packets attains a high
   value for one interval, and the amount comes down to lower values for
   subsequent intervals.  Also, for leaf nodes the amount of control
   packets are more than data packets, as leaf nodes are more prone to
   face changes in their DAG rank as opposed to nodes closer to sink
   when the link ETX value in the topology changes dynamically.

5.6.  Loss of connectivity

   Upon link failures, a node may loose his parents: preferred and
   backup (if any) and its sibling (if any).  In this case, if a packet
   has to be sent and the routing table does not contain an entry for
   the corresponding destination the packet is dropped.  RPL proposes
   two mechanims for DAG repairs, known as global repair and local
   repair.  In this version of the document, simulation results are
   presented to evaluate the amount of time packets are lost because of
   loss of connectivity for two cases: a) when only global repair
   mechanism is implemented (i.e. periodic emission of new DAG
   SequenceNumbers by the DODAG root), and b) when poisoning the sub-DAG
   is used in case of unreachability of any parent or sibling node to
   forward data along with global repair mechanism.  The idea is to tune
   the frequency at which new DAG Sequence Numbers are generated by the
   DAG root that are used for global repair, and also to observe the
   effect of the same when local repair is used in conjunction.  It is
   expected that a higher frequency will lead to shorter duration of
   connectivity loss at a price of a higher rate of control packet in
   the network.  For local repair, the simulation results show the
   trade-off in amount of time that a node may remain without service
   and total number of control packets for extra bit of signalling.

   Figure 13 shows the CDF of time spent by any node without any
   service, when the packet rate from the sources is a packet each 10
   seconds, and new DAG Sequence Number is issued every 10 minutes.
   This plot reflects the property of global repair without any Local
   Repair scheme.  When all the parents (and siblings) are temporarily
   unreachable from a node, the time before it hears a DIO from another
   node is recorded, which gives the time without service.  In some
   cases, this value might go up to the DAG Repair Timer value, because
   untill a DIO is heard, there is a lack of connectivity.

   The effect of the DAG Repair Timer on time without service is plotted
   in Figure 14, where the source rate is 20 seconds/packet and in
   Figure 15, where the source sends a packet every 10 seconds.

   Figure 16 shows effect of DAG Global Repair Timer period on control
   traffic.  As expected, as the frequency at which new
   DAGSequenceNumber are generated increases, the amount of control
   traffic also decreases because the trickle interval gets larger for
   each node, which is pretty intuitive.  However this smaller amount of
   control traffic comes at a price of increased time for loss of
   connectivity.

   The effect of the DAG Repair Timer on time without service, when
   Local repair is present, is plotted in Figure 17, where the source
   rate is 20 seconds/packet.  A comparison of the CDF of loss of
   connectivity for Global Repair Mechanism and Global + Local Repair
   Mechanism is shown in Figures 18 and 19 (semilog plots), where the
   source generates a packet every 10 seconds and 20 seconds
   respectively.  In the plots, one can observe that using the method of
   poisoning the sub-DAG greatly reduces the time without connectivity.

   A comparison between the amount of control overhead used for global
   repair only and global plus local Repair mechanism is shown in Figure
   20, which highlights the improved performance of RPL in terms of
   convergence time at very little extra overhead.

6.  RPL in a building routing scenario

   Unlike the previous traffic pattern, where a majority of the total

   traffic generated by any node is destined to the root, this section
   considers a different traffic pattern, which is more prominent in
   home or building routing scenario.  A node sends 60% of its total
   generated traffic to its physically 1-hop distant nodes, 20% of
   traffic to its 2-hop distant nodes.  Rest of the traffic is once
   again distributed among all other nodes in the network.  The CDF of
   average hop distance path stretch in terms of hop distance, ETX path
   cost and delay for P2P routing for all pair of nodes is calculated.
   Maintaining low delay bound for P2P traffic is of high importance in
   this traffic scenario, as the applications in home and building
   routing has typically low delay tolerance.

6.1.  Path Quality

   Figure 21 shows the CDF of number of hops for both RPL and ideal
   shortest path routing for the traffic scenario described above.
   Figure 22 shows CDF of the expected number of transmission count for
   each packet to reach destination.  Figures 23 and 24 show CDF of the
   stretch factor for these two metrics.

   shortest path in home routing.

   path.

   path.

6.2.  Delay

   To get an idea of maximum observable delay in the mentioned traffic
   pattern, the delay for different number of hops to the destination
   for RPL is considered.  Figure 25 shows how the end-to-end packet
   latency is distributed for different packets with different hop
   counts in the network.

   Figure 25: Comparison of packet latency for different hop count in
   RPL.

   The next figures compares RPL to shortest path routing in terms of
   packet latency in a home/building routing scenario.  Figure 26 shows
   that RPL almost meets the lowest delay bound set by the ideal
   shortest path route.  This is interesting, because despite being a
   non-optimal algorithm, for this specific home routing scenario, the

   performance of RPL is very close to the optimal.  Of course, for
   different topology this outcome may vary.
