Internet-Draft           Birth/Death Extensions           September 2011


1.  Introduction

   The base vCard 4.0 specification [RFC6350] defines a large number of
   properties, including date of birth.  This specification adds three
   new properties to vCard 4.0, for place of birth, place of death, and
   date of death.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [RFC6350].


2.  Identification Property Extensions

2.1.  Property: BIRTHPLACE

   Namespace:

   Property name:  BIRTHPLACE

   Purpose:  To specify the place of birth of the object the vCard
       represents.

   Value type:  A single text value (default) or a single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, LANGUAGE

   Description:

   Format definition:
       BIRTHPLACE-param =  "VALUE=" / ("text" / "uri")
       BIRTHPLACE-value =  text / uri
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

       BIRTHPLACE-param =/  altid-param / language-param / any-param

Internet-Draft           Birth/Death Extensions           September 2011


   Examples:
       BIRTHPLACE:Babies'R'Us Hospital
       BIRTHPLACE;VALUE=uri:http://example.com/hospitals/babiesrus.vcf
       BIRTHPLACE;VALUE=uri:geo:46.769307,-71.283079

2.2.  Property: DEATHPLACE

   Namespace:

   Property name:  DEATHPLACE

   Purpose:  To specify the place of death of the object the vCard
       represents.

   Value type:  A single text value (default) or a single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, LANGUAGE

   Description:

   Format definition:
       DEATHPLACE-param =  "VALUE=" / ("text" / "uri")
       DEATHPLACE-value =  text / uri
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

       DEATHPLACE-param =/  altid-param / language-param / any-param

   Examples:
       DEATHPLACE:Aboard the Titanic\, near Newfoundland
       DEATHPLACE;VALUE=uri:http://example.com/ships/titanic.vcf
       DEATHPLACE;VALUE=uri:41.731944,-49.945833

2.3.  Property: DEATHDATE

   Namespace:

   Property name:  DEATHDATE

   Purpose:  To specify the date of death of the object the vCard
       represents.

   Value type:  The default is a single date-and-or-time value.  It can
       also be reset to a single text value.

Internet-Draft           Birth/Death Extensions           September 2011


   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, CALSCALE, LANGUAGE
       CALSCALE can only be present when the value is a
       date-and-or-time value and actually contains a date or date-time.
       LANGUAGE can only be present when the value is text.

   Description:

   Format definition:
       DEATHDATE-param =  DEATHDATE-param-date / DEATHDATE-param-text
       DEATHDATE-value =  date-and-or-time / text
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

       DEATHDATE-param-date =  "VALUE=date-and-or-time"
       DEATHDATE-param-text =  "VALUE=text" / language-param

       DEATHDATE-param =/  altid-param / calscale-param / any-param
           ; calscale-param can only be present when DEATHDATE-value is
           ; date-and-or-time and actually contains a date or date-time.

   Examples:
       DEATHDATE:19960415
       DEATHDATE:--0415
       DEATHDATE;19531015T231000Z
       DEATHDATE;VALUE=text:circa 1800


3.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 9 of
   the base vcard specification [RFC6350].


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following entries to the vCard
   Properties registry, defined in [RFC6350] section 10.3.1.

         +-----------+--------------+------------------------+
         | Namespace | Property     | Reference              |
         +-----------+--------------+------------------------+
         |           | BIRTHPLACE   | RFCXXXX, section 2.1   |
         |           | DEATHPLACE   | RFCXXXX, section 2.2   |
         |           | DEATHDATE    | RFCXXXX, section 2.3   |
         +-----------+--------------+------------------------+
