1. Introduction 

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label 
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched 
   optical networks (WSON).  In particular, extensions are given to 
   characterize optical signal types via traffic parameters, permit 
   simultaneous bi-directional wavelength assignment, and control the 
   distributed wavelength assignment process. These extensions build on 
   previous work for the control of G.709 based networks.

   optical transponder, etc., which are employed to transmit/terminate 
   the optical signals for data transmission. 

    

3. Requirements for WSON Signaling 

   The following requirements for GMPLS based WSON signaling are in 
   addition to the functionality already provided by existing GMPLS 
   signaling mechanisms.  

3.1.1. WSON Signal Characterization 

   WSON signaling MUST convey sufficient information characterizing the 
   signal to allow systems along the path to determine compatibility and 
   perform any required local configuration. Examples of such systems 
   include intermediate nodes (ROADMs, OXCs, Wavelength converters...), 
   links (WDM systems) and end systems (detectors, demodulators, 
   etc...). The details of any local configuration are out of the scope 
   of this document. 

3.1.2. Bi-Directional Distributed Wavelength Assignment 

   WSON signaling MAY support distributed wavelength assignment 
   consistent with the wavelength continuity constraint for bi-
   directional connections. The following two cases MAY be separately 
   supported: (a) Where the same wavelength is used for both upstream 
   and downstream directions, and (b) Where different wavelengths can be 
   used for both upstream and downstream directions.  

   The need for the same wavelength on both directions mainly comes from 
   the color constraint on some edges' hardware. In Appendix section, 
   two edge relevant scenarios are described, i.e. without and with OXC 
   at edges. In fact, the edges can be classified into two types, i.e. 
   without and with the wavelength-port mapping re-configurability.  


 
 
Bernstein et al.       Expires January 7, 2009                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions               July 2008 
    

   Without the mapping re-configurability at edges, the edge nodes must 
   use the same wavelength in both directions.  For example, (1) 
   transponders are only connected to AWGs (i.e. multiplexer/de-
   multiplexer) ports directly and fixedly, or (2) transponders are 
   connected to the add/drop ports of ROADM and each port is mapped to a 
   dedicated wavelength fixedly.  

   On the other hand, with the mapping re-configurability at edges, the 
   edge nodes can use different wavelengths in different directions. For 
   example, in edge nodes, transponders are connected to add/drop ports 
   of colorless ROADM. Thus, the wavelength-port remapping problem can 
   be solved locally by appropriately configuring the colorless ROADM. 
   If the colorless ROADM consists of OXC and AWGs, the OXC is 
   configured appropriately.  

   The edges of data-plane in WSON can be constructed in different types 
   based on cost and flexibility concerns.  Without re-configurability 
   we should consider the constraint of the same wavelength usage on 
   both directions, but have lower costs. While, with re-configurability 
   we can relax the constraint, but have higher costs.  

   These two types of edges will co-exist in WSON mesh, till all the 
   edges are unified by the same type. The existence of the first type 
   edges presents a requirement of the same wavelength usage on both 
   directions, which must be supported.   

   Moreover, if some carriers prefer an easy management lightpath usage, 
   say use the same wavelength on both directions to reduce the burden 
   on lightpath management, the same wavelength usage would be 
   beneficial. 

   In cases of equipment failure, etc., fast provisioning used in quick 
   recovery is critical to protect Carriers/Users against system loss. 
   This requires efficient signaling which supports distributed 
   wavelength assignment, in particular when the centralized wavelength 
   assignment capability is not available. 

3.1.3. Distributed Wavelength Assignment Method Selection 

   WSON signaling MAY support the selection of a specific distributed 
   wavelength assignment method. 

   As discussed in the [WSON-Frame] a variety of different wavelength 
   assignment algorithms have been developed. A number of these are 
   suitable for use in distributed wavelength assignment. This feature 
   would allow the specification of a particular approach when more than 
   one are implemented in the systems along the path.

3.1.4. Out of Scope 

   This draft does not address signaling information related to optical 
   impairments.  

4. WSON Signal Types, Forward Error Correction, and Rates 

   Although WSONs are fairly transparent to the signals they carry, to 
   ensure compatibility amongst various networks devices and end systems 
   it can be important to include key lightpath characteristics as 
   traffic parameters in signaling [WSON-Frame].  

4.1. Traffic Parameters for WSON signals 

   As in [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] the following traffic parameters would 
   become the contents for the RSVP SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects. 
   The WSON traffic parameters SHOULD be defined as follows: 

   0                   1                   2                   3

       2        RZ 
    
    
   Modulation Parameters(Mod Params):  
   RZ 0 - 33%, 1 -  50%, 2 - 67% duty cycles 
    
   See [G.959.1] and [Winzer06]. 
    
   These are specific to the modulation type employed and may or may not 
   be used.  For example NRZ modulation typically doesn't have extra 
   parameters, while RZ modulation has a duty cycle parameter. 
    
    
   Bitrate/Analog Bandwidth: 
   For digital signals this is the bit rate given as a 32 bit IEEE 
   floating point number. 
    
   For analog signals or when modulation type is given as 0 
   (unspecified), this is the bandwidth of the signal around the center 
   frequency (c/lambda) and not the bit/byte rate. This is given as a 32 
   bit IEEE floating point number that represents the bandwidth in 
   Hertz. The exact definition of bandwidth, e.g., 3dB power bandwidth, 
   etc. is TBD and may be network specific. 
    

5. Bidirectional Lightpath using Same Wavelength on Both Directions 

   With the wavelength continuity constraint in CI-incapable [RFC3471] 
   WSONs, where the nodes in the networks cannot support wavelength 
   conversion, the same wavelength on each link along a unidirectional 
   lightpath should be reserved.  Per the definition in [RFC3471], a 
   bidirectional lightpath can be seen as a pair of unidirectional 
   lightpaths, which are provisioned along the same route simultaneously 
   by the RSVP-TE signaling with Upstream Label and Label Set Objects in 
   the messages [RFC3473]. This does not necessarily require the same 
   wavelength in both directions. 

   In addition to the wavelength continuity constraint, requirement 
   3.1.2(a) gives us another constraint on wavelength usage in data 
   plane, in particular, it requires the same wavelength to be used in 
   both directions.

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions               July 2008 
    

   The simplest and efficient way is to only define an extension to the 
   processing of Label Set [RFC3473], and leave the other processes 
   untouched.  The issues related to this new functionality including an 
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC4420] and the new procedure are 
   described in the following sections. This approach would have a lower 
   blocking probability and a shorter provisioning time.  In cases of 
   equipment failure, etc., fast provisioning used in quick recovery is 
   critical to protect Carriers/Users against system loss. 

5.1. Using LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object 

   To trigger the new functionality at each GMPLS node, it is necessary 
   to notify the receiver the new type lightpath request.  One multi-
   purpose flag/attribute parameter container object called 
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and related mechanism defined in [RFC4420] meet 
   this requirement. One bit in Attributes Flags TLV which indicates the 
   new type lightpath, say, the bidirectional same wavelength lightpath 
   will be present in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  Please refer to 
   [RFC4420] for detailed descriptions of the Flag and related issues. 

5.2. Bidirectional Lightpath Signaling Procedure  

   Considering the system configuration mentioned above, it is needed to 
   add a new function into RSVP-TE to support bidirectional lightpath 
   with same wavelength on both directions. 

   The lightpath setup procedure is described below: 

   1. Ingress node adds the new type lightpath indication in an 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  It is propagated in the Path message in 
      the same way as that of a Label Set object for downstream; 

   2. On reception of a Path message containing both the new type 
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set 
      object, the receiver of message along the path checks the local 
      LSP database to see if the Label Set TLVs are acceptable on both 
      directions jointly.  If there are acceptable wavelengths, then 
      copy the values of them into new Label Set TLVs, and forward the 
      Path message to the downstream node.  Otherwise the Path message 
      will be terminated, and a PathErr message with a "Routing 
      problem/Label Set" indication will be generated; 

   3. On reception of a Path message containing both such a new type 
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and an Upstream 
      Label object, the receiver MUST terminate the Path message using 
      a PathErr message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes TLV" and 

 
 
Bernstein et al.       Expires January 7, 2009                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions               July 2008 
    

      Error Value set to the value of the new type lightpath TLV type 
      code; 

   4. On reception of a Path message containing both the new type 
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set 
      object, the egress node verifies whether the Label Set TLVs are 
      acceptable, if one or more wavelengths are available on both 
      directions, then any one available wavelength could be selected.  
      A Resv message is generated and propagated to upstream node; 

   5. When a Resv message is received at an intermediate node, if it is 
      a new type lightpath, the intermediate node allocates the label 
      to interfaces on both directions and update internal database for 
      this bidirectional same wavelength lightpath, then configures the 
      local ROADM or OXC on both directions. 

   Except the procedure related to Label Set object, the other processes 
   will be left untouched. 

    

5.3. Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   Due to the introduction of new processing on Label Set object, it is 
   required that each node in the lightpath is able to recognize the new 
   type lightpath indication Flag carried by an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object, 
   and deal with the new Label Set operation correctly.  It is noted 
   that this new extension is not backward compatible. 

   According to the descriptions in [RFC4420], an LSR that does not 
   recognize a TLV type code carried in this object MUST reject the Path 
   message using a PathErr message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes 
   TLV" and Error Value set to the value of the Attributes Flags TLV 
   type code. 

   An LSR that does not recognize a bit set in the Attributes Flags TLV 
   MUST reject the Path message using a PathErr message with Error Code 
   "Unknown Attributes Bit" and Error Value set to the bit number of the 
   new type lightpath Flag in the Attributes Flags.The reader is 
   referred to the detailed backward compatibility considerations 
   expressed in [RFC4420].

6. Bidirectional Lightpath using Different Wavelengths on Different 
   Directions 

   TBD 

7. RWA Method Related 

7.1. Wavelength Assignment Method Selection 

   As discussed in [HZang00] a number of different wavelength assignment 
   algorithms maybe employed. In addition as discussed in [WSON-Frame] 
   the wavelength assignment can be either for a unidirectional 
   lightpath or for a bidirectional lightpath constrained to use the 
   same lambda in both directions. A simple TLV could be used to 
   indication wavelength assignment directionality and wavelength 
   assignment method. This would be placed in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES 
   object per [RFC4420]. The use of a TLV in the LSP required attributes 
   object was pointed out in [Xu]. 

   [TO DO: The directionality stuff needs to be reconciled with the 
   earlier material] 

   Directionality: 0 unidirectional, 1 bidirectional 

   Wavelength Assignment Method: 0 unspecified (any), 1 First-Fit, 2 
   Random, 3 Least-Loaded (multi-fiber).  Others TBD.

7.2. Supplemental Information for Wavelength Assignment 

   Distributed wavelength assignment makes extensive use of the label 
   set object/TLV of [RFC3471]. Some higher performance algorithms 
   suitable for multi-fiber networks such as Least-Loaded assignment 
   require supplemental information concerning the potential lambdas to 
   be used. An ordered set of TLVs in correspondence with the group of 
   one or more label set TLVs can be used to convey this information in 
   the form of a general wavelength "acceptability" metric.

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions               July 2008 
    

   Note that the label set syntax of [RFC3471] allows group of 
   wavelengths into ranges. For the purpose of supplementing this 
   information with wavelength count only those wavelengths with the 
   same counts could be grouped. 

   The general format for supplemental wavelength selection information 
   could be as follows:

   Number 0f Metrics: 24 bits 

   Wavelength Metric: (1, 2, or 4 octets) 

         The wavelength metric represents in some fashion the 
   desirability or lack thereof to use this wavelength over another 
   available wavelength. Different wavelength assignment algorithms may 
   use this information differently. 

7.3. Least-Loaded Wavelength Assignment (informational) 

   The Least-Loaded wavelength assignment algorithm [HZang00] can be 
   implemented in a distributed fashion via signaling with the addition 
   of channel count metric information. Least-loaded assignment applies 
   to multi-fiber links hence the supplemental information pertains to 
   the number of available channels at a particular wavelength. Hence 
   the subchannel metric of section 7.2. would simple be the channel 
   count of a particular wavelength. 

   The per node processing to implement the least-loaded assignment 
   algorithm consists of receiving the label set and supplementary 
   information TLVs (wavelengths and their channel counts) and taking 
   the minimum of the received channel counts and the egress channel 
   counts on a per wavelength basis. Where wavelengths with zero 
   available channels will be discarded from the label set.  The 
   resulting channel counts and wavelength set will then be forwarded on 
   to the next node for processing. For more details on least loaded 
   wavelength assignment see [WSON-Frame] and [HZang00]. 

   Example of Wavelength set and wavelength channel count metric. 
   Suppose that in a 40 channel multi-fiber system and that the 
   wavelengths (frequencies) have the following number of channels (this 
   is a multi-fiber system) available: 

            Frequency(THz)    channels available

8. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within GMPLS and associated protocols. That is the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE, 
   and PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.  
    
   However satisfying the requirements for RWA using the existing 
   protocols may significantly affect the loading of those protocols. 
   This makes the operation of the network more vulnerable to denial of 
   service attacks. Therefore additional care maybe required to ensure 
   that the protocols are secure in the WSON environment.  
    
   Furthermore the additional information distributed in order to 
   address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network 
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. Consideration 
   should be given to securing this information.  

    

9. IANA Considerations 

   TBD. Once finalized in our approach we will need identifiers for such 
   things and modulation types, modulation parameters, wavelength 
   assignment methods, etc...

APPENDIX A: Requirement of Bidirectional Lightpath with the Same 
Wavelength in Both Directions  

    

A.1. Introduction 

   With the Lambda Switch (LSC) support defined in GMPLS [RFC3471] and 
   RSVP-TE signaling [RFC3473], by properly configuring the wavelength 
   selective switching elements such as ROADMs or OXCs at the transit 
   nodes, both unidirectional and bidirectional wavelength (optical 
   lambdas) lightpaths can be established in a wavelength switched 
   optical network (WSON).  

   With the wavelength continuity constraint in CI-incapable [RFC3471] 
   WSONs, where the nodes in the networks cannot support wavelength 
   conversion, the same wavelength on each link along a unidirectional 
   lightpath should be reserved.  Per the definition in [RFC3471], a 
   bidirectional lightpath can be seen as a pair of unidirectional 
   lightpaths, which are provisioned along the same route simultaneously 
   by the RSVP-TE signaling with Upstream Label and Label Set Objects in 
   the messages [RFC3473]. This does not necessarily require the same 
   wavelength in both directions. 

   In addition to the wavelength continuity constraint, there is another 
   constraint on wavelength usage, say, require the same wavelength on 
   both directions. This constraint might be introduced by carriers for 
   a simplified management to reduce the OPEX. Moreover, according to 
   some network hardware configurations, users' bidirectional lightpath 
   has to use the same wavelength in both directions. For example, only 
   a specific wavelength among the multiplexed wavelengths could be 
   added/dropped to an optical end node. Some type of ROADMs may 
   add/drop the same wavelength simultaneously.  In particular, with 
   some WSONs, if different wavelengths in two inverse directions are 
   used, this brings a port-remapping problem, which is stated as 
   follows. 

A.2. Port-remapping Problem 

   This problem occurs in the following situations: 

    

   (1) Fixed wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexer like AWGs may be 
   employed in data plane at each node.  Each incoming and outgoing 
   wavelength is with a dedicated fixed port of AWG. For example,

   Consider a bidirectional lightpath with different wavelengths on two 
   directions. The optical transmitter of which output wavelength is the 
   same as the outgoing-wavelength (say lambda 1) is chosen first for 
   using the lightpath. Then, the optical responder attached to that 
   transmitter should be selected for receiving the incoming wavelength 
   (say lambda 2). The responder generally can receive any of different 
   wavelengths. Therefore, if another bidirectional lightpath is 
   assigned the same outgoing wavelength (lambda 1) but with a different 
   incoming wavelength (say lambda 3), the same transmitter and 
   responder pair is selected. See Fig.2.3.

   Fig.2.3. Transmitter sends optical signals on the fixed-tuned 
   wavelength; the responder can receive data on different wavelengths. 

   However, the communication using the transponder and the 
   bidirectional lightpath with different wavelengths will not succeed 
   under the situations (1) and (2) mentioned above. Remember the fixed 
   port mapping that each incoming wavelength is fixed on a unique port 
   of AWG due to the situation (1), and the optical responder is also 
   fixedly connected to a unique port of AWG or OXC due to the situation 
   (2). Conversely, the incoming wavelength may change every lightpath 
   (see lambda 2 and lambda 3 in the above case) for the same outgoing 
   wavelength (lambda 1). The current incoming wavelength (lambda 3) is 
   not on the port of AWG to which the optical responder connects 
   originally (lambda 2), see Fig. 2.4.  To connect the optical 
   responder to the proper port on which the incoming wavelength is, 
   even in different outgoing wavelengths, a port-remapping process 
   between the optical responder and AWG ports may be required.

   Fig.2.4. Port-remapping problem occurs due to the fixed port-mapping 
   between the optical responder and AWG port. 

A.3. Port-remapping with OXC 

The port-remapping capability depends on the system configurations at 
users' optical end nodes.  For example, an OXC may be employed to switch 
the incoming wavelength from the port of AWG to the port which the 
optical responder is connected physically, see Fig. 3.1.

   However, equipping users' optical end nodes with OXCs introduces 
   extra costs.  There exists a trade-off between port-remapping 
   capability and cost/system complexity.

   Users have various types of optical end node configurations to choose 
   from.  Some configurations such as those equipped with OXCs might 
   provide flexibility but could be costly and potentially complicated. 
   Equally, while other configurations without OXCs might lack the 
   flexibility they may be inexpensive and easy to use and maintain.   

A.4. Avoiding Port-remapping Problem: Bidirectional Lightpath using 
Same Wavelength on Both Directions 

   Which solution will be employed depends on the considerations of the 
   flexibility and cost/complexity trade-off.  If users do not have 
   port-remapping capability at optical end nodes, then it is necessary 
   to avoid the port-remapping, and find a feasible approach to provide 
   users full-duplex transmission capability with bidirectional 
   lightpath. 

   A feasible approach is to establish a bidirectional lightpath with 
   the same wavelength on both directions.  At the optical end node, 
   fixed-tuned transponder array is connected to the proper ports of AWG 
   according to the wavelength.  Optical transmitter and responder pair 
   connecting the selected outgoing and incoming wavelength ports of AWG 
   will be assigned to the bidirectional lightpath.  In this situation,

   the bidirectional lightpath with the same wavelength on both 
   directions is required.
