Internet-Draft          Extended MKCOL for WebDAV              July 2009


1.  Introduction

   WebDAV [RFC4918] defines the HTTP [RFC2616] method MKCOL.  This
   method is used to create WebDAV collections on the server.  However,
   several WebDAV-based specifications (e.g., CalDAV [RFC4791]) define
   "special" collections - ones which are identified by additional
   values in the DAV:resourcetype property assigned to the collection
   resource, or through other means.  These "special" collections are
   created by new methods (e.g., MKCALENDAR).  The addition of a new
   MKxxx method for each new "special" collection adds to server
   complexity and is detrimental to overall reliability due to the need
   to make sure intermediaries are aware of these methods.

   This specification defines an extension to the WebDAV MKCOL method
   that adds a request body allowing a client to specify WebDAV
   properties to be set on the newly created collection or resource.  In
   particular, the DAV:resourcetype property can be used to create a
   "special" collection, or other properties used to create a "special"
   resource.  This avoids the need to invent new MKxxx methods.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses XML DTD fragments ([W3C.REC-xml-20081126], Section
   3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response
   bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility
   rules defined in Section 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all
   XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name
   "DAV:".  In particular:

   1.  element names use the "DAV:" namespace,

   2.  element ordering is irrelevant unless explicitly stated,

   3.  extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child
       elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated
       otherwise,

   4.  extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for
       this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly
       stated otherwise.

   When an XML element type in the "DAV:" namespace is referenced in
   this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string
   "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type.

Internet-Draft          Extended MKCOL for WebDAV              July 2009


   This document inherits, and sometimes extends, DTD productions from
   Section 14 of [RFC4918].

3.  WebDAV extended MKCOL

   The WebDAV MKCOL request is extended to allow the inclusion of a
   request body.  The request body is an XML document containing a
   single DAV:mkcol XML element as the root element.  The Content-Type
   request header MUST be set appropriately for an XML body (e.g., set
   to "text/xml" or "application/xml").  XML-typed bodies for an MKCOL
   request that do not have DAV:mkcol as the root element are reserved
   for future usage.

   One or more DAV:set XML elements may be included in the DAV:mkcol XML
   element to allow setting properties on the collection as it is
   created.  In particular, to create a collection of a particular type,
   the DAV:resourcetype XML element MUST be included in a DAV:set XML
   element and MUST specify the expected resource type elements for the
   new resource, that MUST include the DAV:collection element that needs
   to be present for any WebDAV collection.

   As per the PROPPATCH method ([RFC4918], Section 9.2), servers MUST
   process any DAV:set instructions in document order (an exception to
   the normal rule that ordering is irrelevant).  Instructions MUST
   either all be executed or none executed.  Thus, if any error occurs
   during processing, all executed instructions MUST be undone and a
   proper error result returned.  Failure to set a property value on the
   collection MUST result in a failure of the overall MKCOL request -
   i.e. the collection is not created.

   The response to an extended MKCOL request MUST be an XML document
   containing a single DAV:mkcol-response XML element, which MUST
   contain DAV:propstat XML elements with the status of each property
   when the request fails due to a failure to set one or more of the
   properties specified in the request body.  The server MAY return a
   response body in the case where the request is successful, indicating
   success for setting each property specified in the request body.
   When an empty response body is returned with a success request status
   code, the client can assume that all properties were set.

   In all other respects the behavior of the extended MKCOL request
   follows that of the standard MKCOL request.

3.1.  Extended MKCOL Support

   A server supporting the features described in this document, MUST
   include "extended-mkcol" as a field in the DAV response header from
   an OPTIONS request on any URI that supports use of the extended MKCOL

        MKCOL

   Content-Length: 0

3.2.  Status Codes

   As per Section 9.3.1 of [RFC4918].

3.3.  Additional Precondition for Extended MKCOL

   WebDAV ([RFC4918], Section 16) defines preconditions and
   postconditions for request behavior.  This specification adds the
   following precondition for the extended MKCOL request.

   Name:  valid-resourcetype

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Use with:  Typically 403 (Forbidden)

   Purpose:  (precondition) -- The server MUST support the specified
      resourcetype value for the specified collection.

3.4.  Example: Successful Extended MKCOL Request

   This example shows how the extended MKCOL request is used to create a
   collection of a fictitious type "special-resource".  The response
   body is empty as the request completed successfully.

   an error occurred specifically with the DAV:resourcetype property.

4.  Replacing Existing MKxxx Methods

   One of the goals of this extension is to eliminate the need for other
   extensions to define their own variant of MKCOL to create the special
   collections they need.  This extension can be used to replace
   existing MKxxx methods in other extensions as detailed below.  If a
   server supports this extension and the other extension listed, then
   the server MUST support use of the extended MKCOL method to achieve
   the same result as the MKxxx method of the other extension.

4.1.  MKCALENDAR Replacement

   CalDAV defines the MKCALENDAR method to create a calendar collection
   as well as set properties during creation ([RFC4791], Section 5.3.1).

   The extended MKCOL method can be used instead by specifying both DAV:
   collection and CALDAV:calendar-collection XML elements in the DAV:
   resourcetype property, set during the extended MKCOL request.

4.1.1.  Example: Replacing MKCALENDAR with MKCOL

   The first example below shows an MKCALENDAR request containing a
   CALDAV:mkcalendar XML element in the request body, and returning a
   CALDAV:mkcalendar-response XML element in the response body.

   >> MKCALENDAR Request <<

   MKCALENDAR /home/lisa/calendars/events/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: calendar.example.com
   Content-Type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <C:mkcalendar xmlns:D="DAV:"
                 xmlns:C="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav">
     <D:set>
       <D:prop>
         <D:displayname>Lisa's Events</D:displayname>
       </D:prop>
     </D:set>
   </C:mkcalendar>

Internet-Draft          Extended MKCOL for WebDAV              July 2009


   >> MKCALENDAR Response <<

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Cache-Control: no-cache
   Date: Sat, 11 Nov 2006 09:32:12 GMT
   Content-Type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <C:mkcalendar-response xmlns:D="DAV:"
                 xmlns:C="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav">
     <D:propstat>
       <D:prop>
         <D:displayname/>
       </D:prop>
       <D:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</D:status>
     </D:propstat>
   </C:mkcalendar-response>

   The second example shows the equivalent extended MKCOL request with
   the same request and response XML elements.

   >> MKCOL Request <<

   MKCOL /home/cyrus/calendars/events/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: calendar.example.com
   Content-Type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx

      needed when creating the resource.

   Description:  This XML element is a container for the information
      required to modify the properties on a collection resource as it

   This extension does not introduce any new security concerns beyond
   those already described in HTTP and WebDAV.

   This document does not require any actions on the part of IANA.
