Abstract

    Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) version 4rev1 has basic
    support for non-ASCII characters in mailbox names and search
    substrings.  It also supports non-ASCII message headers and content
    encoded as specified by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
    (MIME).  This specification defines a collection of IMAP extensions

    editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol

2.  Introduction

    This specification defines two IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] extensions to
    enhance international support.  These extensions can be advertised
    and implemented separately.

    The LANGUAGE extension allows the client to request a suitable
    language for protocol error messages and in combination with the
    NAMESPACE extension [RFC2342] enables namespace translations.

    The COMPARATOR extension allows the client to request a suitable
    collation which will modify the behavior of the base specification's
    SEARCH command as well as the SORT and THREAD extensions [SORT].
    This leverages the collation registry [RFC4790].


3.  LANGUAGE Extension

    IMAP allows server responses to include human-readable text that in
    many cases needs to be presented to the user.  But that text is
    limited to US-ASCII by the IMAP specification [RFC3501] in order to
    preserve backwards compatibility with deployed IMAP implementations.
    This section specifies a way for an IMAP client to negotiate which
    language the server should use when sending human-readable text.

    The LANGUAGE extension only provides a mechanism for altering fixed
    server strings such as response text and NAMESPACE folder names.
    Assigning localized language aliases to shared mailboxes would be
    done with a separate mechanism such as the proposed METADATA
    extension (see [METADATA]).


3.1 LANGUAGE Extension Requirements

    IMAP servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword
    LANGUAGE in their CAPABILITY response as well as in the greeting
    CAPABILITY data.

    A server that advertises this extension MUST use the language "i-
    default" as described in [RFC2277] as its default language until
    another supported language is negotiated by the client. A server
    MUST include "i-default" as one of its supported languages.

    Clients and servers that support this extension MUST also support

Internet-draft                                             November 2007


    the NAMESPACE extension [RFC2342].

    The LANGUAGE command is valid in all states. Clients are urged to
    issue LANGUAGE before authentication, since some servers send
    valuable user information as part of authentication (e.g. "password
    is correct, but expired").


3.2 LANGUAGE Command

    Arguments: Optional language range arguments.

    Response:  A possible LANGUAGE response (see section 3.3).
               A possible NAMESPACE response (see section 3.4).

    Result:    OK - Command completed
               NO - Could not complete command
               BAD - arguments invalid

    The LANGUAGE command requests that human-readable text emitted by
    the server be localized to a language matching one of the language
    range argument as described by section 2 of [RFC4647].

    If the command succeeds, the server will return human-readable
    responses in the first supported language specified.  These
    responses will be in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  The server MUST send a
    LANGUAGE response specifying the language used, and the change takes
    effect immediately after the LANGUAGE response.

    If the command fails, the server continues to return human-readable
    responses in the language it was previously using.

    The special "default" language range argument indicates a request to
    use a language designated as preferred by the server administrator.
    The preferred language MAY vary based on the currently active user.

    If a language range does not match a known language tag exactly but
    does match a language by the rules of [RFC4647], the server MUST
    send an untagged LANGUAGE response indicating the language selected.

    If there aren't any arguments, the server SHOULD send an untagged
    LANGUAGE response listing the languages it supports.  If the server
    is unable to enumerate the list of languages it supports it MAY
    return a tagged NO response to the enumeration request.

        < The server defaults to using English i-default responses until
          the user explicitly changes the language. >

3.3 LANGUAGE Response

    Contents:  A list of one or more language tags.

    The LANGUAGE response occurs as a result of a LANGUAGE command.  A
    LANGUAGE response with a list containing a single language tag
    indicates that the server is now using that language.  A LANGUAGE
    response with a list containing multiple language tags indicates the
    server is communicating a list of available languages to the client,
    and no change in the active language has been made.


3.4 TRANSLATION Extension to the NAMESPACE Response

    If localized representations of the namespace prefixes are available
    in the selected language, the server SHOULD include these in the
    TRANSLATION extension to the NAMESPACE response.

    The TRANSLATION extension to the NAMESPACE response returns a single
    string, containing the modified UTF-7 [RFC3501] encoded translation
    of the namespace prefix.  It is the responsibility of the client to
    convert between the namespace prefix and the translation of the
    namespace prefix when presenting mailbox names to the user.

    In this example a server supports the IMAP4 NAMESPACE command. It
    uses no prefix to the user's Personal Namespace, a prefix of "Other
    Users" to its Other Users' Namespace and a prefix of "Public
    Folders" to its only Shared Namespace.  Since a client will often
    display these prefixes to the user, the server includes a
    translation of them that can be presented to the user.

        S: * NAMESPACE (("" "/")) (("Other Users/" "/" "TRANSLATION"

        ; UTF-8 excluding 7-bit control characters and "["


4.  COMPARATOR Extension

    IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] includes the SEARCH command which can be used to
    locate messages matching criteria including human-readable text.
    The SORT extension [SORT] to IMAP allows the client to ask the
    server to determine the order of messages based on criteria
    including human-readable text.  These mechanisms require the ability
    to support non-English search and sort functions.

    This section defines an IMAP extension to negotiate use of

Internet-draft                                             November 2007


    comparators [RFC4790] to internationalize IMAP SEARCH, SORT and
    THREAD.  The IMAP extension consists of a new command to determine
    or change the active comparator and a new response to indicate the
    active comparator and possibly other available comparators.

    The term "default comparator" refers to the comparator which is used
    by SEARCH and SORT absent any negotiation using the COMPARATOR
    command.  The term "active comparator" refers to the comparator
    which will be used within a session e.g. by SEARCH and SORT.  The
    COMPARATOR command is used to change the active comparator.

    The active comparator applies to the following SEARCH keys: "BCC",
    "BODY", "CC", "FROM", "SUBJECT", "TEXT", "TO" and "HEADER".  If the
    server also advertises the "SORT" extension, then the active
    comparator applies to the following SORT keys: "CC", "FROM",
    "SUBJECT" and "TO".  If the server advertises THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT,
    then the active comparator applies to the ORDEREDSUBJECT threading
    algorithm.  If the server advertises THREAD=REFERENCES, then the
    active comparator applies to the subject field comparisons done by
    REFERENCES threading algorithm.  Future extensions may choose to
    apply the active comparator to their SEARCH keys.

    For SORT and THREAD, the pre-processing necessary to extract the
    base subject text from a Subject header occurs prior to the
    application of a comparator.


4.1 COMPARATOR Extension Requirements

    IMAP servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword
    COMPARATOR in their CAPABILITY data once IMAP enters authenticated
    state, and MAY list that keyword in other states.

    A server that advertises this extension MUST implement the
    i;unicode-casemap comparator, as defined in [UCM]. It MAY implement
    other comparators from the IANA registry established by [RFC4790].

    A server that advertises this extension SHOULD use i;unicode-casemap
    as the default comparator.  The selection of the default comparator
    MAY be adjustable by the server administrator, and MAY be sensitive
    to the current user.  Once the IMAP connection enters authenticated
    state, the default comparator MUST remain static for the remainder
    of that connection.

    A server that advertises this extension MUST support UTF-8 as a
    SEARCH charset.

    The COMPARATOR command is valid in authenticated and selected

Internet-draft                                             November 2007


    states.

    Note that since SEARCH uses the substring operation, IMAP servers
    can only implement collations that offer the substring operation
    (see [RFC4790 section 4.2.2). Since SORT uses ordering operation
    (and by implication equality), IMAP servers which advertise the SORT
    extension can only implement collations that offer all three
    operations (see [RFC4790] sections 4.2.2-4).

    If the active collation does not provide the operations needed by an
    IMAP command, the server MUST respond with a tagged BAD.


4.2 Comparators and Character Encodings

    RFC 3501, section 6.4.4 says:

               In all search keys that use strings, a message matches
               the key if the string is a substring of the field.  The
               matching is case-insensitive.

    When performing the SEARCH operation, the active comparator is
    applied instead of the case-insensitive matching specified above.

    An IMAP server which performs collation operations (e.g., as part of
    commands such as SEARCH, SORT, THREAD) does so according to the
    following procedure:

    (a) MIME encoding (for example see [RFC2047] for headers and
        [RFC2045] for body parts) MUST be removed in the texts being
        collated.

        If MIME encoding removal fails for a message (e.g., a body part
        of the message has an unsupported Content-Transfer-Encoding,
        uses characters not allowed by the Content-Transfer-Encoding,
        etc.), the collation of this message is undefined by this
        specification, and is handled in an implementation-dependent
        manner.

    (b) The decoded text from (a) MUST be converted to the charset
        expected by the active comparator.

    (c) For the substring operation:
        If step (b) failed (e.g., the text is in an unknown charset,
        contains a sequence which is not valid according in that
        charset, etc.), the original decoded text from (a) (i.e.,
        before the charset conversion attempt) is collated using the
        i;octet comparator (see [RFC4790]).

Internet-draft                                             November 2007


        If step (b) was successful, the converted text from (b) is
        collated according to the active comparator.


        For the ordering operation:

        All strings that were successfully converted by step (b) are
        separated from all strings that failed step (b). Strings in
        each group are collated independently. All strings that fail
        step (b) are collated (after applying step (a)) using the
        i;octet comparator (see [RFC4790]). All strings successfully
        converted by step (b) are collated using the active comparator.
        The resulting sorted list is produced by appending all collated
        "failed" strings after all strings collated using the active
        comparator.
        <<Add an example>>

    If the substring operation (e.g., IMAP SEARCH) of the active
    comparator returns the "undefined" result (see section 4.2.3 of
    [RFC4790]) for either the text specified in the SEARCH command or
    the message text, then the operation is repeated on the result of
    step (a) using the i;octet comparator.

    The ordering operation (e.g., IMAP SORT and THREAD) SHOULD collate
    the following together: strings encoded using unknown or invalid
    character encodings, strings in unrecognized charsets, and invalid
    input (as defined by the active collation).



4.3 COMPARATOR Command

    Arguments: Optional comparator order arguments.

    Response:  A possible COMPARATOR response (see Section 4.4).

    Result:    OK - Command completed
               NO - No matching comparator found
               BAD - arguments invalid

    The COMPARATOR command is used to determine or change the active
    comparator.  When issued with no arguments, it results in a
    COMPARATOR response indicating the currently active comparator.

    When issued with one or more comparator argument, it changes the
    active comparator as directed. (If more than one installed

    matches the specified patterns.

    The argument "default" refers to the server's default comparator.
    Otherwise each argument is an collation specification as defined in
    the Internet Application Protocol Comparator Registry [RFC4790].

        < The client requests activating a Czech comparator if possible,
          or else a generic international comparator which it considers
          suitable for Czech. The server picks the first supported
          comparator. >

        C: A001 COMPARATOR "cz;*" i;basic
        S: * COMPARATOR i;basic
        S: A001 OK Will use i;basic for collation


4.4 COMPARATOR Response

    Contents:  The active comparator.
               An optional list of available matching comparators

    The COMPARATOR response occurs as a result of a COMPARATOR command.
    The first argument in the comparator response is the name of the
    active comparator.  The second argument is a list of comparators
    which matched any of the arguments to the COMPARATOR command and is
    present only if more than one match is found.


4.5 Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification inherits ABNF [RFC4234] rules
    from IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501], and Internet Application Protocol
    Comparator Registry [RFC4790].

        command-auth      =/ comparator-cmd

        resp-text-code    =/ "BADCOMPARATOR" / "BADMATCH"

        comparator-cmd    = "COMPARATOR" *(SP comp-order-quoted)

      response-payload  =/ comparator-data

        comparator-data   = "COMPARATOR" SP comp-sel-quoted [SP "("
                        comp-id-quoted *(SP comp-id-quoted) ")"]

        comp-id-quoted  = astring
            ; Once any literal wrapper or quoting is removed, this
            ; follows the collation-id rule from [RFC4790]

Internet-draft                                             November 2007


        comp-order-quoted = astring
            ; Once any literal wrapper or quoting is removed, this
            ; follows the collation-order rule from [RFC4790]

        comp-sel-quoted   = astring
            ; Once any literal wrapper or quoting is removed, this
            ; follows the collation-selected rule from [RFC4790]


4.6 UNICASEMAP Extension Requirements

    An IMAP server that implements the i;unicode-casemap comparator
    [UCM] and satisfies all requirements specified in sections 4, 4.1
    and 4.2 of this document, but doesn't implement the COMPARATOR
    command and response, SHOULD advertise the UNICASEMAP capability in
    the CAPABILITY response.


    5.  Other IMAP Internationalization Issues

    The following sections provide an overview of various other IMAP
    internationalization issues.  These issues are not resolved by this
    specification, but could be resolved by other standards work, such
    as that being done by the EAI group (see [IMAP-EAI]).


5.1 Unicode Userids and Passwords

    IMAP4rev1 presently restricts the userid and password fields of the
    LOGIN command to US-ASCII. The "userid" and "password" fields of the
    IMAP LOGIN command are restricted to US-ASCII only until a future
    standards track RFC states otherwise.  Servers are encouraged to
    validate both fields to make sure they conform to the formal syntax
    of UTF-8 and to reject the LOGIN command if that syntax is violated.
    Servers MAY reject the use of any 8-bit in the "userid" or
    "password" field.

    When AUTHENTICATE is used, some servers may support userids and
    passwords in Unicode [RFC3490] since SASL (see [RFC4422]) allows
    that. However, such userids cannot be used as part of email
    addresses.


5.2 UTF-8 Mailbox Names

    The modified UTF-7 mailbox naming convention described in section
    5.1.3 of RFC 3501 is best viewed as an transition from the status
    quo in 1996 when modified UTF-7 was first specified.  At that time,



Newman, Gulbrandsen         Expires May 2008                 FF[Page 12]





Internet-draft                                             November 2007


    there was widespread unofficial use of local character sets such as
    ISO-8859-1 and Shift-JIS for non-ASCII mailbox names, with resultant
    non-interoperability.

    The requirements in section 5.1 of RFC 3501 are very important if
    we're ever going to be able to deploy UTF-8 mailbox names. Servers
    are encouraged to enforce them.


5.3 UTF-8 Domains, Addresses and Mail Headers

    There is now an IETF standard for Internationalizing Domain Names in
    Applications [RFC3490].  While IMAP clients are free to support this
    standard, an argument can be made that it would be helpful to simple
    clients if the IMAP server could perform this conversion (the same
    argument would apply to MIME header encoding [RFC2047]).  However,
    it would be unwise to move forward with such work until the work in
    progress to define the format of international email addresses is
    complete.


6.  IANA Considerations

    The IANA is requested to add LANGUAGE, COMPARATOR and UNICASEMAP to
    the IMAP4 Capabilities Registry.  [Note to IANA:
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities]


7.  Security Considerations

    The LANGUAGE extension makes a new command available in "Not
    Authenticated" state in IMAP.  Some IMAP implementations run with
    root privilege when the server is in "Not Authenticated" state and
    do not revoke that privilege until after authentication is complete.
    Such implementations are particularly vulnerable to buffer overflow
    security errors at this stage and need to implement parsing of this
    command with extra care.

    A LANGUAGE command issued prior to activation of a security layer is
    subject to an active attack which suppresses or modifies the
    negotiation and thus makes STARTTLS or authentication error messages
    more difficult to interpret.  This is not a new attack as the error
    messages themselves are subject to active attack.  Clients MUST re-
    issue the LANGUAGE command once a security layer is active, so this
    does not impact subsequent protocol operations.

    Both the LANGUAGE and COMPARATOR extensions use the UTF-8 charset,
    thus the security considerations for UTF-8 [RFC3629] are relevent.

Internet-draft                                             November 2007


    However, neither uses UTF-8 for identifiers so the most serious
    concerns do not apply.


8.  Acknowledgements

    The LANGUAGE extension is based on a previous Internet draft by Mike
    Gahrns and Alexey Melnikov, a substantial portion of the text in
    that section was written by them.  Many people have participated in
    discussions about an IMAP Language extension in the various fora of
    the IETF and Internet working groups, so any list of contributors is
    bound to be incomplete.  However, the authors would like to thank
    Andrew McCown for early work on the original proposal, John Myers
    for suggestions regarding the namespace issue, along with Jutta
    Degener, Mark Crispin, Mark Pustilnik, Larry Osterman, Cyrus Daboo
    and Martin Duerst for their many suggestions that have been
    incorporated into this document.

    Initial discussion of the COMPARATOR extension involved input from
    Mark Crispin and other participants of the IMAP Extensions WG.


9.  Relevant Standards for i18n IMAP Implementations

    This is a non-normative list of standards to consider when
    implementing i18n aware IMAP software.

      o The LANGUAGE and COMPARATOR extensions to IMAP (this
        specification).
      o The 8-bit rules for mailbox naming in section 5.1 of RFC 3501.
      o The Mailbox International Naming Convention in section 5.1.3 of
        RFC 3501.
      o MIME [RFC2045] for message bodies.
      o MIME header encoding [RFC2047] for message headers.
      o The IETF EAI working group.
      o MIME Parameter Value and Encoded Word Extensions [RFC2231] for
        filenames.  Quality IMAP server implementations will
        automatically combine multipart parameters when generating the
        BODYSTRUCTURE. There is also some deployed non-standard use of
        MIME header encoding inside double-quotes for filenames.
      o IDNA [RFC3490] and punycode [RFC3492] for domain names
        (presently only relevant to IMAP clients).
      o The UTF-8 charset [RFC3629].
      o The IETF policy on Character Sets and Languages [RFC2277].
