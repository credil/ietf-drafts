Internet-Draft       SIP Forum UA Config Service Tag        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Forum [1] User Agent Configuration Recommendation [SFUACFG]
   defines a procedure for SIP [RFC3261] User Agents to

   1.  determine the SIP domain from which to request configuration,

   2.  locate one or more server(s) that provide the configuration
       service for that domain,

   3.  construct a URL for and request configuration from that service,

   4.  request that the service send notices of any changes to that
       configuration.

   The second step, locating the configuration service for a given
   domain, is achieved by the U-NAPTR (URI-Enabled NAPTR) application
   defined in [RFC4848], which builds upon the S-NAPTR (Simple NAPTR)
   application defined in [RFC3958].

   This document registers the application service tag "SFUACFG" for
   this operation, as required by the U-NAPTR application.


2.  U-NAPTR Application Service Tag Registration

   This document registers the following U-NAPTR application service
   tag:

                  +-------------------------+-----------+
                  | Application Service Tag | SFUACFG   |
                  | Defining Publication    | [SFUACFG] |
                  +-------------------------+-----------+


3.  Security Considerations


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the "SFUACFG" Application
   Service Tag in the registry defined by [RFC3958].
