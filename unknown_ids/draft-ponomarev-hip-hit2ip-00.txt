Internet-Draft                HIT-TO-IP DNS                 January 2009


1.  Introduction

   One of the approaches to use legacy applications[RFC5338] with Host
   Identity Protocol[RFC4423] is to use HIT as IPv6 address.  The
   application may receive them from the nameserver, store internally
   and connect directly to a HIT.  The HIP software would receive packet
   with HIT as a destination IPv6 address without any additional
   information about the current locator and therefore some HIT
   resolution service is needed in this case.  This document suggests
   the DNS as an access protocol to such a service and proposes the
   usage conventions.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[RFC2119].

2.  HIT to IP addresses mappings in the DNS

   Domain Name System is well-known to systems administators and there
   is much experience with operations under high load.  It also allows
   dynamic modifications to reflect the changes of IP addresses and has
   low overhead when compared to many other protocols.  It is used now,
   for example, to get IP address reputations from various blacklists.

2.1.  Preconfigured Domain

   The systems using this method MUST have the same domain pre-
   configured, for example hit-to-ip.example.net.  A HIT is represented
   as a sequence of nibbles separated by dots and followed by the suffix
   similarly to IPv6 addresses in ip6.arpa[RFC3596]

   For example, the domain name corresponding to the HIT

   2001:10:1234:5678:9abc:def0:1234:5678

   would be

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                   hit-to-ip.example.net

2.2.  Listing IP Addresses of the System

   The A/AAAA resource record types MAY be used to specify the IP/IPv6
   addresses of the system.  There MAY be multiple locators listed for a
   HIT.

   For example, the system with IP address 192.0.2.1 and IPv6 address
   2001:DB8::1 would have the following records

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                 hit-to-ip.example.net.
     1     IN      A       192.0.2.1
   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                 hit-to-ip.example.net.
     1     IN      AAAA    2001:DB8::1

2.3.  Link to another domain

   The CNAME resource record types MAY be used to specify another domain
   to lookup the locators of the system.

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                  hit-to-ip.example.net.
     86400 IN      CNAME   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.

                       4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.hit-to-ip.domain.example.

2.4.  Managing the Records

   The system MAY send DNS UPDATE[RFC2136] to the server provided by SOA
   MNAME field of the domain.  The system MUST use HIT as the source
   address in this case.  The system MAY add or delete A/AAAA or CNAME
   records for its own HIT representation.  The domain provided in SOA
   MNAME field of the preconfigured domain MUST have Host Identity of
   the server stored in DNS, the IP addresses MUST be listed in that
   domain using suggested method and the server MUST accept DNS UPDATE
   messages, which add or delete A/AAAA or CNAME records for the HIT
   representation of the client after successfull HIP base exchange.
