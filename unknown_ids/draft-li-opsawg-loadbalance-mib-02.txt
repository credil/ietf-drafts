             Management Information Base for Load Balancers
                   draft-li-opsawg-loadbalance-mib-02

Abstract

   Load balancer is deployed widely in datacenter nowadays.  There is a
   requirement to build a unique LB network management system where two
   or more vendors' LB devices are used.  We propose the standard MIBs
   for unique NMS.

   Load balancer description is introduced at
   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)".

   This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a MIB module for load balance device.

Internet-Draft              Load Balancer MIB               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Load balancer is deployed widely in datacenter nowadays.  There is a
   requirement to build a unique LB network management system where two
   or more vendors' LB devices are used.  We propose the standard MIBs
   for unique NMS.

   This document defines 4 MIB Modules which together support the
   configuration and monitoring of Load Balance device.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578] STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Structure of Load-Balance MIB objects

   The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
   contained in the loadbalance-MIB.

   3.1.  Load balance System Entity Table

   The LBSysEntityTable is used to inquire and modify configuration
   management information.

   Each entry row in this table represents a single loadbalance entity.
   The operator can inquire or modify system/interface/routing protocol
   parameters from the table.

   3.2.  Load balance config Table

Internet-Draft              Load Balancer MIB               October 2011


   Since loadbalance device provides traffic dispatch ,health detection
   and session persistence function, it is neccessory to monitor
   loadbalance parameters such as disptach method , health detection
   method and session persistence policy.

   The lbConfigTable is a read and write table.  Each entry in this
   table represents the LB working parameter.

   3.3.  Load balance Alarm Table

   Loadbalance device should report the alarm to operating system in
   real-time when fault happens.  The fault can be divided into general
   alarm and specific alarm.  The general alarm contains system alarm,
   link alarm and authentication failed alarm. while, the specific alarm
   contains network protocol alarm, for example OSPF or ISIS.

   3.4.  Load balance Performance Table

   lbPerfTable is a read-only table which contains statistical
   information related to L3(IP layer) interface performance parameter,
   L3 network protocol parameter , L4/L7(transport layer or application
   layer) current active connections.

6.  Security Considerations

   [TBD]


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.
