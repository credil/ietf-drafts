Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions         October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is used to represent calendar
   data and is used with iTIP [RFC5546] to handle scheduling operations
   between calendar users. iCalendar is in widespread use, and in
   accordance with provisions in that specification, extension elements
   have been added by various vendors to the data format in order to
   support and enhance capabilities.  This specification collects a
   number of these ad-hoc extensions and uses the new IANA registry
   capability defined in [RFC5545] to register standard variants with
   clearly defined definitions and semantics.  In addition, some new
   elements are introduced for features that vendors have recently been
   requesting.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as
   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax elements shown below that
   are not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
   [RFC5545].


3.  Modifications to Calendar Components

   The following changes to the syntax defined in iCalendar [RFC5545]
   are made here.  New elements are defined in subsequent sections.

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions         October 2010


4.1.  CALENDAR-NAME Property

   Property Name:  CALENDAR-NAME

   Purpose:  This property specifies the name of the calendar.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, alternate text
      representation, and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object.  However, each property MUST represent the name
      of the calendar in a different language.

   Description:  This property is used to specify a name (a short, one-
      line description) of the iCalendar object that can be used by
      calendar user agents when presenting the calendar data to a user.
      Whilst a calendar only has a single name, multiple language
      variants can be specified by including this property multiple
      times with different "LANGUAGE" parameter values on each.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

          calname       = "CALENDAR-NAME" calnameparam ":" text CRLF

          calnameparam  = *(
                           ;
                           ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                           ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                           ;
                           (";" altrepparam) / (";" languageparam) /
                           ;
                           ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                           ; and MAY occur more than once.
                           ;
                           (";" other-param)
                           ;
                           )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

      representation, and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object.  However, each property MUST represent the
      description of the calendar in a different language.

   Description:  This property is used to specify a lengthy textual
      description of the iCalendar object that can be used by calendar
      user agents when describing the nature of the calendar data to a
      user.  Whilst a calendar only has a single description, multiple
      language variants can be specified by including this property
      multiple times with different "LANGUAGE" parameter values on each.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

          caldesc       = "CALENDAR-DESCRIPTION" caldescparam ":" text
                          CRLF

          caldescparam  = *(
                           ;
                           ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                           ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                           ;
                           (";" altrepparam) / (";" languageparam) /
                           ;
                           ; The following is OPTIONAL,

                           ;
                           (";" other-param)
                           ;
                           )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

          CALENDAR-DESCRIPTION:This calendar contains all the \
           official vacation days of our company.\nThese repre\
           sent paid time-off - make sure you have fun, we'll \

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions         October 2010


   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to BINARY to indicate inline binary
      encoded content information.  The value MUST refer to or be data
      with a media type of "image".

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, display, inline encoding,
      and value data type property parameters can be specified on this
      property.  The format type parameter can be specified on this
      property and is RECOMMENDED for inline binary encoded content
      information.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object.

   Description:  This property specifies an image for an iCalendar
      object via a uri or directly with inline data that can be used by
      calendar user agents when presenting the calendar data to a user.
      Multiple properties MAY be used to specify alternative sets of
      images with, for example, varying media subtypes, resolutions or
      sizes.  When multiple properties are present, calendar user agents
      SHOULD display only one of them, picking one that provides the
      most appropriate image quality, or display none.  The "DISPLAY"
      parameter is used to indicate the intended display mode for the
      image.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions         October 2010


   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, display, inline encoding,
      and value data type property parameters can be specified on this
      property.  The format type parameter can be specified on this
      property and is RECOMMENDED for inline binary encoded content
      information.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in a
      "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

   Description:  This property specifies an image for a calendar
      component via a uri or directly with inline data that can be used
      by calendar user agents when presenting the calendar data to a
      user.  Multiple properties MAY be used to specify alternative sets
      of images with, for example, varying media subtypes, resolutions
      or sizes.  When multiple properties are present, calendar user
      agents SHOULD display only one of them, picking one that provides
      the most appropriate image quality, or display none.  The
      "DISPLAY" parameter is used to indicate the intended display mode
      for the image.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in a
      "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.

   Description:  This property specifies information for accessing a
      conferencing system for attendees of a meeting or to-do.  This
      might be a tel: URI [RFC3496] for a telephone-based conference
      number dial-in (with access codes included), or it might be an
      http: URI [RFC2616] for a web-based video chat, or a URI for an
      instant messaging group chat room.  If a specific URI for a
      conferencing system is not available, a data: URI [RFC2397]
      containing a text description can be used.

      The "INFO" property paramater is used to convey additional details
      on the use of the URI.  For example, the URIs or access codes for
      the moderator and attendee of a teleconference system could be
      different, and the "INFO" property parameter could be used to
      "tag" each "CONFERENCE" property to indicate which is which.

      The "LANGUAGE" property parameter is used to indicate the language
      associated with the property, and in particular any "INFO"
      property parameter.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

          conference = "CONFERENCE" confparam  ":" uri CRLF

          confparam  = *(
                        ;
                        ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                        ; and MOST NOT occur more than once.
                        ;
                        (";" infoparam) / (";" languageparam) /
                        ;
                        ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                        ; and MAY occur more than once.
                        ;
                        (";" other-param)
                        ;
                        )

   Example:  The following are examples of this property:

          CONFERENCE;INFO=Moderator dial-in;:tel:+1-412-
           555-0123,,,654321
          CONFERENCE;INFO=Attendee dial-in;:tel:+1-412-5

6.  Property Parameters

6.1.  DISPLAY Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  DISPLAY

   Purpose:  To specify different ways in which an image for a calendar
      or component can be displayed.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

      displayparam = "DISPLAY" "="
                     ("BADGE" /       ; A small "badge" image
                      "BACKGROUND" /  ; Use as a background image
                      "OVERLAY" /     ; Use as an overlay image
                      "BANNER" /      ; Use as a "banner" across the top
                      x-name /        ; Experimental type
                      iana-token)     ; Other IANA registered type
                                      ;
                                      ; Default is BADGE

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on "CALENDAR-
      IMAGE" or "IMAGE" properties.  In the absence of this parameter,
      the value "BADGE" MUST be used for the default behavior.  The
      value determines how a client ought to present an image supplied
      in iCalendar data to the user.

      Values for this parameter are registered with IANA as per
      Section 8.3.  New values can be added to this registry following
      the procedure outlined in Section 8.2.1 of [RFC5545].

      Servers and clients MUST handle x-name and iana-token values they
      don't recognize by not displaying any image at all.

   Example:

          IMAGE;DISPLAY=BANNER;FMTTYPE=image/png:htt
           p://example.com/images/weather-cloudy.png

6.2.  INFO Property Parameter

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions         October 2010


   Parameter Name:  INFO

   Purpose:  To specify descriptive text about a property.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

      infoparam = "INFO" "=" paramtext

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on
      "CONFERENCE" properties.

   Example:

          CONFERENCE;INFO="Web video chat, access code=7654
           3";:http://video-chat.example.com/;group-id=1234
