Internet-Draft                Reason Header                 January 2011


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms from [RFC3261].

2.  Overview

   Although the use of the Reason header field in responses is
   considered in RFC3326[RFC3326], doing so is not specified for any
   existing response code.  Nonetheless, the Reason header field has
   been widely used in responses to carry Q.850 [Q.850]reason codes for
   failure responses to INVITEs that have been gatewayed to PSTN
   systems.  This document specifies and formally permits the use of the
   Reason header field in SIP responses to carry Q.850 [Q.850]reason
   codes for this and other purposes.

3.  RFC3326 1. Introduction

   Original Text:

   Initially, the Reason header field defined here appears to be most
   useful for BYE and CANCEL requests, but it can appear in any request
   within a dialog, in any CANCEL request and in any response whose
   status code explicitly allows the presence of this header field.

   Note that the Reason header field is usually not needed in responses
   because the status code and the reason phrase already provide
   sufficient information.

   New Text:

   Initially, the Reason header field defined here appears to be most
   useful for BYE and CANCEL requests, but it can appear in any request
   within a dialog, in any CANCEL request and in any response exept the
   100 trying response.

4.  RFC3326 2. The Reason Header Field

   Original Text

   The Reason header field MAY appear in any request within a dialog, in
   any CANCEL request and in any response whose status code explicitly
   allows the presence of this header field.

   New Text:

Internet-Draft                Reason Header                 January 2011


   The Reason header field MAY appear in any request within a dialog, in
   any CANCEL request .  The appearance of the Reason header is
   applicable to final responses 3xx, 4xx, 5xx and 6xx and 18x and 199
   provisional responses [I-D.ietf-sipcore-199].

5.  Security Considerations

   The Update allows the precence of the Reason in Responses.  The
   presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the
   treatment of the response.

   Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the
   reactions of the originating entities.  E.G. sending back a cause
   value "87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that
   the call was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.

   Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header information
   in Responses only by trusted entities as it is described within
   [RFC3325].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the use of the Reason header field described
   within [RFC3326] .  No additional SIP elements are defined within
   this document.  Therefore, this document does not provide any action
   to IANA.
