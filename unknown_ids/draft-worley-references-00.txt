Internet-Draft            SIP References header                July 2008


Abstract

   This document defines a SIP extension header, References, to be used
   within SIP messages to signify that the message (and by extension,
   the dialog containing it) is related to one or more other dialogs.
   It is expected to be used largely for diagnostic purposes.

Internet-Draft            SIP References header                July 2008


1.  Purpose of the References header

   In many situations, the processing of a SIP "telephone call" involves
   a number of different SIP dialogs.  Of course, the existing SIP
   headers provide adequate information for the SIP elements to carry
   out the needed operation.  But in many cases, it is difficult for an
   observer to identify from a network trace the particular SIP dialogs
   that are involved in one operation.

   For example, if a user agent receives a REFER message within one
   dialog, it sends an INVITE to establish a new dialog which replaces
   the previous one within the user interface of the user agent.  But
   since the connection between the new dialog and the old dialog is
   only realized within the user agent, there is no algorithmic way to
   associate the two dialogs based on the SIP messages alone -- the best
   available technique is to extract all the messages to/from the
   particular user agent, and then observe the INVITE that is sent
   immediately after receipt of the REFER.

   The purpose of the References header is to allow a SIP message to
   specify that the message carrying it (and by extension, the dialog
   that contains the message) is related to one or more other dialogs
   (specified by their Call-Id values).  Ideally, when given a Call-Id,
   an automated process can use the connections between dialogs
   specified in References headers to determine the entire set of
   dialogs that are needed to understand a complete "telephone call" or
   other SIP interaction.

   The current definition of the References header does not provide for
   specifying the nature of the relationship between the dialogs.
   Determining the nature of the relationship is expected to be done by
   a human observer or a heuristic algorithm.

2.  Syntax

   The syntax of the References header is as follows.  (All rules not
   defined here are taken from RFC 3261[1].)

    message-header  =/ References
    References      =  "References" HCOLON reference *(COMMA reference)
    reference       =  callid *( SEMI generic-param)

   Multiple References headers may appear in a SIP message, and their
   values may be combined or separated as allowed by section 7.3 of RFC
   3261[1].  The ordering of References values is not significant.

   The presence of a References header in a SIP message means that the
   message (and by implication, the dialog containing it) is related to
   the dialog(s) bearing the specified Call-Id(s).  The exact nature of
   the relationship is not specified.  Note that since there is no way
   to specify a to-tag and from-tag, the References header does not
   distinguish different dialogs that have the same Call-Id.

   Currently, no parameters have defined meanings.  All parameters that
   are not understood by the processor of the References header should
   be ignored.  Parameters whose names start with "X-" (case-
   insensitive) are reserved for non-standardized purposes.

   The call-id elements of the Replaces and Join headers are considered
   implicit "references" and so SHOULD NOT be specified in References
   headers.

   Note that while the SIP References header is similar in function to
   the SMTP References header, they have a different syntax and are not
   interchangeable.

3.  Examples

3.1.  REFER

   One use of References is to connect a REFER to the INVITE that it
   causes to be sent.  A typical use of REFER is to implement blind
   transfer.  This example is taken from section 2.4, "Transfer -
   Unattended" of draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-14[2].

   Upon receipt of the REFER, Bob's UA sends an INVITE to Carol's UA.
   In order to make explicit the relationship between the REFER and the
   INVITE, the INVITE has a References header giving the Call-Id of the
   REFER:

3.2.  Attended Transfer

   An attended transfer normally involves three different dialogs.  If
   the transfer completes, and the REFER that completes the transfer has
   a References header, the References and Replaces headers will suffice
   to connect the three dialogs.  However, to provide complete
   information if the transfer does not complete, the INVITE that
   establishes the "second leg" of the transfer scenario should have a

   has a References header giving the dialog of the first leg, within
   which the REFER was sent:

3.3.  Call Pickup

   References can be used during a call pickup operation to connect the
   SUBSCRIBE that is used to locate the target dialog with the INVITE
   which is generated to execute the pickup.  This example is taken from
   section 2.16 of draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-14[2].

   Bill's UA sends a SUBSCRIBE to find the target dialog:

       ;branch=z9hG4bK74bf

      Event: dialog

      Accept: application/dialog-info+xml
      Content-Length: 0

   After locating the target dialog, Bill's UA generates an INVITE-with-
   Replaces to execute the pickup.  The UA adds the References header to
   show the connection with the SUBSCRIBE:

      F7 INVITE  Bill -> Alice

      INVITE sips:a8342043f@atlanta.example.com;gr SIP/2.0
      References: rt4353gs2egg@pc.biloxi.example.com

      Call-ID: 563456212@b2.biloxi.example.com
      CSeq: 1 INVITE
      Require: replaces
      Replaces: 12345600@atlanta.example.com

      Allow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, NOTIFY
      Supported: replaces
      Content-Type: application/sdp
      Content-Length: ...

      [SDP omitted]

   Note that the executing INVITE F7 does not mention the Call-Id of the
   original INVITE F1 because it is mentioned in the Replaces header.

   If the call pickup operation is done by an agent on behalf of Bill's
   UA (as in the sipX open-source PBX), the executing INVITE is likely
   to exist before the SUBSCRIBE is generated.  In that case, the

4.  Practical Experience

   The current version of the sipX open-source PBX adds a References
   header to the SUBSCRIBE of a call pickup as described in Section 3.3.
   It has caused no observed interoperability problem.

5.  Security Considerations

   The specification of the relationship between two dialogs could in
   principle be a privacy issue.  But these relationships can usually be
   discerned by heuristic processing of the stream of SIP messages, and
   the author knows of no instance where the security or privacy
   properties of SIP have been based on the inability of an eavesdropper
   to determine that two SIP dialogs or messages are related.
