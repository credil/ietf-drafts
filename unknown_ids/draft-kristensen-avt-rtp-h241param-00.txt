Internet-Draft          New H.264 RTP parameters          September 2010


1.  Introduction and Overview

   The ITU-T H.264 [ITU.H264.2007] codec and the extended video
   procedures and control signals for H.300 series terminals in ITU-T
   H.241 [ITU.H241.2006], continue to evolve.  The IETF H.264 RTP
   payload format and parameters need to be updated to include important
   new functionalities not covered in RFC3984bis
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis].  This document describes a new
   parameter specified in H.241 - Amendment 2 [ITU.H241Amd2.2009] used
   to indicate the maximum picture rate that can be efficiently received
   or the maximum picture rate that can be sent.  This proposal defines
   media type parameters and allows use in SDP-based systems.

      Editorial note: This draft may be used to specify further, new
      H.241 parameters if applicable and when new parameters are
      defined.

1.1.  Maximum Frame Rate Signalling

   As a motivation for adding "yet another parameter" to the H.264 media
   subtype registration, existing parameters for frame rate signalling
   are described, the shortcomings are analysed and the benefits of a
   new optional parameter for H.264 are highlighted.

   A general attribute is specified in SDP [RFC4566] as follows:

   a=framerate:  This gives the maximum video frame rate in frames/sec.
      It is intended as a recommendation for the encoding of video data.
      Decimal representations of fractional values using the notation
      "<integer>.<fraction>" are allowed.  It is a media-level
      attribute, defined only for video media, and it is not dependent
      on charset.

   The "a=framerate" attribute applies to all video payloads in the
   media section it belongs to.  This may work well in scenarios where
   the maximum frame rate is identical for all the video codecs present
   in the video media section.  This is not always the case.

   In addition to the general "a=framerate" attribute, some video
   standards have some sort of frame rate signalling in their SDP
   description.  In the H.263 and H.261 RTP payload format
   specifications [RFC4629][RFC4587] the maximum frame rate capability
   for the H263-1998 and H261 media subtypes is signalled as an integer
   value Minimum Picture Interval (MPI).  The desired frame rate
   capability is calculated based on an assumed upper frame rate limit
   of close to 30 frames per second.  In the H263-1998 and H261 "a=fmtp"
   line, the optional parameters for the different resolutions have an
   associated MPI value.  As an example, the optional parameter for CIF

Internet-Draft          New H.264 RTP parameters          September 2010


   is specified for H263-1998 [RFC4629] as follows:

   cif:  Specifies the MPI (Minimum Picture Interval) for CIF
      resolution.  Permissible values are integer values from 1 to 32,
      which correspond to a maximum frame rate of 30/(1.001 * the
      specified value) frames per second.

   For the H263-2000 media subtype [RFC4629] MPI values are not used,
   instead the maximum frame rate is signalled implicit in the optional
   parameter named level.  Where level 50 and above implies a support
   for 60 frames per second, the lower levels 30 or 15 frames per
   second.  This is, by the way, equivalent to the implicit frame rate
   signalling the existing optional parameters for H.264
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis] offers today.

      Informational note: For the H263-1998 media subtype [RFC4629] it
      is possible to specify an arbitrary Custom Picture Clock Frequency
      (CPCF) and associated MPI values for the supported resolutions.
      However, the rationale for CPCF is to enable support for an actual
      clock rate deviating from the one specified in the "a=rtpmap"
      attribute, not to allow frame rates above 30 frames per second.

   For the VC-1 video codec [RFC4425] an optional parameter framerate is
   specified as an "a=fmtp" parameter.  It is an integer greater than
   zero and specifying the number of frames per second multiplied with
   1000 and rounded to nearest integer value.

   As the examples above show, the different media subtypes enables
   different means to signal the maximum frame rate capability.  Some
   are explicit, others implicit.  Some even have an implicit assumption
   of the maximum frame rate it is possible to express.  Also, using the
   SDP "a=framerate" attribute for all payloads associated with a media
   line is not feasible in general.

   So, why are the existing optional parameters for H.264 not
   sufficient?  Increasingly, systems are able to handle 60 frames per
   second and there is no feasible way to discover whether a system can
   handle such frame rates or not to ensure interoperability and to
   optimise resolution choices.

   The existing max-mbps and max-fs [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis]
   parameters underspecify the video stream and can lead to wasted
   bandwidth and processing resources.  For example, a decoder
   signalling support for w1080p30 (243000 MBPS and 8100 MB) implicitly
   allows the sending of w720p60 (216000 MBPS and 3600 MB).  Similarly,
   if a decoder signalled support for w720p30 (108000 MBPS and 3600 MB)
   the encoder could choose to send w480p60, w448p60 or even wCIF at 120
   frames per second.

Internet-Draft          New H.264 RTP parameters          September 2010


   In many cases there is a maximum frame rate at which the decoder side
   can use data.  This limit may stem from internal architecture or
   external factors, e.g. type of display attached.  If the encoder
   chooses to send at a higher frame rate than this maximum limit, the
   decoder side will normally discard the additional frames after
   decoding them.  The transmission of the extra frames and the
   processing of frames to just discard them is wasteful and the
   bandwidth and processing could be used more effectively.

   The new parameter MaxFPS is introduced in H.241 - Amendment 2 to
   remove this issue, by constraining the allowed parameter range.  This
   draft proposes adding the optional parameter max-fps for use in SDP-
   based signalling.  This adoption of the parameter will also ease the
   gatewaying between H.323 and SIP systems.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In this document 30 frames per second and 60 frames per second are
   used repeatedly.  However, the actual values when used in signalling
   description is typically 30/1.001=29.97 and 60/1.001=59.94.


3.  Payload Format Parameters

   The optional H264 media subtype parameter max-fps specified below
   comes in addition to the list of optional H264 media subtype
   parameters defined in Section 8.1 of RFC3984bis
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis].

3.1.  Media Type Registration

   New OPTIONAL parameter:

   max-fps:  This parameter MAY be used to indicate the maximum picture
      rate that can be efficiently received or the maximum picture rate
      that can be sent.  The value of max-fps is an integer in units of
      hundredths of frames per second.  Note that this is not
      necessarily the frame rate at which the maximum frame size can be
      sent.  If the parameter is absent then the encoder is free to
      choose any frame rate.

4.  SDP Parameters

4.1.  Mapping of the optional parameter to SDP

   The optional parameter max-fps, when present, MUST be included in the
   "a=fmtp" line of SDP.  The parameters in the "a=fmtp" line are
   expressed as a media type string, in the form of a semicolon
   separated list of parameter=value pairs.

      Editorial note: To be decided whether the stream property (sender
      capability) usage of max-fps is useful for SDP usage, i.e. with
      sendonly and for declarative usage.

4.2.  Usage with SDP offer/answer

   When H.264 is offered over RTP using SDP in an offer/answer exchange
   [RFC3264] for negotiation of unicast streams, the following
   limitations and rules applies:

   The interpretation of the optional parameter max-fps depends on the
   direction attribute.  When the direction attribute is sendonly, then
   it indicates the maximum picture rate that shall be sent.  When the
   direction attribute is sendrecv or recvonly, the value of this
   parameter indicates the maximum picture frame rate that the receiver
   can efficiently handle.  Any encoder that understands the parameter
   semantics shall constrain the frame rate to rates up to that
   specified.  A receiver should have the ability to process video from
   a sender that does not understand this parameter.

   The profile-level-id parameter MUST be present in the same receiver
   capability description that contains this parameter.

4.3.  Usage in Declarative Session Descriptions

   When H.264 over RTP is offered with SDP in a declarative style, the
   max-fps parameter is used to declare the actual stream property and
   the value indicates the maximum picture rate that shall be sent.

4.4.  Examples

   Two simple examples of SDP descriptions with the max-fps parameter.
   A system supporting maximum 30 frames per second could offer:

      m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
      a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E; max-fps=2997

Internet-Draft          New H.264 RTP parameters          September 2010


   A description for a system supporting 60 frames per second:

      m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 99
      a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
      a=fmtp:99 profile-level-id=42A01E; max-fps=5994


5.  Co-existence

      Editorial note: Whether the usage of the "a=framerate" parameter
      should be recommended in the case below or not is pending.
      Consider the text as basis for discussion.

   The SDP attribute "a=framerate" is used by some endpoints today, in
   cases where all the different video payloads in the media section has
   the same maximum frame rate limit.  To support endpoints with this
   behaviour and possibly no support for max-fps, endpoints SHOULD add
   both max-fps for H.264 and "a=framerate" for the video media section
   if all payloads has the same maximum frame rate.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft updates RFC3984bis by adding three new optional parameters
   to the H264 media subtype.  The parameters are specified in Section
   Section 3 of this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   No separate considerations introduced in this document.  Refer to
   section 9 of RFC3984bis [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis].


8.  Open issues

   The open issues are marked as editorial notes in the draft.  An
   overview of the issues:

   Placeholder:  This draft may be used for new H.241 parameters if
         applicable.  Depends on the timeline of this draft and
         proposals for H.241 extensions.  See Section 1.
   Stream property:  Specification for max-fps as stream property might
         be removed, if not feasible or actually required.  Pending.
         See Section 4.1.

   Co-existence:  Pending whether recommending "a=framerate" usage in
         given scenarios belongs here.  See Section 5.
