1.  Introduction

   Social network has become common.  Well organized social network
   information allows the vCard owner to import or preferably subscribe
   profile information from any existing profile when he/she joins a new
   network.

   Data portability remains, one of the incentives behind the
   development of this format.


2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
