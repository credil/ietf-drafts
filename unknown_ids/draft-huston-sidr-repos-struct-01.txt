Internet-Draft        ResCert Respository Structure        February 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a profile for the structure of repositories
   that contain X.509 / PKIX Resource Certificates
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].  This profile contains the proposed object
   naming scheme for the contents of Resource Certificate Repositories
   and the proposed internal structure of a Repository Cache that is
   intended to facilitate synchronization across a distributed
   collection of repositories and facilitate certificate path
   construction.

   A Resource Certificate describes an action by an Issuer that binds a
   list of IP address blocks and AS numbers to the Subject of a
   certificate, identified by the unique association of the Subject's
   private key with the public key contained in the Resource
   Certificate.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC3280], "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], and
   related regional Internet registry address management policy
   documents.


2.  Resource Certificate Publication Repository Contents

   This section describes the desired properties of the names associated
   with objects (certificates, certificate revocation lists, manifests
   and signed objects) held in publication repositories.

   An instance of a publication repository contains all the signed
   products of a Certificate Authority, or all the objects signed by an
   End Entity (EE) .

2.1.  CA Publication Repository

   In the case of a CA's publication repository in the scope of the
   Resource Certificate PKI (RPKI) , the repository contains the current
   certificates issued by this CA, the most recent CRLs that are
   associated with the CA's non-revoked keypairs, and the current
   Manifest.







Huston, et al.           Expires August 11, 2008                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        ResCert Respository Structure        February 2008


   CRL:  The scope of a CRL in the RPKI is all objects issued by a CA
      with a given key pair, implying that publication of successive
      instances of a CA's CRL may overwrite previous instances of CRLs
      signed by the same CA private key in the publication repository.
      This implies that the name chosen for the CRL in the publication
      repository may be a value derived from the public key part of the
      CA's key pair that was used to sign the CRL.  One such method of
      generating a CRL publication name is described in section 2.1 of
      [RFC4387], converting the 160-bit hash of the CA's public key
      value into a 27-character string using a modified form of Base64
      encoding, with an additional modification as proposed in section
      5, table 2, of [RFC4648].

   Manifest:  When a new instance of a manifest is published by the CA,
      there is no requirement within the RPKI for any relying party to
      have continuing access to older instances of the CA's manifest.
      This implies that the name chosen for the manifest object in the
      publication repository may be a constant value, implying that
      publication of successive instances of the manifest overwrite the
      previous instance of the manifest within the context of each
      publication repository.

   Certificates:  Within the RPKI framework it is possible that a CA may
      issue a series of certificates for the same subject and the same
      subject public key that refer the same subject right-of-use
      resource collection.  Within the context of each such series of
      certificates a relying party has an interest only in the most
      recently published certificate.  The publication repository object
      name scheme for the CA may use a unique name for each such series
      of certificates, thereby ensuring that each successive issued
      certificate in such a series effectively overwrites the previous
      instance of the certificate series in the publication repository.
      If the CA adopts a local policy that each subject uses a unique
      key pair for each unique instance of a certified resource
      collection then the CA can use a certificate object name scheme
      that is derived from the subject's public key, applying the
      algorithm described above for CRL object names to the subject's
      public key value.

   It is left as an implementation choice as to whether a CA is to use a
   single publication repository for all products of the CA across all
   non-retired keypairs, or to use one publication repository for each
   non-retired keypair.

2.2.  EE Publication Repository

   In the case of a EE's publication repository in the scope of the
   Resource Certificate PKI (RPKI) , the repository contains objects



Huston, et al.           Expires August 11, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        ResCert Respository Structure        February 2008


   that have been signed by the EE's key pair.  These objects do not
   form a logical sequence, and must be named uniquely in the context of
   the publication repository.

   It is consistent with this specification that all subordinate EE
   certificates of a given CA share a common publication repository.
   The choice of whether to use a common single publication repository
   or a dedicated publication repository per EE certificate is an
   implementation choice.


3.  Resource Certificate Publication Repository Considerations

   Each issuer may publish their issued certificates and CRL in any
   location of their choice.  However, there are a number of
   considerations which guide the choice of a suitable repository
   publication structure.

   o  The publication repository should be hosted on a highly available
      service and high capacity publication platform.

   o  The publication repository should be available using RSYNC.
      Support of additional retrieval protocols is the choice of the
      repository operator.

   o  Each CA publication directory in the publication repository should
      contain the products of a single issuer's CA instance.  Aside from
      subdirectories, no other objects should be placed in a publication
      repository directory.

      Any such subdirectory should be the repository publication point
      of a CA or EE certificate that is contained in the directory.
      There are no constraints on the name of a subdirectory.  These
      considerations also apply recursively to subdirectories of these
      directories.

   o  Signed Objects may be published in a repository.  It is
      recommended that only those objects that are generally useful to
      relying parties be published in this way.  At present this would
      appear to be constrained to Route Origin Authorization objects.
      Other signed objects, such as signed Internet Route Registry
      objects, for example, probably have no additional utility when
      published in a signed object repository.

   o  Signed Objects are published in the location indicated by the SIA
      field of the certificate (EE or CA certificate) that has certified
      the key pair that was used to sign the object.

4.  Synchronising Repositories

   While it is possible to perform the validation-related task of
   certificate path construction using retrieval of individual
   certificates and certificate revocation lists using online retrieval
   of individual certificates, sets of candidate certificates and
   certificate revocation lists based on the Authority Information
   Access, Subject Information Access and CRL Distribution Points
   certificate fields, the factors of speed and reliability of
   validation suggest that there is some value in maintaining a local
   synchronized repository containing a mirror of all valid
   certificates, current certificate revocation lists, and all related
   signed objects that are stored in the local instances of components
   of the overall logical complete certificate repository.

   The general approach to repository synchronization is one of a "top-
   down" walk of the distributed repository structure, commencing with
   the initial configured trust anchor certificates, and then populating
   the repository will all valid certificates that have been issued by
   these issuers, and then recursively applying the same approach to
   each of these subordinate certificates.  Obviously a process would
   need to support some maximal chain length from the initial trust
   anchors to the current working validation point in order to ensure
   that the process does not follow a loop or a non-terminating
   certificate chain.

   An informal algorithmic description of one such synchronization
   algorithm is as follows:

Internet-Draft        ResCert Respository Structure        February 2008


   Place configured trust anchor self-signed certificate(s) in the
    root directory of the repository

   working_directory = repository_directory_root
   chain_length = 0

   for each certificate in the current working_directory {
     Synch_Repository(certificate,working_directory, chain_length)
     }
   end


   Procedure Synch_Repository(certificate, directory, chain) {
     sub_dir = create_sub_dir(directory,g(ski(certificate)))
     rsync(sia(certificate),sub_dir) ;
     if (ca_set(certificate) {
       if (crl is invalid or missing) {
         warn(directory_name is invalid)
         remove(sub_dir)
         return(invalid)
         }
       for each sub_certificate in sub_dir {
         if (sub_certificate is invalid)
           remove(sub_certificate)
         else if (ca_set(sub_certificate) {
           if ((chain + 1) < max_chain)) {
             valid = Synch_Repository(sub_certificate, sub_dir,chain+1)
             if (valid == invalid)
               remove(sub_certificate)
             }
           }
         }
       }
     else {
       for each (sub_certificate in sub_dir) {
         remove(sub_certificate) ;
         }
       }
     for each signed_object in sub_dir {
       if signature(signed_object) is invalid
         remove(signed_object)
       }
     return(valid) ;
     }
