      <t>
        The NOMAIL policy is declared in an SSP record using the tag "NOMAIL".         
      </t>
      <t>
        No parameters are specified for the NOMAIL policy.
      </t>
      <t>
       If specified the NOMAIL policy states that no mail is sent from the domain to 
       which it is attached. All mail that purports to have been sent by that domain
       MUST be considered suspicious.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
