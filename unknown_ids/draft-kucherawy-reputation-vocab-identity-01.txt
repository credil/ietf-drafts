Internet-Draft   Email Identities Reputation Vocabulary     October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a "vocabulary" for describing reputation of an
   email identity.  A "vocabulary" in this context is defined in
   [RFCxxxx] and is used to describe assertions a reputation service
   provider can make about email identities as well as meta-data that
   can be included in such a reply beyond the base set specified there.


2.  Document Series

   This memo represents the media type registration, part of a series of
   documents that define the overall service and introduce the initial
   exemplary applications.  The series is as follows:

   1.  RFCxxxx: A Model for Reputation Interchange

   2.  RFCxxxx+1: A Media Type for Reputation Information

   3.  RFCxxxx+2: Using UDP for Reputation Interchange

   4.  RFCxxxx+3: Using the DNS for Reputation Interchange

   5.  RFCxxxx+4: Using HTTP/XML for Reputation Interchange

   6.  RFCxxxx+5: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Identity Reputation
       (this memo)

   7.  RFCxxxx+6: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Property Reputation


3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

3.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.2.  Email Definitions

   Commonly used definitions describing entities in the email
   architecture are defined and discussed in [EMAIL-ARCH].

3.3.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this memo are defined in RFCxxxx, the
   base memo in this document series.


4.  Discussion

   The expression of reputation about an email identity requires
   extensions of the base set defined in [RFCxxxx].  This memo defines
   and registers some common assertions about an entity found in a piece
   of [MAIL].

4.1.  Assertions

   The "email-id" reputation application recognizes the following
   assertions:

   PERPETRATES-FRAUD:  The subject identity is associated with
      fraudulent email

   SENDS-MALWARE:  The subject identity is associated with the sending
      or relaying of malware via email

   SENDS-SPAM:  The subject identity is associated with unwanted bulk
      email

4.2.  Vocabulary Extensions

   The "email" reputation application recognizes the following
   extensions to the vocabulary defined in [RFCxxxx]:

   IDENTITY:  A token indicating the source of the identity; that is,
      where the subject identity was found in the message.  This MUST be
      one of:

      DKIM:  The signing domain, i.e. the value of the "d=" tag, found
         on a valid [DKIM] signature in the message

      RFC5321.MAILFROM:  The RFC5321.MailFrom value of the envelope of a
         message of the message (see [SMTP])

      RFC5322.FROM:  The RFC5322.From field of the message (see [MAIL])

      SPF:  The identity verified by [SPF])

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo presents one action for IANA, namely the registraton of the
   reputation application "email-id".

5.1.  Registration of 'email-id' Reputation Application

   This section registers the "email-id" reputation application, as
   defined in [RFCxxxx+1].  The registration parameters are as folows:

   o  Application name: email-id

   o  Short description: Evaluates DNS domain names found in email
      identities

   o  Defining document: [this memo]

   o  Status: current

   o  Application-specific query parameters:

      subject:  (current) identifies the subject of the reputation
         query; in this case, it is the email identity whose reputation
         is requested


6.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes security considerations introduced by the media
   type defined here.

6.1.  General

   This memo is part of a series introducing a reputation query and
   response system (see Section 2).  The Security Considerations
   sections of the other memos should also be consulted.
