Abstract

   This document creates an Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA)
   registry for tel Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) parameters and
   their values.  It populates the registry with the parameters defined
   in the tel URI specification, along with the parameters in tel URI
   extensions defined for number portability and trunk groups.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registry for TEL URI Parameters     December 2006


1.  Introduction

   The tel URI, defined in RFC 3966 [1], defines a URI that can be used
   to represent resources identified by telephone numbers.  The tel URI,
   like many other URIs, provides extensibility through the definition
   of new URI parameters and new values for existing parameters.
   However, RFC3966 did not specify an IANA registry where such
   parameters and values can be listed and standardized.  This
   specification creates such a registry.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

3.  Use of the Registry

   The tel URI parameters and values for these parameters MUST be
   documented in a standards-track RFC in order to be registered by
   IANA.  This documentation MUST fully explain the syntax, intended
   usage, and semantics of the parameter.  The intent of this
   requirement is to assure interoperability between independent
   implementations, and to prevent accidental namespace collisions
   between implementations of dissimilar features.

   RFCs defining tel URI parameters or parameter values MUST register
   them with IANA as described below.

   Registered tel URI parameters and their values are to be considered
   "reserved words".  In order to preserve interoperability, registered
   parameters MUST be used in a manner consistent with that described in
   their defining RFC.  Implementations MUST NOT utilize "private" or
   "locally defined" URI parameters that conflict with registered
   parameters.

   Some tel URI parameters only accept a set of predefined parameter
   values while others can take any value.  There are also parameters
   that do not have any value; they are used as flags.

   Those URI parameters that take on predefined values typically take on
   a large number of values.  Registering each of those values, or
   creating a sub-registry for each such parameter is not not
   appropriate.  Instead, we have chosen to register URI parameter
   values by reference.  That is, the entry in the URI parameter
   registry for a given URI parameter contains references to the RFCs
   defining new values of that parameter.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registry for TEL URI Parameters     December 2006


   Accordingly, the tel URI parameter registry contains a column that
   indicates whether or not each parameter only accepts a set of
   predefined values.  The column can contain "Yes", or "No".  A value
   of "Yes" in the column implies that certain predefined values exist
   for this parameter and the accompanying RFC should be consulted to
   find out the accepted set of values.  A value of "No" in the column
   implies that the parameter is used either as a flag, or does not have
   a set of predefined values.  The accompanying RFC should provide more
   information on the semantics of the parameter.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The specification creates a new IANA registry named "tel URI
   Parameters".

4.1  tel URI Parameters Registry

   New tel URI parameters and new values for existing tel URI parameters
   MUST be registered by IANA.

   When registering a new tel URI parameter the following information
   MUST be provided:

   o  Name of the parameter.
   o  Whether the parameter only accepts a set of predefined values.
   o  Reference to the RFC defining the parameter and to any RFC that
      defines new values for the parameter.

   When registering a new value for an existing tel URI parameter the
   following information MUST be provided:

   o  Name of the parameter.
   o  Reference to the RFC providing the new value.

   Note to IANA editor:  When a new value for an existing tel URI
   parameter is standardized, the Reference column of Table 1 (below)
   corresponding to the parameter name must be updated to include the
   new RFC number.

   Table 1 contains the initial values for this registry.

   Table 1: IANA tel URI parameter registry

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace AAAA with the RFC number for [7].
   Please replace CCCC with the RFC number for [5].

4.2  Registration Policy for tel URI Parameters

   As per the terminology in RFC 2434 [4], the registration policy for
   tel URI parameters shall be "Standards Action".  For the purposes of
   this registry, the parameter for which IANA registration is requested
   MUST be defined by a standards-track RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   The registry in this document does not in itself have security
   considerations.  However, as mentioned in RFC 3427 [2], an important
   reason for the IETF to manage the extensions of SIP is to ensure that
   all extensions and parameters are able to provide secure usage.  The
   supporting RFC publications for parameter registrations described
   this specification MUST provide detailed security considerations for
   them.

6.  Acknowledgments

   The bulk of this document comes from RFC 3969 [8] written by Gonzalo
   Camarillo.  Jonathan Rosenberg provided substantive comments that
   have improved this document.
