       Rationale for update to the IPv6 flow label specification
                     draft-ietf-6man-flow-update-04

Abstract

   Various published proposals for use of the IPv6 flow label are
   incompatible with its original specification in RFC 3697.
   Furthermore, very little practical use is made of the flow label,
   partly due to some uncertainties about the correct interpretation of
   the specification.  This document discusses and motivates changes to
   the specification in order to clarify it, and to introduce some
   additional flexibility.

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update                 March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The flow label field in the IPv6 header was reserved but left
   experimental by [RFC2460], which mandates only that "Hosts or routers
   that do not support the functions of the Flow Label field are
   required to set the field to zero when originating a packet, pass the
   field on unchanged when forwarding a packet, and ignore the field
   when receiving a packet."

   The flow label field was normatively specified by [RFC3697].  In
   particular, we quote three rules from that RFC:
   a.  "The Flow Label value set by the source MUST be delivered
       unchanged to the destination node(s)."
   b.  "IPv6 nodes MUST NOT assume any mathematical or other properties
       of the Flow Label values assigned by source nodes."
   c.  "Router performance SHOULD NOT be dependent on the distribution
       of the Flow Label values.  Especially, the Flow Label bits alone
       make poor material for a hash key."

   Additionally, RFC 3697 leaves it undefined what method a host should
   adopt by default to choose the value of the flow label, if no
   specific method is in use.  It was expected that various signaling
   methods might be defined for agreeing on values of the flow label,
   but no such methods have been standardised, except a pre-existing
   option in RSVP [RFC2205].

   The flow label is hardly used in practice in widespread IPv6
   implementations, although some operating systems do set it
   [McGann05].  To some extent this is due to the main focus being on
   basic deployment of IPv6, but the absence of a default method of
   choosing the flow label value means that most host implementations
   simply set it to zero.  There is also anecdotal evidence that the
   rules quoted above have led to uncertainty about exactly what is
   possible.  Furthermore, various use cases have been proposed that
   infringe one or another of the rules.  None of these proposals has
   been accepted as a standard and in practice there is no significant
   deployment of any mechanism to set the flow label.

   The intention of this document is to explain this situation in more
   detail and to motivate changes to RFC 3697 intended to remove the
   uncertainties and encourage active usage of the flow label.  It does
   not formally update RFC 3697, but it serves as background material
   for [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis].


2.  Impact of current specification

   Rule (a) makes it impossible for the routing system to use the flow



Amante, et al.         Expires September 14, 2011               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update                 March 2011


   label as any form of dynamic routing tag.  This was a conscious
   choice in the early design of IPv6 and there appears to be no
   practical possibility of revisiting this choice at this stage in the
   deployment of IPv6, which uses conventional routing mechanisms like
   those used for IPv4.  However, this rule also makes it impossible to
   make any use at all of the flow label unless hosts choose to set it.
   It also forbids clearing the flow label for security reasons.

   This last point highlights the security properties, or rather the
   lack of them, of the flow label.  The flow label field is always
   unprotected as it travels through the network, because there is no
   IPv6 header checksum, and the flow label is not included in transport
   pseudo-header checksums, nor in IPsec checksums.  As a result,
   intentional and malicious changes to its value cannot be detected.
   Also, it could be used as a covert data channel, since apparently
   pseudo-random flow label values could in fact consist of covert data.
   If the flow label were to carry quality of service semantics, then
   like the diffserv code point [RFC2474], it would not be intrinsically
   trustworthy across domain boundaries.  As a result, some security
   specialists believe that flow labels should be cleared for safety.
   These points must be considered when discussing the immutability of
   the flow label across domain boundaries.

   Rule (b) appears to forbid any usage in which the bits of the flow
   label are encoded with a specific semantic meaning.  However, the
   words "MUST NOT assume" are to be interpreted precisely - if a router
   knows by configuration or by signaling that the flow label has been
   assigned in a certain way, it can make use of that knowledge.  It is
   not made clear by the rule that there is an implied distinction
   between stateless models (in which case no assumption may be made)
   and stateful models (in which the router has explicit knowledge).

   If the word "alone" is overlooked, rule (c) has sometimes been
   interpreted to forbid the use of the flow label as part of a hash
   used by load distribution mechanisms.  In this case too, the word
   "alone" is to be interpreted precisely - a router is allowed to
   combine the flow label value with other data in order to produce a
   uniformly distributed hash.

   Both before and after these rules were laid down, a considerable
   number of proposals for use of the flow label were published that
   seem incompatible with them.  Numerous examples and an analysis are
   presented in [I-D.hu-flow-label-cases].  Those examples propose use
   cases in which some or all of the following apply:
   o  The flow label may be changed by intermediate systems.
   o  It doesn't matter if the flow label is changed, because the
      receiver doesn't use it.

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update                 March 2011


   o  Some or all bits of the flow label are encoded: they have specific
      meanings understood by routers and switches along the path.
   o  The encoding is related to the required quality of service, as
      well as identifying a flow.
   o  The flow label is used to control forwarding or switching in some
      way.

   These proposals all require either some form of encoding of semantics
   in the bits of the flow label, or the ability for routers to modify
   the flow label, or both.  Thus they appear to infringe the rules from
   RFC 3697 quoted above.

   We can conclude that a considerable number of researchers and
   designers have been stymied by RFC 3697.  On the other hand, some
   other proposals discussed in [I-D.hu-flow-label-cases] appear to be
   compatible with RFC 3697.  Several are based on the originator of a
   packet choosing a pseudo-random flow label for each flow, which is
   one option suggested in RFC 3697.  Thus, we can also conclude that
   there is a useful role for this approach.

   If our goal is for the flow label to be used in practice, the
   conflict between the various approaches creates a dilemma.  There
   appear to be two major options:
   1.  Discourage locally defined and/or stateful use of the flow label.
       Strengthen RFC 3697 to say that hosts SHOULD set a pseudo-random
       label value, without creating state, which would clarify and
       limit its possible uses.  In particular, its use for load
       distribution and balancing would be encouraged.
   2.  Relax the rules to encourage locally defined and/or stateful use
       of the flow label.  This approach would make the flow label
       completely mutable and would exclude use cases depending on
       strict end-to-end immutability.  It would encourage applications
       of a pseudo-random flow label, such as load distribution, on a
       local basis, but it would exclude end-to-end applications.

   During 2010 there was considerable debate about these options and
   variants of them, with a variety of proposals in previous versions of
   this document and in mailing list discussions.  After these
   discussions, there appears to be a view that simplicity should
   prevail, and that complicated proposals such as defining quality of
   service semantics in the flow label, or sub-dividing the flow label
   field into smaller sub-fields, will not prove efficient or
   deployable, especially in high speed routers.  There is also a
   clearly expressed view that using the flow label for various forms of
   stateless load distribution is the best simple application for it.
   At the same time, it is necessary to recognize that the strict
   immutability rule has drawbacks as noted above.

   Even under the rules of RFC 3697, the flow label is intrinsically
   untrustworthy, because modifications en route cannot be detected.
   For this reason, even with the current strict immutability rule,
   downstream nodes cannot rely on the value being unchanged.  In this
   sense, any use of the flow label must be viewed as an optimisation on
   a best effort basis; a packet with a changed (or zero) flow label
   value should never cause a hard failure.

   The remainder of this document discusses specific modifications to
   the standard, which are defined normatively in a companion document
   [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis].


3.  Changes to specification

   Although RFC 3697 requires the flow label to be delivered unchanged,
   as noted above, it is not included in any transport layer pseudo-
   header checksums nor in IPsec authentication [RFC4302].  Both RFC
   2460 and RFC 3697 define the default flow label to be zero.  At the
   time of writing, this is the observed value in an overwhelming
   proportion of IPv6 packets; the most widespread operating systems and
   applications do not set it, and routers do not rely on it.  Thus
   there is no reason to expect operational difficulties if a careful
   change is made to the rules of RFC 3697.

   In particular, the facts that the label is not checksummed and rarely
   used mean that the current strict immutability of the label can be
   moderated without serious operational consequences.

   The purposes of the proposed changes are to remove the uncertainties
   left by RFC 3697, in order to encourage setting of the flow label by
   default, and to enable its generic use.  The proposed generic use is
   to encourage pseudo-random flow labels that can be used to assist
   load distribution balancing.  There should be no impact on existing
   IETF specifications other than RFC 3697 and no impact on currently
   operational software and hardware.

   A secondary purpose is to modify the immutability of the flow label
   in a limited way, to allow hosts that do not set the flow label to
   benefit from it nevertheless.  The fact that the flow label may in
   practice be changed en route is also reflected in the reformulation
   of the rules.

   A general description of the changes follows.  The normative text is
   to be found in [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis].

   The definition of a flow is subtly changed from RFC 3697 to allow any
   node, not just the source node, to set the flow label value.

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update                 March 2011


   However, it is recommended that sources should set a pseudo-random
   flow label value in all flows, replacing the less precise
   recommendation made in Section 3 of RFC 3697.  Both stateful and
   stateless methods of assigning a pseudo-random value could be used.

   Section 3 of RFC 3697 also allows nodes to participate in an
   unspecified method of flow state establishment.  The changes do not
   remove that option, but it is made clear that stateless models are
   also possible and are the recommended default.  The specific text
   about requirements for stateful models has been reduced to a bare
   minimum requirement that they do not interfere with the stateless
   model.

   The main novelty is that a forwarding node (typically a first-hop or
   ingress router) may set the flow label value if the source has not
   done so, according to the same recommendations that apply to the
   source.  This might place a considerable processing load on ingress
   routers, even if they adopted a stateless method of flow
   identification and label assignment.

   The immutability of the flow label, once it has been set, is not
   changed.  However, some qualifications are placed on this property,
   to allow for the fact that the flow label is an unprotected field and
   might be changed undetectably.  No Internet-wide mechanism can depend
   mathematically on immutable flow labels.  The new rules require that
   flow labels exported to the Internet should always be either zero or
   pseudo-random, but even this cannot be relied on mathematically.  Use
   cases need to be robust against non-conforming flow label values.
   This will also enhance compatibility with any legacy hosts that set
   the flow label according to RFC 2460 or RFC 3697.


4.  Discussion

   The following are some practical consequences of the above changes:
   o  Sending hosts that are not updated will in practice continue to
      send all-zero labels.  If there is no label-setting router along
      the path taken by a packet, the label will be delivered as zero.
   o  Sending hosts conforming to the new specification will by default
      choose pseudo-random labels between 1 and 0xFFFFF.
   o  Sending hosts may continue to send all-zero labels, in which case
      an ingress router may set pseudo-random labels between 1 and
      0xFFFFF.
   o  The flow label is no longer unrealistically asserted to be
      strictly immutable; it is recognised that it may, incorrectly, be
      changed en route.  In some circumstances this will break end-to-
      end usage, e.g. potential detection of third-party spoofing
      attacks [I-D.gont-6man-flowlabel-security].

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update                 March 2011


   o  The expected default usage of the flow label is some form of
      stateless load distribution, such as the ECMP/LAG usage defined in
      [I-D.carpenter-flow-ecmp].
   o  If the new rules are followed, all IPv6 traffic flows on the
      Internet should have zero or pseudo-random flow label values.

   From an operational viewpoint, existing IPv6 hosts that set a default
   (zero) flow label value and ignore the flow label on receipt will be
   unaffected by implementations of the new specification.  In general,
   it is assumed that hosts will ignore the value of the flow label on
   receipt; it cannot be relied on as an end-to-end signal.  However,
   this doesn't apply if a cryptographically generated label is being
   used to detect attackers [I-D.gont-6man-flowlabel-security].

   Similarly, routers that ignore the flow label will be unaffected by
   implementations of the specification.

   Hosts that set a default (zero) flow label but are in a domain where
   routers set a pseudo-random label as recommended in Section 3 will
   benefit from whatever flow label handling is used on the path.

   Hosts and routers that adopt the recommended pseudo-random mechanism
   will enhance the performance of any load balancing devices that
   include the flow label in the hash used to select a particular path
   or server, even when packets leave the local domain.

   usage of the flow label as an alternative to any form of generic use,
   but it required complex rules for the behaviour of domain boundary
   routers, and proved controversial in discussion.

   Two even more complex alternative approaches were also considered and
   rejected.

   The first was to distinguish locally significant flow labels from
   those conforming to RFC 3697 by setting or clearing the most
   significant bit (MSB) of the flow label.  This led to quite
   complicated rules, seems impossible to make fully self-consistent,
   and was not considered practical.

   The second was to use a specific differentiated services code point
   (DSCP)[RFC2474] in the Traffic Class octet instead of the MSB of the
   flow label itself, to flag a locally defined behaviour.  A more
   elaborate version of this was proposed in
   [I-D.martinbeckman-ietf-ipv6-fls-ipv6flowswitching].  There are two
   issues with this approach.  One is that DSCP values are themselves
   only locally significant, inconsistent with the end-to-end nature of
   the original flow label definition.  Secondly, it seems unwise to
   meld the semantics of differentiated services, which are currently
   deployed, with the unknown future semantics of flow label usage.
   However, this approach, while not recommended, does not appear to
   violate any basic principles if applied strictly within a single
   differentiated services domain.
