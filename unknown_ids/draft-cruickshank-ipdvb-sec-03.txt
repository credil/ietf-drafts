1. Introduction 

   The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation Protocol (ULE) [3] 
   is used for the transportation of user traffic like IP datagrams, 
   ethernet frames, etc. over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS) [1]. 
   This document describes a new ULE mandatory extension header for 
   providing link layer security for ULE.  

   In MPEG-2 transmission networks employing ULE, there is a need to 
   provide link-layer security, particularly where network layer and 
   transport-layer security may not be present or may not be 
   sufficient. The security requirements are presented and discussed 
   in detail in [4]. The set of security services that the security 
   extension for ULE can provide includes data confidentiality, data 
   integrity, data origin authentication and rejection of replayed 
   packets. While providing suitable link encryption is mandatory, 
   link layer data integrity and data origin authentication is 
   provided as an optional security service. These are especially 
   desirable for systems where there are several ULE transmitters

   (e.g. satellite meshed systems with on-board processing).  

   On Securing the ULE SNDUs, security is provided at the link layer 
   as opposed to other existing mechanisms like IP Security (IPsec) 
   [8] that provides security at the network-layer or TLS [11] that 
   provides transport layer security. Since these security services 
   are provided at the link layer any network layer protocol like IP 
   (even with Ethernet bridging) may be used with secure ULE.  

   ULE may use and benefit from IETF key management protocols, such 
   as the MSEC Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) [9] and Group 
   Secure Association Key Management Protocol (GSAKMP) [7]. This 
   does not preclude the use of other key management methods in 
   scenarios for which there is benefit. The encryption algorithms, 
   key lengths, etc. will be defined making use of the standard 
   IPsec suites.  For this purpose a security association identity 
   similar to the IPsec Security Parameter Index (SPI)[8] is used.  

   In some current encapsulation methods like Multi-Protocol 
   Encapsulation (MPE) [5], encryption of the MAC address requires 
   each receiver to decrypt all encrypted data sent using a TS 
   Logical Channel (identified by a PID), before it can then filter 
   the PDUs that matches the set of Network Point of Attachment 
   (NPA) addresses that the Receiver wishes to receive.  Therefore 
   encryption of the MPE NPA address is not permitted in such 
   systems.  This document specifies a method which provides support 
   for using temporary Layer 2 NPA address.

4. ULE Security Extension 

   This section describes the security services offered and the 
   packet format of the security extension for ULE.  The procedures 
   for processing the security extension header at the transmitter 
   and the receiver are also described.  

4.1. Security Services 

   MPEG-2 based networks are susceptible to several security 
   attacks, both passive and active. Some of the main security 
   services (mandatory or optional) that the security extension for 
   ULE aims to provide for IP services running on MPEG-2 based 
   systems are:  

   o Data Confidentiality (Mandatory): Data confidentiality is    
     achieved by encrypting the higher layer PDU (and other ULE 
 
 
Cruickshank et. al.     Expires January 24, 2008           [Page 4]

     extensions headers that may be present and require security) 
     before encapsulation in the ULE SNDU, so that only authorised 
     receivers can decrypt the transmitted information while an 
     adversary would not be able to recover the important 
     information even if it got hold of the transmitted data.  

   o Receiver NPA address hiding (mandatory): This is an important 
     objective for ULE security to prevent any passive attacks like 
     traffic analysis.  The option D=1 (i.e. no NPA address 
     present) is permitted as long as the ULE_Security_Identifier 
     (ULE-SID) is unique in the whole ULE network.  This implies 
     the need for a centralised key management system that 
     generates the ULE-SID. If an NPA address is used (option D=0) 
     in the base ULE header, then the Network Control Centre (NCC) 
     is responsible for generating a temporary NPA address. The 
     temporary NPA address should be used for all secure 
     communications with that receiver. The ULE encapsulator should 
     be notified of these addresses as well. In addition, the 
     temporary NPA address will change from time to time depending 
     on the security policy and it is not directly related to each 
     ULE session. It can change periodically (for example after a 
     specified period of time and/or after a specified volume of 
     traffic has been sent to that terminal).  The temporary NPA 
     address is used in association with the ULE-SID for specific 
     session security. It is envisaged that there will be a small 
     impact on the NCC for handling two NPA addresses for each 
     terminal.  

   o Data origin authentication (Optional): Data origin (source) 
     authentication allows a ULE receiver to verify that the data 
     is sent by the claimed ULE sender. To achieve data origin 
     authentication, a Message Authentication Code (MAC) is 
     generated for each message using a shared secret key and is 
     also transmitted along with the data.  The ULE receiver 
     calculates the MAC for the received data using the shared key, 
     and then compares this computed MAC value to the one sent by 
     the sender along with the data. If the two match, then the 
     receiver knows that the data had to be sent from the claimed 
     sender.  

   o Data Integrity (Optional): Data integrity provides a way for 
     the receiver of the data message to know if the data has been 
     tampered in transit by an attacker. The MAC used for data 
     authentication also provides data integrity. The receiver of 
     the data calculates the MAC and compares it to the one 
     transmitted by the sender. If an adversary had tampered with 
     the message then the two MACs would not match.

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     June 2007 
    

   o Replay Attacks Countermeasures (Optional): Methods against 
     replay attacks need to ensure that the received data is recent 
     and that an adversary has not replayed old messages at a later 
     time. A monotonically increasing sequence number would be used 
     with every message and messages with old sequence number 
     values would be rejected. The choice of using sequence numbers 
     is dictated by policy and is done by the key management 
     system.  

   Another issue is key space. There is a need for the following two 
   databases for the correct processing on security in ULE 
   transmitters and receivers:  

   o Security Policy Database (SPD): This database contains the 
     policies that determine the processing of all ULE 
     inbound/outbound traffic (such as encrypting all outbound ULE 
     traffic destined to a certain terminal).  

   o Security Association Database (SAD): Each entry defines the 
     parameters associated with one ULE-SID such as encryption 
     keys, keys and algorithms used for calculating the MAC, 
     presence of Sequence number and MAC. Each ULE-SID has an entry 
     in the SAD.  

   This specification may re-use existing techniques in IPsec 
   architecture and therefore the SPD and the SAD will follow the 
   format of these databases as defined in RFC 4301 [8]. The 
   security suite of algorithms for data encryption and data 
   authenticity/integrity specified in IPsec/MSEC will be used for 
   ULE security. The design of these databases will be simpler and 
   also the lookups because unlike in IPsec only the ULE-SID along 
   with the NPA address and possibly the PID is needed to retrieve 
   the data from these databases.  

4.2. Secure ULE SNDU Format 

   The security extension aims to secure the transmission of user 
   traffic over MPEG-2 Transport Streams.  In order to address the 
   security issues, Figure 1 shows the SNDU format with the security 
   extension header.  

   This security extension is a standard extension header as 
   described in Section 5 of RFC 4326 [3] and does not affect the 
   ULE base protocol. This security extension header is a Mandatory 
   ULE Extension header. This means that a receiver MUST process 
   this header before it processes the next extension header or the 
   encapsulated PDU, otherwise the entire SNDU should be discarded.

   Figure 1 General SNDU format with Security extension header (D=0)  

   In Figure 1, the Type field in the base header denotes that a 
   mandatory security extension header is present. The receiver 
   destination NPA address is optional. After the base ULE header 
   the security extension header follows. This header contains the 
   ULE-SID, the optional Sequence Number field and the optional 
   Message Authentication Code (MAC) field. The Next-Type field 
   denotes the type of the enclosed PDU. The higher-layer PDU is 
   encrypted and then encapsulated in the SNDU.  

   The format of the Destination Address Absent field (D), the 
   Length field the Type field and the Receiver Destination NPA 
   address field are defined by ULE [3].  

4.2.1. Destination Address Absent (D) Field  

   The most significant bit of the Length Field carries the value of 
   the Destination Address Absent Field (D) as defined by ULE [3]. 
   When D is set to 0, it indicates the presence of the Destination 
   Address Field while D set to 1 indicates that a Destination 
   Address Field is not present.

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     June 2007 
    

4.2.2. Length Field  

   A 15-bit Length field denotes the length, in bytes, of the SNDU 
   counted from the byte following the Type field, up to and 
   including the CRC [3].  

4.2.3. Type Field  

   A 16-bit Type Field indicates that this is a Secure ULE SNDU [3].  

   [XXX IANA ACTION REQUIRED to allocate xxS-ULExx XXX] 

   The S-ULE header is defined in the IANA maintained Next-Header 
   Registry for ULE and has the value xxS-ULExx 

   [XXX END of IANA ACTION XXX]  

4.2.4. Destination NPA Address Field  

   The SNDU Destination Address Field is optional. This field is 
   MUST be carried when field D is set to 0 and may be omitted when 
   D=1 [3].  

4.2.5. ULE-SID Field  

   A 32-bit security identifier, the ULE-SID similar to the SPI used 
   in IPsec has been added to uniquely identify the secure session. 
   This ULE-SID represents the security association between the 
   MPEG-2 transmitter and receiver for a particular session and 
   indicates the keys and algorithms used for encrypting the data 
   payload and calculating the MAC. The ULE-SID is used by a 
   receiver to filter PDUs in combination with the NPA address when 
   present.  

4.2.6. Sequence Number Field  

   An optional 32-bit sequence number MAY be included in the ULE 
   SNDU to prevent replay attacks. The gateway monotonically 
   increments this number when it sends a packet to the receiver and 
   the receiver verifies the correct sequence number and MUST 
   discard all SNDUs which do not match. If an adversary tries to 
   inject or replay old packets the sequence number would not match. 
   This would result in discarding the packet.  

   SNDU reordering is not permitted on ULE links, and therefore any 
   accidental reordering of segments will result in discard.

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     June 2007 
    

4.2.7. Message Authentication Code (MAC) Field  

   To provide both data origin authentication and data integrity, a 
   Message Authentication Code (MAC) is included in the extension 
   header.  

   The MAC is calculated over the security extension header and the 
   encrypted data payload. The receiver calculates the MAC for the 
   each received packet and compares it with the transmitted value. 
   The two would not match in only 2 cases, firstly either there was 
   an error during processing or transmission over the MPEG-2 
   Network, or secondly the packet has not been sent from an 
   authenticated entity.  

   In either case, the packet MUST be discarded.  Hence the same MAC 
   can be used for data origin authentication and to provide data 
   integrity for transmission/processing errors.  

4.2.8. Type Field  

   This second type field denotes the type of packet that is 
   encrypted and encapsulated in the Secure ULE SNDU. If another ULE 
   extension header follows, then this type field indicates the type 
   of this extension header. 

4.2.9. Encrypted SNDU Payload  

   To achieve data confidentiality, the traffic between the MPEG-2 
   TS transmitter (ULE Encapsulator) and Receiver needs to be 
   encrypted.  The network layer PDUs are first encrypted and then 
   encapsulated in the secure ULE SNDU. The security associations 
   between the two communicating points will describe the algorithms 
   and keys used for encryption purposes.  

   Secure ULE does not impose the use of any specific encryption 
   algorithm and should be able to support the commonly used 
   algorithms including DES [12], 3DES etc.  

4.3. Transmitter Processing  

   The following procedure is followed at the encapsulator for 
   processing the security extension header for ULE:  

   o Upon reception of the higher layer PDU, the SPD is first 
     queried to check the policy to be applied to the PDU. If 
     security is needed then an SA must exist in the SAD (this is 
     set by the key management system). The parameters are 
 
 
Cruickshank et. al.     Expires January 24, 2008           [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     June 2007 
    

     retrieved from the SAD and it is first encrypted using the key 
     and the algorithm as indicated in the SAD.  

   o The header of the base protocol (and other extension headers 
     if present) is added to the SNDU.  

   o The ULE-SID for the security association between the 
     transmitter and the receiver are added next.  

   o The SAD is consulted to determine if the sequence number has 
     to be added. If required, then the corresponding sequence 
     number is added to the SNDU.  

   o The SAD is also checked to determine if the data origin 
     authentication and data integrity has to be provided. If 
     required, then the MAC has to be calculated. The MAC is 
     calculated over the encrypted PDU (and other possible 
     extension headers), the Security header i.e. the ULE-SID and 
     the Sequence Number (if present) and the secret key. The MAC 
     is then added to the extension header in the SNDU.  

   o Then the encrypted higher layer PDU is encapsulated to form 
     the SNDU.  

   o Finally, the CRC is calculated as defined in Section 4.6 of 
     RFC4326 [3] and added.  

4.4.  Receiver Processing  

   The following procedure is followed at the Receiver for 
   processing the security extension header for ULE:  

   o Upon reception of a Secure ULE SNDU, the Receiver first 
     filters the received packets according to the receiver 
     destination NPA address (if present).  

   o The CRC is verified as defined in RFC4326 [3].  

   o The Receiver then uses the ULE-SID to obtain the security 
     associations between the transmitter and receiver and retrieve 
     the data from the SAD.  With this the receiver determines if 
     the sequence number and the MAC are present or not. This is 
     also used to determine the algorithms and keys used for both 
     encryption of the encapsulated PDU and for generation of the 
     message authentication code.  

   o It would then use the sequence number for filtering any out

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     June 2007 
    

     of-sequence packets.  

   o The next step would be to check the MAC to verify the 
     authenticity and integrity of the received PDU.  If the 
     calculated MAC does not match the transmitted MAC, then the 
     PDU is discarded.  

   o Finally the encapsulated payload will be decrypted.  

5. Key Exchange Procedure  

   This section describes the key exchange procedure, used to 
   install and manage the keys at Receivers.  There is a need to 
   take into account the two cases described in [10], both 
   unidirectional and bi-directional transfers.  The key management 
   procedures are independent from the ULE operations.  During the 
   key exchange procedure, the ULE-SID will be defined.  

   The exact data encryption and data integrity choices are linked 
   to the key management systems in use. One example is the security 
   suite 1 (defined in GSAKMP [7]). This uses AES (CBC mode, Key 
   Length: 128 bits) for data encryption and DSS-ASN1-DER for 
   digital signature and SHA-1 as the Hash algorithm.  Other suites 
   will be added in future versions.  

   A detailed key management system is not presented in this 
   document, but two approaches are outlined.  

5.1. IPsec Key Management for L2  

   Existing key management systems can be used such as the MSEC key 
   exchange protocols, GDOI and GSAKMP.  The format of the ULE-SID 
   will be identical to the security association as defined in GDOI 
   or GSAKMP. The initial key exchange between the security server 
   and the ULE receiver can be transported either within the ULE 
   network or may be performed by some other means.  This is a 
   matter of policy and an architecture decision. For example, for 
   bi-directional transfers the whole key exchange procedures could 
   be carried within the ULE network, while for unidirectional 
   transfers, some other bidirectional connection should be used.  

5.2. Alternative Key Management  

   The method described here for link security may be used with 
   alternative key management systems when used as a part of a 
   system that already implements a key management infrastructure 
   (e.g. the DVB-RCS security system [6]). The format of the ULE-

   Security-ID will be the same format as defined in DVB-RCS 
   security procedures.  

6. Secure ULE SNDU example  

   This section shows the ULE SNDU with the security extension 
   header when IP datagrams are secured using Secure ULE. In the 
   example below, there are no additional extension headers.

7. Security Considerations  

   Link-level (L2) encryption of IP traffic is commonly used in 
   broadcast/radio links to supplement End-to-End security (e.g. 
   provided by TLS, SSH, Open PGP, S/MIME, IPsec).  A common 
   objective is to provide the same level of privacy as terrestrial 
   links. This document defines a method to provide mandatory link 
   encryption at the ULE level. The method may also support optional 
   link level integrity / authentication of the SNDU payload plus 
   protection against replay attacks. This is provided in a flexible 
   way using a new ULE Mandatory Extension Header for security. This 
   decouples specification of the security functions from the 
   encapsulation functions. This method also supports encryption of 
   the NPA addresses. The encryption and integrity algorithms are 
   similar to the ones used in IPsec/MSEC protocols.  

8. IANA Considerations  

   The S-ULE header is defined in the IANA maintained Next-Header 
   Registry for ULE and has the value xxS-ULExx
