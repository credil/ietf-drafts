 Internet-Draft      PIM-SM DR Priority Auto-Adjustment      August 2009 
 Abstract 

    This document defines a mechanism for automatically adjusting the 
    Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Designed Router (DR) priority 
    according to the status of the tracked interface. This approach can 
    be used to realize DR auto-switchover in case the current DR loses 
    the routes to multicast senders or Rendezvous Points (RP).

 Internet-Draft      PIM-SM DR Priority Auto-Adjustment      August 2009 
     
 1. Problem Statement 

    In the Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) 
    specification [RFC4601], a Designated Routers (DR) plays a very 
    important role, e.g., the multicast receiver's DR sends PIM 
    join/prune messages upon receiving Internet Group Management 
    Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376] membership report/leave messages from 
    multicast receivers, or the multicast sender' DR sends PIM Register 
    packets to a Rendezvous Point (RP) on behalf of the multicast 
    senders.  

    To achieve DR redundancy, multiple PIM routers are usually deployed 
    in a shared-media LAN like Ethernet. As depicted in the following 
    figure, two PIM routers R1, R2 are connected to the same LAN where a 
    multicast receiver is located. Assume R1 is elected as the DR for 
    that LAN. Now R1's upstream link to the outside network is down, as 
    a result, R1 will lose the reachability to the multicast senders and 
    RPs. If R1 doesn't quit the DR role, the multicast service for the 
    receiver will be broken even though R2 is still available.              

                |   +-----+    +------------------+ 
                +---+ R1  +----+                  | 
                |   +-----+    |                  | 
   +--------+   |              |                  |  +-------+ 
   |Receiver+---+              | Outside Network  +--+Sender | 
   +--------+   |              |   (Run PIM-SM)   |  +-------+ 
                |   +-----+    |                  | 
                +---+ R2  +----+                  | 
                |   +-----+    +------------------+ 
                  

    In most cases, the recovery of the multicast forwarding tree can be 
    fully dependent on the unicast route convergence. However, in the 
    above scenario, there is usually no Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) 
    running between R1 and R2, and even IGP was ran, their interfaces 
    are usually set to silent mode due to some issues, e.g., the 
    possible route spoofing by malicious hosts, or the side-effect of 
    route flooding on hosts.  

    Somebody may argue that a failover static route can be configured on 
    these two routers instead of running IGP. That's to say, each PIM 
    router is configured with a default route with its next-hop pointed 
    to the opposite side, and this default route will not take effect 
    until the reachability to the outside network is lost. However, this 
    approach has a few side-effects. Assume these two routers are 
    connected to the same Internet Service Provider (ISP) network via 
    different links, once the default route learnt from the ISP is 
    withdrawn, the forwarding loop will occur between them when received

    a packet whose best route is the configured default route. Another 
    side-effect with this approach is: when the upstream link to the 
    outside network recovers (from down to up), the RPF interface will 
    change. As a result, the transient forwarding interruption due to 
    SPT/RPT rebuilding will occur. Although this transient interruption 
    issue due to unicast route change can be alleviated by using some 
    make-before-break mechanism (e.g., by borrowing some ideas from RPT-
    >SPT switch mechanism, the old upstream link will not be pruned 
    until the stream is received from the new upstream link.), the cost 
    is relatively high for this scenario. 

 2. DR Priority Auto-adjustment Mechanism 

    A PIM router could exactly cease the DR role by decreasing its DR 
    priority once it loses routes to the RPs or multicast sources. Since 
    the addresses of the RPs or the multicast sources may not be known 
    to it, the PIM router could simply determine whether or not it has 
    lost the route to the RPs or multicast sources just by tracking the 
    status of its upstream link. This approach is much similar to 
    interface tracking mechanism of the Virtual Router Redundancy 
    Protocol (VRRP) [RFC2338]. Taken the above scenario as an example, 
    R1 will track its upstream link to the outside network, once the 
    upstream link is down, its PIM DR priority will be reduced 
    automatically so as to cease the DR role. As a result, R2 will take 
    over the DR role. To speed up the DR switchover further, as soon as 
    the DR priority adjustment occurs, a new hello message containing 
    the current DR priority will be triggered. 

    In most cases, two last-hop routers each with an upstream link are 
    enough for redundancy purpose. In case there are more than one 
    upstream links on a PIM router, all of these interfaces should be 
    tracked. As long as there is a route to the outside network, it is 
    not necessary for the DR switchover to take place. 

    Once the failed upstream link on R1 recovers (from down to up), its 
    DR priority can be either recovered or not according to the pre-
    configured preemption policy. For example, if preemption is not 
    allowed, its DR priority will remain unchanged so as to avoid DR 
    switchover. As a result, the transient multicast forwarding 
    interruption due to multicast forwarding tree rebuilding will not 
    occur. 

    Note that this approach is fully compatible with the current PIM 
    specification. There is no need to change the PIM protocol on wire 
    at all since it's just an internal implementation optimization. 

    Although the PIM router could cease the DR role by declaring its 
    death directly, e.g., sending a hello message with a zero holdtime,

    or keeping silent till it times out, these approaches have a few 
    limitations in some specific scenarios. Still taken the above 
    scenario as an example, assume there is another multicast sender 
    directly connected to R1 via another interface. Since the receiver 
    and this sender are connected to the same PIM router, the receiver 
    ought to be able to receive the multicast stream from this sender. 
    However, in case there is another multicast source in the outside 
    network using the same address (i.e., in anycast source scenario), a 
    problem due to PIM assert failure will occur since join/prune or 
    assert messages from a non-neighbor will be discarded silently 
    according to the PIM specification. 

 3. Security Considerations 

    The DR priority auto-adjustment mechanism described in this document 
    does not introduce any new security risk. 

 4. IANA Considerations 

    There is no IANA consideration for this document.
