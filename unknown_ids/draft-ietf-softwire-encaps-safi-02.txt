Abstract

   In certain situations, transporting a packet from one BGP speaker to
   another, the BGP next hop, requires that the packet be encapsulated
   by the first BGP speaker and decapsulated by the second. To support
   these situations, there needs to be some agreement  between the two
   BGP speakers with regard to the "encapsulation information", i.e.,
   the format of the encapsulation header as well as the contents of
   various fields of the header.

   The encapsulation information need not be signaled for all

   encapsulation types. In the cases where the signaling is required
   (such as L2TPv3, GRE with key), This draft specifies a method by
   which BGP speakers can signal encapsulation information to each
   other. The signaling is done by sending BGP updates using the
   "Encapsulation SAFI" and IPv4 or IPv6 AFI. In the cases where no
   encapsulation information needs to be signaled (such as GRE without
   key), this draft specifies a BGP extended community that can be
   attached to UPDATE messages that carry payload prefixes to indicate
   the encapsulation protocol type to be used.

2. Introduction

   Consider the case of a router R1 forwarding an IP packet P. Let D be
   P's IP destination address. R1 must look up D in its forwarding
   table.  Suppose that the "best match" route for D is route Q, where Q
   is a BGP-distributed route whose "BGP next hop" is router R2. And
   suppose further that the routers along the path from R1 to R2 have
   entries for R2 in their forwarding tables, but do NOT have entries
   for D in their forwarding tables. For example, the path from R1 to R2
   may be part of a "BGP-free core", where there are no BGP-distributed
   routes at all in the core. Or, as in [Softwires-Mesh-Frame-work], D
   may be an IPv4 address while the intermediate routers along the path
   from R1 to R2 may support only IPv6.

   In cases such as this, in order for R1 to properly forward packet P,
   it must encapsulate P, and send P "through  a tunnel" to  R2. For
   example, R1 may encapsulate P using GRE, L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, etc.,
   where the destination IP address of the encapsulation header is the
   address of R2.

   In order for R1 to encapsulate P for transport to R2, R1 must know
   what encapsulation protocol to use for transporting what sorts of
   packets to R2. R1 must also know how to fill in the various fields of
   the encapsulation header. With certain encapsulation types, this
   knowledge may be acquired by default or through manual configuration.
   Other encapsulation protocols have fields such as session id, key, or
   cookie which must be filled in. It would not be desirable to require
   every BGP speaker to be manually configured with the encapsulation
   information for every one of its BGP next hops.

   In this draft, we specify a way in which BGP itself can be used by a
   given BGP speaker to tell other BGP speakers, "if you need to
   encapsulate packets to be sent to me, here's the information you need
   to properly form the encapsulation header". A BGP speaker signals
   this information to other BGP speakers by using a distinguished SAFI
   value, the Encapsulation SAFI. The encapsulation SAFI can be used
   with the AFI for IPv4 or with the AFI for IPv6. The IPv4 AFI is used
   when the encapsulated packets are to be sent using IPv4; the IPv6 AFI
   is used when the encapsulated packets are to be sent using IPv6.

   In a given BGP update, the NLRI of the encapsulation SAFI consists of
   the IP address (in the family specified by the AFI) of the originator
   of that update. The encapsulation information is specified in one or
   more BGP "tunnel encapsulation  attributes" (specified herein). These
   attributes specify the encapsulation protocols that may be used, as
   well as specifying whatever additional information (if any) is needed
   in order to properly use those protocols. Other attributes, e.g.,
   communities or extended communities, may also be included.



Mohapatra & Rosen                                               [Page 3]

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-softwire-encaps-safi-02.txt        June 2008


   Since the encapsulation information is coded as a set of attributes,
   one could ask  whether a new SAFI is really  required.  After all, a
   BGP speaker could simply  attach the tunnel encapsulation attributes
   to each prefix (like Q in our example) that it advertises.  But with
   that technique,  any change  in the encapsulation  information would
   cause a  very large number of  updates.  Unless one  really wants to
   specify different  encapsulation information for each  prefix, it is
   much  better  to  have  a   mechanism  in  which  a  change  in  the
   encapsulation information  causes a BGP speaker to  advertise only a
   single update. Conversely, when prefixes get modified, the tunnel
   encapsulation information need not be exchanged.

   In this specification, a single SAFI is used to carry information for
   all encapsulation protocols. One could have taken an alternative
   approach of defining a new SAFI for each encapsulation protocol.
   However, with the specified approach, encapsulation information can
   pass transparently and automatically through intermediate BGP
   speakers (e.g., route reflectors) that do not necessarily understand
   the encapsulation information. This works because the encapsulation
   attribute is defined as an optional transitive attribute. New
   encapsulations can thus be added without the need to reconfigure any
   intermediate BGP system. If adding a new encapsulation required using
   a new SAFI, the information for that encapsulation would not pass
   through intermediate BGP systems unless those systems were
   reconfigured to support the new SAFI.

   For encapsulation protocols where no encapsulation information needs
   to be signaled (such as GRE without key), the egress router MAY still
   want to specify the protocol to use for transporting packets from the
   ingress router. This draft specifies a new BGP extended community
   that can be attached to UPDATE messages that carry payload prefixes
   for this purpose.


3. Encapsulation NLRI Format

   The NLRI, defined below, is carried in BGP UPDATE messages [RFC4271]
   using BGP multiprotocol extensions [RFC4760] with an AFI of 1 or 2
   (IPv4 or IPv6) [IANA-AF] and a SAFI value to be assigned by IANA
   (called as Encapsulation SAFI).

   The NLRI is encoded in a format as defined in section 5 of [RFC4760]
   (a 2-tuple of the form <length, value>). The value field is
   structured as follows:







Mohapatra & Rosen                                               [Page 4]

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-softwire-encaps-safi-02.txt        June 2008


            +-----------------------------------------------+
            |       Endpoint address (Variable)             |
            +-----------------------------------------------+

     - Endpoint Address: This field identifies the BGP speaker
       originating the update. It is typically one of the interface
       addresses configured at the router. The length of the endpoint
       address is dependent on the AFI being advertised. If the AFI is
       set to IPv4 (1), the the endpoint address is a 4-octet IPv4
       address whereas if the AFI is set to IPv6 (2), the endpoint
       address is a 16-octet IPv6 address.

   An update message that carries the MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   with Encapsulation SAFI MUST also carry the BGP mandatory attributes:
   ORIGIN, AS_PATH, and LOCAL_PREF (for IBGP neighbors) as defined in
   [RFC4271]. In addition, such an update message can also contain any
   of the BGP optional attributes, like Community or Extended Community
   attribute to influence an action on the receiving speaker.

   When a BGP speaker advertises the Encapsulation NLRI via BGP, it uses
   its own address as the BGP nexthop in the MP_REACH_NLRI or
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute. The nexthop address is set based on the
   AFI in the attribute.  For example, if the AFI is set to IPv4 (1),
   the nexthop is encoded as a 4-byte IPv4 address. If the AFI is set to
   IPv6 (2), the nexthop is encoded as a 16-byte IPv6 address of the
   router. On the receiving router, the BGP nexthop of such an update
   message is validated by performing a recursive route lookup operation
   in the routing table.

   Bestpath selection of Encapsulation NLRIs is governed by the decision
   process outlined in section 9.1 of [RFC4271]. The encapsulation data
   carried through other attributes in the message are to be used by the
   receiving router only if the NLRI has a bestpath.


4. Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute

   Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is an optional transitive attribute
   that is composed of a set of TLVs. The type code of the attribute is
   to be assigned by IANA. Each TLV contains information corresponding
   to a particular tunnel technology. The TLV is structured as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Tunnel Type (2 octets): It identifies the type of the tunneling
   technology being signaled. This document defines the following types:

     - L2TPv3 over IP [RFC3931]: Tunnel Type = 1

     - GRE [RFC2784]: Tunnel Type = 2

   Unknown types are to be ignored and skipped upon receipt.

   Length (2 octets): the total number of octets of the Value field.

   Value (variable): The value is comprised of multiple sub-TLV's. Each
   sub-TLV consists of three fields: a one-octet type, one-octet length,
   and zero or more octets of value. The sub-TLV is structured as
   follows:


                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      Sub-TLV Type (1 Octet)       |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |     Sub-TLV Length (1 Octet)      |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |     Sub-TLV Value (Variable)      |
                   |                                   |
                   +-----------------------------------+

   Sub-TLV Type (1 octet): Each sub-TLV type defines a certain property
   about the tunnel TLV that contains this sub-TLV. The following are
   the types defined in this document:

     - Encapsulation: sub-TLV type = 1

     - Protocol type: sub-TLV type = 2

     - Color: sub-TLV type = 3

   When the TLV is being processed by a BGP speaker that will be
   performing encapsulation, any unknown sub-TLVs MUST be ignored and

   skipped. However if the TLV is understood, the entire TLV MUST NOT be
   ignored just because it contains an unknown sub-TLV.

   Sub-TLV Length (1 octet): the total number of octets of the sub-TLV
   value field.

   Sub-TLV Value (variable): Encodings of the value field depend on the
   sub-TLV type as enumerated above. The following sub-sections define
   the encoding in detail.


4.1. Encapsulation sub-TLV

   The syntax and semantics of the encapsulation sub-TLV is determined
   by the tunnel type of the TLV that contains this sub-TLV.

   When the tunnel type of the TLV is L2TPv3-over-IP, the following is
   the structure of the value field of the encapsulation sub-TLV:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      Session ID (4 octets)                    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      |                        Cookie (Variable)                      |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


     * Session ID: a non-zero 4-octet value locally assigned by the
       advertising router that serves as a lookup key in the incoming
       packet's context.

     * Cookie: an optional, variable length (encoded in octets - 0 to 8
       octets) value used by L2TPv3 to check the association of a
       received data message with the session identified by the Session
       ID. Generation and usage of the cookie value is as specified in
       [RFC3931].

       The length of the cookie is not encoded explicitly, but can be
       calculated as: (sub-TLV length - 4).

   When the tunnel type of the TLV is GRE, the following is the
   structure of the value field of the encapsulation sub-TLV:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


     * GRE Key: A 4 octet field [RFC2890] that is generated by the
       advertising router.  The actual method by which the key is
       obtained is beyond the scope of the document. The key is inserted
       into the GRE encapsulation header of the payload packets sent by
       ingress routers to the advertising router. It is intended to be
       used for identifying extra context information about the received
       payload.

       Note that the key is optional. Unless a key value is being
       advertised, the GRE encapsulation sub-TLV MUST NOT be present.


4.2. Protocol Type sub-TLV

   The protocol type sub-TLV MAY be encoded to indicate the type of the
   payload packets that will be encapsulated with the tunnel parameters
   being signaled in the TLV. The value field of the sub-TLV contains a
   2-octet protocol type that is one of the types defined in [IANA-AF]
   as ETHER TYPEs.

   For example, if we want to use three L2TPv3 sessions, one carrying
   IPv4 packets, one carrying IPv6 packets, and one carrying MPLS
   packets, the egress router will include three TLVs of L2TPv3
   encapsulation type, each specifying a different session id and a
   different payload type. The protocol type sub-TLV for these will be
   IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and
   MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847) respectively. This informs the ingress
   routers of the appropriate encapsulation information to use with each
   of the given protocol types. Insertion of the specified session id at
   the ingress routers allows the egress to process the incoming packets
   correctly, according to their protocol type.

   Inclusion of this sub-TLV depends on the tunnel type. It MUST be
   encoded for L2TPv3 tunnel type. On the other hand, the protocol type
   sub-TLV is not required for GRE tunnels.

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-softwire-encaps-safi-02.txt        June 2008


4.3. Color sub-TLV

   The color sub-TLV MAY be encoded as a way to color the corresponding
   tunnel TLV. The value field of the sub-TLV contains an extended
   community that is defined as follows:


4.3.1. Color Extended Community

   The color extended community is an opaque extended community
   [RFC4360] with the following encoding:

         0                   1                   2                   3
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |       0x03    |      TBD      |             Reserved          |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |                          Color Value                          |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The value of the high-order octet of the extended Type Field is 0x03,
   which indicates it is transitive. The value of the low-order octet of
   the extended type field for this community is TBD. The Color value is
   user defined and configured locally on the routers.  The same color
   extended community can then be attached to the UPDATE messages that
   contain payload prefixes. This way, the BGP speaker can express the
   fact that it expects the packets corresponding to these payload
   prefixes to be received with a particular tunnel encapsulation
   header.


4.4. Tunnel Type Selection

   A BGP speaker may include multiple tunnel TLVs in the tunnel
   attribute.  The receiving speaker MAY have local policies defined to
   choose different tunnel types for different sets/types of payload
   prefixes received from the same BGP speaker. For instance, if a BGP
   speaker includes both L2TPv3 and GRE tunnel types in the tunnel
   attribute and it also advertises IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes, the ingress
   router may have local policy defined to choose L2TPv3 for IPv4
   prefixes (provided the protocol type received in the tunnel attribute
   matches) and GRE for IPv6 prefixes.

   Additionally, the Encapsulation SAFI UPDATE message can contain a
   color sub-TLV for some or all of the tunnel TLVs. The BGP speaker
   SHOULD then attach a color extended community to payload prefixes to
   select the appropriate tunnel types.




Mohapatra & Rosen                                               [Page 9]

   In a multi-vendor deployment that has routers supporting different
   tunneling technologies, including color sub-TLV to the Encapsulation
   SAFI UPDATE message can serve as a classification mechanism (for
   example, set A of routers for GRE and set B of routers for L2TPv3).
   The ingress router can then choose the encapsulation data
   appropriately while sending packets to an egress router.

   If a BGP speaker originates an update for prefix P with color C and
   with itself as the next hop, then it MUST also originate an encaps-
   SAFI update which contains the color C.

   Suppose that a BGP speaker receives an update for prefix P with color
   C, that the BGP decision procedure has selected the route in that
   update as the best route to P, that the next hop is node N, but that
   an encapsulation SAFI update originating from node N containing color
   C has not been received. In this case, no route to P will be
   installed in the forwarding table unless and until the corresponding
   encapsulation SAFI update is received, or the BGP decision process
   selects a different route.

   Suppose that a BGP speaker receives an "uncolored" update for prefix
   P, with next hop N, and that the BGP speaker has also received an
   encapsulation SAFI originated by N, specifying one or more
   encapsulations that may or may not be colored. In this case, the
   choice of encapsulation is a matter of local policy. The only
   "default policy" necessary is to choose one of the encapsulations
   supported by the speaker.


4.5. BGP Encapsulation Extended Community

   We define a BGP opaque extended community that can be attached to BGP
   UPDATE messages to indicate the encapsulation protocol to be used for
   sending packets from an ingress router to an egress router.
   Considering our example from the "Introduction" section, R2 MAY
   include this extended community specifying a particular tunnel type
   to be used in the UPDATE message that carries route Q to R1. This is
   useful if there are no explicit encapsulation information to be
   signaled using the encap SAFI for a tunneling protocol (such as GRE
   without key).

   The value of the high-order octet of the extended type field is 0x03,
   which indicates it's transitive. The value of the low-order octet of
   the extended type field is TBD.

   The last two octets of the value field encode a tunnel type as
   defined in this document.


5. Capability advertisement

   A BGP speaker that wishes to exchange tunnel endpoint information
   must use the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability Code as defined in
   [RFC4760], to advertise the corresponding (AFI, SAFI) pair.


6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations applicable to Softwires can be found in the
   mesh framework [Softwires-Mesh-Frame-work]. In general, security
   issues of the tunnel protocols signalled through encapsulation SAFI
   are inherited.

   If a third party is able to modify any of the information that is
   used to form encapsulation headers, or to choose a tunnel type, or to
   choose a particular tunnel for a particular payload type, user data
   packets may end up getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.


7. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new NLRI format, called Encapsulation NLRI,
   to be carried in BGP using multiprotocol extensions. It is to be
   assigned its own SAFI.

   This document defines a new BGP optional transitive attribute type,
   called Tunnel Encapsulation attribute and two new opaque extended
   community sub-types. These values are to be assigned by IANA.

   This document introduces Tunnel TLVs and sub-TLVs. The type space for
   both of these should be set up by IANA as a registry of 2-octet

   tunnel types and 1-octet sub-TLV types. These should be assigned on a
   first-come- first-serve basis.
