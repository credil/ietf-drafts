   is beneficial for separation of the HyperText Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) from underlying transports, which has been increasingly
   recognised as useful when a variety of ways of transporting or

   use must be indicated.

Internet-Draft          Specifying URI transports             March 2009


1.  Background and Introduction

   Desire to separate the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616]
   from its traditional transport of the Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP) is increasing.

   There are environments where TCP is not suitable, or absent, yet HTTP
   can still be used as a method to transfer data.  Being able to
   indicate the desired transport and interface to use in the URI for a
   program to interpret when executing HTTP GETs or PUTs is useful when
   a choice of mechanisms and interfaces are available, and
   infrastructure such as DNS cannmot be queried for advice.

   This document outlines how the desired transport and interface can be
   indicated in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) format [RFC3986]
   by a simple extension to that format using existing syntax.

   This syntax is useful for carrying HTTP over different transport
   protocols.  HTTP can be thought of a session layer, running over a
   transport layer providing reliable delivery of the HTTP stream.  This
   transport layer has commonly (and almost universally) been TCP in the
   terrestrial Internet, although alternative transport layers, such as
   SCTP, can also be used under HTTP [I-D.natarajan-http-over-sctp].
   For long-delay networks, or for network conditions where TCP or an
   equivalent is not suitable, an alternative transport layer such as
   Saratoga [I-D.wood-tsvwg-saratoga] can be used under HTTP instead in
   hop-by-hop communications between nodes.  This has been described in
   detail [I-D.wood-dtnrg-http-dtn-delivery].

   HTTP requires only reliable streaming that can be used to provide
   ordered delivery to the application; how that reliable streaming is
   provided is up to the local transport layer in the local network.  In
   the examples given above, TCP or SCTP are used to carry HTTP over the
   congestion-sensitive public Internet, while Saratoga would be used
   for HTTP across dedicated private links.

   Steve Deering has often described IP as 'the waist in the hourglass'
   [Deering98] - what is above and touching on IP can be changed, what
   is below and touching on IP can be changed, but provided the new
   elements continue to interface to and work with IP, the hourglass
   remains complete and the network stack remains functional.  Here,
   HTTP is the waist in this particular hourglass; applications can use
   HTTP to communicate, provided HTTP runs over a reliable transport
   stream.  The applications can vary.  The transport stream can be
   changed; HTTP does not even have to run over a TCP/IP stack, but
   could even be made to run directly over something else entirely.
   Given the prevalence of IP in many networks, it is likely that two
   popular waists (layers that other layers interface to) exist: IP and

   HTTP.  The transport protocol and physical enviroment that IP and
   HTTP are used with will vary more, depending on local conditions and
   needs.

   Being able to specify how HTTP or other schemes are carried is useful
   when a variety of methods are available to choose from.  The syntax
   described here is useful for local configuration, e.g. in a scripting
   language that is aware of the local host and remote host's shared
   support of a given transport protocol.  It is less useful on the
   public world-wide web, because users (and web page designers) are not
   generally capable of determining which transport protocol(s) are
   supported by their web browser, operating system, or network.
   However, the option to explicitly choose a communication method is
   useful.


2.  Extending the URI scheme to indicate transports and interfaces

   Before describing this URI scheme syntax, it is worthwhile to lay out
   the foundations on which this syntax is based.

   HTTP is not explicitly tied to use over TCP.  To quote [RFC2616],
   section 1.4:

   "HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections.  The
   default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used.  This does not
   preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol on
   the Internet, or on other networks.  HTTP only presumes a reliable
   transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used;
   the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the
   transport data units of the protocol in question is outside the scope
   of this specification."

   The URI format syntax ([RFC3986], section 3.1) defines the scheme as:

   scheme = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )

   The period (.) is in use in a number of scheme names; the other
   punctuation characters appear unused.

   To quote [RFC2718], section 2.2.2:

   "When a scheme is associated with a network protocol, the
   specification should completely describe how URLs are translated into
   protocol actions in sufficient detail to make the access of the
   network resource unambiguous.  If an implementation of the URL scheme
   requires some configuration, the configuration elements must be
   clearly identified."

Internet-Draft          Specifying URI transports             March 2009


   With this foundation, this draft proposes that schemes can be
   extended to include configuration elements that indicate transport
   and interface.  These modify use of the http request, and are in the
   format:

   scheme = scheme [ "-+" port behaviour ] [ "++" transport ] ["+-"
   interface ] [ "--" dynamic configuration]

   where the optionally-included -+port is a description mapping to the
   default IANA-assigned port number, or the equivalent name, indicating
   the desired behaviour over a transport.  This information is
   specified locally as service names in e.g. /etc/services on unix
   machines.

   The optionally-included ++transport is the transport name or IANA
   protocol identifier number that that name maps to.  As we aim to
   separate HTTP from TCP and place it over other transports, nicknaming
   this proposal 'http++' obviously follows.

   The optionally-included +-interface can contain a locally-meaningful
   specifier identifying the local interface to use; useful on multi-
   homed devices.  The local interface identifier may identify a virtual
   or physical interface or one that is only capable of using IPv4,
   IPv6, or another network protocol (in the case of HTTP being run over
   something other than a TCP/IP stack.)  Defining virtual interfaces
   limited to one network protocol allows the choice of network protocol
   to be made.

   The optionally-included "--" gets configuration information and
   transport/services to use dynamically via some method, e.g.  DNS
   records, but can be partly overriden by other locally-provided
   configuration from the other three modifier types described above.
   This is described more in the 'relevant work' section below.

   Use of these modifiers would permit http++sctp:// or
   http-+saratoga++udp:// for the uses outlined in
   [I-D.natarajan-http-over-sctp] and
   [I-D.wood-dtnrg-http-dtn-delivery].  Port and internet protocol
   numbers assigned by IANA are accepted as equivalent to assigned names
   for these underlying protocols, so http-+7542++17:// specifies HTTP
   over Saratoga over UDP. http++132 is equivalent to http++sctp in
   specifying HTTP over SCTP.  As is usual, these are case insensitive,
   so that http++sctp, HTTP++sctp, and HtTp++ScTp are all equivalent.

   Adding these optional transport indicators to the scheme name does
   not change the namespace in any way; the URI should still be treated
   as if it began simply http: and is the http namespace.  Similarly,
   'https++' shares the https namespace, only indicating services,

Internet-Draft          Specifying URI transports             March 2009


   transports and interfaces for the https request to use.

   This document deliberately does not state what 'http:' by itself
   implies; local use may invoke dynamic configuration, or simultaneous
   attempts to use multiple available transports or interfaces. 'http:'
   is NOT restricted to mean 'http++tcp:'.

   If required, the port the scheme is actually run over, which the
   behaviour of any specified default port is mapped to, is still
   indicated later in the URI as :number, e.g. :80.  When this is not
   specified the default port for that tranport behaviour is used.  For
   example, Saratoga runs over UDP and is assigned default port 7452 by
   IANA.  Saying 'http-+7452:' means do the default behaviour for port
   7452, i.e. use the Saratoga protocol. http:-+7452:blah:1024 indicates
   that the default behaviour on port 7452 - that is, Saratoga - should
   be carried over to port 1024, i.e. use the Saratoga protocol on port
   1024 instead.

   Knowing that a '-+' service port behaviour stated in the scheme is
   only associated with either TCP or UDP would mean that ++tcp or ++udp
   can be omitted when that -+behaviour is given.  That is, -+saratoga
   is known to mean -+saratoga++udp.

   Being able to specify the local interface to initiate a transaction
   on when a choice of interfaces is available on a multihomed device is
   useful, e.g. http-+saratoga+-serial0://.


3.  Relevant work

   [I-D.natarajan-http-over-sctp] proposes carrying http over sctp.
   This can be indicated with http++sctp:.

   [I-D.wood-dtnrg-http-dtn-delivery] proposes separating HTTP from the
   underlying transport entirely, and running it over other transports,
   such as Saratoga [I-D.wood-tsvwg-saratoga].  This can be specified
   locally with http-+saratoga++udp: or simply http-+saratoga:.

   We can also use '--' to indicate that information on resolving the
   URI must be sought from the network.

   [I-D.jennings-http-srv] has proposed using DNS lookup of a SRV record
   to return a dynamic port value, as well as an address, and could
   indicates this using http--srv:// and http--srv:// in line with the
   use of a service name as indicated above.  [Ed note: need to double-
   check Cullen's current draft.]

   Alternatively, some new DNS record type returning address, port and

Internet-Draft          Specifying URI transports             March 2009


   other access information could be explicitly accessed via e.g.
   http--dns:// or some other indication of method.  This could take
   advantage of DNS Name Authority Pointers (NAPTR) via S-NAPTR and
   U-NAPTR [RFC3958] [RFC4848], and encourage the use of and testing
   with those protocols before wider deployment.  [I-D.faltstrom-uri]
   expands further on this approach.

   Other work on evolving the URI format to enable service discovery
   with DNS for different transport protocols is in e.g.  [Uruena05].

   It should be possible to combine the static configuration in the
   parseable scheme format described here with getting other
   configuration information that is not explicitly given, but that is
   needed to access the URI dyamically, from DNS records when
   appropriate.  Any static information explicitly provided should
   override information from dynamic configuration, just as explicitly
   indicating a port with e.g. :80 in the URI explicitly overrides the
   port returned by http--srv:.


4.  Security Considerations

   No additional security concerns have been thought of at this time.


5.  IANA Considerations

   No additional IANA considerations have been thought of at this time.
