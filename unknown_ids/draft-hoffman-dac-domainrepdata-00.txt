Abstract

   This document describes two formats for reputation data for domains.
   The smaller format contains data that is expected to be used in real-
   time receiver decisions, while the larger format is used for more
   complete data that is appropriate for off-line decision making.

1.  Introduction

   Providers of domain reputation want to be able to publish many types
   of reputation data.  Among these are:

   o  A score along some scale, plus an indication of the confidence in
      that score
   o  Data about the domain's owner such as their name, how long they
      have been in business, where they are located, the type of
      business they are in, they type of mail they send, and so on
   o  Recent mailing statistics for the domain
   o  Number and types of complaints about the domain
   o  Innumerable others

   There are many models for the ways domain reputation information
   could be distributed.  Some providers might give some data away
   freely while charging for other data; some providers would give away
   the data in exchange for valuable feedback from the recipient about
   the domains; some providers would sell the reputation data to the
   owner of the domain and certain mail receivers; and so on.

   There are also many models for the ways the domain reputation data
   would be used by mail senders and receivers.  SMTP servers could use
   a score of the likelihood that they would want to receive mail from a
   particular domain, and they might be interested in the type of
   business of the sender for mixing into their decision on how to
   deliver the mail (banks might be more likely to be delivered to the
   inbox, auto dealers to the spam folder).  ISPs might buy reputation
   data in bulk to help create their own in-house scoring systems.

   This document describes two formats for reputation data for domains.
   The smaller format contains data that is expected to be used in real-
   time receiver decisions, while the larger format is used for more
   complete data that is appropriate for off-line decision making.  DAC
   will later define protocols for retrieving the reputation data; these
   are likely to be based on DNS queries and responses.

   [[ The intended status of this document is an Informational RFC that
   will be submitted as an independent submission to the RFC Editor. ]]


2.  Smaller Format for Responses

   The smaller response format is plain text with single spaces as
   separators.  An explicit goal is that the response can be parsed
   without XML parsers (which are rare on SMTP servers).

   The format for a small response is:

Internet-Draft              Domain Reputation              November 2007


       <version><sp><score><sp><confidence><sp><SIC>

   All fields, and the single space between each, are required.

   o  version -- a text string; for the first version of the protocol,
      it is "1".
   o  score -- the likelihood that a recipient who trusts the reputation
      provider would want to receive mail from the domain.  The value
      specifies a number between 0 and 99 inclusive that is the relative
      score of the the domain.
   o  confidence -- the confidence of the reputation provider in the
      score.  It is a number between 0 and 99 inclusive with 50 meaning
      "average confidence".
   o  SIC -- the numeric NAICS code of the business associated with the
      domain.  The value is the numeric code.  The most recent list of
      NAICS codes can be found at [NAICS-CODES].

   An example of such a record might be:

       1 72 99 52213


3.  Larger Format for Responses

   The larger response format is XML.  The XML overhead for this format
   is approximately 100 bytes, which leaves plenty of room within even a
   512-byte UDP DNS response for simple information.  In the inevitable
   cases where the answer is too big for one UDP packet, there is a
   simple fall-back to TCP, although the number of larger-format queries
   that have that much data is probably limited.

   A set of common elements is defined in the namespace
   "http://domain-assurance.org/rep-3".  A reputation provider can use
   their own XML namespace or other common XML namespaces for elements
   not defined in the DAC namespace.  DAC-defined elements have very
   short names in order to maximize the number that can fit in a single
   UDP packet.

   Every element is optional.  Also, every element also has an optional
   c attribute whose value is a number between 0 and 99 inclusive that
   is the confidence of the reputation provider in the information in
   the element.  If the c attribute is not given, the default value is
   50, meaning "average confidence".  It is expected that the c
   attribute will not be used often.

   The general defined elements are listed here.

   o  sc -- Score, the likelihood that a recipient who trusts the
      reputation provider would want to receive mail from the domain.
      The value specifies a number between 0 and 99 inclusive that is
      the relative score of the the domain.
   o  in -- Industry, the numeric NAICS code of the business associated
      with the domain.  The value is the numeric code.  The most recent
      list of NAICS codes can be found at [NAICS-CODES].
   o  na -- Name, the true name of the business associated with the
      domain.
   o  st1, st2, ci, pr, co, pc -- Postal address elements of the
      business associated with the domain: street address 1, street
      address 2, city, state or province, country, postal code.  The
      country should be given as the two-letter ISO 3166 code.
   o  te -- Telephone, the telephone number of the business associated
      with the domain.  The value holds the text string that is the
      telephone number; spaces, periods, and hyphens are explicitly
      allowed.  The value should include the country code prefaced with
      a "+".


4.  Examples of Reputation Records

   An example using just the defined elements might be:

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
   <rep xmlns='http://domain-assurance.org/rep-3'>
   <sc>72</sc>
   <in c='75'>52213</in>
   <na>Example Company LLC</na>
   <st1>127 Typical Street, Suite 500</st1>
   <ci>Anytown</ci><pr>CA</pr><co>US</co><pc>95782-4410</pc>
   <te>+1 672.487.0091</te>
   </rep>

   An example including provider-defined elements might be:

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
   <rep xmlns='http://domain-assurance.org/rep-3'
       xmlns:brp='http://BigReputationProvider.com/syntax'>
   <sc>72</sc>
   <brp:fln type='md5'>a1892c25e959bd7a87161724dfec8c6d</brp:fln>
   <brp:mris value='green'/>
   </rep>

5.  RELAX NG schema

   grammar {
   c-att = attribute c { xsd:integer }
   start = element rep {
       default namespace ='http://domain-assurance.org/rep-3'
       element sc { c-att?, xsd:integer }?,
       element in { c-att?, xsd:integer }?,
       element na { c-att?, text }?,
       element st1 { c-att?, text }?,
       element st2 { c-att?, text }?,
       element ci { c-att?, text }?,
       element pr { c-att?, text }?,
       element co { c-att?, text }?,
       element pc { c-att?, text }?,
       element te { c-att?, text }?,
   }}


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for publishing reputation
   information about domain names.
