1.  Introduction

   With the deprecation of RH0 [RFC5095]the ability of a node to
   influence traffic to traverse the same firewall in opposing
   directions was eliminated.  Operation of stateful firewalls requires
   path symmetry at least through that device.  The likelihood of
   asymmetry is particularly true on the Internet side, but is also a
   problem when the exit path changes on the private side during an
   established packet exchange.  This document targets the specific use
   case of symmetric firewall selection, and then defines an IPv6
   Firewall Routing Header and associated IPv6 ICMP error messages.
   Other use cases may take advantage of these mechanisms, but are
   explicitly out of scope for the development and definition here.
   Also, this option is not trying to solve every possible topology of
   firewall deployments, or source of asymmetry, but is should be useful
   for the most common existing deployments.

   While this Firewall Routing Header mechanism allows for changes in
   the firewalls in use during a packet exchange, any mechanisms that
   would be used to pass state between disperse firewalls is out of
   scope here.  If those state passing mechanisms exist, it will be
   possible for an end-to-end packet exchange to persist during a
   routing shift, even over vast geographic path changes.  Since the
   ability to force routing through a single intermediary can be used by
   attackers to receive traffic they otherwise would not, the ICMP error
   messages used here should be integrity protected, and in any event
   should be dropped if originating outside of a policy domain.  The
   method that a node would use to verify that signature is out of scope
   here.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Mechanisms

3.1.  Overview

   To deal with the asymmetry issue, a function specific IPv6 routing
   header is defined, the Firewall Routing Header (FWRH).  This routing
   header is used to pass information to a correspondent, so that return
   packets are routed through a firewall that is maintaining state for
   this transaction.  In the case where an organization deploys multiple
   firewalls from different vendors in series to reduce vendor specific

   issues, this option would be related to the most public facing
   firewall of the set.  A flag (Origin Flag) will be used to indicate
   which instance this is in the case where there are firewalls on each
   end (note:  this assumes that a firewall would allow an initial
   inbound packet, then enforce subsequent packets through itself).
   There can be at most 2 (one with each value of the Origin Flag)
   FWRH's in any given extension header chain.

   An originating node is probably unaware of the presence of a firewall
   on its path to any given destination, so it will likely send an
   initial packet without the FWRH option.  (It may have cached the
   value received in a prior ICMP error message for non-local prefixes,
   and if so can optimistically minimize the chance for an initial error
   by including the cached value in the optional FWRH.)  On receipt of
   any ICMP Routing Header Required message, the origin node will
   extract the return-via address from the ICMP, optionally verify any
   signature that may be present, then cache it for use over the
   lifetime of the current packet exchange, and optionally for use with
   other non-local prefixes.  The packet which generated the error is
   reconstructed with the appropriate FWRH option, and resent.  If the
   FWRH option with the appropriate Origin Flag value is missing when a
   packet is being sent outbound (from the perspective of the firewall -
   private toward public), or if the return-via address in the FWRH
   option does not match any address on the firewall that is processing
   the packet, an ICMP error (RHR type ???) is returned to the source
   address of the packet, indicating the value that is expected to
   result in return-path symmetry through an interface on this specific
   firewall.  That ICMP error SHOULD be signed, and if so the ICMP
   packet indicates which signing method was used.  Outbound packets
   with the matching Origin Flag and return-via address will receive
   normal firewall handling before forwarding.  If the source address
   prefix does not match any prefix that being exchanged in routing
   protocols with the next hop, an RPF-error (type ???+1) ICMP message
   should be returned.

   The correspondent node will extract the return-via address from a
   received FWRH option with an Origin Flag that is opposite the one it
   will use when sending, and cache it for use related to this specific
   packet exchange.  When constructing packets related to this specific
   exchange; after all normal processing is complete, the ultimate
   destination address will be swapped into the FWRH with the
   appropriate Origin Flag, and the previously cached value from any
   received FWRH with the opposing Origin Flag will be swapped as the
   initial destination address of the packet.

   Inbound packets to the public side of a firewall will be addressed
   with it as the destination address of the base IPv6 header, and the
   FWRH with the Origin flag matching existing state will contain the

   address of the ultimate destination.  The contents of the FWRH with
   the matching Origin flag will be swapped with the destination
   addresses in the packet, before normal firewall processing and
   forwarding.

3.2.  Firewall Routing Header Option

   The Firewall Routing header is used by an IPv6 source to list a
   single intermediate node to be "visited" by returning packets.  The
   Firewall Routing header is identified by a Next Header value of 43 in
   the immediately preceding header, and has the following format:

           that a firewall exists in the initial packet direction
           (for TCP this is the SYN), while a value of 0 indicates

           firewall contains the ultimate destination address
           that the firewall will deliver the packet to.

   same address if there was an audit function, or traffic engineering
   reason to route both directions through the same mid-point.

   Informing the originating endpoint that it needs to insert a routing
   header is accomplished with a specific ICMP error - 'Routing Header
   Required' (type ???).  This ICMP error may optionally be signed to
   mitigate a man-in-the-middle attack vector which could be used to
   route all return-path traffic through an attacker's node.

   Example 1 - Single firewall connecting a private network to the
   Internet.
          A           FW1             B
          |__Private__|  |__Internet__|

   Initial packet exchange sequence -
   A   ->>         DST = B
   FW1 ICMP(5) <<- DST = A : SRC = FW1(P) : value - FW1(I)
   A   ->>         DST = B : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
   B   <<-         DST = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=1) = A
   FW1 <<-         DST = A : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
   A   ->>         DST = B : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
   B   <<-         DST = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=1) = A
   FW1 <<-         DST = A : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
                           ...

   In this case as node A attempts to connect to node B, FW1 rejects the
   first attempt with an error message informing that the FWRH is
   required.  The subsequent packet including the FWRH with Origin Flag
   set is forwarded by FW1 toward B. B sends the return packet to FW1,
   where the DST is swapped with the locator for A in the FWRH with the
   Origin Flag set.
          A           FW1             B
          |__Private__|  |__Internet__|
                      |               |
                      FW2 _ Internet _|

   Initial packet exchange sequence -
   A   ->>         DST = B
   FW1 ICMP(5) <<- DST = A : SRC = FW1(P) : value - FW1(I)
   A   ->>         DST = B : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
   B   <<-         DST = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=1) = A
   FW1 <<-         DST = A : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
           --- FW1 dies
   A   ->>         DST = B : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
   FW2 ICMP(5) <<- DST = A : SRC = FW2(P) : value - FW2(I)
   FW2 ICMP(6) <<- DST = A : SRC = FW2(P) : value - /48 FW2(I)
   A   ->>         DST = B : FWRH(OF=1) = FW2(I)
   B   <<-         DST = FW2(I) : FWRH(OF=1) = A
   FW2 <<-         DST = A : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
                           ...

                                 Figure 2

   This case is the same as above, except there is an alternate firewall
   available to A. At some point after the connection is established,
   FW1 dies, and routing redirects packets to B through FW2.  FW2 has
   acquired state from FW1, so the connection between A & B does not
   have to be reset, but FW2 still rejects the next packet with an error
   message informing that the FWRH does not have the public address of
   FW2.  The subsequent packet including the FWRH with Origin Flag set
   is forwarded by FW2 toward B. B sends the return packet to FW2, where
   the DST is swapped with the locator for A in the FWRH with the Origin
   Flag set.

          |__Private__|  |__Internet__| |__Private__|

   Initial packet exchange sequence -

   FW1 ICMP(5) <<- DST = A : SRC = FW1(P) : value - FW1(I)
   A   ->>         DST = B : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I)
   FW2 ->>         (presumes that FW2 allows initial pkt without state)
   B   <<-         DST = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=1) = A
   FW2 ICMP(5) ->> DST = B : SRC = FW2(P) : value - FW2(I)
   B   <<-         DST = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=1) = A : FWRH(OF=0) = FW2(I)
   FW1 <<-         DST = A : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=0) = FW2(I)
   A   ->>         DST= FW2(I) : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=0) = B
   FW2 ->>         DST = B : FWRH(OF=1) = FW1(I) : FWRH(OF=0) = FW2(I)
                           ...

                                 Figure 3

   In this case there are firewalls at each end, and both require a
   FWRH.  The value of the Origin Flag identifies which FWRH option is
   associated with each firewall.  Note that before forwarding to the
   private side of each firewall, the DST & FWRH(OF=1) was swapped at
   FW1, while DST & FWRH(OF=0) was swapped at FW2.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a Routing Header type & two ICMP message
   types


6.  Security Considerations

   A routing header is used to cause packets to traverse a specific
   node, and if used maliciously would allow an attacker to see all
   packets in an exchange.  The risk of this attack is minimized by
   filtering out any ICMP Routing Header Required and ICMP RPF-error
   messages that originate outside the policy domain, and/or signing &
   verifying those ICMP error messages when generated internally.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The need to resolve routing symmetry for firewalls was initially
   championed by William Dixon, and discussed with many attendees at
   IETF 74.

8.  Pending comments

   It has been suggested the Origin Flag model will fail in
   simultaneous-open situations.  Recommendation to change the OF to
   indicate src < dst.  If that was done as a rule, there wouldn't need
   to be a flag.
