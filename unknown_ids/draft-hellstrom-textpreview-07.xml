      <section title="Introduction">
          <t>This is a specification of methods for presentation of a real-time
	    text conversation. The aim is to give the participants in a conversation
	    a good opportunity to perceive the real-time flow of the conversation
	    and also provide a display of the history of the conversation that makes
	    it easy to follow the flow. One reason to specify the presentation
	    method is to be able to give participants a synchronized view of the
	    conversation even if they use different presentation characteristics.
	    The methods are intended for use in a protocol environment where text
	    can be transmitted in real-time or in fragments of messages. Both
	    two-party situations and multi-party session presentations are
	    specified. The specification is mainly held on the presentation level,
	    relatively independent of the transport layer. It has though some
	    requirements on the lower layers, as well as some characteristics of the
	    lower layers cause slightly different user experience of the
	    presentation.</t>
      </section>
    
      <section title="Terminology">
	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	  document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope">
      <t>This specification describes methods for presenting a text
      conversation so that the gradual entry of text is made visible to the
      users. One method has text flowing in real-time in a way that is similar
      to common text chat, but with the possibility to follow entries while
      they are created in a real-time preview area. The method may be applied
      on any text conversation transport method that transmits text character
      by character, time-sampled, word by word, or any other method based on
      small chunks. The methods cover both two-party and multi-party
      situations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Real-time text presentation methods">
      <t>The presentation method described here are intended to give a
      convenient view of a text conversation between two or more participants
      in a session. It is intended to fulfill the requirements of
      ITU-T T.140 [1], and be
      feasible to implement in terminals with small displays. The basic
      concept however could be implemented in other text technologies as well
      and displayed in different ways. ITU-T T.140 [1], Appendix I, describes
      a traditional chat view and a two-column view. The display formats shall
      be implemented so that terminals in a session can implement different
      display views meeting the requirements of T.140 [1] and giving the users
      a synchronized view of the flow of the conversation.</t>

       is placed in its vertical position to show its time relation.</t>
      
     <section title="Common Aspects">
       
       <section title="Paragraph dividing">
	 <t>Text entries are divided into paragraphs by hard or soft return. Hard 
	   return finalizes a text entry. Once a text entry has been terminated by
	   hard return it can no longer be erased or modified. The control sequences
	   used for producing hard return are CRLF or paragraph separator U+2029.</t>
	 <t>
	   When soft return is used for creating a new paragraph, previous paragraph
	   can still be erased or modified. Soft return is produced by line separator U+2028.</t>
       </section>
       
       <section title="Completion of local entry">
           <t>The end-of-entry
             event may be triggered by a send button, a RETURN, or when another
             condition selectable by the local user to "post what I have so far" is
             met ( such as a pause in typing, a delimiting character such as a
             period, or a turn-taking token).</t>

           <t>When an end-of-entry event occurs, if the entry does not end with
             end of paragraph as defined by the device, the sending system SHALL append one.
           </t>
	   
	 </section>

       <section title="Moving between different states">
        <t>Entries can be either "real-time (preview)" or "historical" and
        they can be either "displayed" or "hidden". When real-time text is
        received it SHALL BE classified as a real-time entry until an
        end-of-entry indicator is received. Real-time entries SHOULD be
        displayed in the real-time preview field. Once an end-of-entry
        indicator is received, the entry SHALL become historical and SHOULD be
        move into the history display field. Its position within the history
        SHALL be determined by the time that its end-of-entry indicator was
        received.</t>

        <t>The local user may select to hide either the entries while they are
        real-time (previews) or when they are historical. Hiding entries when
        they are in real-time state may be done to avoid distraction for the
        local participant. The feature to hide the entries while in real-time
        state SHOULD provide some alert when an end-of-entry indicator is
        received as well as when real-time text stops coming in for a period
        of time. (The alert due to pause in incoming text is important because
        some real-time text users are not accustomed to sending end-of-entry
        indications(e.g. RETURNs) or may use a text based end-of-entry
        indication (such as GA).</t>

        <t>An entry (or category of entries) can be placed in a hidden state
        by user command to hide it (them). (e.g. Hide all but "Mary" to make
        it easier to see her thread)</t>

        <t>The default SHALL be that both real-time and history are not
          hidden.</t>
       </section>

       <section anchor="Eras" title="Erasure">
         <t>Erasure SHALL only be done from the last displayed character per
           participant.</t>
	 
         <t>Transmitted characters that take no position on the display (e.g.
           Bell or Alert in Session) SHALL not take any specific erasing action,
           but be regarded to be erased simultaneously with the succeeding
           character.</t>
	 
         <t>Characters that are composed by multiple keystrokes SHALL be erased
           by one erasing action.</t>

         <t>New lines inserted by automatic line break and word wrap actions
           purely for display formatting purposes by the local system SHALL not
           require any specific erasing action.</t>
	 
        <t>New lines inserted by the user shall be erased in one erasing
          action even if they are represented by multiple characters.</t>
	
        <t>The erasing action MUST be performed strictly according to the
          rules above, in order to maintain a synchronized view of the
          conversation for the participants, even if conversation participants
          use different display formats, such as the side-by-side-panel mode
          described in section 6 and ITU-T T.140 <xref target="T140.refs">1</xref> and the real-time preview mode described
          here.</t>
	
        <t>The scope of erasure shall only be possible back to the latest new paragraph (hard return) sent from the erasing party. 
          This may be valid for message borders in certain message based
          transmission systems. When using T.140, this condition should be
          signalled with an "unsupported request" protocol element from the
          entity that cannot perform the requested erasure.</t> 
      </section>
       
       <section title="Presentation of detected errors">
         <t>If a transmission error is detected and it is likely that it has
           resulted in loss of text, a character SHALL be inserted in the text
           for display at that point. The character should be the "Replacement
           character", a question mark within a rhombus. For cases when this
           character cannot be represented on the display, the replacement
           character SHOULD be presented as an apostrophe (" ' ") .</t>
	 
         <t>The same applies for incoming text that cannot be presented on the
           local terminal because of limitations in available fonts.</t>
       </section>
       
       <section title="Display formatting">
         <t>The display SHALL be word-wrapped within the limits of the
           window.</t>
	
         <t>The following operations SHOULD be possible to do: 
	   <list style="symbols">

             <t>Select font size</t>
	     
             <t>Select text colour and background colour for each
               participant.</t>
	     
             <t>Set window size</t>
             
         </list></t>
	 
         
       </section>
       
       <section title="En bloc transmission">
         <t>It SHOULD be possible for the participants to hold their text and
           not have it sent to the other participants until after the
           end-of-message event occurs. This enables users who do not want their
           message to be viewed by other participants until they have verified
           it. This also facilitates editing since random editing can be done on
           the text block before it is sent. This also allows a block of text to
           be pasted into the text entry area and then edited before it is sent.
           This could be new text or a previous text entry that the user would
           like to resend with edits. The en bloc method SHALL NOT be the only
           method for sending. A 'real-time / block send' switch SHOULD be
           located near the local user's text entry field Real-time SHALL be the
           default method for sending but a user preference setting MAY change
        the default to en bloc.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Multi-party sessions">
         <t>A multi-party session can be presented in a similar manner as the
	   two-party session. The chat-view with real-time entry at the bottom of
	   the window is one possible view.</t>

	 <t>When implemented in an environment that supports multi-party calls,
	   it may be felt less important to maintain a real-time preview view of
	   text from all participants. It may be very important for some
	   participants to have rapid real-time preview presentation of selected
	   participants, e.g. for live captioning of the call by a third party.</t>
	 
	 <t>Thus it may be desirable to be able to turn on or off the preview
	   presentation per user. When turning off real-time preview from one
	   participant, its presentation SHALL disappear from the preview window,
	   and text SHALL be entered en-bloc to the history display as they are
	   finished for that participant.</t>
	 
       </section>
       
       
     </section> <!--- end section common aspects --->

     <section title="Real-time Text Preview">
       
         <section title="Entries in creation">
             <t>Entries in creation SHALL be displayed in a real-time preview area,
               one for each participant who has entries in creation. The real-time
               preview areas MAY be placed under the list of completed entries as
               shown in <xref target="example-realtime-preview"></xref> and 
	       <xref target="example-three-party-realtime-textpreview"></xref>, 
	       or at any other suitable place in the user
               interface. If video from the participants is also displayed, then it
               MAY be suitable to display the real-time preview areas under the video
               image of the participant. The real-time text MAY also be displayed in
               a manner more closely associated with earlier exchanged text entries
               by the same participant (e.g. text from each participant goes in its
               own column).</t>
	     
             <t>If real-time previews from other participants are placed under the
               list of completed entries as in 
	       <xref target="example-realtime-preview"></xref> and 
	       <xref target="example-three-party-realtime-textpreview"></xref>, the 
	       text being entered
               by the local participant SHOULD be placed at the bottom in its own
               text entry field. This is recommended for a number of reasons. First,
               this is the only "editable" text on the screen. It also facilitates an
               optional input behavior where the local user may sometimes be holding
               their text back until it is completed while normally transmission
               occurs in real-time. Having the user input area be in a separate field
               MAY also be useful when scrolling the output field so that the input
               field always stays in view even as the history and text previews are
               scrolled out of view to read older text.</t>
	     
             <t>For ease of reading different entries, it is RECOMMENDED that all
               entries be placed close together in the display area.</t>
	     
             <t>For text input technologies requiring a number of keystrokes before
               the character or characters are finally decided, no characters shall
               be submitted to communication until they are decided from this input
               preparation process. This is for example valid for input of some Asian
               languages, and for some text entry methods from number keypads, and 
	       word prediction systems.</t>
	     
             <t>During entry, the following actions MAY be requested: 
	       <list style="symbols">

		 <t>Alert. Requests alerting of the remote participant.</t>
		 
		 <t anchor="Erase">Erase last character. Erases the last (
		   non-erased) character in the entry. (See 
		   <xref target="Eras"></xref>)</t>

             </list></t>
	 </section>
	 
	 <section title="Completion of local entry">
           <t>Text from the local participant SHALL be entered in the local user
             input field, until an end-of-entry event occurs. 
             The completed entry SHALL be moved to the history display area. If the
             protocol used defines an end-of-message indicator, it SHALL also be
             issued.</t>
	 </section>
	 
	 <section title="Completion of preview entry">
           <t>Text from the remote participants SHALL be entered in the preview
             area until an end-of entry event occurs. The end-of-entry is
             identified by any variant of a NEW LINE coded in the character set
             used, or an end of message indicator if there is a specific coding of
             that event. When an end-of-entry event occurs, the completed entry
             SHALL be moved to the history display area.</t>
	 </section>
	 
	 <section title="Order of entries">
           <t>The order of displayed entries in the display area SHALL be the
             timing order when the entries were "posted" to the display from the
             preview area. That is, when the new line or end-of-message indicator
             is received.</t>
	 </section>

	 <section title="Display formatting">
	   <t>The labels on the entries SHOULD display the user name of the
             participant. If this information is not available, labels indicating
             "Received" and "Transmitted" or other suitable names for the
             participants SHOULD be used.</t>

	   <t>The real-time preview display area MAY follow the same display
             formatting regarding font size, colours etc as the display area or MAY
             be different.</t>
	   
           <t>Each real-time preview area MAY have a fixed or adjustable size. It
             MAY also have no specific scrolling features or its own scrolling
             mechanism.</t>
	   </section>
	 
	 <section title="Scrolling and buffering">
        <t>When there are entries in the history area that have been pushed
        (scrolled) out of the view by new text coming in, it SHOULD be
        possible to scroll back to them within a practical limit. When the
        display area is scrolled, it SHALL stay in that scrolled position
        until scrolling is changed again or (at the user's option) when a new
        entry is received. When scrolled to the bottom, the display area SHALL
        auto-scroll as needed to show new entries. When the display
        arrangement is made with the preview field placed just under the
        history field as in <xref target="example-realtime-preview"></xref> and 
	  <xref target="example-three-party-realtime-textpreview"></xref>, 
	the preview field and the history field SHOULD scroll together as one display area.</t>

        <t>The input field of the local participant SHOULD always be visible
        regardless of the scroll position of the history field.</t>

	<section title="Auto-real-time for Emergency calls and Textphone calls">
          <t>When it is detected that the session is used for emergency
            purposes, the text transmission SHALL be switched to real-time
            regardless of its previous setting.</t>

              the user.</t>
	    
            <t>A specific send button MAY also be used.</t>
	    
            <t>Users with dominating experience from real-time text communication
              in PSTN may have a habit of not ending entries with a new line. There
              will be a risk that entries are left in real-time mode unintentionally
              not displayed and not read if the receiving end has hidden real-time
              display. Some actions are needed in order to avoid this risk.</t>
	    
            <t>If an entry is left in real-time mode without any input activity
              for a long period (e.g. 10 seconds), the local participant should be
              given an indication that there is an unfinished entry in the input
              field, and given a hint to complete it. Optionally, e.g. when using a
              voice-to-text application for generating text, the application SHOULD
              create the end-of-entry.</t>
	    
            <t>A period (".") followed by a short inactivity MAY also be

            <t>For PSTN text gateways having user input from PSTN text telephones,
	      the following sequences SHOULD be included among those causing an
	      entry to be finished. These terminations would usually be done by the
	      PSTN gateway in its transmission towards the IP side:</t>
	    
            <t>
	      <list style="symbols">
		<t>Letters "GA" or "GASK" or "SKSK" followed by short inactivity

            </t>
	    
            <t>White spaces (space bar, New line, CR, and LF) after those
	      characters SHALL be accepted and included in the finished entry. (Some
	      users do type a space character after the turn-taking indicator and
	      some textphones will send return after the turn-taking symbol).</t>

    <section title="Transport and presentation considerations ">
         <section title="Time sampling and smooth display">
	     <t>It is RECOMMENDED that characters be buffered and transmitted in 300
	       ms intervals on the transport level. It is permissible to buffer
	       characters for transmission in up to 500 ms intervals. Display of
	       received chunks of text SHOULD be done one character at a time spread
	       over the transmission interval so that adding a chunk of text to the
	       real-time preview window approximately covers the transmission interval
	       to give a smoother flow. <vspace blankLines="0" /></t>
	     
	     <t>The presentation method MAY be used with transport methods for
	       real-time text and for all text message methods where it is possible to
	       use timer based transmission to transmit fragments of message
	       entries.<vspace blankLines="0" /></t>
	 </section>
	 <section title="RTP based transport">
	     <t>The method MAY be applied on various text transmission technologies.
	       It is designed in order to be usable for real-time text conversation
	       with coding and presentation according to ITU-T T.140 including its
	       amendment <xref target="T140.refs">1</xref>, and 
	       <xref target="RFC3550">IETF RTP</xref> transport with packetization as defined
	       in <xref target="RFC4103">RFC 4103</xref>. The methods for applying this
	       in a multi-party situation is described in IETF Text media handling in
	       RTP based real-time and message conferences 
	       <xref target="I-D.hellstrom-text-conference">draft-hellstrom-text-conference</xref>.</t>
	 </section>
	 <section title="MSRP and message chunk based transport">
	     <t>Another environment where the real-time text with preview
	       presentation is feasible, is with the messaging protocol 
	       <xref target="RFC4975">IETF MSRP</xref>, where the message fragment concept
	       MAY be used for a real-time transmission and presentation according to
	       the description in this specification. This requires MSRP to be used in a real-time fashion.</t>
	 </section>
	 <section title="Identification of entries">
             <t>The transport method SHALL allow identification of the source of
               text, so that text from different sources can be arranged for
               convenient and readable presentation at the receiving end. [e.g. to
               attach labels to the incoming text).</t>

      &lsquo;en bloc&rsquo; mode.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Alerting">
      <t>In order to be useful for hearing impaired, deaf and deaf-blind users
      as well as all situations with all users, it is important to provide
      audible, visual and, where possible, tactile alerting from events in the
      text conversation application. <vspace blankLines="0" /> It should be
      possible for a user to get external alerting signals with a method
      preferred by the user. It may for example be vibration, light flashes or
      sound as selected by the user. It should also be possible to get
      alerting on the screen at certain events. <vspace blankLines="0" /> The
      signals to external alerting systems should be issued when an incoming
      request for session initiation is received. When the method is used in
      connection with <xref target="T140.refs">T.140</xref> presentation, it
      should also be issued when the alert-in-session T.140 control event is
      received. <vspace blankLines="0" /> For minor events, for example when
      an entry from a user is completed and displayed in the conversation
      display area, an indication MAY be given e.g. by an on-screen flashing
      or any other suitable alerting signal. <vspace blankLines="0" /> It may
      be useful to provide external alerting also for these minor events in
      specific situations. If the user has not touched the application for a
      number of minutes when the minor event occurs it may be of interest to
      get an external alert. Details of such arrangements are outside the
      scope of this document.<vspace blankLines="0" /></t>
