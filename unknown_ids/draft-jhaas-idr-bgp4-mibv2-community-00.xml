  XML2RFC offers an include feature described in the XML2RFC README
  file.  That syntax, however, contradicts the DTD requirements to
  have <reference> elements within the <references> element, so an 
  XML parser is likely to find your XML file invalid.  It may be
  possible that XML2RFC will change their DTD so that the XML file
  remains valid when their style of include is used.

  In the meantime therefore, we use an alternative valid-XML approach
  to includes, which unfortunately require that define your includes
  at the beginning of the file. Since the biggest benefit of includes
  is for references, this requires that your references be defined in
  ENTITY clauses here before being "included" and cited elsewhere in
  the file.

    <!-- Design Principles  -->

    <!--
        <t>This section is here to remind authors of the Design Principles
         for MIB modules.</t>

        <t>To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering
        practice, an explicit attempt should be made to keep this MIB module
        as simple as possible.  This can be accomplished by applying the
        following criteria to objects proposed for inclusion:</t>
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Start with a small set of essential objects and add only
            as objects are needed.
          </t>
          <t>
            Require objects be essential for either fault or
            performance or configuration management.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.
          </t>
          <t>
            Limit the total number of objects.
          </t>
          <t>
            Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
            this or other MIB modules. The complexity of deriving values
            should be done by the managament station, not the agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily
            instrumented.  The guideline that has been followed in previous
            MIB modules is one counter per critical section per layer.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider the requirements of a small footprint system, such 
            as a set-top box as well as the expanded functionality beneficial 
            to a large foootprint system. To the degree possible, costs 
            associated with advanced functionality should be borne only 
            by the systems implementing such functionality, and the overhead 
            of advanced functionality should minimally impact systems which 
            do not implement the advanced functionality.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: 
        <list style="symbols">
	  <t>bgpCommunityElementValue, bgpCommunityElementWellKnown - 
	  BGP Communities may be used to implement routing policy for ISPs and
	  that routing policy may reflect business relationships.  Inadvertent
	  disclosure of this information inadvertently expose sensitive
	  information about those business relationships.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
