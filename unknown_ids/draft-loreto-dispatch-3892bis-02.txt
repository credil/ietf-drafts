    Updates to Referred-By in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
                    draft-loreto-dispatch-3892bis-02

Abstract

   SIP Referred-By header field conveys the referrer identity of a
   request.  This header field may be used when exploding a SIP MESSAGE
   or a SIP INVITE request to a pre-defined group URI and the
   P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header field in the exploded
   SIP requests needs to carry another value (e.g. the URI of a pre-
   defined group, or a conference focus URI).  In those cases, the
   Referred-By header field in the resulting exploded requests is set to
   the P-Asserted-Identity or to the From header field value of the
   original SIP request received before exploding, so as to convey to
   the receiver the identity of the original inviting sender.

   RFC 3892 restricts the value of the header to only one SIP URI.
   However the P-Asserted-Identity header field currently allows two URI
   values and may be expanded in the future to carry more than two
   values as described in RFC5876.  This document extends the
   Referred-By definition to support more than one value as well.

Internet-Draft      Updates to Referred-By SIP header       January 2011

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.


2.  Introduction

   SIP has a mechanism for conveying the identity of the referrer of a
   request by means of the Referred-By header field [RFC3892].  This
   header field may be used when exploding a SIP MESSAGE request to a
   pre-defined group URI and when exploding a SIP INVITE request to an
   ad-hoc group or to a pre-defined group URI.  The Referred-By header
   is only included if the P-Asserted-Identity header field [RFC3325] or
   From header field needs to carry another value (e.g. the URI of a
   pre-defined group, or a conference focus URI, in the exploded SIP
   requests).  In those cases, the Referred-By header field in the
   resulting exploded requests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity header
   field or to the From header field of the original SIP request
   received before exploding so as to convey to the receiver the
   identity of the original inviting sender.  However, [RFC3892]
   restricts the value of the header to only one SIP URI.

   Since RFC 3325 allows the P-Asserted-Identity header field to contain
   at most two URIs, where one is SIP or SIPS URI [RFC3261] and the
   other is a TEL URI [RFC3966], and moreover [RFC5876] provides
   forwards compatibility by mandating tolerance to the receipt of
   unexpected URIs, then the Referred-By definition in [RFC3892] needs
   to be extended to contain more than one URI value as well.

   The TEL URI in the Referred-By is needed in specific cases:

   o  When the message is interworked to a legacy service that does not
      support the SIP URI and a reply address is needed in that legacy
      service format.  For instance if an Instant Message is sent
      through an interworking function to an SMS user then the sender's
      TEL URI can be translated into an MSISDN in the interworking
      function and sent as the sender address in the SMS message.  The
      SMS user is then able to use this address to send replies to the
      sender.  Because it is not possible to predict ahead of time if
      the message will be interworked or not, there is a need to have
      always both the SIP URI and the TEL URI
   o  Usually clients, in order to be able to display the name or
      identity of the calling party, need the TEL URI.  In fact most of
      the addresses stored in the client's contact list are based on

      phone numbers.  So the client uses the TEL URI to find the
      person's name in the contact list and displays the name along with
      the TEL URI.

   This document extends [RFC3892] by allowing all values of the
   P-Asserted-Identity header field to be carried in the Referred-By
   header field.


3.  Inclusion of URIs in a Referred-By header

   [RFC3892] does not allow more than one URI in the Referred-By header.
   However, if the contents of the Referred-By header come from a
   P-Asserted-Identity header field, then all of the URIs present in the
   P-Asserted-Identity header field should be copied into the
   Referred-By header field.


4.  Behaviour

   This document updates [RFC3892] by allowing a Referred-By header to
   contain two or more URIs as defined for P-Asserted-Identity header
   field in [RFC5876].

4.1.  Referrer Behaviour

   A server can generate a SIP Request because of exploder functionality
   for SIP MESSAGE sent to a pre-defined group URI or for SIP INVITE
   sent to an ad-hoc group or to a pre-defined group URI.  In this
   particular case the server MAY include in the request a Referred-By
   header field to report the identity of the user on behalf of which
   the server is acting and whose identity the server is in a position
   to assert, copying all of the URIs present in the P-Asserted-Identity
   header field.  A server SHOULD do so only in cases where it can
   expect to be trusted by the first proxy.

   If Privacy was requested then there will only be one URI in the
   Referred-By header containing an anonymous URI.

4.2.  General handling

   If a server generates a SIP Request because of exploder functionality
   for a request containing a P-Asserted-Identity header field that
   carries an unexpected number of URIs or unexpected URI schemes it
   MUST act as specified in Section 4.5 of [RFC5876].

5.  The Referred-By Header Field

   The BNF in [RFC3892] is augmented from this:

       Referred-By  =  ("Referred-By" / "b") HCOLON referrer-uri
                      *( SEMI (referredby-id-param / generic-param) )
       referrer-uri =  ( name-addr / addr-spec )

   to this:

    Referred-By  =  ("Referred-By" / "b") HCOLON referrer-uri
                    ( SEMI (referredby-id-param / generic-param) )
                   *(COMMA referrer-uri
                        *( SEMI (referredby-id-param / generic-param) ))
    referrer-uri =  ( name-addr / addr-spec )

   A Referred-By header field value MUST consist of exactly one name-
   addr or addr-spec.  There may be one or two Referred-By values.  If
   there is one value, it MUST be a sip, sips, or tel URI.  If there are
   two values, one value MUST be a sip or sips URI and the other MUST be
   a tel URI.


6.  Examples

   Figure 1 shows an example of a server acting as conference server.
   In this case a User (User1) sends an INVITE request F1 that contains
   an SDP body to a pre-defined group with identity sip:
   pre-definedgroup@example.com .  The group has members User1, User2 ,
   User3 and User4.  The server answers with a 200 (OK) response and
   generates an INVITE request to each of the remaining members of the
   group identified by the URIs corresponding to each user in the group
   membership document.  The conference server includes SDP and a
   Refer-by header including all the values received in the initial
   request from User1 in each of the outgoing INVITE requests.

   Note that these examples consist of partial SIP messages that
   illustrate only the relevant headers.
