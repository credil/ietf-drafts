    <abstract>
      <t>
	This document defines a suite of cryptographic algorithms that
	target a 112-bit security level.  Additionally, this document
	defines the use of these algorithms for use in IPSEC.
	</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	<xref target="SuiteB"/> defines a set of cryptographic
	algorithms that are secure, well reviewed, and are efficient
	at high data rates and high security levels.  Currently,
	support for Suite B is only partly available across the
	industry.  Traditionally, the adoption of new algorithms by
	the industry is a complex and slow process involving multiple
	actors, including policy makers in government and industry,
	standards organizations, and vendors of crypto software and
	hardware, network devices and software, and operating systems.
	Complications around ownership of some intellectual property
	rights as also slowed adoption of Suite B.
      </t>
      <t>
	In this document, we define a suite of crypto algorithms
	that overlap with Suite B, that contains only algorithms that
	are believed to be unencumbered by intellectual property
	considerations and that targets a 112-bit security level.
	This level is not as high as that of Suite B, but it is
	believed to be adequately secure to meet present commercial
	needs.  It provides a halfway point between current industry
	practice and Suite B.
      </t>

      <t>
	It is hoped that the adoption of this new suite will simplify
	and shorten the process of adopting Suite B while providing
	112-bit security.
      </t>
      <t>
	As with previous user interface suites ("UI suites") for IPSec
	(see <xref target='RFC4308'/> and <xref target="RFC4869"/>), this
	document simply defines a few collections of algorithms for IPSec
	and does not modify the protocol itself in any way.
      </t>
      <section title="Conventions Used In This Document">
	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
    	  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    	  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    	  described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    

    <section title="Algorithms">
      <section title="Considerations">
	<t>
	  There were four main criteria taken into consideration when
	  developing the list of algorithms to be recommended:
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      IPR licensing concerns
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Targeted strength equivalence of at least 112 bits of security
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Acceptance of algorithms by the industry and
	      governments, including NIST approval of algorithms
	    </t>  
	    <t>
	      Interoperability between VPN devices
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<section title="Naming">
	  <t>
	    The naming of the suite of algorithms defined here is
	    based on the precedent set forth in RFC4308 where the
	    denotation of "VPN-A" and "VPN-B" is used.  Due to
	    concerns over naming conflicts with organizations that
	    already exist in the industry, the "VPN-C" designation was
	    bypassed and therefore the suite defined here is
	    referenced as "VPN-D".
	  </t>
	</section>
      </section>
  
      <section title="Suite D Algorithms">
	<t>
	  For Authenticated Encryption in the data plane, AES with 128
	  bit keys in GCM mode with 128 bit ICV
	  <xref target="RFC4106"/> MUST be used.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For Integrity checks (when Authenticated Encryption is not
	  in use), HMAC-SHA-256-128 <xref target='RFC4868'/> MUST be
	  used.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For hashing algorithms, SHA-256 <xref target="SHA2"/> MUST
	  be used.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For certificate based signatures, RSA-2048 and SHA-256 MUST
	  be used.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, a 2048-bit MODP group MUST
	  be used.  Explicitly, Diffie-Hellman Group 14
	  <xref target='RFC3526'/> MUST be used.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For pseudo-random generation function, PRF-HMAC-SHA-256
	  <xref target='RFC4868' /> MUST be used.
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>


    <section title="Suite D Algorithms in IPSec">
      <t>
	Suite-VPN-D defines the set of algorithms intended to be used
	for IPSec VPN applications and fully complies with the MUST Suite D
	algorithms defined above.
      </t>
      <texttable title="Suite-VPN-D Cryptosuite">
	<ttcol align='left'> Protocol </ttcol>
	<ttcol align='left'> Algorithm </ttcol>
	<c> ESP encryption transform</c>  <c> AES-GCM-128 w/ 16 octet ICV </c>
	<c> ESP integrity transform</c>  <c> N/A </c>
	<c> Pseudo Random Function</c> <c>PRF-HMAC-SHA-256</c>
	<c> IKE encryption transform</c>  <c> AES-CBC-128 </c>
	<c> IKEv1 hash</c>  <c> SHA-256 </c>
	<c> IKEv2 integrity transform</c>  <c> HMAC-SHA-256-128 </c>
	<c> IKE Diffie-Hellman Group</c> <c> 14 </c>
	<c> IKE X509 authentication</c>  <c> RSA-2048 with SHA-256 </c>
	<c> IKE Pre-Shared Key</c>  <c>not less than 128 bits</c>
      </texttable>
      <t>
	For IKEv1 implementations, Main mode SHOULD be used.  
      </t>
      <t>
	IKEv1 implementations MUST support rekeying of Phase 2.  For
	IKEv2 implementations, CREATE-CHILD_SA exchanges MUST be
	supported.  Rekey operations that include the optional
	Diffie-Hellman key MUST use a key that is DH Group 14.
      </t>
      <t>
	If the pre-shared key option is used, then it MUST have a
	min-entropy of 128 bits.  This means that the key must be
	chosen at random in such a way that the most probable key will
	occur with probability no greater than 2^(-128).  A practical
	way to achieve this is to choose the key uniformly at random;
	for example, a string of 22 base64 characters chosen uniformly
	at random has sufficient min-entropy.
	</t>
    </section>


    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	The target of 112-bit security level for the suite is
	generally believed to be sufficient for some time given
	current technologies <xref target="RFC3766"/>.  This security
	level is also supported by current NIST recommendations for
	key strengths <xref target="NIST.800-57.2007"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	The IANA registry called "Cryptographic Suites for IKEv1,
	IKEv2, and IPsec" should be updated with an identifier of
	'VPN-D' following the criteria set forth in
	<xref target="RFC4308"/>.
      </t>

    <section title="Other 2048 bit MODP Groups">
      <t>
	In this document, we make use of Diffie-Hellman Group 14 in
	Suite VPN-D to provide 2048 bit MODP for IKE.  Diffie-Hellman
	Group 24 <xref target="RFC5114"/> might also be considered to
	for this purpose.  However, the authors note, the prime chosen
	for Group 24 is not a safe prime and modified IKE hanlding
	based on public key validation routines might be required.
