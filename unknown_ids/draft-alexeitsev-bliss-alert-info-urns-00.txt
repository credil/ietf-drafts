Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
   provide a reference to the alternative ringback tone for the caller
   using the Alert-Info header.  However, the reference addresses only
   the network resources with specific rendering properties.  There is
   currently no support for predefined standard identifiers for ringback
   tones or semantic indications without tied rendering.  To overcome
   this limitations and support new applications a family of the URNs is
   defined in this specification.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                 August 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] allows for user agent
   servers (UAS) and proxies to provide the specific ringback tone to
   the user agent (UA).  In RFC 3261 this is done by including a URI
   reference in the Alert-Info header field, that points to the rinback
   tone.  The URI reference is most commonly the HTTP URI to the audio
   file.  On the receipt of the Alert-Info header the user agent may
   fetch the referenced ringback tone and play it to the user.  Current
   solution is sufficient for human users that share the same
   understanding of the ringback tones.  However if caller and callee
   are from the different countries the understanding of the ringback
   tones may vary significantly.  Hearing impaired users may not sense
   the specific ringback tone if it is provided as an audio file.  The
   ringback tone is not useful for automata.  Another limitation of the
   current solution is that the referenced ringback tones are tied to
   particular rendering.  It is not possible to provide a semantic
   indication that signals the intent and allows the recipient to decide
   how to render it in an appropriate way.

   To solve the described issues and support new applications this
   specification defines the new URN namespace 'alert' for the Alert-
   Info header that can be understood by an automaton, would allow for
   programmatic handling, including user interface adaptation, or
   conversion to equivalent protocol parameters in the Public Switched
   Telephone Network (PSTN) when the client is a gateway.

   Using 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different
   application spaces:

   o  Names for services like "call is a waiting call", not tied to any
      particular rendering.

   o  Names for standard tones, such as those used by the PSTN.  For
      instance there could be names for all the various country-specific
      ring tones and ringback tones

   o  Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
      audio.  They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.

   Some advantages of a URN rather than a net reference to a
   downloadable resource:

      no need to download it

      you don't have to worry if you support the format downloaded

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                 August 2008


      there is no "danger" that you might end up rendering something
      unexpected and undesirable

      you can render as high (or low) quality as your device can use

   The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the URN
   then it won't be able to render anything.  To provide the general
   awareness about the Alert-Info URNs this document provides IANA
   template for registering the URNs and defines several typical
   identifiers.


2.  Server Behavior

   A server MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header in a
   provisional response when it needs to provide additional information
   about the status of the callee.  A server SHOULD NOT add a mixture of
   URNs and URIs to the Alert-Info header that may cause disturbing
   rendering interference at the callee's UA.

   Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
   the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service
   transported by the Alert-Info header.

      Alert-Info: <http://www.exmple.com/sound/moo.wav>,
      <sip:urn:alert:service:call-waiting>


3.  User Agent Client Behavior

   Upon receiving a provisional response with an Alert-Info header that
   contains a single or multiple alert URNs, the User Agent Client (UAC)
   attempts to match the URNs with the known indications.

   If no match is found, the UA ignores the received URNs and proceed
   with normal operation.

   If the one or multiple URNs matches a known indication the UAC
   renders the indication(s) to the user according to the type of
   indication.  The UAC is responsible for the non disturbing rendering
   if multiple indications and network resources are to rendered
   simultaneously.


4.  Use cases

   This section describes the use cases that are supported by the Alert-
   Info header URNs.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                 August 2008


4.1.  Call is a waiting call

   The call waiting Service [TS24.615] permits a callee to be notified
   of an incoming call whilst the media resources are not available for
   the incoming call and the callee is engaged in an active or held
   call.  Subsequently, the callee can either accept, reject, or ignore
   the incoming call.  There is an interest on the caller side to be
   informed about the call waiting situation on the callee side.  Having
   this information the caller can decide whether to continue waiting
   for callee to pickup, or better to call some time later when it is
   estimated, that the callee could finished the ongoing conversation.
   To provide this information callee's UAS or proxy aware of the call
   waiting condition can add the call-waiting indication URN to the
   Alert-Info header.

   As call-waiting information may be subject to the callee's privacy
   concerns, the exposure of this information SHALL be done only if
   explicitly required by the user


5.  Registration template

   Below is the registration template for the 'alert' URN scheme
   according to the RFC 3406 [RFC3406]

   Namespace ID: alert

   Registration Information:

   Registration version: 1

   Registration date: 2008-08-14

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

   Registering organization: IETF

   Designated contact: Denis Alexeitsev

   Designated contact email: d.alexeitsev@telekom.de

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

   The URN consists of a hierarchical alert service identifier, with a
   sequence of labels separated by periods.  The left-most label is the
   most significant one and is called 'top-level alert service', while
   names to the right are called 'alert sub-services'.  The set of
   allowable characters is the same as that for domain names [RFC1123].

   Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be specified in all lower-case.
   For any given service URN, service- identifiers can be removed right-
   to-left; the resulting URN is still valid, referring to a more
   generic service.  In other words, if a service 'x.y.z' exists, the
   URNs 'x' and 'x.y' are also valid service URNs.  The ABNF [RFC4234]
   is shown below.

        alert-URN       = "URN:alert:" indication
        indication      = top-level *("." sub-indication)
        top-level       = let-dig [ *25let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
        sub-indication  = let-dig [ *let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
        let-dig-hyp     = let-dig / "-"
        let-dig         = ALPHA / DIGIT
        ALPHA           = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z
        DIGIT           = %x30-39 ; 0-9


   Relevant ancillary documentation: None

   Community considerations: The alert URN is believed to be relevant to
   a large cross-section of Internet users, including both technical and
   non-technical users, on a variety of devices and with a variety of
   perception capabilities.  The alert URN will allow Internet users to
   better understand the alert status of the callee in the foreign
   country, or better understand if the callee is able to answer the
   call.  For example, specific ringback tone from the foreign country
   can be rendered by the user interface in the familiar way to the
   user.  Call is a waiting call indication meaning that the callee is
   occupied with the different session can be provided to the caller
   that would help to better assert the answer probability.  User
   interfaces for the perception impaired users can better render the
   ringback indication based on the alert URN.  The assignment of
   identifiers is described in the IANA Considerations (Section 6).  The
   alert URN does not prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but
   it is assumed that a number of different entities could operate and
   offer such mechanisms.

   Namespace considerations: There do not appear to be other URN
   namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely identifying alert
   communication and information services.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations: An alert URN identifies a
   logical service or tone, specified in the alert indication
   registration (see IANA Considerations (Section 6)).  Resolution of
   the registered URN, will return a particular instance of the alert
   indication.  Alert indication URNs MUST be unique for each unique
   indication; this is guaranteed through the registration of each alert
   indication within this namespace, described in (Section 6).

   Identifier persistence considerations: The alert URN for the same
   indication is expected to be persistent, as long as it is registered
   with IANA.

   Process of identifier assignment: The process of identifier
   assignment is described in the IANA Considerations (Section 6).

   Process for identifier resolution: alert URNs are statically resolved
   according to the IANA registry.

   Rules for lexical equivalence: alert URNs are compared according to
   case-insensitive string equality.

   Conformance with URN syntax: The BNF in the 'Declaration of syntactic
   structure' above constrains the syntax for this URN scheme.

   Validation mechanism: Validation determines whether a given string is
   currently a validly-assigned URN [RFC3406].  Static validation is
   performed based on the currently registered alert URNs at IANA.

   Scope: The scope for this URN is public and global.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new URN scheme with the registration
   template provided in section Registration Template.

   Below, the section 7.1 details how to register new alert indication
   identifying labels.  Descriptions of sub-indications for the first
   two indications to be registered, service and tone, are given in
   Section 7.2 and Section 7.3, respectively.  Finally, Section 7.4
   contains the initial registration table.

6.1.  New Indication identifying lables

   Indications and sub-indications are identified by labels managed by
   IANA, according to the processes outlined in [RFC2434] in a new
   registry called "Alert URN Labels".  Thus, creating a new indication
   requires IANA action.  The policy for adding top-level indication
   labels is 'Standards Action'.  (This document defines the top-level
   indication labels 'service' and 'tone'.)  The policy for assigning
   labels to sub-indications may differ for each top-level indications
   designation and MUST be defined by the document describing the top-
   level indication.

   Entries in the registration table have the following format:

   Indication  Reference  Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   foo         RFCxyz     Brief description of the 'foo' top-level service or tone
   foo.bar     RFCabc     Description of the 'foo.bar' service or tone

   All top-level indication labels MUST NOT exceed 27 characters.

6.2.  Sub-Indications for the 'service' Indication

   This section defines the first indication registration within the
   IANA registry defined in Section 7.1, using the top-level indication
   label 'service'.

   'service' indication label provides information about additional
   services performed on the callee side.  Sub-indications of the
   service indication are not tied to any particular rendering and
   signal the service invocation, that allows the recipient to decide on
   the best way to render this indication.

   urn:alert:service:call-waiting indication provides information to the
   caller about the call-waiting situation on the callee side.  Call-
   waiting situation for the callee means that very limited resources
   are available for an incoming communication.  The callee normally has
   the choice of accepting, rejecting or ignoring the waiting call.

6.3.  Sub-Indications for the 'tone' Indication

   The 'tone' indication type describes tones that should be rendered to
   the caller.  The normal rendering is audio, however there can be
   other renderings applicable if needed by the user interface
   specifics.

   urn:alert:tone:XYZ

6.4.  Initial IANA Registration

   The following table contains the initial IANA registration for
   service and tone indications.

    Indication             Reference  Description

    tone                   RFC XYZ    Ringback tones
    tone.xyz               RFC XYZ    XYZ tone

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   The indication labels are protocol elements [RFC3536] and are not
   normally seen by users.  Thus, the character set for these elements
   is restricted, as described in Section 6.


8.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the alert indication URN does not appear to raise
   any particular security issues.  The indications described by the
   alert URN are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do
   not apply to the URN.

   Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
   privacy issues.  Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised
   by the callee.
