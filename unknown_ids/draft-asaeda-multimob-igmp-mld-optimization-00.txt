Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility        July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [2] for IPv4 and the
   Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) [3] for IPv6 are the
   standard protocols for hosts to initiate joining or leaving multicast
   sessions.  These protocols must be also supported by multicast
   routers or IGMP/MLD proxies [7] that serve multicast member hosts on
   their downstream interfaces.  Conceptually, IGMP and MLD work on
   wireless networks.  However, wireless access technologies operate on
   a shared medium or a point-to-point link with limited frequency and
   bandwidth.  In many wireless regimes, it is desirable to minimize
   multicast-related signaling to preserve the limited resources of
   battery powered mobile devices and the constrained transmission
   capacities of the networks.  A mobile host may cause initiation and
   termination of a multicast service in the new or the previous
   network.  Slow multicast service activation following a join may
   degrade reception quality.  Slow service termination triggered by
   IGMP/MLD querying or by a rapid departure of the mobile host without
   leaving the group in the previous network may waste network
   resources.

   To create the optimal condition for mobile hosts and routers, it is
   required to "ease processing cost or battery power consumption by
   eliminating transmission of a large number of IGMP/MLD messages via
   flooding" and "realize fast state convergence by successive
   monitoring whether downstream members exist or not".

   One of the possible approaches to support these requirements is that
   multicast routers enable the "explicit tracking function".  According
   to the specification of IGMPv3 [2] and MLDv2 [3], the downstream
   IGMPv3 or MLDv2 member hosts must send their membership reports to
   the upstream router upon data reception.  This enables the router to
   keep track of the membership status of the downstream IGMPv3 or MLDv2
   member hosts.

   On the other hand, routers still need to maintain downstream
   membership status by sending IGMPv3/MLDv2 query messages due to the
   following reasons.

   o  IGMP/MLD messages are non-reliable and may be lost in the
      transmission, therefore routers need to confirm the membership by
      sending query messages.

   o  Routers need additional processing capability and a possibly large
      memory to keep track of membership status, and therefore the
      routers usually disable the function for keeping track of
      membership status.

Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility        July 2009


   o  To preserve compatibility with older versions of IGMP/MLD, routers
      need to support downstream hosts that are not upgraded to the
      latest versions of IGMP/MLD and run the report suppression
      mechanism.

   This document describes the ways of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocol
   optimization for mobility.  The optimization includes a query timer
   tuning and an explicit membership notification operation.  The
   selective optimization that provides tangible benefits to the mobile
   hosts and routers is given by "keeping track of downstream hosts'
   membership status", "varying IGMP/MLD Query types and values to tune
   the number of responses", and "using a source filtering mechanism in
   a lightweight manner".  Aside from a modified protocol semantic,
   optional "Notification function" for the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols
   is introduced.  The proposed optimization interoperates with the
   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols.  This condition is advantageous to the
   deployment.

2.  Optimization

2.1.  Tracking of Membership Status

   Mobile hosts use IGMP and MLD to request to join or leave multicast
   sessions.  When the upstream routers receive the IGMP/MLD reports,
   they recognize the membership status on the LAN.  To update the
   membership status, the routers send IGMP/MLD Query messages
   periodically as a soft-state approach does, and the member hosts
   reply IGMP/MLD report messages upon reception.

   IGMP/MLD Query is therefore necessary to obtain the up-to-date
   membership information, but a large number of the reply messages sent
   from all member hosts may cause network congestion or consume network
   bandwidth.  To escape from the trouble, a membership report
   suppression mechanism was proposed in the traditional IGMP and MLD
   [4][5][6].  By the report suppression mechanism, a host would cancel
   sending a pending membership reports requested by IGMP/MLD Query if a
   similar report was observed from another member on the network.
   However, the report suppression mechanism precluded the function for
   an upstream router to track membership status.  In IGMPv3 and MLDv2,
   it is hence decided that the membership report suppression mechanism
   has been removed, and all downstream member hosts must send their
   membership reports to an upstream router.

2.2.  IGMP/MLD Query Coordination

2.2.1.  Unicasting IGMP/MLD General Query

   IGMP and MLD are non-reliable protocols; to cover the possibility of
   a State-Change Report being missed by one or more multicast routers,
   a host retransmits the same State-Change Report [Robustness Variable]
   - 1 more times, at intervals chosen at random from the range (0,
   [Unsolicited Report Interval]) [2][3].  However, this manner does not
   guarantee that the State-Change Report is reached to the routers.
   The routers therefore need to refresh the downstream membership
   information by receiving Current-State Report periodically solicited
   by IGMP/MLD General Query, in order to be robust in front of host or
   link failures and packet loss.  It supports the situation that mobile
   hosts turn off or move from the wireless network to other wireless
   network managed by the different router without any notification
   (e.g., leave request).

   A multicast router periodically transmits IGMP/MLD General Query in
   the [Query Interval] sec.  The default value of [Query Interval] is
   125 sec. specified in the standard IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications
   [2][3].  Unfortunately, periodical message flooding using the all-
   hosts multicast address (i.e. 224.0.0.1 or ff02::1) as its IP

Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility        July 2009


   destination address gives the unwilling situation to the mobile
   hosts.  It consumes the bandwidth of a wireless link and may wake all
   mobile hosts up by IGMP/MLD General Query.  In fact, when mobile
   hosts are operating in dormant mode and not communicating with
   others, they should keep sleeping for saving the battery power.  In
   this case, only the hosts that are receiving multicast contents
   should make the response to the router.

   A multicast router attached on a wireless link may want to configure
   longer query interval as the [Multicast Query Interval] value
   Section 5, in order to reduce the number of IGMP/MLD General Query
   messages via multicast.  Yet, longer query interval will increase
   join latency when an unsolicit Join message with State-Change Record
   requesting joining a multicast session is not reached to the router,
   or it will increase leave latency when an unsolicit Leave message
   with State-Change Record requesting leaving a session is not reached
   to the router.

   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications [2][3] mention that a host MUST
   accept and process any Query whose IP Destination Address field
   contains any of the addresses (unicast or multicast) assigned to the
   interface on which the Query arrives.  According to the scenario, a
   router can unicast the message to tracked member hosts in the
   [Unicast Query Interval] (described in Section 5), especially when a
   multicast router has a small number of mobile hosts that are
   listening different multicast sessions.  In this case, the router
   multicasts IGMP/MLD General Query with longer [Multicast Query
   Interval] (described in Section 5) to recognize hosts that were not
   tracked.

2.2.2.  Multicasting IGMP/MLD Group-Specific Query

   In the standard protocols [2][3], an IGMP/MLD Group-Specific Query is
   sent to verify there are no hosts that desire reception of the
   specified group or to rebuild the desired reception state for a
   particular group.  The Group-Specific Query is sent when a router
   receives State-Change Records indicating a host is leaving a group,
   and never in response to Current-State Records.

   A Group-Specific Query builds and refreshes group membership state of
   hosts on attached networks.  Since a Group-Specific Query specifies
   the corresponding multicast address (not the all-hosts multicast
   address) as its IP destination address, dormant mode hosts that do
   not join any multicast session are not woken up by these specific
   Queries, and only active group member hosts that have been receiving
   multicast contents with the specified address reply IGMP/MLD reports.

   However, sending many Group-Specific Queries for all corresponding

Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility        July 2009


   groups may increase the total number of transmitted IGMP/MLD
   messages.  [TODO: Therefore, it is necessary to know the condition in
   which a Group-Specific Query is used for maintaining the group
   membership state of all hosts on a link, instead of a General Query.]

   The [Multicast Group-Query Interval] is the interval between Group-
   Specific Queries sent by the querier, i.e., the router that sends the
   Group-Specific Query.  [TODO: Define [Multicast Group-Query
   Interval].  We currently think this value is same of the default
   [Query Interval] value the regular IGMP and MLD define [2][3].]

2.3.  IGMP/MLD Querier Selection

   [TODO: To consider the case that multiple multicast routers exist in
   a single wireless link, do we need to propose a new IGMP/MLD querier
   selection mechanism and the corresponding timer values or intervals?
   The Querier's Query Interval Code (QQIC) field that specifies the
   [Query Interval] used by the querier may be tuned.  The actual
   interval, called the Querier's Query Interval (QQI), is derived from
   QQIC.  Multicast routers that are not the current querier adopt the
   QQI value from the most recently received Query as their own [Query
   Interval] value.]

2.4.  Multicast Source Filter

   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 provide the ability for hosts to report source-
   specific subscriptions.  With IGMPv3/MLDv2, a mobile host can specify
   a channel of interest, using multicast group and source addresses
   with INCLUDE filter mode in its join request.  Upon reception, the
   upstream router establishes the shortest path tree toward the source
   without coordinating a shared tree.  This function is called the
   source filtering function and required to support Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM) [8].

   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 support another operation with EXCLUDE filter mode.
   When a mobile host specifies multicast and source addresses with
   EXCLUDE filter mode in the join request, an upstream router forwards
   the multicast packets sent from all sources *except* the specified
   sources.

   However, practical applications do not use EXCLUDE mode to block
   sources very often, because a user or application usually wants to
   specify desired source addresses, not undesired source addresses.  In
   addition, this scheme leads an implementation cost to mobile hosts
   and complex procedures to maintain coexisting situation of the
   interesting source address lists with INCLUDE filter mode or non-
   interesting source address lists with EXCLUDE filter mode.

Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility        July 2009


   Furthermore, specifying non-interesting source addresses with EXCLUDE
   filter mode reduces the advantage of scalable routing tree
   coordination produced by SSM.  An upstream router needs to maintain a
   shared tree (e.g., RPT in PIM-SM) whenever the router receives join
   request with EXCLUDE filter mode from the downstream hosts.  This
   increases the tree maintenance cost to the multicast routers on the
   routing paths.  While the mobile multicast communication does not
   prohibit a traditional (*,G) join request (which is a join request
   with EXCLUDE filter mode without specifying any source address), all
   other join requests with EXCLUDE filter mode should be eliminated
   from the mobile multicast communication.

   Recently, Lightweight-IGMPv3 (LW-IGMPv3) and Lightweight-MLDv2 (LW-
   MLDv2) [9] are proposed in the IETF MBONED working group.  These
   protocols are the simplified versions of IGMPv3 and MLDv2, and
   eliminate an EXCLUDE filter mode operation.  Not only are LW-IGMPv3
   and LW-MLDv2 fully compatible with the full version of these
   protocols (i.e., the standard IGMPv3 and MLDv2), but also the
   protocol operations made by hosts and routers are simplified in the
   lightweight manner, and complicated operations are effectively
   reduced.  LW-IGMPv3 and LW-MLDv2 give the opportunity to grow SSM
   use.

   In the lightweight protocols, EXCLUDE mode on the host part is
   preserved only for EXCLUDE (*,G) join/leave, which denotes a non-
   source-specific group report (known as the traditional (*,G) join/
   leave or Any-Source Multicast (ASM)) and is equivalent to the group
   membership join/leave triggered by IGMPv2/IGMPv1/MLDv1.  This
   document hence recommend to adopt LW-IGMPv3 and LW-MLDv2 to mobile
   hosts and routers, or eliminate EXCLUDE filter mode operation from
   mobile hosts if IGMPv3 and MLDv2 are adopted to the hosts.

3.  Explicit Membership Notification

   This document proposes an IGMP/MLD Notification operation, in which a
   mobile host *periodically* sends Current-State Record messages
   expressing which multicast sessions the host is joining, even the
   host is not requested to report the membership information by its
   upstream router (i.e., no reception of General Query message).

   The IGMP/MLD Notification operation enables the longer [Multicast
   Query Interval] value for IGMP/MLD General Query than the default
   [Query Interval].  If mobile hosts support the IGMP/MLD Notification
   operation, a multicast router can obtain downstream membership
   information without periodical and spontaneous membership
   solicitation by IGMP/MLD General Query.  The router only needs to
   refresh downstream membership information by solicit IGMP/MLD General
   Query to the hosts that do not support the IGMP/MLD Notification
   operation or leave from network without sending any message to the
   router.

   If timers are tuned by dynamic nature of membership, the IGMP/MLD
   Notification operation reduces the number of IGMP/MLD General Query
   periodically sent by a router and the total number of IGMP/MLD
   messages.  Since a router only needs to refresh downstream membership
   information by solicit General Query to hosts that do not support the
   Notification operation, both [Unicast Query Interval] and [Multicast
   Query Interval] can be set to longer values.  This mechanism may
   conserve battery power of dormant mode hosts, as dormant mode hosts
   do not pay attention to the General Query messages at short
   intervals.

   The IGMP/MLD Notification operation also contributes to fast
   handover, because a host receiving data immediately sends unsolicited
   reports without waiting for IGMP/MLD General Query at the new
   network.

   The [Notification Interval] value (described in Section 5) is the
   interval of Current-State Records periodically sent by a member host
   that joins at least one multicast session.  Since a mobile host
   periodically unicasts Current-State Record in [Notification Interval]
   that is shorter than the regular General Query interval (i.e.  [Query
   Interval] value) and [Multicast Query Interval] and [Unicast Query
   Interval], even if a router tracking membership status misses State-
   Change report that requests a leave operation, the router can operate
   a leave procedure faster than the regular case.  When mobile hosts
   receive IGMP/MLD General Query, they reset their [Notification
   Interval] timer value and restart it.

   When a multicast router works with the Notification operation, it

   must maintain the following information for each multicast session to
   recognize receiver host's membership status;

   1      Receiver address - indicates an address of a receiver host
          sending the Current-State Report.

   2      Last membership report - indicates the time that the router
          receives the last Current-State Report.

   3      Filter mode - indicates either INCLUDE or EXCLUDE as defined
          in [2][3].

   4      Source addresses and multicast address - indicates the address
          pair that the receiver joins.

4.  Interoperability

   This document assumes multicast routers that deal with mobile hosts
   MUST be IGMPv3/MLDv2 capable (regardless whether the protocols are
   the full or lightweight version).  Therefore all interoperability
   conditions are inherited from [2][3][9], and this document does not
   need to consider interoperability with older version protocols.

   An IGMP/MLD Notification operation is a simple optimization for
   mobile hosts to spontaneously send IGMP/MLD Current-State Report to
   their upstream multicast routers.  Since a multicast router solicits
   downstream membership information by IGMP/MLD General Query, non-
   upgraded mobile hosts can coexist in the network.  However, join and
   leave latency for non-upgraded mobile hosts may become longer due to
   the longer [Query Interval] timer configuration for multicast
   routers.  Note that the IGMP/MLD Notification operation does not
   require any modification to multicast routers.

5.  Timers, Counters, and Their Default Values

   A multicast router operating in dormant mode keeps track of the
   membership status and checks the membership status by transmitting
   unicast IGMP/MLD General Query or multicast IGMP/MLD Group-Specific
   Query.  Cooperating with these scenarios, the message interval
   between IGMP/MLD General Queries is set to longer than the default
   [Query Interval] value.

   The [Query Interval] is the interval between General Queries sent by
   the regular IGMPv3/MLDv2 querier, and the default value is 125
   seconds [2][3].  By varying the [Query Interval], multicast routers
   can tune the number of IGMP messages on the network; larger values
   cause IGMP Queries to be sent less often.

   [TODO: We will provide the appropriate [Multicast Query Interval]
   value that would fit in the mobile communication environment based on
   some experimental results.  In our current sense, this value should
   be larger than the default [Query Interval] value the regular IGMPv3
   and MLDv2 define.]

   The Query Response Interval is the Max Response Time (or Max Response
   Delay) used to calculate the Max Resp Code inserted into the periodic
   General Queries, and the default value is 10 seconds [2][3].  By
   varying the [Query Response Interval], multicast routers can tune the
   burstiness of IGMP messages on the network; larger values make the
   traffic less bursty, as host responses are spread out over a larger
   interval.

   [TODO: We will provide the appropriate [Query Response Interval]
   value that would fit in the mobile communication environment based on
   some experimental results.  In our current sense, this value should
   be less than the default value the regular IGMP and MLD define,
   because, while the larger Query Interval does not reduce the number
   of transmitted IGMP/MLD messages, it may cause slow leave latency.]

   Mobile hosts may receive a variety of Queries on different interfaces
   and of different kinds (e.g., General Queries, Group-Specific
   Queries, and Group-and-Source-Specific Queries), each of which may
   require its own delayed response.

   [TODO: The timer management for each queries may or should be
   independent.  E.g. the timer value for General Query should be longer
   than the one of other queries.  We will investigate this issue.]

   To cover the possibility of unsolicited reports being missed by
   multicast routers, unsolicited reports are retransmitted [Robustness
   Variable] - 1 more times, at intervals chosen at random from the

   defined range [2][3].  The QRV (Querier's Robustness Variable) field
   in IGMP/MLD Query contains the [Robustness Variable] value used by
   the querier.  Routers adopt the QRV value from the most recently
   received Query as their own [Robustness Variable] value, whose range
   SHOULD be set between "1" to "7".  While the default [Robustness
   Variable] value defined in IGMPv3 [2] and MLDv2 [3] is "2", the
   [Robustness Variable] value announced by the querier MUST NOT be "0"
   and SHOULD NOT be "1".

   [TODO: We will propose the robustness values that would be adjusted
   according to the number of receivers.  In our current sense, this
   value SHOULD NOT be bigger than "2" especially when the [Query
   Response Interval] is set to less than its default value.]

   The default [Unicast Query Interval] value is 90 sec.

   The default [Multicast Query Interval] value is 180 sec.

   The default [Notification Interval] value is 60 sec.  The
   [Notification Interval] value MUST be shorter than [Multicast Query
   Interval] and [Unicast Query Interval].
