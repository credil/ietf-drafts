                      The RPKI Ghostbusters Record
                    draft-ietf-sidr-ghostbusters-00

Abstract

   In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), resource
   certificates completely obscure names or any other information which
   might be useful for contacting responsible parties to deal with
   issues of certificate expiration, maintenance, roll-overs,
   compromises, etc.  This draft describes the RPKI Ghostbusters Record
   containing human contact information to be signed (indirectly) by a
   resource-owning certificate.  The data in the record are those of a
   severely profiled vCARD.

Internet-Draft        The RPKI Ghostbusters Record          January 2011


1.  Introduction

   In the operational use of the RPKI it can become necessary to
   contact, human to human, the party responsible for a resource-owning
   certificate.  The primary example of this need is when the owner of a
   Route Origin Authorizations (ROA) sees that a upstream certificate in
   the chain needed to validate the ROA is soon to expire or a CRL
   associated with the certificate is stale, thus placing the quality of
   the routing of the address space described by the ROA in jeopardy.

   As the names in RPKI certificates are intentionally obscured hashes,
   see [I-D.ietf-sidr-cp], there is no way to use the certificate itself
   to lead to the certificate's maintainer.  So, "Who do you call?"

   This document specifies the RPKI Ghostbusters Record, signed
   indirectly by the certificate whose maintainer needs to be contacted,
   which contains human usable contact information for that maintainer.

   This document and the Ghostbusters Record conform to the syntax
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].

   Note that this record is not an identity certificate, but an
   attestation to the contact data made by the holder of the signing
   certificate, and its parent if that is an EE certificate.

   This record is not meant to supplant or be used as resource registry
   whois data.  It gives information about a certificate maintainer not
   a resource holder.

   This specification has three main sections.  The first, Section 4, is
   the format of the contact payload information, a severely profiled
   vCARD.  The second, Section 5, profiles the packaging of the payload
   as a profile of the RPKI Signed Object Template specification
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].  The third, Section 6, describes the
   proper validation of the signed Ghostbusters Record.


2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands the RPKI,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], the RPKI Repository Structure,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct], Signed RPKI Objects,
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object], and vCARDS [RFC2426].


3.  RPKI Ghostbuster Record Payload Example

   An example of an RPKI Ghostbusters Record payload with all fields

   used is as follows:

     BEGIN:vCard
     VERSION:3.0
     FN:Human's Name
     ORG:Organizational Entity
     ADR;TYPE=WORK:;;42 Twisty Passage;Deep Cavern; WA; 98666;U.S.A.
     TEL;TYPE=VOICE,MSG,WORK:+1-666-555-1212
     TEL;TYPE=FAX,WORK:+1-666-555-1213
     EMAIL;TYPE=INTERNET:human@example.com
     END:vCard


4.  vCARD Profile

   The goal in profiling the vCARD is not to include as much information
   as possible, but rather to include as few fields as possible while
   providing the minimal necessary data to enable one to contact the
   maintainer of the RPKI data which threatens the ROA[s] of concern.

   The Ghostbusters vCARD payload is a minimalist subset of the vCARD as
   described in [RFC2426].

   BEGIN -  pro forma packaging which MUST be the first line in the
      vCARD and MUST have the value "BEGIN:vCARD" as described in
      [RFC2426].

   VERSION -  pro forma packaging which MUST be the second line in the
      vCARD and MUST have the value "VERSION:3.0" as described in 3.6.9
      of [RFC2426].

   FN -  the name, as described in 3.1.1 of [RFC2426], of a contactable
      person who responsible for the certificate.

   ORG -  an organization as described in 3.5.5 of [RFC2426].

   ADR -  a postal address as described in 3.2.1 of [RFC2426].

   TEL -  a voice and/or fax phone as described in 3.3.1 of [RFC2426].

   EMAIL -  an Email address as described in 3.3.2 of [RFC2426]

   END -  pro forma packaging which MUST be the last line in the vCARD
      and MUST have the value "END:vCARD" as described in [RFC2426].

   The BEGIN, VERSION, and END lines MUST be included in a record.  To
   be useful, FN and one or more of ADR, TEL, and EMAIL SHOULD be
   included.

5.  CMS Packaging

   The Ghostbusters Record is a CMS signed-data object conforming to the
   RPKI Signed Data Object Template, [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].

   The ContentType of a Ghostbusters Record is defined as
   rpkiGhostbusters, and has the numerical value of TO BE ASSIGNED.
   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object.  See [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object].

   eContent: The content of a Ghostbusters Record is described above in
   Section 4 above.

   Similarly to a ROA, the Ghostbusters Record is usually signed by an
   end-entity certificate which is, in turn, signed by the resource-
   holding certificate whose maintainer is described in the vCARD.


6.  Validation

   The validation procedure defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object] is applied to a Ghostbusters Record.
   After this procedure has been performed, the Version number field
   within the payload is checked, and the OCTET STRING containing the
   vCARD data is extracted.  These data are checked against the profile
   defined in Section 4 of this document.  Only if all of these checks
   pass is the Ghostbusters payload deemed valid and made available to
   the application that requested the payload.


7.  Security Considerations

   Though there is no on the wire protocol in this specification, there
   are attacks which could abuse the data described.  As the data, to be
   useful, need to be public, little can be done to avoid this exposure.

   Phone Numbers:  The vCARDs may contain real world telephone numbers
      which could be abused for telemarketing, abusive calls, etc.

   Email Addresses:  The vCARDs may contain Email addresses which could
      be abused for purpases of spam.

   Relying parties are warned that the data in a Ghostbusters Record are
   self-asserted.  These data have not been verified by the CA that
   issued a (CA) certificate to the entity that issued the EE
   certificate used to validate the Ghostbusters Record.
