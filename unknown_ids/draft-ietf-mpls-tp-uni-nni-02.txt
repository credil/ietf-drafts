MPLS Transport Profile User-to-Network and Network-to-Network Interfaces
                     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-uni-nni-02

Abstract

   The framework for MPLS in transport networks (RFC 5921) provides
   reference models for an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) User-to-
   Network Interface (UNI), and an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network Interface
   (NNI).  This document updates those reference models to show detailed
   reference points for these interfaces, along with further
   clarification of the functional architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and
   NNI.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subjet to an IETF
   Last Call.

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published
   RFC has IETF consensus.]

1.  Introduction

   The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] provides
   reference models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and
   an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network Interface (NNI).  This document updates
   those reference models to show detailed reference points for these
   interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional
   architecture of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) at a UNI and
   NNI.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

1.1.  Updates to the MPLS-TP UNI and NNI

   The transport service interfaces for MPLS-TP are defined in Section
   3.4.3 of [RFC5921].  These definitions are illustrated by showing
   MPLS-TP PEs containing a UNI and an NNI.  The figures illustrate the
   UNI and the NNI as a span.  However, it is more conventional to
   illustrate these interfaces as reference points.  Furthermore, in the
   case of a UNI, it is useful to illustrate the distribution of UNI
   functions between the Customer Edge (CE) side and the Provider Edge
   (PE) side of the UNI (the UNI-C and UNI-N).

Internet-Draft             MPLS-TP UNI and NNI             December 2010


   This document provides updated illustrations of the MPLS-TP UNI and
   MPLS-TP NNI to show these additional details.  These illustrations
   obsolete the corresponding ones in [RFC5921].  This document also
   defines additional terminology referenced in the illustrations.  No
   other updates are made by this document.

1.2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The terminology and abbreviations of [RFC5921] apply.

   The following additional terminology is used in this document.

   Term  Definition
   ----- ---------------------------------------------
   CP    Control Plane
   NNI   Network-to-Network Interface
   TSI   Transport Service Instance
   UNI   User-to-Network Interface
   UNI-C User-to-Network Interface, Customer Edge side
   UNI-N User-to-Network Interface, PE Side


2.  MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface

   The MPLS-TP User-Network Interface (UNI) is illustrated in Figure 1.
   This figure obsoletes Figure 3 of [RFC5921].  Note that the term
   MPLS-TP UNI is to be interpreted as a UNI to an MPLS-TP network and
   does not refer to the protocol transiting the UNI.  The UNI for a
   particular client flow may involve signaling between the CE and PE.
   If signaling is used, it may traverse the same attachment circuit
   that supports the client flow.
