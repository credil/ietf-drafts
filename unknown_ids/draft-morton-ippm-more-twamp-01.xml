    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF is completing its work on TWAMP - the Two-Way Active
      Measurement Protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>, which
      is an extension to the One-way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP <xref
      target="RFC4656"></xref>. The TWAMP specification gathered wide review
      as it approached completion, and the by-products were several
      recommendations for new features in TWAMP. There are a growing number
      TWAMP implementations at present, and wide-spread usage is expected.
      There are even devices emerging that test implementations for protocol
      compliance.</t>

      <t>This memo describes additional features for TWAMP, such as the
      ability to use different security modes in the TWAMP-Control and
      TWAMP-Test protocols.</t>

      <t>The relationship between this memo and the TWAMP is intended to be an
      update to the TWAMP RFC when published.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is to specify additional functions and
      features for TWAMP <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>. The
      features and extensions were vetted before adoption in this memo.</t>

      <t>The scope of the memo is limited to specifications of the following
      features:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Extension of the modes of operation through assignment of new
          values in the Mode field (see section 3.1 of <xref
          target="RFC4656"></xref>), while retaining backward compatibility
          with TWAMP <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>
          implementations. These values add the ability to use different
          security modes in the TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test protocols. The
          motivation for this extension is to permit the low packet rate
          TWAMP-Control protocol to utilize a stronger mode of integrity
          protection than that used in the TWAMP-Test protocol.</t>
        </list>(other items may be added)</t>
    </section>

    <section title="TWAMP Control Extensions">
      <t>TWAMP-Control protocol is a derivative of the OWAMP-Control protocol,
      and provides two-way measurement capability. All TWAMP Control messages
      are similar in format and follow similar guidelines to those defined in
      section 3 of <xref target="RFC4656"></xref> with the exceptions
      described in TWAMP <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>, and in
      the following sections.</t>

      <t>All OWAMP-Control messages apply to TWAMP-Control, except for the
      Fetch Session command.</t>

      <section title="Extended Connection Setup">
        <t>TWAMP connection establishment follows the same procedure defined
        in section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>. The extended modes
        assign three new bit positions (and values) to allow the Test protocol
        security mode to differ from the Control protocol mode. With this
        extension, the complete set of TWAMP values are as follows:</t>

        <t>In the original OWAMP mode field, setting bit positions 0, 1 or 2
        indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test
        protocol inherited the same mode (see section 4 of <xref
        target="RFC4656"></xref>). In this extension to TWAMP, setting a
        higher mode field bit position (3, 4 or 5) SHALL discontinue the
        inheritance of the security mode in the Test protocol, and each
        protocol&rsquo;s mode SHALL be specified explicitly. When the desired
        TWAMP Test protocol mode is identical to the Control Session mode, the
        corresponding mode bit (position 0, 1 or 2) SHALL be set. The table
        below gives the various combinations that are now permissible in
        TWAMP, where the Test protocol may use one of the modes in each column
        corresponding to a Control mode.</t>

        <t>The value of the Modes field sent by the Server is the bit-wise OR
        of the mode values that it is willing to support during this session.
        Thus, the last six bits of the Modes 32-bit field are used. The first
        26 bits MUST be zero. A client conforming to this version of the
        specification MUST ignore the values in the first 26 bits of the Modes
        value. (This way, the bits are available for future protocol
        extensions.)</t>

        <t>Other ways in which TWAMP extends OWAMP are described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Extended TWAMP Test ">
      <t>The TWAMP test protocol is similar to the OWAMP <xref
      target="RFC4656"></xref> test protocol with the exception that the
      Session-Reflector transmits test packets to the Session-Sender in
      response to each test packet it receives. TWAMP <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref> defines two different test packet
      formats, one for packets transmitted by the Session-Sender and one for
      packets transmitted by the Session-Reflector. As with OWAMP-Test
      protocol there are three security modes: unauthenticated, authenticated,
      and encrypted. The extension to TWAMP makes it possible to specify these
      modes independently from the mode used in the TWAMP-Control
      protocol.</t>

      <section title="Sender Behavior">
        <t>This section describes extensions to the behavior of the TWAMP
        Sender.</t>

        <section title="Packet Timings">
          <t>The Send Schedule is not utilized in TWAMP, and there are no
          extensions defined in this memo.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Packet Format and Content">
          <t>The Session Sender packet format and content follow the same
          procedure and guidelines as defined in section 4.1.2 of <xref
          target="RFC4656"></xref>, with the following exceptions: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>the Send Schedule is not used, and</t>

              <t>the support of additional security mode combinations defined
              in section 3.1 of this memo.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Reflector Behavior">
        <t>The TWAMP Reflector follows the procedures and guidelines in
        section 4.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>, with the
        following extensions:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>the support of additional security mode combinations defined in
            section 3.1 of this memo.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>These extended modes of operation permit stronger integrity
      protection on the TWAMP-Control protocol while simultaneously
      emphasizing accuracy or efficiency on the TWAMP-Test protocol, thus
      enhancing overall security when compared to the previous options.</t>

      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live networks are relevant here as well. See <xref
      target="RFC4656"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This memo adds three security mode combinations to the OWAMP-Control
      specification<xref target="RFC4656"> </xref>, and describes behavior
      when the new modes are used. This memo requests creation an IANA
      registry for the TWAMP Mode field. This field is a recognized extension
      mechanism for TWAMP.</t>

      <section title="Registry Specification">
        <t>IANA is requested to create a TWAMP-Modes registry. TWAMP-Modes are
        specified in TWAMP Server Greeting messages and Set-up Response
        messages consistent with section 3.1 of <xref
        target="RFC4656"></xref>, and extended by this memo. Modes are
        indicated by setting bits in the 32-bit Modes field. Thus, this
        registry can contain a total of 32 possible values.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Registry Management">
        <t>Because the Modes registry can contain only thirty-two values, and
        because TWAMP is an IETF protocol, this registry must be updated only
        by "IETF Consensus" as specified in <xref target="RFC2434"></xref>(an
        RFC documenting registry use that is approved by the IESG). For the
        Modes registry, we expect that new features will be assigned using
        monotonically increasing bit positions and in the range [0-31] and the
        corresponding values, unless there is a good reason to do
        otherwise.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Experimental Numbers">
        <t>No experimental values are currently assigned for the Modes
        Registry.</t>
