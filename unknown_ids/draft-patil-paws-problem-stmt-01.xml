       Governments around the world continue to search for new pieces
       of radio spectrum which can be used by the expanding wireless
       communications industry to provide more services in the usable spectrum. 
       The concept of allowing secondary 
       transmissions (licensed or unlicensed) in frequencies occupied by a primary 
       user is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new
       use. An obvious requirement is that these secondary transmissions do not interfere with the primary use of the spectrum. One interesting observation is that often, in a given physical location, the primary user(s) may not be using the entire band allocated to them.  The available spectrum for a secondary use would then depend on the location of the secondary user.  The fundamental issue is how to
       determine for a specific location and specific time, if any of the primary spectrum is available for secondary use. Academia and Industry have studied multiple
       cognitive radio mechanisms for use in such a scenario. One simple mechanism is to use a geospatial database that records the primary users occupation, and require the secondary users to check the database prior to selecting what part of the spectrum they use.  Such databases could be available on the Internet for query by secondary users. This document discusses the requirements and
       the problems that need to be addressed for enabling the use of
       white space spectrum by obtaining information from such a database.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Spectrum useable for data communications, especially wireless Internet communications, is scarce. One area which has received much attention globally is
	the TV white space: portions of the TV band that are not used
	by broadcasters in a given area. In 2008 the United States regulator took beginning steps when
	they published their first ruling on use of TV white space,
	and then followed up with a final ruling in
	2010<xref target="FCC ruling"/>. Finland
	passed an Act in 2009 enabling testing of cognitive radio
	systems in the TV white space. The ECC has completed Report
	159 <xref target="ECC Report 159"/>
	containing requirements for operation of cognitive radio systems
	in the TV white space.  Ofcom published in 2004 their Spectrum
	Framework Review <xref target="Spectrum Framework Review" />
	and their Digital Dividend Review <xref target="DDR"/> in 2005, 
	and have followed up with a proposal to access TV white
	space.  More countries are expected to provide access to their TV spectrum in similar ways.  Any entity holding spectrum that is not densely used may be asked to give it up in one way or another for more intensive use.  Providing a mechanism by which secondary users share the spectrum with the primary user is attractive in many bands in many countries. 
	</t>
      <t>
	The concept of allowing secondary transmissions
	in frequencies occupied by a primary user is a
	technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use. An
	obvious requirement is that these secondary 
	transmissions do not interfere with the primary 
	use of the spectrum. The fundamental issue is how to determine
	for a specific location and specific time if of the spectrum
	are available for secondary use. There are two dimensions of use that may be interesting: space (the area in which a secondary user would not interfere with a primary user, and time: when the secondary use would not interfere with the primary use. In this discussion, we consider the time element to be relatively long term (hours in a day) rather than short term (fractions of a second).  Location in this discussion is geolocation: where the transmitters (and sometimes receivers) are located relative to one another.  In operation, the database records the existing user's transmitter (and some times receiver) locations along with basic transmission characteristics such as antenna height, and sometimes power.  Using rules established by the regulator, the database calculates an exclusion zone for each authorized primary user, and attaches a time schedule to that use.  The secondary user queries the database with it location.  The database intersects the exclusion zones with the querier location, and returns the portion of the spectrum not in any exclusion zone.  Such methods of geospatial database query to avoid interference have been shown to achieve favorable results, and are
	thus the basis for rulings by the FCC and reports from ECC and
	Ofcom. In any country, the rules for which primary entities are entitled to protection, how the exclusion zones are calculated, and what the limits of use by secondary entities are may vary.  However, the fundamental notion of recording primary users, calculating exclusion zones, querying by location and returning available spectrum (and the schedule for that spectrum) are common.
	</t>
      <t>
	In a typical implementation of geolocation and database to
	access TV white space, a radio is configured with its
	location in latitude and longitude. There are multiple ways to
	configure this location information, e.g. programmed at
	installation (e.g. for a fixed device) or determined by GPS
	(e.g. for a or mobile device). At power-on, before the device
	can transmit in TV white space frequencies, the device must
	contact a database, provide its geolocation and receive in
	return a list of unoccupied or "white space" spectrum (for example, in a TV White space implementation, the list of available channels at that location). The
	device can then select one of the channels from the list (note
	that it is possible they list is empty; there are no
	unoccupied channels at the location of the device) and then
	begins to transmit and receive on the selected channel. The
	device must query the database again for a list of unoccupied
	channels based on certain conditions, e.g. a fixed amount of
	time has passed, the device has changed location beyond a
	specified threshold. The basic scenario is that before
	transmitting in TV white space, the device must get permission
	from the database.
      </t>
      <t>This arrangement assumes that the device querying can complete a query before it transmits, or some other entity is able to query the database.  A common arrangement for this kind of service is a fixed tower with a wired infrastructure that provides Internet service to a network of client devices.  In this scenario, the tower has Internet access from its upstream service, and can query the database for channels within the tower service area.  It can then provide beacon service to its clients, and assign them channels within the list of channels that the tower gets from the database.</t>
<t>Another arrangement might be an ad-hoc mobile network where one or more members of the ad hoc network have an independent radio IP connection (perhaps a commercial cellular wireless data network) which can be used to query the database over the Internet.</t>
<t>A third possibility is a mechanism where the database is accessed on a private IP network.</t>
      <t>
	The low frequencies of the TV bands have good propagation
	characteristics. At these low frequencies, a radio signal will
	travel ~3 times further than traditional WLAN at 2.5 GHz,
	assuming the same transmit power. Because of these
	characteristics and new cognitive radio techniques, when TV
	white space becomes available, this will enable new use cases
	and new business opportunities. Not only is the capacity of
	new spectrum needed, but this propagation trait by itself
	makes TV white space attractive for providing broadband wireless access in rural,
	sparsely populated areas, as well as for extended range home
	hot-spot coverage (similar to WLAN today, but with improved
	coverage). In addition to propagation characteristics, the
	geolocation database may provide new capabilities for devices
	that use TV white space. When a device using TV white space
	registers its location in the database, this simple act makes
	the location of the device available for location based
	services.
      </t><t>
Other spectrum that might also be available for sharing using white space techniques exist in every country.  A great many primary users were allocated space a time when there were many fewer potential users of the space, and the primary users are not making efficient (in geospatial and time aspects) use of the space.  In the past, relocating existing primary users was the only feasible alternative.  Using white space techniques to share spectrum without imposing burdens on the primary users is more attractive.</t>
      <t>
	This document discusses the requirements for accessing a
	database on the Internet or a private IP network to obtain information that enables a device to
	operate/use the available spectrum at a given location. It
	also identifies various issues that need to be addressed by
	the protocol between the device and database.

      <section title="The concept of Cognitive Radio">
	<t>
	  A cognitive radio uses knowledge of the local radio
	  environment to dynamically adapt its own configuration and
	  function properly in a changing radio environment. Knowledge
	  of the local radio environment can come from various
	  technology mechanisms including sensing (attempting to ascertain primary users by listening for them within the spectrum), location determination and
	  internet connectivity to a database to learn the details of
	  the local radio environment.  TV White Space is one implementation of cognitive
	  radio. Because a cognitive radio adapts itself to the
	  available spectrum in a manner that prevents the creation of
	  harmful interference, the spectrum can be shared among
	  different radio users.

    <section title="Background information on white space in US">
     <t>
       Television transmission in the United States has moved to the
       use of digital signals as of June 12, 2009. Since June 13,
       2009, all full-power U.S. television stations have broadcast
       over-the-air signals in digital only. An important benefit of
       the switch to all-digital broadcasting is that it freed up
       parts of the valuable broadcast spectrum. More information
       about the switch to digital transmission is at :
       <xref target="DTV" />.
       </t>
     <t>
       With the switch to digital transmission for TV, the guard bands
       that existed to protect the signals between stations can now be
       used for other purposes. The FCC has made this spectrum
       available for unlicensed use and this is generally referred to
       as white space. Please see the details of the FCC ruling and
       regulations in <xref target="FCC ruling" />. The spectrum can
       be used to provide wireless broadband as an example. The term
       "Super-Wifi" is also used to describe this spectrum and
       potential for providing wifi type of service. 
     </t>
     </section>
     <section title = "Air Interfaces">
       <t>Efforts are ongoing to specify air-interfaces for use in white
       space spectrum. IEEEs 802.11af task group is currently working
       on one such specification. IEEE 802.22 is another
       example. Other air interfaces could be specified in the future
       such as LTE. 
       </t>

    </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Problem Statement">
	<t>
	  The use of white space spectrum is enabled via the
	  capability of a device to query a database and obtain
	  information about the availability of spectrum for
	  use at a given location. The databases are reachable via the
	  Internet and the devices querying these databases are expected
	  to have some form of Internet connectivity, directly or indirectly. The databases
	  may be country specific since the available spectrum and
	  regulations may vary, but the fundamental operation of the protocol should be country independent.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    An example high-level architecture of the devices and
	    white space databases is shown in the figure below:

      </t>								      

	  <t>
	    In the figure above, note that there could be multiple
	    databases serving white space devices. The databases are
	    country specific since the regulations and available
	    spectrum may vary. In some countries, for example, the U.S., the regulator has determined that multiple, competing databases may provide service to White Space Devices.
	    </t>
	  <t>
	    A messaging interface between the white space devices and
	    the database is required for operating a network using the
	    white space spectrum. The following sections discuss
	    various aspects of such an interface and the need for a
	    standard. Other aspects of a solution including provisioning the database, and calculating protected contours are considered out of scope of the initial effort, as there are significant differences between countries and spectrum bands.
	  </t>

	  <section title="Global applicability">
	    <t>
	      The use of TV white space spectrum is currently approved
	      by the FCC in the United States. However 
	      regulatory bodies in other countries are also
	      considering similar use of available spectrum. The
	      principles of cognitive radio usage for such spectrum is
	      generally the same. Some of the regulatory details 
	      may vary on a country specific basis. However the need for
	      devices that intend to use the spectrum to communicate
	      with a database remains a common feature.  The database provides a known, specifiable Protection Contour for the primary user, not dependent on the characteristics of the White Space Device or it's ability to sense the primary use.  It also provides a way to specify a schedule of use, because some primary users (for example, wireless microphones) only operate in limited time slots.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Devices need to be able to query a database, directly or indirectly over the public Internet and/or private IP networks prior to operating in
	      available spectrum. Information about available
	      spectrum, schedule, power, etc. are provided by the
	      database as a response to the query from a device. 
	      The messaging interface needs to be:
	    </t>
	    <t>
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>Radio/air interface agnostic - The radio/air
	      interface technology used by the white space device in
	      available spectrum can be 802.11af, 802.16, 802.22, LTE
	      etc. However the messaging interface between the white
	      space device and the database should be agnostic to the
	      air interface while being cognizant of the
	      characteristics of various air-interface technologies
	      and the need to include relevant attributes in the query
	      to the database.
	      </t>
              <t>Spectrum agnostic - the spectrum used by primary and secondary users varies by country.  Some spectrum has an explicit notion of a "channel" a defined swath of spectrum within a band that has some assigned identifier.  Other spectrum bands may be subject to white space sharing, but only have actual frequency low/high parameters to define protected entity use.  The protocol should be able to be used in any spectrum band where white space sharing is permitted.</t>
	      <t>Globally applicable - A common messaging interface
	      between white space devices and databases will enable
	      the use of such spectrum for various purposes on a
	      global basis. Devices can operate in any country where
	      such spectrum is available and a common interface
	      ensures uniformity in implementations and deployment.  Since the White Space device must know it's geospatial location to do a query, it is possible to determine which database, and which rules, are applicable, even though they are country specific.
	      </t>
	      <t>Address regulatory requirements - Each country will
	      likely have regulations that are unique to that
	      country. The messaging interface needs to be flexible to
	      accommodate the specific needs of a regulatory body in
	      the country where the white space device is operating
	      and connecting to the relevant database.
	      </t>
	    </list>
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Database discovery">
	    <t>
	      Another aspect of the problem space is the need to
	      discover the database. A white space device needs to
	      find the relevant database to query based on its current
	      location or for another location. Since the spectrum and
	      databases are country specific, the device will need to
	      discover the relevant database. The device needs to
	      obtain the IP address of the specific database to which
	      it can send queries in addition to registering itself
	      for operation and using the available spectrum.  
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      A database discovery mechanism needs to be
	      specified. Reuse of existing mechanisms is an option and
	      could be adapted for meeting the specific needs of
	      cognitive radio technology. 
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Data model definition">
	    <t>
	      The contents of the queries and response need to be
	      specified. A data model is required which enables the
	      white space device to query the database while including
	      all the relevant information such as geolocation, radio
	      technology, power characteristics, etc which may be country and spectrum dependent. All databases
	      are able to interpret the data model and respond to the
	      queries using the same data model that is understood by
	      all devices. 
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Use of XML for specifying a data model is an attractive
	      option. The intent is to evaluate the best option that
	      meets the need for use between white space devices and databases.
	    </t>
	    
	  </section>
          <section title="Protocol">
    <t>
     The protocol requirements are simple: registration and query transactions are needed.   In some circumstances, a registration transaction is required prior to being able to query.  The device provides some identifying information, and the database responds with an acknowledgement or error.  The query protocol is a simple query/response action (primarily location in, available spectrum out), with some error conditions.</t>
<t>It may be possible to use existing protocols (e.g. LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/>) or it may be more appropriate to define a new protocol for this purpose.  HTTP transport is probably appropriate.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	    <t>
	      The messaging interface between the white space device
	      and the database needs to be secured. Both the queries
	      and the responses need to be delivered securely. The device must be certain it is talking to a bona fide database authoritative for the location and spectrum band the device operates on.  The database may need to restrict interactions to devices that it has some prior relationship with, or may be restricted from providing service to devices that are not authorized in some manner.</t>
<t>As the device will query with it's location, the location must be protected against eavesdropping.  Some regulations include personally identifiable information as required elements of registration and/or query and must similarly be protected.</t>
<t>All communications between the device and the database will require integrity protection.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Man-in-the-middle attacks could modify the content of a
	      response which can cause problems for other networks or
	      devices operating at a given location. Interference as

	      malicious information being delivered to a white space
	      device.
