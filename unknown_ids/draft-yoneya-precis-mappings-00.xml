      <t>
	Preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS")
	Framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/> is defining
	several classes of strings for preparation and comparison.  In the
	document, case mapping is defined because many of protocols handle 
	case sensitive or case insensitive string comparison and therefore
	preparation of string is mandatory.  As described in IDNA mapping 
	<xref target="RFC5895"/> and PRECIS problem statement 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement"/>, mappings in 
	internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width
	and/or delimiters are taken into consideration.  This document
	considers mappings other than case mapping in PRECIS context.
      </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is generated
	by input method editor ("IME") or copy-and-paste from free text.
	Usually users do not care case and/or width of input characters
	because they are identical for users' eyes.  Further, users rarely
	switch IME state to input special characters such as protocol
	elements.  For Internationalized Domain Names ("IDNs"), IDNA Mapping
	<xref target="RFC5895"/> describes methods to treat these issues. 
	For PRECIS strings, case mapping is defined as a process in PRECIS
	Framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/>, but width
	mapping and/or delimiter mapping are not defined.  Handling of
	mappings other than case is also important to increase chance of
	strings match as users expect.  This document considers such
	mappings in PRECIS context.
      </t>

    <section title="Type of mappings">
      <section title="Width mapping">
        <t>
	  Fullwidth and halfwidth characters (those defined with
	  Decomposition Types &lt;wide&gt; and &lt;narrow&gt;) are mapped to
	  their decomposition mappings as shown in the Unicode character
	  database <xref target="Unicode"/>.  This mapping should be
	  performed before case mapping because fullwidth/halfwidth
	  characters includes both upper case and lower case letters.
        </t>
        <t>
	  Width mapping will increase backward compatibility with Stringprep
	  <xref target="RFC3454"/> and PRECIS Framework 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/>.  Because in a
	  Stringprep profile which specifies Unicode normalization form KC
	  (NFKC) for normalization method, fullwidth/halfwidth characters
	  are mapped into its compatible form.  If a PRECIS Framework
	  profile specified NFKC (which is not recommended), width mapping
	  might not be useful.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Delimiter mapping">
        <t>
	  Definitions of delimiters in certain protocols are differ from
	  each other.  Therefore, delimiter mapping should be based on
	  well defined mapping table for each protocols.  This mapping
	  should be performed after width mapping because some punctuations
	  have fullwidth form.
        </t>
	<t>
	  One of the most useful case of delimiter mapping is when FULL STOP
	  character (U+002E) is a delimiter as well as domain name.  Some of
	  IME generates FULL STOP compatible characters such as IDEOGRAPHIC
	  FULL STOP (U+3002) when users type FULL STOP on the keyboard.
	</t>

    <section title="Discussion">
      <t>
	There are several points for discussion on this topic.
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	    Whether mappings other than case are targets of PRECIS or not?
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    If they are target, are they a part of PRECIS Framework 
	    <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/> or separate ones 
	    like IDNA Mapping <xref target="RFC5895"/>?
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Are there another mappings not described in this document?  For
	    example, migration from Stringprep <xref target="RFC3454"/> to
	    PRECIS Framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/>
	    needs some special treatment?
