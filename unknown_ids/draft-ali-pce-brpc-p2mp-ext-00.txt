   1. Introduction 

      The ability to compute constrained Traffic Engineering Label 
      Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs 
      in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS 
      (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where a domain is 
      a collection of network elements within a common sphere of 
      address management or path computational responsibility such 
      as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems) has been identified 
      as a key requirement [PCEP-P2MP-REQ]. [P2P-BRPC] specifies a 
      procedure for inter-domain shortest constrained paths 
      computation for point-to-point (P2P) LSPs, using backward 
      recursive path computation (BRPC) technique. This draft 
      extends the technique specified in [P2P-BRPC] for P2MP LSP 
      path computation. Just like [P2P-BRPC], its P2MP-TE 
      extension preserves confidentiality across domains, which is 
      sometimes required when domains are managed by different 
      Service Providers. 
       
      A P2MP tree is a graphical representation of all TE links 
      that are committed for a particular P2MP LSP. In other 
      words, a P2MP tree is a representation of the corresponding 
      tunnel on the TE network topology. A sub-tree is a part of 
      the P2MP tree describing how the root or an intermediate 
      P2MP LSPs minimizes packet duplication when P2P TE sub-LSPs 
      traverse common links. The computation of a P2MP tree 
      requires three major pieces of information. The first is the 
      path from the ingress LSR of a P2MP LSP to each of the 
      egress LSRs, the second is the traffic engineering related 
      parameters, and the third is the branch capability 
      information. 

      Generally, inter-domain P2MP tree (i.e. whose source and 
      destinations of the P2MP LSP reside in a multiple different 
      domains) is particularly difficult to compute even for a 
      distributed PCE architecture. For instance, while the BRPC 
      recursive path computation may be well-suited for P2P paths, 
      P2MP path computation involves multiple branching path 
      segments from the source to the multiple destinations. As 
      such, inter-domain P2MP path computation may result in a 
      plurality of per-domain path options that may be difficult 
      to coordinate efficiently and effectively between domains. 
      That is, when one or more domains have a multiple ingress 
      and/or egress border nodes, there is currently no known 
      technique for one domain to determine which border routers 
      another domain will utilize for the inter-domain P2MP tree, 

                       Expires September 2009            [Page 3] 
   Internet-Draft      draft-ali-pce-brpc-p2mp-ext-00.txt 

      and to limit the computation of the P2MP tree to those 
      utilized border nodes.  

      A trivial solution to computation of inter-domain P2MP tree 
      would be to compute shortest inter-domain P2P paths from 
      source to each destination and then combine them to generate 
      an inter-domain Steiner P2MP tree. This, however, may 
      require replication of incoming packets to all the P2P LSPs 
      at the ingress PE to accommodate multipoint communication. 
      Obviously, this solution is very inefficient for a couple of 
      reasons. First, it places more replication burden on the 
      ingress PE and hence has poor scaling characteristics, and 
      second it does not make use of bandwidth sharing when one or 
      more S2L LSPs share links along their paths, hence wasting 
      bandwidth resources, memory and MPLS label space in the 
      network. 

      Apart from path computation difficulties faced due to the 
      inter-domain topology visibility issues, the computation of 
      the minimum P2MP Steiner tree, i.e. one which guarantees the 
      least cost resulting tree, is an NP-complete problem. 
      Moreover, adding and/or removing a single destination 
      to/from the tree may result in an entirely different tree. 
      In this case, the frequent Steiner tree computation process 
      may prove computationally intensive, and the resulting 
      frequent tunnel reconfiguration may even cause network 
      destabilization. There are several heuristic algorithms 
      presented in the literature that approximate the result 
      within polynomial time that are applicable within the 
      context of a single-domain. This draft extends the technique 
      specified in [P2P-BRPC] for P2MP LSP path computation in an 
      inter-domain environment using PCE [RFC4655].

    3. General Assumptions 

      This document makes the same assumptions as outlined in 
      [P2P-BRPC] and will not be repeated here.  
    
   4. Extension to BRPC Procedure for Path Computation for P2MP 
      LSP 

   This section describes the extension to BRPC procedure defined 
   in [P2P-BRPC]. It also details procedure on how extended BRPC 
   can be used for path computation of a P2MP LSP.  
    
   4.1. Definition of X-VSPT(i) 

      Definition of X-VSPT(i) is similar to definition of VSPT(i) 
      in [P2P-BRPC], with a few exceptions outlined in the 
      following.  
       
      In the case of computation of VSPT(i), PCE(i) only considers 
      the entry BNs of domain(i). That is only the BNs that 
      provide connectivity from domain(i-1). This works well in 
      P2P case as there is only one destination and there is no 
      added value in knowing connectivity from BNs that do not

   Internet-Draft      draft-ali-pce-brpc-p2mp-ext-00.txt 

      provide connectivity from domain(i-1). However, for the case 
      of P2MP tree path computation, and since there is usually 
      more than one destination per P2MP LSP (some residing in 
      different destination domains) knowing the connectivity from 
      BNs that are not connected with domain(i-1) is useful. 
      Specifically, it improves the ability of the ingress PCE to 
      compute lower cost P2MP trees by favoring paths for new 
      destination that branch off existing sub-tree as opposed to 
      shortest end-to-end P2P path from source to destination. The 
      set of BN-ex of domain remains the same as defined in [P2P-
      BRPC].  
       
      X-VSPT(i) is defined as follows-  
    
      In each domain (i), 
       
         o  There is a set of X-en(i) all entry BNs, such that BN-
      en(k,i) is the kth entry BN of domain(i). 
       
         o  There is a set of Y-ex(i) exit BNs, such that BN-
      ex(k,i) is the kth exit BN of domain(i). 
    
      VSPT(i), as defined in [P2P-BRPC], for P2P LSP is a tree 
      that provides a list of shortest paths from BN-en(1,i), BN-
      en(2,i), ... BN-en(j,i) to destination such that j <= [X-
      en(i)], where [X-en(i)] is the number of entry BNs in 
      domain(i).   
      The X-VSPT(i), in addition to VSPT(i), includes shortest 
      paths from the BN-en(k,i) to all BN-ex(i), such that k is 
      the BN that is along the shortest path to destination, and 
      BN-ex(i) is an exit BN in domain (i). Nonetheless, the X-
      VSPT(i) may exclude some BN-ex(i) according to policy 
      constraints (either due to local policy or policies signaled 
      in the path computation request). Also, when more than one 
      BN-ex(i) connect to the same neighboring domain (domain 
      (i+1)), the X-VSPT(i) only includes the BN-ex along the 
      least cost path to domain (i+1). In the presence of inter-AS 
      link, the X-VSPT includes the path of the inter-AS TE links 
      connecting domain(i) to domain(i+1). 
       
      For destination domain, the X-VSPT(i) includes shortest 
      paths from the destination node to the set of BN-ex nodes. 
    
   4.2. Definition of X-VSPT(i, d) 

      X-VSPT(i, d) is defined as X-VSPT at domain(i) to reach 
      destination d of a P2MP tree.  
    
   4.3. P2MP-BRPC procedure 

      In the following we outline steps of the P2MP-BRPC 
      procedure.  

                     Expires September 2009            [Page 6] 
   Internet-Draft      draft-ali-pce-brpc-p2mp-ext-00.txt 
  
      Given a set of destinations D = 1, 2, ... d, where |D| is 
      the total number of destinations in the P2MP LSP.  This 
      draft assumes that the ingress PCE, PCE(1), has a mechanism 
      to determine the set of PCEs (i.e. PCE-chain) to be 
      traversed for the computation of the inter-domain path on 
      per destination basis. The said mechanism is outside the 
      scope of this document.  
    
      Note, it is possible for the ingress PCE, PCE(1), to request 
      path computation for destinations sequentially (one-by-one), 
      or simultaneously (in-parallel). In the former case, the 
      computation burden in P2MP-BRPC can be further reduced. 
      PCE(1) can include the P2MP sub-tree(d-1), which includes X-
      VSPT(1, 1), X-VSPT(1, 2), ..., X-VSPT(1, d-1), i.e. that 
      for destinations up to (d-1), in the PCE request for 
      destination (d). By doing so, it is possible for PCE(n^d, d) 
      to immediately compute a best path for (d) by computing a 
      path from (d) to the closest branching node within the P2MP 
      sub-tree(d-1). However, in this version of the draft only 
      parallel requests for computation of XVSPT(n^d, d) for d = 
      1, 2, . . . D are considered.  
    
      Denote by PCE(n^d, d) the PCE in the destination domain(n) 
      of destination (d). A PCC discovers a PCE, PCE(1), that is 
      capable of serving its path computation request and forwards 
      to it the P2MP path computation request. 
    
      PCE(1) will then iteratively send P2MP path requests to all 
      destinations d = 1, 2, ... D, in the P2MP tree, as follows: 
    
      Start of iteration(d): 
       
         Step (1, d): PCE(1) sends a computation request for P2MP-
            BRPC to PCE(n^d, d).   
          
         Step (2, d): PCE(n^d, d) computes X-VSPT(n^d, d) by 
         including, in addition to VSPT(i), constraints shortest 
         paths from the destination node (d) to all exit BNs BN-
         ex(i), as described earlier. When multiple BN-ex(n^d) 
         connect to the same neighboring domain (domain (n^d +1)), 
         the X-VSPT(n^d) only includes the BN-ex along the least 
         cost path to domain (n^d +1). In the presence of inter-AS 
         link, the X-VSPT includes the path of the inter-AS TE 
         links connecting domain(n^d) to domain(n^d+1). 
          
         Step (3, d): X-VSPT(n^d) is forwarded to PCE((n-1)^d,d). 
         According to [P2P-BRPC], PCE((n-1)^d) computes VSPT((n-
         1)^d) by finding constrained shortest paths from all BN-
         en((n-1)^d) to the destination (d) using VSPT((n)^d). 
         When this step is completed, only a sub-set of BN-
         en((n)^d) are selected. At this point, PCE((n-1)^d,d) can 
         prune those BN-en that were not considered in computation 

                      Expires September 2009            [Page 7] 
   Internet-Draft      draft-ali-pce-brpc-p2mp-ext-00.txt 
 
         of VSPT((n-1)^d), and the respective X-VSPT((n)^d) 
         branches attached to them. 
          
         PCE((n-1)^d,d) appends to VSPT((n-1)^d) the X-VSPT((n-
         1)^d) by by finding constrained shortest paths from all 
         BN-en((n-1)^d) to all other BN-ex((n-1)^d). When multiple 
         BN-ex((n-1)^d) connect to the same neighboring domain, 
         the X-VSPT((n-1)^d) only includes the BN-ex along the 
         least cost path to that domain. 
       
         Step(i,d): the previous procedure is repeated PCE(i^d,d) 
         where i= n-1 ... 2. 
       
      End of iteration 
       
      When PCE(1) receives replies with X-VSPTs(2,d) for all 
      destinations, it forms a virtual graph composed of the 
      source node, BNs included in the X-VSPTs, and the 
      destinations. PCE(1) can then use a suitable heuristic to 
      compute a feasible P2MP tree. 
       
      Note, an X-VSPT(i, d) tree may be returned in the form of an   
      explicit path (in which case all the hops along the path 
      segment are listed) or a loose path (in which case only the 
      BN is specified) so as to preserve confidentiality along 
      with the respective cost. In the later case, various 
      techniques can be used in order to retrieve the computed 
      explicit paths on a per domain basis during the signaling 
      process thanks to the use of path keys as described in [I-
      D.ietf-pce-path-key].

   5.  PCEP Protocol Extensions 
    
         The X-BRPC procedure proposed in this document requires 
      the specification of a new flag of the RP object carried 
      within the PCReq message (defined in [PCEP]), as follows 
       
         X-VSPT Flag 
         Bit Number      Name Flag 
           TBD            X-VSPT 
       
         When set, the VSPT Flag indicates that the PCC requests 
      the computation of an inter-domain P2MP-TE TE LSP using the

         defined in this document. 
    
   5. VSPT Encoding 

      Similar to the VSPT, the X-VSPT can be returned within a 
      PCRep message.  The encoding may consist of non-ordered 
      lists of EROs where each ERO represents a path segment from 
      a entry BN to the exit BNs, or from destination to an exit 
      BN as described earlier in Section 4.3.  

      Encoding using SERO is to be considered in the later version 
      of this document. 

   6. IANA Considerations 

      A new flag of the RP object (specified in [PCEP]) is defined in 
      this document.
