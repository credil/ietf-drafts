   Using PCP To Coordinate Between the CGN and Home Gateway Via Port

Abstract

   Consider a situation where a subscriber's packets are subject to two
   levels of NAT, with both NATs operating under the control of the ISP.
   An example of this would be a NATing Home Gateway forwarding packets
   to a Large Scale NAT.  This memo proposes that advantage be taken of
   the presence of the second NAT, to offload the burden on the Large
   Scale NAT by delegation to the Home Gateway.  Enhancements to the
   Port Control Protocol are specified to achieve this.

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation       March 2011


1.  Application Scenario

   A Large Scale NAT (LSN) is responsible for translating source
   addresses and ports for packets passing into and out of the provider
   network.  Especially for large scale service providers, one LSN may
   need to support at least tens of thousands of customers, resulting in
   heavy processing requirements for the LSN.

   In some broadband scenarios an additional NAT is present at the edge
   of the customer network.  For convenience we will call this the Home
   Gateway.  The load on the LSN could be reduced if address and port
   translation were actually done at the Home Gateway.  Achieving such
   an outcome would require coordination between the two devices.  This
   memo makes a detailed proposal for the required coordination
   mechanism.


2.  Proposed Solution

2.1.  Delegation of Port Ranges

   The basic proposal made in this memo is to provide the means for the
   Home Gateway to request that the LSN delegate to it a set of ports
   and optionally an external address that will be associated with those
   ports.  It is proposed to use the Port Control Protocol (PCP)
   [ID.port-control-protocol] to achieve this.  The procedure is
   illustrated in Figure 1.

      The LSN allocation of port sets MAY take into account the advice
      given in [ID.behave-natx4-log-reduction].

      [Open Issue: if we want to make the port sets discontinuous, we
      must either allow negotiation of the algorithm or parameters of
      that algorithm for determining the complete set from a given
      starting point, or specify it here.  Specifying it all here is
      probably counter-productive, given that this is a security measure
      to make port guessing harder.]

                 Figure 1: Acquiring a Delegated Port Set

   If the Home Gateway allocates all of the ports that have been
   delegated to it for a given protocol, it MAY send a request to the
   LSN for another delegated set of ports.  If the LSN satisfies that
   request, the Home Gateway MUST release the additional set as soon as
   possible.  To achieve this, the Home Gateway May follow a policy for
   allocation of additional ports to flows, that has the same effect as
   searching for "free" ports in the port sets in the order in which
   they were delegated to the Home Gateway.  A port SHOULD be considered
   "free" if no traffic has been observed through it for the timeout
   interval specified for the protocol concerned, as discussed in
   [ID.behave-natx4-log-reduction], or if the Home Gateway knows through
   other means (e.g., host reboot) that it is no longer in use.

2.2.  Packet Processing At the Home Gateway and LSN

   The Home Gateway maps outgoing flows to the delegated ports.  If an
   external address was received it uses that for the source address;
   otherwise it retains the private address of the Home Gateway as the
   source address.

      The procedures are more complicated, of course, if the IP version
      running externally to the LSN is different from the IP version
      running between the Home Gateway and the LSN, since the
      destination address also has to be translated.  The details depend
      on the particular transition mechanism in use, and are left as an
      exercise for the reader.

   If the private address is retained, the LSN recognizes it from the
   original delegation request and changes the source address but not
   the port before forwarding the packet.  If the external public
   address was used, the LSN is not useful and another device may be
   needed to allocate the port range.

   In the reverse direction, the LSN recognizes the public destination
   address and port of an incoming packet as belonging to a delegated
   set for the Home Gateway.  It translates the destination address, if
   necessary, leaving the destination port unchanged.  The Home Gateway
   translates the destination port and address to the corresponding
   values in the customer network and forwards the packet in turn.

2.3.  Proposed Enhancements To and Usage Of the Port Control Protocol

   This document proposes the following new option for PIN opcodes:
   PORT_SET_REQUESTED.

      option number: to be allocated

      is valid for OpCodes: PIN44, PIN64, PIN46, or PIN66

      is included in responses: MUST

      has length: 0 in requests, 4 in successful responses.  [As
      mentioned above, if non-consecutive sets of ports are allocated,
      we may want to add parameters of the algorithm for deriving the
      complete set from the initial value provided in the "assigned
      external port" field of the response.]

      may appear more than once: no

   When constructing a PIN request with the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option,
   the client MUST set the "internal port" field of the request to zero.
   If requesting a new set of delegated ports, the client MAY set the
   "requested external port" field to a non-zero value.  If releasing a
   set of delegated ports (i.e., by setting the "Requested lifetime"
   field to zero), the client MUST set the "requested external port"
   field to the value of the "assigned external port" field of the
   earlier response from the server.  The remaining fields of the PIN
   request MUST be set as directed by [ID.port-control-protocol]

   [Open issue: for a release, should the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option have
   the same contents as it had in the earlier response?]

   Upon receiving a PIN request with the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option, the
   server MAY reject it using return codes 151 - NOT_AUTHORIZED, or 152
   - USER_EX_QUOTA.  In this case, the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option in the
   response MUST have zero length (no data).  If the server chooses to
   honour the request, it MUST place the value of the first port in the
   assigned set in the "assigned external port" field of the response.
   It MUST set the length of the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option in the
   response to 4, and MUST provide the number of ports in the delegated
   set as the value of the option.

3.  Port Range Options

   The Port Range option is used to specify one range of ports
   (contiguous or not contiguous) pertaining to a given IP address.  The
   starting point of the ports and the number of delegated ports are
   used to infer a set of allowed port values.  This section provides
   only one method to request the port range values.  Other ways and
   Optcode can be proposed in later versions.

   These fields are described as below:

   o  Starting Port: A 16 bit value used as an input to the specified
      function.

   o  Number of delegated ports: A 16 bit value specifying the number of
      ports delegated to the client for use as source port values.

   o  The value "n" indicates that the port range is not contiguous.


4.  Security Considerations

   Will do later.  Trust issues between the client and server, plus the
   port randomization issues discussed in
   [ID.behave-natx4-log-reduction].


5.  IANA Considerations

   Will register the new option if this draft goes through as a
   standalone document rather than being incorporated into the base
   protocol.
