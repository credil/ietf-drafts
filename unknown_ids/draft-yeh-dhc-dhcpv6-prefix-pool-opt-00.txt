               Prefix Pool Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent
                draft-yeh-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-00

Abstract

   The Prefix Pool option provides an automatic mechanism for the
   information exchange between DHCPv6 server and DHCPv6 Relay Agent.
   The information about Prefix Pools maintained on DHCPv6 server can be
   transferred from server to relay agent through this DHCPv6 option to
   support the necessary route aggregation on the provide edge router,
   which has a huge number of routes pointing to the customer networks
   before the aggregation.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option           October 2010


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC3315] are deployed to relay messages between
   clients and servers when they are not on the same link, and are often
   implemented alongside a routing function in the provider edge (PE)
   routers [BBF WT-177].  Meanwhile, DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633]
   provides a mechanism for the automated delegation of IPv6 prefix to
   the customer network.

   In order to make the customer network to be reachable in the IPv6
   network, the PE routers always need to add or remove the route entry
   directing to each customer network in its routing table per the
   relay-forward or relay-reply message between DHCPv6 Server
   (Delegation Router) and Customer router (CPE, DHCPv6 Client, DHCPv6
   Requesting Router) when the PE router acts as DHCPv6 Relay Agent [BBF
   WT-177].

   When the routing protocol is enabled on the network-facing interface
   of the PE router, all the routes directing to the customer networks
   are supposed to advertise in the ISP core network.  This will make
   the number of entries in the routing table on the ISP core router to
   be an unacceptable huge one, so that it is necessary to aggregate the
   routes directing to the customer networks on the PE router.

   Because the prefixes of the customer networks can not guarantee
   always to be valid and continuous, the routing protocol on the PE
   router can not make one aggregation route automatically to cover all
   the prefixes delegated to the customer networks, which are associated
   to the same client-facing link of the PE.  On the other hand, the
   information of the prefix pools associated to each client-facing
   interface of PEs is always maintained on the DHCPv6 server.  When the
   PE router acts as the DHCPv6 Server, the aggregation route can be
   generated by this information directly, but when the PE router acts
   as the DHCPv6 Relay Agent, a new mechanism to transfer the
   information of the prefix pools from the server to the relay agent
   for each client-facing interface of the PE is requested.

   After the PE got the information of the prefix pools associated to
   its client-facing interfaces, the black-hole route entry pointing to
   each of these prefix pools can be added in the routing table of PE.
   When the routing protocol is enabled on PE's network-facing
   interface, the above black-hole route will be advertised to the whole
   ISP network as the aggregation route pointing to all of the customer
   networks attached on the same link of the PE's client-facing
   interface.

2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes new DHCPv6 options of prefix pool and the
   associated mechanism for the configuration on the Relay Agent.  This
   document should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv6 specification,
   RFC 3315 and RFC 3633, for a complete mechanism.  Definitions for
   terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this document are
   defined in RFC 3315, RFC 3633 and RFC 3769 [RFC3769].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   The Relay Agent who needs the information from the
   ServerGBP[not]shall includes Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to
   request Prefix Pool option from the Server, which contains the
   information about the prefix pool that will be configured on the
   associated client-facing interface of the Relay agent.  The Relay
   Agent may include this ORO in the relay-forward (12) message of
   SOLICIT (1), REQUEST (3), RENEW (5) or REBIND (6).

   The Relay Agent should includes Interface-ID Option
   (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) for the server to identify the associated
   interface on which the prefix pool is configured, if the Server would
   not like to use link-address specified in the DHCPv6 message
   encapsulation of relay-forward message to identify the interface of
   the link on which the client is located.

   The Relay Agent shall advertise the aggregation route based on the

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option           October 2010


   information of prefix pool when the routing protocol is enabled on
   its network-facing interface.


6.  Server Behavior

   The Server must include Prefix Pool option in the relay-reply (13)
   message of REPLY (7) after it receives the relay-forward message,
   which is included an associated ORO.

   The Server shall use the Interface-ID included by the Relay Agent to
   identify the client-facing interface of the Relay Agent on which the
   associated prefix pool is configured.

   When multiple Prefix Pools are associated to the same client-facing
   interface of the Relay Agent, the server must include multiple Prefix
   Pool options in the same relay-reply message.

   The Server shall include Prefix Pool option when it initiates the
   relay-reply message of RECONFIGURE (10).  The Status of 'Valid' for
   the Prefix Pool option can be used to set up the Prefix Pool on the
   Relay Agent; the Status of 'Released' for the Prefix Pool option can
   be used to release the configuration of the Prefix Pool on the Relay
   Agent.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of RFC
   3315.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to Option_Prefix_Pool from
   the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options" registry (http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml).
