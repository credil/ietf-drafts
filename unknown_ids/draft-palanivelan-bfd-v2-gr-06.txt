Abstract

   This document proposes an extension for Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) to support Graceful Restart, in complementing
   Graceful Restart support of the underlying protocol.This would work
   consistently, irrespective of the bfd mode or protocol or the type of
   restart and, most importantly, the vendors design and implementation.
   This document describes in detail the challenges to BFD in surviving 
   a graceful restart, and a generic solution to such challenges.

1  Introduction

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol [BFD] provides a
   mechanism for liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems.
   It is intended to provide low-overhead, short-duration detection of
   failures in the path between adjacent forwarding engines, including
   the interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible the
   forwarding engines themselves. It operates independently of media,
   data protocols, and routing protocols. An additional BFD goal is to
   provide a single mechanism that can be used for liveness detection
   over any media, at any protocol layer, with a wide range of detection
   times and overhead, to avoid a proliferation of different methods.

   Although Graceful Restart (GR) was considered for BFD, but - so as to
   keep the protocol simple - it was not included in the BFD standard.
   This document records the Graceful Restart discussions, and presents
   them as an extension to BFD.

   The extensions to BFD documented in this draft introduced in this
   draft would aid BFD in complementing the GR capabilities of protocols
   such as OSPF, and also in providing a consistent behavior for 
   planned/unplanned restarts irrespective of the underlying protocols.
   Further, these extensions would provide a solution that works for all
   types of BFD implementation.


2  Overview

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection [BFD] specification defines a
   protocol with simple and specific semantics. Its sole purpose is to
   verify liveliness of the connectivity between a pair of systems, for
   a particular data protocol across a path (which may be of any
   technology, length, or OSI layer). The promptness of the detection of
   a path failure can be controlled by trading off protocol overhead and
   system load with detection times.

   BFD is assumed to be working fine without a need for any GR support.
   However, BFD deployments show that the different types of
   implementations in the products and their inherent mechanisms lead to
   issues with BFD, especially in surviving GR. It is true that
   prioritizing BFD would make sure the other CPU intensive processes do
   not fail BFD, but this may not be possible as there may be other
   higher priority processing that can't be ignored. For example,
   perhaps the existing subscriber connections can't be given a lesser
   priority.

   The extensions introduced in this draft would aid BFD in
   complementing the GR capabilities of protocols such as OSPF and also

   provide a consistent behavior for planned/unplanned restarts for the
   underlying protocols.

3  Motivations 

   Though the existing drafts discuss BFD interactions with various
   applications with Graceful Restart and ways of implementing in
   serving successful GR, the RFCs have some exceptions and caveats
   applied. This draft discusses the issues in the following scenarios
   and provides a generic solution that would scale for future
   applications, and provides a solution that works for all types of BFD
   implementations.

   This section of the document discusses the following issues, that are
   commonly seen in BFD deployments:

   * Planned restart with control protocols

   * BFD co-existing with Broadband configurations      

   This document provides a solution for Graceful restart mechanism in
   general, for BFD.


3.1  Planned Restarts with control protocols

   The  BFD RFCs suggest administratively disabling BFD prior to the
   start of GR.  But, this works only for planned restarts and not for 
   unplanned restarts. This also does not work for a protocol such as
   IS-IS that cannot signal a planned restart.

   For a planned restart where a control protocol can signal before
   restarting, if a BFD session failure occurs during the restart, it is
   recommended in the existing document(s) that such a planned restart
   should not be aborted and the session failure should not result in a
   topology change being signaled in the control protocol. Control
   protocols that cannot signal a planned restart depend on the 
   recently restarted system to signal the Graceful Restart prior to the
   control protocol adjacency timeout.

   In most cases, whether the restart is planned or unplanned, it is
   likely that the BFD session will time out prior to the onset of
   Graceful Restart, causing a topology change to be signaled. This type
   of implementation could impact non-stop routing and non-stop
   forwarding support using GR-enabled protocols, and provides an
   opportunity to review the existing BFD implementations and propose
   improvements to them.

3.2  BFD Co-existing with Broadband configurations

   In a real-time scenario with Broadband configurations, it is
   highly likely that the BFD sessions do not survive a Graceful
   restart.  

   Assume a PE router that has active DHCP sessions with a large number
   of clients (say 16k). During a planned restart, it is likely that
   the DHCP clients request the server (restarting router) to renew
   client IP addresses.  When the router is restarting, these requests
   do not reach it.  But, when these requests reach the router when it
   has just come up, it will treat them at a high priority and respond
   to them.   When we have thousands of such requests to the restarting
   router,  the router will spend a major part of its first second of
   uptime in addressing them. In this scenario, a control protocol
   like OSPFv2 that has GR enabled [OSPF-GRACE], could withstand the
   restart for the specified restart interval (as it will be in
   seconds) and it is likely to survive the restart, maintaining its
   forwarding plane. 

   In the same scenario, if BFD is enabled for OSPFv2 for an
   unplanned restart, the (BFD) neighbor router will be expecting BFD
   control packets in a milliseconds interval; during the restart
   process it is likely to timeout,  also impacting the associated
   OSPFv2 adjacency and resulting in a significant loss of traffic. 

   The scenario will be the same for BFD with a protocol such as IS-IS
   [IS-IS-GRACE], where the problem is likely to be seen even for a 
   planned restart.


4. Extensions to BFD 

   This document introduces a new diag value to indicate that the
   neighbor is restarting and provisions to configure Graceful 
   Restart timers.

   The Generic BFD Control Packet Format shown below introduces two
   additional sections "My Restart Interval" and "Your Restart 
   Interval".

        4.1 Version (Vers)  

           The version of BFD defined by this draft, that has support   
           for GR configuration and a diag for neighbor restarting      
           state, has a value of 2.

        4.2  Diagnostic  (Diag)    

           A diagnostic code specifying the local system's reason for 
           the last change in session state. A new diag value 9 for  
           "Neighbor Restarting" is introduced in this document.

           Values are: 

                0 -- No Diagnostic

                1 -- Control Detection Time Expired

                2 -- Echo Function Failed

                3 -- Neighbor Signaled Session Down

                4 -- Forwarding Plane Reset 

                5 -- Path Down  

                6 -- Concatenated Path Down

            This field allows remote systems to determine the reason    
            that the previous session failed.

        4.3 My Restart Interval

           This is the restart interval, in microseconds, of the
           transmitting system advertised to the remote system. In the    
           case of a restart (of transmitting system), the remote   
           system is expected to keep the BFD session up for this       
           duration of time.  This field need to have a value greater   
           than the detection time.  A value of 0 indicates to the 
           remote system that this system has BFD-GR disabled.

        4.4 Your Restart Interval

           The restart interval,in microseconds, received from the
           corresponding remote system. In the case of a restart (of   
           remote system), the transmitting system is expected to keep  
           the BFD session up for this duration of time. This field     
           need to have a value greater than the detection time.



5. State Machine for BFD with GR Support 


   The BFD state machine is quite straightforward and explained in
   detail by [BFD]. The BFD RFC describes different states for BFD as: 
   Down, Init, Up, AdminDown.

   Each system communicates its session state in the State (Sta) field
   of the BFD Control packet, and that received state, in combination
   with the local session state, drives the state machine.

   Please refer [BFD] for state machine diagram and detailed
   explanations of the state transitions.

   The following diagram provides an overview of the state machine, for
   state transitions for BFD with GR support (where "Your Restart
   Interval" has a non-zero value greater than Detection time). This

INTERNET DRAFT     draft-palanivelan-bfd-v2-gr-06.txt      June 25, 2010

   document does not introduce any new state to BFD state machine.

   The "Your Restart Interval" must have a value greater than the
   detection time value.  If this value is zero or less than the
   detection time value, the state transitions should completely follow
   the BFD state machine as defined by [BFD].

   The notation on each arc represents the state of the remote system
   (as received in the State field in the BFD Control packet) or
   indicates the expiration of the Detection Timer.

   functionality in the network deployments. This is the ability of the
   system to switchover to the standby (Control plane, Data plane)
   during planned/unplanned restart of the system, thus ensuring that
   the traffic loss if any is minimal. The system architecture and the
   GR support of the routing protocols contribute to the success of such
   a design in live networks.

   When using a routing protocol that is GR enabled, a system that
   has support for high-availability will continue to forward traffic
   (with minimal loss) during a neighbor restart.

   When BFD is enabled on a routing protocol in such a setup,  it is
   expected to assist the process than disturb it.  With the current BFD
   implementations, the BFD sessions do not survive a restart 
   under different conditions. An Unplanned restart or a planned restart
   with a protocol such as IS-IS that cannot signal about restart,  are 
   some of the situations where the BFD configuration is likely to
   impact a high-availability situation.  Though there are certain 
   implementations adopted by various companies to make BFD survive
   restarts, there is no uniform method of achieving this; it is 
   likely to fail when interoperating with routers from other
   companies. This document proposes a standard way of achieving this
   objective.

   This document recommends the introduction of a new diag value (9 
   for "Neighbor restarting"), new version (2 for GR supported BFD)  and
   two additional sections to the BFD packet format.  This design is 
   expected to provide a capability to BFD in withstanding restart 
   scenarios, complementing the associated protocol.  This should 
   work consistently, irrespective of the BFD mode or protocol or 
   the type of restart.



6.1. Session Establishment and GR Timer exchange


   The BFD session establishment follows the procedures as described in
   [BFD]. If the technology described by this document were to be

   implemented,  the BFD control packets should have the following
   field(s) with the values given below:


   The Version field (Section 4.1) should have a value of 2,indicating
   the support for GR.


   A new section to the BFD control packet format,"My Restart
   Interval" (Section 4.3) need to have a non-zero value that is greater
   than the detection time.


   A new section to the BFD control packet format,"Your Restart
   Interval" (Section 4.4) need to have a non-zero value that is greater
   than the detection time.


   The "My Restart Interval" and "Your  Restart Interval" are used
   in exchanging the GR timers information between the systems.


   "My  Restart Interval" is the time interval in microseconds, that
   this system expects its remote system to wait for, before bringing
   down its BFD session with that system.  


   "Your Restart Interval" is the time interval in microseconds,
   specified by the remote system,  that it expects this system to 
   wait for, before bringing down its BFD session with the remote
   system.


   Once the packet exchanges are complete and the BFD sessions 
   are up, every BFD session will have information about the time 
   interval its remote system will wait during a Restart, and also the
   time interval this system has to wait when the remote system 
   restarts. The "My Restart Interval" and the "Your Restart Interval"
   values can be modified after the session is up, just like the
   other BFD parameters, and in this case the packet exchanges will
   sync up the restart interval times (My and Your) on both the sides
   appropriately.


   The exchange of GR Specific parameters during BFD session
   establishment is indicated in the diagram below. The diagram shows
   only part of control packets, for the purpose of clarity.

              |  BFD.YourRestartInterval = 0 }     |

              |  BFD.YourRestartInterval= AAAA }   |
              |                                    |

              |  {BFD.version = 2                  |
              |  BFD.MyRestartInterval  = AAAA     |
              |  BFD.YourRestartInterval= BBBB }   |
              |                                    | 

   
   The initial BFD packet exchange between local system and remote 
   system will have the exchanged values for the "My Restart Interval" 
   or 0.  The "Your Restart Interval" will reflect the value received
   in "My Restart Interval" from the corresponding remote system,  or
   be Zero if that value is not set (value of 0). 

   A value of Zero for "Your Restart Interval" means that the BFD GR
   is disabled at the remote end,  and similarly a value of Zero for
   "My Restart Interval" means that BFD GR is disabled at the
   transmitting system.


6.2. Remote Neighbor Restart and Recovery

   When the BFD neighbors have established their BFD sessions (with
   their BFD GR timer values exchanged as described above), the
   following set of operations take place when the remote neighbor
   attempts a graceful restart (for example, with a GR enabled routing
   protocol like OSPFv2/IS-IS tied with BFD).

   Once the packet exchanges are complete and the BFD sessions are up, 
   every BFD session will have information about the time interval 
   its remote system will wait during a Restart, and also the time 
   interval this system has to wait when the remote system restarts.

   For clarity, let us revisit the BFD timers and BFD detection time as
   described in [BFD].

   The Detection Time (the period of time without receiving BFD packets
   after which the session is determined to have failed) is not carried
   explicitly in the protocol.  Rather, it is calculated independently
 

A.Palanivelan              Expires Dec 27, 2010                [Page 11]

   in each direction by the receiving system based on the negotiated
   transmit interval and the detection multiplier.

   This means that a BFD control packet should be received from the
   remote neighbor within the detection time.  When the BFD control
   packet is not received from the remote neighbor within this time, the
   timer expiry should bring the BFD session state to down.

   In the case of Graceful Restart scenario, we may end up in a
   situation that the routing protocol (like OSPFv2) is in graceful
   restart mode with the remote neighbor restarting, and the system not
   receiving BFD control packets within the detection time, due to other
   CPU intensive processes in the system. The technology described by
   this document addresses this issue.

   
   When the set of systems had their BFD sessions established, with GR
   support as described in this document, when the remote neighbor
   restarts it will set the BFD diagnostics field to a value of 9
   (Neighbor Restarting) in the control packet to its neighbor (local
   system).

   
   When the local system receives BFD control packet with diag field set
   to 9, the local system will update its timer to the previously
   exchanged value of "Your Restart Interval". This effectively means
   that the local system should wait for a BFD control packet for "Your
   Restart Interval" instead of Detection time.  This will be the case
   as long as the diag field from the remote neighbor is 9.

   
   When the restart is complete and the remote neighbor recovers, the
   remote neighbor should set the Diagnostics field to a value of 0. The
   local system, on receiving BFD control packets with diag field set to
   0, understands that the restart process for remote neighbor is
   complete and hence will revert the timer back to detection time (by
   calculation) and then expect control packets from the neighbor within
   this detection time.

   
   If the remote neighbor does not recover in time to send a BFD control
   packet within the previously communicated "Your Restart Interval",
   the timer expiry should bring the session down.


   It is important to have a meaningful values for the "Your Restart
   Interval" and  "My Restart Interval" to complement the GR timers in
   the associated protocol.

7  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [BFD], [BFD-1HOP] apply to this
   document.


8  IANA Considerations

   At this time, no IANA action is requested.  However, if this
   technology were to be implemented, it would need two sections added
   to the BFD generic packet format namely "My Restart Interval" and
   "Your Restart Interval"  as described in Section 4 of this document.


   This document also defines a Diag value of 9 to be used to specify
   "Neighbor Restarting" in addition to the "BFD Diagnostic Codes" 
   defined by [BFD] and referred in Section4.2 of this document.If 
   this technology were to be implemented, the "BFD Diagnostic Codes"
   would need to be updated as:


             Value  BFD Diagnostic Code Name                         
             -----  ------------------------

               0 -- No Diagnostic

               1 -- Control Detection Time Expired

               2 -- Echo Function Failed

               3 -- Neighbor Signaled Session Down

               4 -- Forwarding Plane Reset 

               5 -- Path Down  

               6 -- Concatenated  Path  Down

               7 -- Administratively  Down

               8 -- Reverse Concatenated Path Down

               9 --  Neighbor  Restarting  

           10-31 -- Reserved for future use
