Internet-Draft               JSON Reference                November 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a JSON [RFC4627] structure for referencing
   a specific JSON value within a JSON document.  This provides a basis
   for transclusion in JSON: the use of a target resource as an
   effective substitute for the reference.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Syntax

   A JSON Reference is a JSON object containing a single member "$ref",
   whose value identifies another JSON value via a URI [RFC3986].
   Example:

   { "$ref": "http://example.com/example.json#/foo/bar" }


4.  Resolution

   Resolution of a JSON Reference object SHOULD yield the referenced
   JSON value.

   If the URI contained in the JSON Reference value is a relative URI,
   then the base URI resolution MUST be calculated according to
   [RFC3986], section 5.2.  Resolution is performed relative to the
   referring document.

   If a URI contains a fragment identifier, then the fragment should be
   resolved per the fragment resolution mechansim of the referrant
   document.  If the representation of the referrant document is JSON,
   then the fragment identifier SHOULD be interpreted as a [JSON
   Pointer].


5.  Media Type

   Documents that use JSON Reference SHOULD include a media type
   parameter: application/json; profile=http://json-schema.org/json-ref
   or refer to a schema that extends http://json-schema.org/json-ref.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft includes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   A JSON Reference is not guaranteed to resolve to a JSON value.
   Implementations of this specification should be aware of this and
   take appropriate precautions.
