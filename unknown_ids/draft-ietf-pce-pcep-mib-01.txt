Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   for modeling of Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs.

1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be
   used to manage Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] for communications between a Path 
   Computation Client(PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or
   between two PCEs.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is built on notions introduced
   and discussed in PCE WG documents.  The reader should be familiar
   with these documents.

   Domain:
      any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.

   IGP Area:
      OSPF Area or ISIS level.

   This document also uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655]
   and [RFC5440].

3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7
   of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
   generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
   memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which
   is described in STD 58,RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

4. PCEP MIB Module Architecture

   The PCEP MIB will contain the following information:
   
   a. PCEP client configuration and status.
   b. PCEP peer configuration and information.
   c. PCEP session configuration and information.
   d. Notifications to indicate PCEP session changes.

4.1. Relations to other MIB modules
        
   TBD

5. Example of the PCEP MIB module usage

   TBD

6.  Object definitions

6.1 PCE-PCEP-DRAFT-MIB

   This MIB module makes references to the following documents.
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], [RFC2863], [RFC4001],
   [RFC4265] and [RFC3813].

   DESCRIPTION

      "This MIB module defines a collection of objects for managing 
       PCE communication protocol(PCEP)."


-- Revision history

    REVISION 
      "200811031200Z"  -- Nov 03 2008 12:00:00 EST 
    DESCRIPTION 
        "
          Changes from -00- ietf draft include support for the following
           in the MIB :
           o Whether the PCEP speaker should initiate the PCEP session
             or wait for initiation by the peer,
           o A set of PCEP policies including the type of operations 
             allowed for the PCEP peer (e.g., diverse path computation,
             synchronization, etc.),
           o A scalar object restricting the set of PCEP peers
             that can initiate a PCEP session with the PCEP speaker 
             (e.g., list of authorized PCEP peers, all PCEP peers in 
             the area, all PCEP peers in the AS).

         Changes from -01- draft include support for the following
           in the MIB :
           o  The SyncTimer,
           o  The maximum number of sessions that can be setup,
           o  Request timer: amount of time a PCC waits for a reply 
              before resending its path computation requests 
              (potentially to an alternate PCE).
           o  The MAX-UNKNOWN-REQUESTS
           o  The MAX-UNKNOWN-MESSAGES
           o  Response time (minimum, average and maximum), on a 
              per PCE Peer basis,
           o  PCEP Session failures,
           o  Amount of time the session has been in active state,
           o  Number of corrupted messages,
           o  Number of failed computations,

        Changes from -00- draft :
         1. Clarified the notion of PCEP Client.
         2. Added new objects to the PCEP client and session tables
            to manage PCEP protocol as in section 8 of 
            draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt
         3. Did not add all the objects to manage the recommendations
            in draft-ietf-pce-pcep-08.txt to control the complexity of
            the MIB."

7. Security Considerations

   These MIB modules can be used for configuration of certain objects,
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB modules
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   
   <The tables and objects and their sensitivies will be added in a
   future version of this document>
   
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT

draft-ietf-pce-pcep-mib-01 PCE-PCEP-MIB                 March 8, 2010 
 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.   
   

8. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment for pceStdMIB under
   the mib-2 branch. The MIB module in this document uses the following
   IANA-assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers
   registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           
           pceStdMIB              { mib-2 XXX }
   
   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module contained in
   this document under the mib-2 subtree.
