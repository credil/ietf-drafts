2.  Introduction

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971] (SEND) utilizes X.509v3
   certificates that include the [RFC3779] extension for IPv6 addresses
   to certify a router's authority over an IPv6 prefix for the Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) Protocol.  SEND specification defines neither the
   certificate profile nor any certificate management routines.  It
   specifies only the certificate path validation and the IP address
   extension verification procedures.  This document defines the
   certificate profile, as well as certificate issuance and revocation
   routines for SEND.

   The SIDR WG in the IETF is working on a Certificate Profile for the
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The RPKI represents the
   centralized model referred in Section 6.2 of [RFC3971].
   Consequently, SEND will use the SIDR certificate profile and
   certificate validation detailed in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

   Since the RFC 3779 IPv6 addresses extension does not mention what
   functions the node can perform for the certified IPv6 space, it
   becomes impossible to know the reason for which the certificate was
   issued.  In order to facilitate issuance of certificates for specific
   functions, it is necessary to utilize the ExtKeyUsageSyntax field
   (optional in RPKI Certificates) of the X.509 certificate to mention
   the purpose why the certificate was issued.  This document specifies
   three extended key usage values, one for routers, one for proxies,
   and one for address owners, for use with SEND.

   In RFC 3971 two deployment models were described: centralized and
   decentralized.  With the advance of RPKI standardization we introduce
   two different deployment models: local and public deployment models.

4.  SEND Certificate profile

   SEND certificates MUST comply with the RPKI resource profile
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].  A Router Authorization Certificate
   example is included in the Appendix A.

   In sections 2, 3.9.10 and 3.9.11 of [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] it is
   stated that RFC 3779 resource extensions MUST be critical and MUST be
   present in all Resource Certificates.  SEND certificates MUST include
   the IP Resources extension for IPv6 Address Family (AFI=0002)
   described in section 3.9.10 of [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] and MUST be
   the only resource extension present.  The IPv6 resource extension
   MUST NOT specify the "inherit" element.  Certified IPv6 address space
   SHOULD be expressed using either addressPrefix or addressesOrRange
   elements.

5.  Deployment Models

   RFC 3971 describes two deployment models:centralized and
   decentralized.  These models were differentiated by having one or
   many trust anchor.  In this document we introduced two new deployment
   models, not based on the number of trust anchors but on the
   localization of the SEND deployment.

   The local SEND deployment model represent those cases where SEND
   deployment is confined to an administrative domain.  In this
   scenario, the deployment of SEND MAY be done independently of the
   existence of deployment in the upper RPKI hierarchy (i.e. an end user
   could local SEND deployment without the need of RPKI deployment in
   its ISP).  This model requires the use of local trust anchors and
   configuring islands of trust.  This model MAY include ULA addresses.

   The public SEND deployment models represent those cases where SEND
   deployment is linked to RPKI deployment as described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch].  Trust anchor material MAY be part of a
   different administrative domain (i.e.  RIR, NIR or ISPs).  It is a
   global model suitable for mobile users.

6.  Trust Anchor Material

   Relying parties (e.g., user devices that implement SEND and process
   these router certificates) MUST be configured with one or more trust
   anchors to enable validation of the routers' certificates.  The trust
   anchor material MAY be either a CA certificate (which MAY be self-
   signed) containing an RFC 3779 address extension or it MAY be trust
   anchor material as defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-ta].

   In a local SEND deployment model, it is possible to use as trust
   anchor material a certificate that includes in its RFC 3779 address
   extension the prefix ::/0.  In this case no new trust anchor material
   would be needed when renumbering.  However, if trying to move from
   the local deployment model to the public deployment model, new trust
   anchor material will have to be distributed to relying parties.

   By using the trust anchor model described in [I-D.ietf-sidr-ta],
   relying parties will use as trust anchor material the ETA (External
   Trust Anchor) certificate, which does not list any address space.
   This configuration allows network renumbering without the need for
   issuing trust anchor material in both the local and the public model.
   In this case the Relying party MUST obtain an RTA (RPKI Trust Anchor)
   certificate from the publication point of the ETA certificate as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-ta].

   The identification for the Trust Anchor Material will be included in
   the Name Type Field of the ICMP Trust Anchor Option as described in
   RFC 3971 and MUST always refer to a certificate that includes a RFC
   3779 address extension.

7.  Extended Key Usage Values

   The Internet PKI document [RFC5280] specifies the extended key usage
   X.509 certificate extension.  The extension indicates one or more
   purposes for which the certified public key may be used.  The
   extended key usage extension can be used in conjunction with key
   usage extension, which indicates the intended purpose of the
   certified public key.  The Extended Key Usage extension is defined as
   optional in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] for end entity certificates but
   MUST be present when issuing end entity certificates for SEND.

   The extended key usage extension syntax is repeated here for
   convenience:

     ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

     KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   This specification defines three KeyPurposeId values: one for
   authorizing routers, one for authorizing proxies, and one for address
   owners.

   The inclusion of the router authorization value indicates that the
   certificate has been issued for allowing the router to advertise
   prefix(es) that are mentioned using the X.509 extensions for IP
   addresses and AS identifiers [RFC3779]

   The inclusion of the proxy authorization value indicates that the
   certificate has been issued for allowing the proxy to perform
   proxying of neighbor discovery messages for the prefix(es) that are
   mentioned using the X.509 extensions for IP addresses and AS
   identifiers [RFC3779]

   The inclusion of the owner authorization value indicates that the
   certificate has been issued for allowing the node to use the
   address(es) or prefix(es) that are mentioned using the X.509
   extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers [RFC3779]

   Inclusion of multiple values indicates that the certified public key
   is appropriate for use by a node performing more than one of these
   functions.

     id-kp OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
       { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
         security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) kp(3) }

     id-kp-sendRouter OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBA1 }

Internet-Draft   SEND certificate profile and management      March 2010


     id-kp-sendProxy OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBA2 }

     id-kp-sendOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBA3 }

   As described in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs], the extended key usage
   extension, if present, MUST be non-critical.

   Certificate-using applications MAY require the extended key usage
   extension to be present in a certificate, and they MAY require a
   particular KeyPurposeId value to be present (such as id-kp-sendRouter
   or id-kp-sendProxy) within the extended key usage extension.  If
   multiple KeyPurposeId values are included, the certificate-using
   application need not recognize all of them, as long as the required
   KeyPurposeId value is present.

8.  CRL profile and revocation

   RPKI requires the use of CRLs [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].  The host
   will obtain the necessary CRLs and perform the certificate validation
   method described in [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

8.1.  OCSP Considerations

   By addopting the [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] as the certificate profile
   for SEND, the use of the OCSP protocol is not allowed by the RPKI
   Certicate Policies [I-D.ietf-sidr-cp].  As CRLs are expected to be
   small, the fetching of the required CRLs are not expected to demand
   important bandwith.

10.  Security Considerations

   The certification authority needs to ensure that the correct values
   for the extended key usage are inserted in each certificate that is
   issued.  Relying parties may accept or reject a particular
   certificate for an intended use based on the information provided in
   these extensions.  Incorrect representation of the information in the
   extended key usage field can cause the relying party to reject an
   otherwise appropriate certificate or accept a certificate that ought
   to be rejected.
