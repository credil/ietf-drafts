    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transport
        Layer Security (TLS) as a dereferencing protocol to resolve a reference into a Presence
        Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO). The document assumes that a Location
        Recipient possesses a secure HELD URI that can be used in conjunction with the HELD protocol
        to request the location of the Target. </t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t> This document describes how to transport Presence Information Data Format Location Object
        (PIDF-LO) when dereferencing a location URI in the form of a secure HELD URI (held: URI
        scheme) <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>. This held: URI indicates
        that the XML-based HELD messages are carried on top of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        (HTTP), which is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) (<xref target="RFC2616"/> and
          <xref target="RFC2818"/>). </t>
      <t> The document describes how HELD <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>
        is used to request and to receive location information in a way that also satisfies the
        requirements laid out in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/>. HELD provides
        location information in the form of a PIDF-LO (see <xref target="RFC4119"/>) which, as part
        of its definition, complies with the requirements of a location object as described in <xref
          target="RFC3693"/>. </t>
      <t>To use HELD as a dereferencing protocol has the advantage that the Location Recipient can
        indicate the type of location information it would like to receive. This functionality is
        already available with the HELD base specification, described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>. Furthermore, the HELD response from
        the LIS towards the Location Recipient not only provides the PIDF-LO but also encapsulates
        supplementary information, such as error messages, back to the Location Recipient. </t>
      <t> The general usage scenario envisioned by this document is shown in <xref target="fig1"/>.
        While the figure shows a typical HELD location request being made to initially obtain the
        location URI. As <xref target="fig1"/> indicates, an alternative Location Configuration
        Protocol (LCP) that can provide a HELD URI can be used. </t>

    <section anchor="threats" title="Threat Models">
      <t>This document assumes that the HELD messages between the Location Recipient and the LIS are
        carried on top of HTTP and secured via TLS. HTTP can be used as a substrate to a number of
        different applications, and defining a set of guidelines for conveying a PIDF-LO for any
        application that might use HTTP would be difficult or impossible. This document does not
        attempt that task. Instead, it is limited in applicability to the case where a client uses a
        HELD locationRequest to retrieve a PIDF-LO object from a server. No other functionality is
        covered. This document does not describe how the Location Recipient obtains the location URI
        pointing to the PIDF-LO document. This is subject of the Location Conveyance protocol <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"/></t>
      <t>There are three security models. They assume that the Location Recipient who obtains the
        the location URI does not act maliciously and does not distribute the obtained Location
        Object without inspecting the privacy policies attached with the Location Object. </t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Authorization Policy Security Model:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/> The assumption of this model is that the LIS has some
            authorization policies (such as those specified in <xref target="RFC4745"/> and <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy"/>) that are provided by the Target and uploaded to
            the LIS. The policies have the form of access control lists that indicate to which
            Location Recipients location information is disclosed. The LIS is therefore able to
            control access to location information. Consequently, when the reference is conveyed to
            the potential Location Recipient (e.g., via SIP <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"/>), then it does not need to be protected
            (neither hop-by-hop nor end-to-end). Authentication by the Location Recipient to the LIS
            is necessary (e.g., TLS client authentication, HTTP Digest authentication) to allow the
            LIS to determine whether access to location information has to be granted. <vspace
              blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="End-to-End Security Model:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/> In this security model we assume that the transport of the
            location URI is encrypted end-to-end, for example using S/MIME, and an adversary along
            the signaling path is not able to eavesdrop, modify or replay a location URI. The Target
            is able to control the disclosure of the PIDF-LO by making it available only to trusted
            entities. Consequently, only the entity that is able to decrypt the end-to-end protected
            object, such as S/MIME encrypted object, can resolve the reference.<vspace
              blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="Hop-by-Hop Security Model:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>In this security model we assume that the location URI can
            either be directly communicated between the Target and the Location Recipient or from
            the Target via trusted proxies to the Location Recipient. In some cases the location URI
            is conveyed to multiple Location Recipients, for example in case of location-based
            routing applications. The entity that observes the location URI has to be able to
            resolve it into a literal location. </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The description of the security models above shows the responsibility of the participating
        entities; from a dereferencing protocol point of view an important responsibility can be
        found in the protection of the interaction between the Location Recipient and the LIS
        against the classical communication security threats. </t>
      <t> With respect to the Location Configuration and the Location Conveyance protocol
        interaction, which are outside the scope of this document, this document at least assumes
        the hop-by-hop security model. Additionally, it is assumed that the requirements outlined in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/>, such as the requirement that the
        location URI contains a random component with sufficient entropy and that it does not
        contain identity information. When the pre-requisites for the end-to-end security model are
        met then further protection can be accomplished. End-to-end security mechanisms do, however,
        not enjoy widespread deployment so in SIP so far (when SIP is used as the Location
        Conveyance protocol). The usage of policies local to the LIS are possible. Furthermore,
          <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context"/> allows constraints to be placed on
        the dereferencing procedure that limit the location information available to the Location
        Recipient, for example limiting the number of times a reference may be used. </t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="details" title="Using HELD to Dereference a Location URI">
      <t>This section describes how HELD protected by TLS can be used to qualify location requests
        to the LIS. Only a subset of HELD functionality is required and is described in the
        following paragraphs. The HELD based dereferencing step provides ways to tell the LIS what
        information is desired and allows the LIS to communicate additional information back to the
        client. </t>
      <t>The &lt;locationType&gt; element allows location to be requested in a specific
        form, such as civic or geodetic location information. The Location Recipient SHOULD NOT
        request location as a locationURI. The LIS MUST respond with a
        &quot;requestError&quot; if it receives a request for a locationURI where HELD is
        being used as a dereference protocol. Location information provided by the LIS MUST
        correspond to the rules and guidelines in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile"/>.
        If the requested form of location violates any authorization policies known to the LIS, then
        the LIS MUST respond with a &quot;cannotProvideLiType&quot; error. </t>

      <t>The LIS will provide location information on request even if the location information does
        not fit the form requested. This stems from the premise that some location is better than no
        location. HELD provides a means for the requestor to modify this behaviour and instruct the
        LIS to return an error if location information is not available in the form requested. This
        is done using the <spanx style="verb">exact</spanx> attribute.</t>

      <t>Location systems often have more than one location determination mechanism at their
        disposal. Differing determination techniques provide different degrees of accuracy over
        differing periods of time. Generally, more accurate determination techniques require more
        time. HELD addresses this trade-off by allowing the requestor to specify how long they are
        prepared to wait for a location result. This allows the LIS to select the most accurate
        determination technique at its disposal that can return a result in the specified time. The
        HELD attribute for specifying this value is the <spanx style="verb">responseTime</spanx>
        attribute and MAY be used by a Location Recipient to specify their preference for the
        accuracy-time trade-off. </t>

      <t>The LIS MUST support the HELD locationRequest semantic using an HTTP GET as described in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>. </t>

      <t> Where the LIS is unable to process the Location Recipient&apos;s request, it MUST
        return the appropriate error from the existing HELD error set defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>. </t>

    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document assumes that the use of TLS to protect HTTP is sufficient to protect the
        privacy of the PIDF-LO content while in flight. When access control at the LIS is not
        applied, as described in the threat models in <xref target="threats"/>, then the possession
        of the location URI is equal to the possession of location information. When the
        requirements for creating a location URI, as described in <xref
          target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context"/>, are met, then the reference provides
        sufficiently high security guarantees for most usages. Furthermore, the ability of the
        Target to put constraints on the dereferencing step, as described in <xref
          target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context"/>, provides additional security guarantees. </t>

      <t>In the normal case, connection establishment from the Location Recipient to the LIS will be
        made on HTTP over TLS, and the location URI being dereferenced by the Location Recipient
        will contain the hostname of the LIS. The Location Recipient MUST check the FQDN of the LIS
        in the reference with the identity presented in the server's certificate. A discrepancy may
        indicate a possible man-in-the-middle-attack, and the Location Recipient should take
        appropriate action based on application dependent semantics. Actions may include but are not
        limited to; proceeding anyway, flagging the result as suspect, or giving up. </t>
      <t>In some applications the Location Recipient has a pre-established relationship with one or
        several Location Information Servers and hence the LIS might authorize only certain Location
        Recipients might be allowed to resolve a reference.</t>

      <t>This section compares the GEOPRIV requirements described in <xref target="RFC3693"/> with
        the approach outlined in this document. </t>

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.1, the Location Object has to be understood by the Location
            Recipient and the Location Server, the two communication end points. The PIDF-LO <xref
              target="RFC4119"/> allows both civic and geospatial location information to be
            expressed. Combining this with <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile"/> ensures
            that location can be constructed and interpreted in a consistent manner. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.2, a number of fields in the civic location information format
            are optional. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.3, the civic location information is defined in an extensible
            way. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.4, the location information itself is not defined in this
            document. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.5, the protocol described in this document allows the Location
            Recipient to resolve a reference to a PIDF-LO only. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.6, the Location Object contains both location information and
            privacy rules. Depending on the deployment scenario, which is outside the scope of this
            document, the privacy rules might have stronger or a weaker semantic. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.7, the Location Object is usable in a variety of protocols. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 1.8, no change regarding with respect to the encoding of the
            Location Object (see <xref target="RFC4119"/>) was made by this document. </t>

        </list>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.1, depending on the deployment scenario an identifier pointing
            to the Target may be carried inside the PIDF-LO since the PIDF object provides the
            ability to carry this identifier. In some circumstances it might be desirable not to
            carry information about the Target's identity in the PIDF-LO. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.2, depending on the deployment scenario the LIS might require
            that the Location Recipient performs an authentication step. The security mechanisms for
            client and server authentication are outside the scope of this document and defined
            already for HTTPS itself. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.3, proof of possession of the Location Recipient credentials is
            provided outside the scope of this document. The security mechanisms defined for HTTPS
            are used by this document. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.5, RFC 4119 defines the basis for carrying location information
            in a PIDF document. The ability to extend RFC 4119 to convey motion specific information
            is work in progress.</t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.6, this document as specified only allows the Location
            Recipient to resolve the reference and to indicate which location format has to be
            returned. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.7, the PIDF-LO relevant elements and attributes are available.

            time&apos; and &apos;TTL&apos;]]-->
          </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.8, provision exists for a reference to an external (more
            detailed rule set) within the PIDF-LO to be made. This is the
            &lt;external-ruleset&gt; element. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.9, security headers and trailers are provided Transport Layer
            Security. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 2.10, extensibility within the PIDF-LO is provided regarding the
            definition of namespaces. </t>

            apply to an absolute geodetic point. Geodetic information expressed in a PIDF-LO that

            volume there-by &quot;fuzzing&quot; the location of the Target. </t>
          <t>Regarding requirement 3.4, since the PIDF-LO format is designed to be extensible it
            allows further location information types to be defined in the future. </t>
