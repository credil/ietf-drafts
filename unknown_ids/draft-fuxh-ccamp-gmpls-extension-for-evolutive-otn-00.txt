Internet-Draft    GMPLS Extension for G.709 Amendment3         June 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the extensions of GMPLS signaling to control
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) including ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e,
   ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2, ODU4 and ODUflex.  It also describe the
   interworking between pre-G.709 and G.709 Amendment3.  The control of
   ODUflex resizing is for further study.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  GMPLS Extension for G.709 Amendment3-Overview

   The concept of Lower Order (LO) ODUk and High Order (HO) ODUk in the
   G.709 Amendment3 multiplex hierarchy is introduced as same
   information structures but with different client signals.  LO-ODUk
   can be considered as the service layer and the HO-ODUk can be
   considered as the Tunnel Layer.  LO-ODUk can be multiplexed into the
   HO-ODUk or can be mapped directly to OTUk layer.

   The High Order ODU signals of a carrier can also be transported over
   Low Order links provided in a carrier-carrier network domain.  This
   external HO-ODUk can be multiplexed together with the equivalent LO-
   ODUk into the HO-ODUk tunnel layer.  The LO-ODUk into HO-ODUk
   multiplexing and OCh into OMSn multiplexing provide a two stage
   multiplexing capability.  ODU0 are to be transported over ODUk
   (k=1,2,3,4) and ODU2e are to be transported over ODUk (
   k=3,3e1,3e2,4).

   The ability to accommodate any client bit rate into a variable bit
   rate LO-ODU and map into any number of Tributary Slots of HO-ODU i.e.
   being agnostic to the service bit rate and provide flexibility to the
   mapping process creates a future proof multi service OTN evolution.
   ODUflex is a LO-ODU that enhances bit transparent transport over OTN.
   It can be of any rate of ODU0 rate or higher and has a generic
   capacity.

   GMPLS signaling extensions for pre-G.709 has been described in
   rfc4328.  It extended the Generalized Label Request, the Generalized
   Label and Traffic Parameter.  This document give more extensional for
   the G.709 Amendment3.  It also covers the Generalized Label, Traffic
   Parameters.  It also give some consideration about the interworking
   between pre-G.709 and G.709 Amendment3.

   ODUflex should be more further study in the future (e.g., Control of
   ODUflex resizing).

   [RFC4328] extends GMPLS to support G.709 Optical Transport Networks
   Control.  To support the application of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e,
   ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODU4 the extensions based on [RFC4328] are
   needed.  The first extension defines signal Type of these ODUk in
   G.709 Traffic Parameters.  The second extension provides the
   compatible definition of ODUk Label.


3.  Generalized Label Request

   [RFC4328] extends the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type, and
   G-PID (Generalized-PID) values to accommodate G.709 Recommendation
   [ITUT-G.709].  Signaling of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2e, ODU4, ODUflex, ODU3e1
   and ODU3e2 LSP must comply with these extensions.  Additional LSP
   Encoding Type code-point for the G.709 Digital Path layer must be
   used in these new ODUk types LSP and their switching types belong to
   the TDM class.

3.1.  Extension of Traffic Parameters for G.709 Amendment3

   G.709 traffic parameters has been defined in rfc4328.  The backwards
   compatibility must be considered.  Backwards compatibility
   considerations for each feature is covered in this section.

   This document extends this Traffic Parameters including adding one
   bit for the different G.709 version.

   V (G.709 Version): 1 bit

     0 - In the case of a pre-G.709 implementation, it must set to
         zero in every Path and Resv message.

     1 - In the case of a G.709 Amendment3 implementation, it must be
         set to 1 in every Path and Resv message.

3.1.1.  Signal Type Extension

   Signal Type is extended for G.709 Amendment3 as follow:

   Value  Type
   -----  ----
   0      Not significant
   1      ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps)
   2      ODU2 (i.e., 10  Gbps) /*The size of OPU2 TS is 2.5G*/
   3      ODU3 (i.e., 40  Gbps) /*The size of OPU3 TS is 2.5G*/
   4      Reserved (for future use)
   5      Reserved (for future use)
   6      OCh at 2.5 Gbps
   7      OCh at 10  Gbps
   8      OCh at 40  Gbps
   9      OCh at 100 Gbps
   10     ODU0
   11     ODU1    /*The size of OPU1 TS is 1.25G*/
   12     ODU2    /*The size of OPU2 TS is 1.25G*/
   13     ODU3    /*The size of OPU3 TS is 1.25G*/
   14     ODU4    /*The size of OPU4 TS is 1.25G*/
   15     ODU2e   /*10Gbps for FC1200 and GE LAN */
   16     ODU3e1  /*The size of OPU3e1 TS is 2.5G */
   17     ODU3e2  /*The size of OPU3e2 TS is 1.25G */
   18     ODUflex
   19-255 Reserved (for future use)


4.  Backward Compatibility Considerations

   If one G.709 Amendment3 implementation node receives a Path message
   from pre-G.709 implementation node with V bit set to zero in Traffic
   Parameters, it must check the local mapping capability. if it can not
   support the pre-G.709 payload mapping into the link that are attached
   to the G.709 Amentment3 equipment or pre-G.709 equipment, the Path
   message will be terminated, and a PathErr message with a "Traffic
   Control Error/Service unsupported" indication will be generated.
   There are several interworking scenarios as following:

   1.  If the one G.709 Amendment3 implementation node receives a Path

   message with V bit set to zero in Traffic Parameters and it can
   support the pre-G.709 payload mapping into the link that are attached
   to the G.709 Amentment3 equipment, it should generated a path message
   with V bit set to 1.

           ----| old |------------| new |-------------| new |----
               +-----+            +-----+             +-----+
                      ----------->       ----------->
                       Path(V=0)          Path(V=1)

                        Compatibility Scenario (1)

   2.  If one G.709 Amendment3 implementation node receives a Path
   message from pre-G.709 implementation node with V bit set to zero in
   Traffic Parameters and it can support the pre-G.709 payload mapping
   into the link that are attached to the pre-G.709 equipment, it should
   generated a path message with V bit set to zero.

           ----| old |------------| new |-------------| old |----
               +-----+            +-----+             +-----+
                      ----------->       ----------->
                       Path(V=0)          Path(V=0)

                        Compatibility Scenario (2)

   3.  When a upstream node implemented with G.709 Amendment3 generates
   a path message to the donwstream node implemented with pre-G.709, V
   bit should be always set to zero.  If the one pre-G.709
   implementation node receives a Path message from G.709 Amendment3
   implementation node with V bit set to 1 in Traffic Parameters and the
   Signal Type represents that the size of tributary slot in OPUk is
   2.5G, it should generated a path message with V bit set to zero.
   Otherwise the Path message will be terminated, and a PathErr message
   with a "Traffic Control Error/Service unsupported" indication will be
   generated.

5.  Generalized Label

5.1.  Label Space

   G.709 Amendment3 has been added many different client payload bit
   rates which are mainly based on Gigabit Ethernet.  An Optical Data
   Unit (ODU) frame has been defined for each of these bit rates.  ODUk
   refers to the frame at bit rate k, where k = 0 (for 1.2G Gbps which
   is sepecially introduced for GE client signal), 1 (for 2.5 Gbps), 2
   (for 10 Gbps including CBR and GE LAN), 2e (also for 10 Gbps which is
   sepecially introduced for FC1200 and GE LAN client signal), 3 (for 40
   Gbps including CBR and GE) or 4 (for 100 Gbps which is sepecially
   introduced for GE client signal).  ODU0 can be mapped into ODU1,
   ODU2, ODU3, ODU4.  ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 can be mapped into ODU4.
   ODU2e can be mapped into ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODU4.

   The ODUflex can be used for CBR clients and for packet clients.  The
   existing G.709 mappings for CBR clients into ODU0, 1, 2, 3 will

   continue to be used.  New ODUflex mappings will not be defined for
   these clients.  The CBR ODUflex rate should be 239/238*client bit
   rate.  The Packet ODUflex bit rate is based on an incremental number
   of tributary slots of the ODUk (k=2, 3, 4) expected to carry the
   ODUflex.  The Packet ODUflex rate should be n*1.24416 Gbps+/-20ppm (n
   should be between 1 and 80).  CBR ODUflex and Packet ODUflex are
   transported by mapping into an integer number of TS of an OPUk (of a
   High Order ODUk) for k>1.  There is no OTUflex.  Just as there is no
   OTU0 nor OTU2e in the next G.709 revision.

   Most Lower Order ODUk signals have the same number of tributary slots
   in all High Order ODUk(i.e.  HO OPUk signals).  There are however a
   few exceptions; the most well known is LO ODU2e (i.e.  LO
   ODU(10.399G).  ODU2e fits into 5*2.5G tributary slots of OPU3,
   9*1.25G tributary slots of OPU3, or 8*1.25G tributary slots of OPU4.

   Following is the ODUk label format for the G.709 Amendment3


    0                   1                   2                   3

                Figure 2: Label Format for G.709 Amendment3

   The specification of the fields t1, t2, t3 and t4 self-consistently
   characterizes the ODUk label space.  The value space for the t1, t2,
   t3, t4, t5 and t6 fields is defined as follows:

   1.  t1 (2-bit):

       *  t1=1 indicates an ODU1 signal that is not further sub-divided.
          It is same as the definition in rfc4328.

       *  t1=[2..3] indicates the tributary slot (t1th-1) used by the
          ODU0 in an ODTUG1 mapped into an ODU1 (via OPU1).  ODU0 is
          mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU1.

       *  t1 is not significant for the other ODUk signal types (i.e.,
          t1 value MUST be set to 0 and ignored).

   2.  t2 (5-bit):

       *  t2=1 indicates an ODU2 signal that is not further sub-divided.
          It is same as the definition in rfc4328.

       *  t2=[2..5] indicates the tributary slot (t2th-1) used by the
          ODU1 in an ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2 (via OPU2).  It is same
          as the definition in rfc4328.  ODU1 is mapped into 2.5G
          tributary slots of OPU2.

       *  t2=[6..13] indicates the tributary slot (t2th-5) used by the

          the draft revised G.709 (resulting in the mapping for ODU2e
          into five 2.5G tributary slots would not be supported in
          favour of using GMP mapping into nine 1.25G tributary slots).

       *  t4 is not significant for the other ODUk signal types (i.e.,
          t4 value MUST be set to 0 and ignored).

5.2.  Label Distribution Rules

   The label distribution rules must be same as rfc4328.  But it was
   noted that VCAT is only defined currently for ODU1, ODU2, and ODU3.
   The draft revision of G.709 Amendment3 will not define VCAT for ODU1,
   ODU2e and ODU4.  ODUflex was expected to support clients with new bit
   rates that do not fit efficiently into ODU2, ODU3, or ODU4.  It was
   also noted that VCAT supports client signals that require more than
   the capacity supported on a single wavelength, which is not supported
   using ODUflex.

5.3.  Calculation of Tributary Slot Number for ODUflex

   For an ODUflex that is based on transport of a particular physical
   layer client (e.g., ODU2e) the size of the ODUflex depends on that
   client.  In general, it is a bit-synchronous mapping of the client
   with the ODUflex bit-rate being 239/238 times the bit-rate of the
   client.  Due to the fixed stuff columns, the bit-rate of the ODU2e is
   239/237 times the bit-rate of the 10GBASE-R client.  For this type of
   ODUflex, the number of tributary slots is chosen to fit.

   For example, ODU2e fits into 5*2.5G tributary slots of OPU3 (i.e.,
   Five labels need to be allocated for one ODUflex connection when
   ODUflex is mapped into 2.5G tributary slots of ODU3), 9*1.25G
   tributary slots of OPU3 (i.e., Nine labels need to be allocated for
   one ODUflex connection when ODUflex is mapped into 1.25G tributary
   slots of OPU3), or 8*1.25G tributary slots of OPU4 (i.e., Eight
   labels need to be allocated for one ODUflex connection when ODUflex
   is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU4).

   For an ODUflex to provide flexibly sized trunks for packet transport,
   the granularity is selected to provide a reasonably efficient mapping
   into tributary slots of high order OPU2, OPU3, and OPU4.  A good
   choice here seems to be to allow these trunks to be provisioned in
   sizes of n*1.24416G+/-20ppm.

   Figure 3: Interworking Example between pre-G.709 and G.709 Amendment3

   Interworking can probably be accomplished by requiring the new
   equipment to support the current payload mappings onto link that are
   attached to current equipment.  One approach that may satisfy this is
   to represent the capacity of a link in terms of the number of
   timeslots and the time slot bandwidth.  This can be reflected in the
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor.  In the this scenario,
   node DXC3, DXC4 and DXC5 should have the interworking capability.

   With the introduction of many new LO ODU bit rates, TE links should
   be represented by means of either their bandwidth or their number of
   tributary slots, the bandwidth per tributary slot and the set of
   client ODU signals supported.  TED should be compose of the following
   TE link in this scenario.


                  Max LSP Bandwidth  Minimum LSP Bandwidth
   OTU2(DXC1-DXC2)     ODU2 (10G)       ODU1 (2.5G)
   OTU2(DXC5-DXC6)     ODU2 (10G)       ODU0 (1.25G)
   OTU3(DXC2-DXC3)     ODU3 (40G)       ODU1 (2.5G)
   OTU3(DXC4-DXC5)     ODU3 (40G)       ODU1 (2.5G)
   OTU4(DXC3-DXC4)     ODU4 (100G)      ODU0 (1.25G)

   When we need to setup a ODU1 (2.5G) LSP between DXC1 node and DXC6
   nodes, the path computation entiy may computate an DXC1-DXC2-DXC3-
   DXC4-DXC5-DXC6 route by the ODU2e bandwidth in an G.709 network.

   In the case of a contiguous TE LSP, the setup of a end-to-end
   connection must be based on the section "Backward Compatibility
   Considerations" in this document.

   The end-to-end connection also can be setuped with Stitching LSP
   technology.  This end-to-end connection is stitched to several
   segment LSPs (i.e., ODU1 LSP1, ODU1 LSP2, ODU1 LSP3, ODU1 LSP4).  The
   segment lsp is created and prepaired for stitching by signaling.

Internet-Draft    GMPLS Extension for G.709 Amendment3         June 2009


   Druing setup of each segment lsp, tributary slot size should be known
   to control plane.  One approach that may satisfy this is based on the
   Signal Type in Traffic Parameters.  Following is the value of Signal
   Type for different segment LSP.


              Value     Type
   ODU1 LSP1  1         ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps is not further sub-divided)
   ODU1 LSP2  12        ODU1 /*The size of OPU4 TS is 1.25G*/
   ODU1 LSP3  1         ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps is not further sub-divided)
   ODU1 LSP2  12        ODU1 /*The size of OPU2 TS is 1.25G*/
