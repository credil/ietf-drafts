    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <section title="Emergency Services Architecture">

        <t>The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency Context Resolution
          with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group, see <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"/>, describes an architecture where location
          information is provided by access networks to end points or VoIP service providers in
          order to determine the correct dial string and information to route the call to a Public
          Safety Answering Point (PSAP). The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol <xref
            target="RFC5222"/> allows callers and other call-routing entities to determine the PSAP
          Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a specific geographical location together with a
          service URI <xref target="RFC5031"/>. The basic architecture is shown in Figure 1 of <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"/> and further detailed in the message flow in Figure 2
          of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"/>. </t>

        <t>For emergency services, location information is needed in three ways: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>Emergency call routing to the PSAP that is responsible for a specific geographical
              region</t>
            <t>Dispatch of the emergency personnel to the scene of an accident, crime or other types
              of incidents</t>
            <t>Additionally, a Voice Service Provider (VSP) may need to verify that an call is
              indeed an emergency call and may therefore require location information to ensure that
              calls routed to a specific URI point to a PSAP.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>This document focuses on item (1) and item (3). Providing location information by the ISP
          to the PSAP and to the emergency personnel are typically legal obligations covered by
          regulatory frameworks.</t>
      </section>


      <section title="Location Hiding">

        <t>Internet Access Providers (IAPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs)) typically have
          little incentives to provide location information to end hosts or independent VSPs
          (without monetary compensation) for any purpose, including for emergency call routing. The
          decision to deny disclosure of location information can be driven by a number of technical
          and business concerns. Some providers may perceive a risk that allowing users to access
          location information for non-emergency purposes or prior to an emergency call will incur
          additional server load and thus costs. Other providers may not want to make location
          information available without the ability to charge for it. Yet others fear problems with
          regard to privacy when disclosing location information to potentially unknown third
          parties.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Location by Reference">

        <t>The work on the Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) indicated the need to provide the
          capability to obtain Location-by-References (LbyRs) in addition to Location-by-Value
          (LbyV) from a Location Information Server (LIS).</t>

        <t> The LCP problem statement and requirements document can be found in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/>. The requirements for obtaining an LbyR via the
          LCP and the corresponding dereferencing step can be found in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/>. </t>

        <t>HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD), see <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>, is an instantiation of the LCP
          concept and allows LbyVs and LbyRs to be requested. </t>

        <t>A location reference may already satisfy the requirement for location hiding if the PSAP
          has the appropriate credentials to resolve the reference. These credentials allow the
          ISP/IAP to authenticate and to authorize the party that would like to request location
          information. The policy to obtain these credentials allows ISPs/IAPs to put constraints
          under which these credentials are handed out. ISP/IAPs ideally might want to engage in a
          business relationship with the VSP to receive a financial compensation for the service
          they provide. On the Internet the number of VSPs is potentially large and the VSPs would
          not want to enter a business contract with potentially every ISP/IAP worldwide. The number
          of potential contracts between ISPs/IAPs and PSAPs is, however, relatively small as they
          typically need to have a local relationship as PSAPs provide their emergency services
          support in a certain geographical region for which certain ISPs/IAPs have networks
          deployed. </t>

        <t>Note that the requirement being met here is for delivery of location information to the
          PSAP, not for LoST routing or for validation at the VSP. Another obstacle when it comes to
          the usage of location reference for location-based routing from a technical point of view
          is that a location reference cannot be used as input to LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/>, as
          LoST requires location per value rather than a reference. Also, LoST servers may be
          operated by independent parties, including VSPs, which again may not be able to resolve
          the reference to location by value. (Note that LoST is a protocol used for determining the
          location-appropriate PSAP based on location information and a Service URN <xref
            target="RFC5031"/>.</t>

              include "trial-and-error" operations on its critical path, such as attempts at LbyR
