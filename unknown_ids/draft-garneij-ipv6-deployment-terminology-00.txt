              draft-garneij-ipv6-deployment-terminology-00

Abstract

   When discussing IPv6 deployment related matters it is easy to mix up
   the terminology used in this area.  To try to provide a higher level
   of consistency in this area this document suggests a brief
   terminology definition that may be used as a reference when using
   IPv6 deployment related terminology.

1.  Introduction

   This document is intended to serve as a reference to IPv6 deployment
   related terminology.  It is not the purpose of this document to
   introduce any new terminology into this area but only to provide
   definition of already existing and established terminology.


2.  IPv6 deployment related terminology

2.1.  IPv6 deployment

   IPv6 deployment is the process of introducing IPv6 in a network
   environment, be it an environment where currently IPv4 is in use and
   the two IP versions co-exist or in a "Greenfield" deployment with no
   prior IP infrastructure.  IPv6 deployment in co-existence with an
   IPv4 environment may or may not have the goal of completing an IPv6
   migration.  IPv6 deployment can be discussed from a node capability
   perspective as well as from an application capability perspective.

2.2.  IPv6-only

   IPv6-only defines a state where only IPv6 is available for IP
   transport.  The limitation can reside in applications and/or node
   capability.

2.3.  IPv6 migration

   IPv6 migration is the process of switching from IPv4 to IPv6 in a
   node or a network.

   o  Co-existence phase
      If during this process you leave IPv4 on in parallel with IPv6,
      that is coexistence. - Coexistence phase

   o  Transition point
      If and when you turn IPv4 off, leaving the nodes IPv6 only, that
      is a transition. - Transition point

2.4.  IPv6 transition

   IPv6 transition defines the task of making the transition of the
   Internet to IPv6-only as the final stage of the IPv6 migration
   process.  IPv6 transition mechanisms [RFC4213] are designed to enable
   transition and to support IPv6 hosts and routers that need to
   interoperate with IPv4 hosts and utilize IPv4 routing
   infrastructures.

Appendix A.  A tale of two countries

   Freely adapted from "The Emigrants" novels series [EMIGRANTS]

   Once upon a time there where two countries, IPv4 and IPv6.  IPv4 was
   a crowded country with limited resources and a growing population
   tormented by starvation and diseases.  On a distant shore across the
   sea was a brave new land, full of promises and plenty, called IPv6.
   Spurred by the opportunities of a better life in the distant country
   families started the process of migrating from their old country IPv4
   to IPv6.  In their new homeland the people there spoke another
   language called IPv6, while the newcomers only spoke IPv4, the
   language of their old country.  Luckily many of the people that
   already lived in IPv6 also spoke IPv4, and being bi-lingual made it
   possible for them to talk to their new fellow countrymen and to
   introduce them to the language of their new country.  Eventually the
   immigrants also became bilingual and for some their frequent use of

   their new won language they made the transition from speaking IPv4 to
   IPv6.  I was also common that the children of the immigrants only
   spoke IPv6, which was made possible because of the bi-lingual skills
   of their parents.  Some of the older people, like grandparents than
   accompanied the families, kept their old habits and language which
   they spoke among their kin and friends from the old country.  To talk
   with their grandchildren they had to rely on the bilingual parents to
   translate between children and grandparents.  Eventually the need of
   being bi-lingual became less important as time went by, and when the
   need will go away only time can tell.

   Bi-lingual read Dual-Stack

   Starvation and diseases read Address pool depletion

   Migrate - move from one country or region to another and settle there

   Transition - a change of state
