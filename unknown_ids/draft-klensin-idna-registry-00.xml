<section title="Introduction">
   <section title="Reasons for this Specification">
      <t>As part of the IDNA package <xref target="RFC5890"/>,
		 the IANA Considerations Section
		 of <xref target="RFC5892">RFC 5892</xref> specified an "IDNA
		 Derived Properties" registry. 
		 Experience with that specification demonstrated it to be
		 insufficiently clear on several details.  This document
		 respecifies that registry to eliminate any confusion.  In
		 particular, clarifications are required for the following:
		 <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Preservation of tables">
               <vspace blankLines="0"/> The registry
			   actually consists of one table per Unicode version
			   starting with the Unicode 5.2 table that was included
			   in RFC 5892.</t>
			<t hangText="Identification of tables">
               <vspace blankLines="0"/> Each table in the
			   registry will be identified with a reference to the
			   particular Unicode version from which it was
			   generated and the date on which it was installed.</t>
			<t hangText="Timing and Mechanism for Generating Tables">
               <vspace blankLines="0"/>
			   The text in RFC 5982 is not clear about who is
			   responsible for generating tables and when new tables
			   are to be installed and this requires
			   clarification.</t>
		</list></t>
	 </section>
	 
  <!--      <section title="Terminology">
   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
	   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in
	   <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
	</section>  -->
	 
   </section>

   <section title="Explanation of the Updating Model">
	  <t>[[RFC Editor, please remove this section -- Note in Draft
		 only]]</t>
	  <t> As of the time of posting the first draft of this document,
		 there had been no real discussion in the community of the
		 mechanisms and timing for getting new versions posted.  The
		 suggestion made below is very tentative and intended to
		 encourage discussion.  It tries to preserve the intent and
		 discussions leading up to RFC 5892 to the extent possible by
		 putting the burden of deciding when new table versions are
		 appropriate on the expert reviewer.
		 <!-- balance several goals:
		 <list style="symbols">
			<t>Rapidly publishing new tables after new Unicode
			   versions appear, both to give the community something
			   to examine as discussed in the second paragraph of
			   Section 5.1 of RFC 5892 and to provide a heads-up that
			   a new version of Unicode has been published and that a
			   new table is in progress.</t>
			<t>Distinguishing between a table posted purely by applying
			   existing rules to a new version of Unicode and one that
			   reflects IETF discussion and decisions about whether
			   changes in RFC 5892 (specifically additions to
			   Section 2.7) are needed and, if so, approval of those
			   changes.</t>
			<t>Having  -->
		       Itj also makes IANA responsible for the actual work of
			   producing and installing new tables, but
			   identifies mechanisms by which they can get help with
			   tables and with identifying the existence of new versions of
			   Unicode as needed.</t> 
		<!--  </list>
		</t> -->
		<t> The procedure outlined below delays any posting of a table
		   by IANA until either (i) the expert reviews signs off that
		   no changes to RFC 5892 rules are needed or (ii) IESG, after
		   being notified by the expert reviewer that there is a
		   problem, figures out how to handle things in terms of
		   documentation and community consensus, and approves the
		   result.  If the community would prefer posting of a table
		   for comparison or checking purposes as soon as possible
		   after a new Unicode version is completed, it would be
		   possible to devise a model for "Preliminary" (just after
		   Unicode gets through) and "Final" (after IETF is sure it is
		   through) versions of a table with procedures for getting
		   from one to the other..</t>

   <section title="Specific Updates to RFC 5892" anchor="RegistrySpec">
	  <t>The following subsections are added to the specification of
		 RFC 5892 Section 5.1 "IDNA-Derived Property Value
		 Registry".  The numbers in parentheses are the subsection
		 numbers the paragraphs would have if actually inserted in RFC
		 8582.
	  <list style="format (5.1.%d) ">
		 <t>The registry consists of a set of tables, one
			table per version of Unicode starting with
			Unicode 5.2 and continuing with each new version of
			Unicode as specified below.</t>
		 <t>Each table in the registry shall be identified with the
			Unicode version, a reference to the specification of that
			version, and the date the table was last updated.</t>
		 <t>As soon as feasible after a new version of Unicode is finalized and
			published, IANA or the expert reviewer (as they mutually
			agree) will generate a new version of the table.
			The expert reviewer will then conduct a review.  If issues
			are found, they are brought to IESG attention as discussed
			in RFC 5892.  If not, the expert reviewer will advise IANA to
			install the new table version in the registry,
			identifying it as described above.
			<vspace blankLines="1"/>
			Members of the community are encouraged to call new
			versions of Unicode to the attention of IANA and the
			expert reviewer.  IANA is
			encouraged to call on the expert reviewer or others for
			assistance in compiling and verifying Preliminary
			tables as needed. </t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t> This document clarifies the management, content, and
