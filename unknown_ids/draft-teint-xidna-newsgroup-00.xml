<abstract>

<t>Traditional Network News (Netnews) systems handle only ASCII characters in
newsgroup names used in NNTP commands and message headers.</t>

<t>This memo defines an extension to allow Internationalised Newsgroup Names,
the characters of which can be drawn from the large Unicode repertoire, based
on the Extending IDNA to Other Protocols (X-IDNA) base specification.</t>

</abstract>
  </front>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>The X-IDNA base specification (<xref target="I-D.teint-xidna-base"/>)
provides a generic framework for internationalisation of addresses, based on
IDNA. This memo defines an X-IDNA Profile for use with Netnews newsgroup names.</t>


<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

</section>

<section title="The X-IDNA Profile for Network News Group Names">

<section title="Applicability">

<t>This X-IDNA Profile (<xref target="I-D.teint-xidna-base"/>) applies to
newsgroup names defined in <xref target="RFC3977"/> and <xref target="RFC5536"/>,
i.e. to the following syntax elements:

<list style="symbols">

<t>the &lt;newsgroup-name&gt; and &lt;wildmat&gt; syntax elements defined in
Section 9.8 of <xref target="RFC3977"/> (includes the "group" and "wildmat"
parameters to the "GROUP", "LISTGROUP", "NEWNEWS" and "LIST" commands).</t>

<t>the &lt;newsgroup-name&gt; defined in Section 3.1.4 of <xref target="RFC5536"/></t>
</list>

It also applies to other specifications based on these definitions (or their
precedessors) if the elements are to be used as newsgroup names.</t>

</section>

<section title="Normalisation">
<t>Newsgroup names do not require normalisation.</t>
</section>

<section title="Validation" anchor="valid">

<t>Validation of internationalised newsgroup names is the responsibility of
whoever creates a newsgroup:

<list style="symbols">

<t>for distributed newsgroups, the person sending out the "newgroup" and
"checkgroup" control messages (Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.3 of <xref target="RFC5537"/>)</t>
<t>for local newsgroups, the person creating the newsgroup on the server</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>The following types newsgroup names SHOULD not be created:<list style="symbols">

<t>newsgroup names containing R-LDH-Labels and fake A-Labels</t>
<t>newsgroup names containing uppercase ASCII characters and extended characters</t>

</list>
</t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="Submitting Messages to Moderators">

<t><list style="empty"><t>This section is non-normative.</t></list></t>

<t>A common method for deriving the email address of the moderator of a group,
which is described in a NOTE in section 3.5.1 of <xref target="RFC5537"/>, is
forming the submission address for a moderated group by replacing each "." in
the newsgroup name with "-" and then using that value as the &lt;local-part&gt; of
a &lt;mailbox&gt; formed by appending a set domain.</t>

<t>When a forwarding service supports newsgroups the name of which is
internationalised, they ought to provide two different addresses to accomodate
both X-IDNA-aware and X-IDNA-unaware users:

<list style="symbols"> <t>the result of replacing "." with "-" in the U-Address
form of the newsgroup name</t> <t>the result of replacing "." with "-" in the
A-Address form of the newsgroup name, which will usually result in fake
A-Labels</t> </list>

NOTE: This method not only produces fake labels, which are discouraged in <xref
target="I-D.teint-xidna-email"/>, but can also produce clashes where newsgroup
names only differ in "-" and "." characters.</t>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<section title="Visually Similar Characters">

<t>By using visually similar characters, an attacker can create newsgroup names
that are confusingly similar to other newsgroup names and newsgroup hierarchies
that are confusingly similar to other hierarchies.</t>

<t>This may not only create a denial of service situation, where communication
fails because users are tricked into posting into different groups, but may
also create a leak for information where the distribution of the "fake"
newsgroup is wider than that of the indented group.</t>

<t>This issue most prominently occurs if a single newsgroup servers carries
multiple confusingly similar addresses. However, it can also occur if a user
agent combines newsgroup lists from multiple servers, such as a private
intranet NNTP server and a public, less trusted server, into a single list.
Furthermore, even if the user agent clearly identifies the server carrying the
group, users might still confuse the newsgroups when they see the familiar name
and don't pay attention to the server identification.</t>

<t>It is suggested that Netnews server operators take care not to carry
hierarchies that exploit confusingly similar newsgroup names.</t>

<t>In addition, user agent implementations ought to provide visual indications
where a domain name contains multiple scripts, especially when the scripts
contain characters that are easily confused visually, such as an omicron in
Greek mixed with Latin text.</t>

<t>See Section 4.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/> for further
information on visually similar characters.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
