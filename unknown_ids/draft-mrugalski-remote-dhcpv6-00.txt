                    Remote DHCPv6 Autoconfiguration
                    draft-mrugalski-remote-dhcpv6-00

Abstract

   This document describes remote autoconfiguration, using DHCPv6
   protocol.  Every time a node attaches to a new link, it must renew or
   obtain new address and parameters, using DHCPv6 protocol.  In case of
   mobile nodes, it is beneficial to obtain address and other
   configuration parameters remotely, before actually attaching to
   destination link.  This document defines new options required to
   remotely discover destination DHCPv6 servers.  Remote unicast
   configuration with DHCPv6 servers is also defined.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft       Remote DHCPv6 Autoconfiguration           July 2010


1.  Introduction

   When mobile IPv6 node (MN) changes its location, signal quality and
   other metrics fluctuate and handover decision is made.  During normal
   handover procedure, data link layer (e.g. 802.16) initiates and
   performs handover procedure.  This phase is often referred to as L2
   handover.  After such procedure is completed, network layer (e.g.
   IPv6) handover is performed.  After MN attaches to its new location,
   it tries to confirm old or obtain new configuration parameters, using
   DHCPv6 CONFIRM or SOLICIT messages.  After discovering available
   DHCPv6 servers, MN requests new address and possibly other
   configuration options.  Once DHCPv6 configuration is complete, it may
   start other handover related activities, like updating Correspondent
   Nodes (CN) using Binding Update procedure [RFC3775].  Doing
   aforementioned actions sequencially, delays introduced by each layer
   are adding up, resulting in a large overall delay.  This intrduces
   gaps in communication capabilites that should be avoided.


2.  Remote DHCPv6 Operation

   Client, while still connected to its old location, gains information
   about DHCPv6 servers located at possible handover destinations.  One
   of the possible ways to determine such addresses is specified in
   Section 2.1.  After gaining knowledge about potential destinations,
   client chooses one or more destinations and obtains configuration
   parameters from each chosen location, as defined in Section 2.2.

2.1.  Discovering Neighboring Networks

   Client, while still connected to its old location, sends regular
   SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW or REBIND message to its DHCPv6 server.
   Client includes OPTION_NEIGHBORS code in the transmitted ORO.  DHCPv6
   server responds with the list of addresses of DHCPv6 servers located
   at possible handover targets.  Such list is conveyed in
   OPTION_NEIGHBORS option.

2.2.  Remote Autoconfiguration

   Client communicates with remote DHCPv6 server, located at potential
   destination.  To do so, client transmits SOLICIT message to known
   server unicast address and includes OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF (defined
   in Section 3.  Server, supporting remote autoconfiguration responds
   as if the message was received locally, e.g. responds with ADVERTISE
   to client's SOLICIT message.  Client continues remote configuration
   using REQUEST or CONFIRM message.  Server concludes remote
   autoconfiguration by responding using REPLY message.

3.  DHCPv6 Options Format

   A DHCPv6 based solution is able to address the problems of lengthly
   reconfiguration, by allowing MN to remotely complete its DHCPv6
   configuration.

   Neighboring DHCPv6 server Address  One or more IPv6 address of the
             neighboring DHCPv6 servers.


4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Server MUST NOT send OPTION_NEIGHBOR to client, unless client
   explicitly requested such option.

   Server MUST respond to client message transmitted off-link if

Internet-Draft       Remote DHCPv6 Autoconfiguration           July 2010


   OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF option is included in client's message.

   Server MUST ignore off-link messages that does not contain
   OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF option.


5.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   Client supporting remote autoconfiguration, SHOULD request
   OPTION_NEIGHBORS every time it sends SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND
   or CONFIRM messages.

   Client MAY initiate remote autoconfiguration at its own discretion.
   Depending on client policy, that may be as soon as local
   configuration is completed, when radio signal quality degrades and
   handover is imminent or when other implementation specific conditions
   are met.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate two DHCPA option codes referencing this
   document: OPTION_NEIGHBORS and OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF.


7.  Security Considerations

   The overall security considerations discussed in [RFC3315] apply also
   to this document.  OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF may be used to attack know
   DHCPv6 server, but that does not differ from attacks directed at
   servers supporting unicast address option.

   Neither of the above considerations are new and specific to the
   proposed remote configuration option.  The mechanisms identified for
   securing DHCPv6 as well as reasonable checks performed by client
   implementations are deemed sufficient in addressing these problems.
