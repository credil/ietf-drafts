2.  Introduction

   Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an
   architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize
   information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding
   plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  [RFC3654] has defined
   the ForCES requirements, and [RFC3746] has defined the ForCES
   framework.

   The ForCES protocol works in a master-slave mode in which FEs are
   slaves and CEs are masters.  The protocol includes commands for
   transport of Logical Function Block (LFB) configuration information,
   association setup, status, and event notifications, etc.  The reader
   is encouraged to read FE-protocol [RFC5810] for further information.

   The FE-MODEL [RFC5812] presents a formal way to define FE Logical
   Function Blocks (LFBs) using XML.  LFB configuration components,
   capabilities, and associated events are defined when the LFB is
   formally created.  The LFBs within the FE are accordingly controlled
   in a standardized way by the ForCES protocol.

   The TML transports the PL messages.  The TML is where the issues of
   how to achieve transport level reliability, congestion control,
   multicast, ordering, etc. are handled.  It is expected that more than
   one TML will be standardized.  The various possible TMLs could vary
   their implementations based on the capabilities of underlying media
   and transport.  However, since each TML is standardized,
   interoperability is guaranteed as long as both endpoints support the
   same TML.  All ForCES Protocol Layer implementations MUST be portable
   across all TMLs.  Although more than one TML may be standardized for
   the ForCES Protocol, all ForCES implementations MUST implement the
   SCTP-TML [RFC5811].

   The Applicability Statement [I-D.ietf-forces-applicability] captures
   the applicable areas in which ForCES may be used.

2.1.  Document Goal

   This document captures the experience of implementing the ForCES
   protocol and model and it's main goal is not to tell others how to
   implement, but to provide alternatives, ideas and proposals as how it
   can be implemented.

   Also, this document mentions possible problems and potential choices
   that can be made, in an attempt to help implementors develop their
   own products.

   Additionally this document takes into account that the reader has

   become familiar with the three main ForCES RFCs, the FE-protocol
   [RFC5810], the FE-MODEL [RFC5812] and the SCTP-TML [RFC5811].

2.2.  Definitions

   This document follows the terminology defined by the ForCES
   Requirements in [RFC3654] and by the ForCES framework in [RFC3746].

3.  ForCES Architecture

   This section discusses the ForCES architecture, difficulties and how
   to overcome them.

3.1.  Pre-association setup - Initial Configuration

   The initial configuration of the FE and the CE respectively is done
   by the FE Manager and the CE Manager.  These entities has not as yet
   been standardized and anyone can build their own.  It is expected
   that somehow they will talk to each other and exchange details
   regarding the upcoming associations.  Any developer can create any
   Manager, but at least they should be able to exchange the following
   details:

   From the FE side:

   1.  FEID

   2.  FE IP, if your FE and CE will be communicating via network.

   3.  TML.  The TML that you will be using.  If you skip this, then
       SCTP MUST be chosen as default from the CE side.

   4.  Priority ports.  If you also skip this, then the CE MUST use the
       default ones from the respective TML RFC.

   From the CE side:

   1.  CEID

   2.  CE IP, if your FE and CE will be communicating via network.

   3.  TML.  The TML that you will be using.  If you skip this, then
       SCTP MUST be chosen as default from the FE side.

   4.  Priority ports.  If you also skip this, then the FE MUST use the
       default ones from the respective TML RFC.

3.2.  TML

   All ForCES implementations MUST support the SCTP as TML.  Even if
   another TML will be chosen by the developer, SCTP is mandatory and
   MUST be supported.

   There are several issues that should concern a developer for the TML.

Internet-Draft   ForCES Implementation Experience Draft         May 2010


   1.  Security.  TML must be secure according to the respective RFC.
       For SCTP you have to use IPSec.

   2.  NAT issues.  ForCES can be deployed everywhere and can run over
       SCTP/IP.  If you are behind a NAT, you must forward the TML
       priority ports to your CE who listens at these ports.  The issue
       is what happens to the ports that the FE uses.  Unless you bind
       the same port numbers to the FE, your FE would have a random port
       number.  This means that port forwarding to the FE must include
       all sctp ports.  The CE can be easily behind a NAT since it will
       bind the specific sctp ports.  In order for the FE to work, it
       must either have a global IP, or it must bind specific ports that
       are forwarded to it unless all sctp ports are forwarded to the
       FE.

3.3.  Model

   The model is very dynamic and can be used to model anything.  Using
   the basic atomic values that are defined, new datatypes can be built
   using atomic (single valued) and/or compound (structures and arrays).

   The difficulty is to create something that is completely scalable so
   a develeper doesn't need to write the same code for new LFBs, or for
   new components etc.  Just create code for the defined atomic values
   and then new components can be built based on already written code.

   The model itself provides the key which is inheritance.

3.3.1.  Components

   First, a basic component needs to be created as the mother of all the
   components with the basic parameters of all the components:

   o  The ID of the component.

   o  The access rights of that component.

   o  If it is of variable length.

   o  If it is an optional component.

   o  The size of its data.

   Next, some basic functions are in order:

   o  A common constructor.





Haleplidis, et al.      Expires November 13, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   ForCES Implementation Experience Draft         May 2010


   o  A common deconstructor.

   o  Retrieve Component ID.

   o  Retrieve access right property.

   o  Query if it is an optional component.

   o  Get Full Data.

   o  Set Full Data.

   o  Get Sparse Data.

   o  Set Sparse Data.

   o  Del Full Data.

   o  Del Sparse Data.

   o  Get Hardware Value.

   o  Set Hardware Value.

   o  Del Hardware Value.

   o  Get Data.

   o  Clone component.

   While almost all functions are logical, the last function seems out
   of place.  That function MUST return a new component that has the
   exact same values and attributes.  This function is especially useful
   in array components.

   Now any atomic datatype can be built as a child of that basic
   component which will inherit all the functions and if necessary
   override the mother's functions.

   Next struct components can be built.  A struct component is a
   component itself, but contains an array of basic components.  The ID
   of the component is the array index.  The Clone function must create
   and return a similar struct component.

   The most difficult component to be built is the array.  The
   difficulty lie in the actual benefit of the model.  You have absolute
   freedom over what you build.  An array is an array of components.  In
   all rows you have the exact same type of component either a single



Haleplidis, et al.      Expires November 13, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   ForCES Implementation Experience Draft         May 2010


   component or a specific struct.  The struct can have multiple basic
   components, or a combination of basic components, structs and arrays
   and so on.  So, the difficulty lies in how do to create a new row
   since the array is very dynamic.  This is where the clone function is
   very useful.  For the array you need a mother component.  Once a set
   command is received, the mother component can spawn a new component
   and adds them into the array, and with the set fulldata the value is
   set in the recently spawned component, as the spawned component knows
   how the data is created.

   Once the basic constructors of all possible components are created,
   then a developer only has to create his LFB components or datatypes
   as a child of one of the already created components and the only
   thing the developer really needs to add, is the three functions of
   Get/Set/Del hardware value of each component.  The rest is the same.

3.3.2.  LFBs

   The same architecture in the components can be used for the LFBs.
   The parent LFB has some basic attributes:

   o  The LFB Class ID.

   o  The LFB Instance ID.

   o  An Array of Components.

   Then some common functions:

      Handle Configuration Command.

      Handle Query Command.

      Get Class ID.

      Get Instance ID.

   Once these are created each LFB can inherit all these from the parent
   and the only thing it has to do is to add the components that have
   already been created.

   An example of this is the following.  The code next creates a part of
   FEProtocolLFB:

Internet-Draft   ForCES Implementation Experience Draft         May 2010


   //FEID
   cui = new Component_uInt(FEPO_FEID, ACCESS_READ_ONLY, FE_id);
   Components[cui->get_ComponentId()]=cui; //Add component

   //Current FEHB Policy Value
   cub = new Component_uByte(FEPO_FEHBPolicy, ACCESS_READ_WRITE, 0);
   Components[cub->get_ComponentId()]=cub; //Add component

   //FEIDs for BackupCEs Array
   cui = new Component_uInt(0, ACCESS_READ_WRITE, 0);
   ca = new Component_Array(FEPO_BackupCEs, ACCESS_READ_WRITE);
   ca->AddRow(cui, 1);
   ca->AddMotherComponent(cui);
   Components[ca->get_ComponentId()]=ca; //Add BackupCEs Array component

   Then all it is required is an LFBHandler that will have an array of
   all the LFBs:

   LFBs[ClassID][InstanceID][LFB].

3.4.  Protocol

3.4.1.  TLVs

   Since the model is so free to create anything the developer needs,
   the protocol itself has been created thus to provide the user the
   freedom to manipulate any component.  This creates some difficulties
   in developing a scalable architecture for handling the protocol
   messages.

   Another difficulty arises from the batching capabilities of the
   protocol.  You can have multiple Operations within a message, you can
   select more than one LFB to command, and more than one component to
   manipulate.

   A possible solution is again provided by inheritance.  There are two
   basic components in a protocol message.

   1.  A main header.

   2.  The rest of the packet.

   The rest of the packet is divided in Type-Length-Value (TLV) packets,
   and in one case Index-Length-Value (ILV) packets.

   The possible TLVs and ILVs the are described in detail in the forces
   protocol RFC.

Internet-Draft   ForCES Implementation Experience Draft         May 2010


   A TLV's main attributes are:

   o  Type

   o  Length

   o  Data

   o  An array of TLVs.

   The array of TLVs is the next level of TLVs for this TLV.

   A TLVs common function could be:

   o  A basic constructor.

   o  A constructor using data from the wire.

   o  Add a new TLV for next level.

   o  Get the next TLV of next level.

   o  Get a specific TLV of next level.

   o  Replace a TLV of next level.

   o  Get the Data.

   o  Get the Length.

   o  Set the Data.

   o  Set the Length.

   o  Set the Type.

   o  Serialize the header.

   o  Serialize the TLV to be written on the wire.

   Next all TLVs can inherit all these functions and attributes and
   either override them or create some new functions for each.

3.4.2.  Message Deserialization

   What follows is a the algorithm for deserializing any protocol
   message:




Haleplidis, et al.      Expires November 13, 2010              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   ForCES Implementation Experience Draft         May 2010


   1.  Get the message header.

   2.  Read the length.

   3.  Check the message type to understand what kind of packet this is.

   4.  If the length is larger than the message header then there is
       data for this packet.

   5.  A check can be made here regarding the message type and the
       length of the packet

3.4.2.1.  Config or Query

   If the packet is a Query or Config type then for this level there are
   LFBSelector TLVs:

   1.  Read the next 2 shorts(type-length).  If the type==LFBSelector
       then the message is valid.

   2.  Read the necessary length for this LFBSelector and create the
       LFBSelector from the data of the wire.

   3.  Add this LFBSelector to the mainheader array of LFBSelectors

   4.  Do this until the rest of the packet has finished.

   The next level of TLVs are Operation TLVs

   1.  Read the next 2 shorts(type-length).  If the type==OperationTLV
       then the message is valid.

   2.  Read the necessary length for this OperationTLV and create the
       OperationTLV from the data of the wire.

   3.  Add this OperationTLV to the LFBSelector array of TLVs.

   4.  Do this until the rest of the LFBSelector's Packet has finished.

   1.  Read the next 2 shorts(type-length).  If the type==PathData then
       the message is valid.

   2.  Read the necessary length for this PathDataTLV and create the
       PathDataTLV from the data of the wire.

   3.  Add this PathData TLV to the Operation TLV's array of TLVs.





Haleplidis, et al.      Expires November 13, 2010              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   ForCES Implementation Experience Draft         May 2010


   4.  Do this until the rest of the OperationTLV's Packet has finished.

   Here it gets interesting, as the next level of PathDataTLVs can be
   either:

   o  PathData TLVs.

   o  FullData TLV.

   o  SparseData TLV.

   o  Result TLVs

   The solution to this difficulty is recursion.  If the next TLV is
   PathData then the PathData that is created uses the same kind of
   deserialisation etc. until it reaches a FullData or SparseData.
   There can be only one FullDataTLV or SparseData within a PathData.

   1.  Read the next 2 shorts(type-length).

   2.  If the Type==PathDataTLV then do again the previous algorithm but
       add the PathDataTLV to this PathDataTLV's array of TLVs.

   3.  Do this until the rest of the PathData's Packet has finished.

   4.  If the Type==FullDataTLV create the FullData TLV from the packet
       and add this to the PathData's array of TLVs

   5.  If the Type==SparseDataTLV create the SparseData TLV from the
       packet and add this to the PathData's array of TLVs

   6.  If the Type==ResultTLV create the Result TLV from the packet and
       add this to the PathData's array of TLVs

   If the message is a Query it MUST not have any kind of data inside
   the PathData.

   If the message is a Query Response then it MUST either have a
   ResultTLV or a FullData TLV.

   If the message is a Config it MUST have inside either a FullDataTLV
   or a SparseData TLV.

   If the message is a Config Reponse, it MUST have inside a ResultTLV

   A developer should keep some limitations regarding Java.

   Java inherently does not support unsigned types.  A workaround this
   can be found in the creation of classes that do the translation of
   unsigned to java types.  The problem is that the unsigned long cannot
   be used as it is in the Java platform.  The proposed set of classes
   can be found in [Java Unsigned Types].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the ForCES framework in [RFC3746] and
   FE-protocol [RFC5810] are applicable in this document.  Implementers
   or users of ForCES FEs and CEs should take these considerations into
   account.

   Also, as specified in the security considerations section of the
   SCTP-TML RFC [RFC5811] the transport-level security, has to be
   ensured by TLS (Transport Layer Security).
