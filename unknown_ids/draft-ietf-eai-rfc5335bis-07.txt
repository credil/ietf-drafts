                      draft-ietf-eai-rfc5335bis-07

Abstract

   Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the
   capabilities to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected
   information in specific header fields, and to use non-ASCII
   characters in envelope addresses.  It also requires being able to
   express those addresses and the information based on them in mail
   header fields.  This document specifies a variant of Internet mail
   that permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than ASCII,
   as the base form for Internet email header field.  This form is
   permitted in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP extension, as
   specified in an associated specification.  This specification updates
   Section 6.4 of [RFC2045] to conform with the requirements.

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers              December 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Role of This Specification

   Full internationalization of electronic mail requires several
   capabilities:

   o  The capability to transmit non-ASCII content, provided for as part
      of the basic MIME specification [RFC2045], [RFC2046].

   o  The capability to use international characters in envelope
      addresses, discussed in [I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis] and
      specified in [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis].

   o  The capability to express those addresses, and information related
      to them and based on them, in mail header fields, defined in this
      document.

   This document specifies a variant of Internet mail that permits the
   use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629], rather than ASCII, as the
   base form for Internet email header fields.  This form is permitted
   in transmission, if authorized by the SMTP extension specified in
   [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis] or by other transport mechanisms capable of
   processing it.

1.2.  Relation to Other Standards

   This document updates Section 6.4 of [RFC2045].  It removes the
   blanket ban on applying a content-transfer-encoding to all subtypes
   of message/ and instead specifies that a composite subtype MAY
   specify whether or not a content-transfer-encoding can be used for
   that subtype, with "cannot be used" as the default.

   This document also updates Section 3.4 of [RFC5322].  It Extended
   mailbox address syntax to permit UTF-8 character in Section 4.3.

   Allowing use of a content-transfer-encoding on subtypes of messages
   is not limited to transmissions that are authorized by the SMTP
   extension specified in [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis]. message/global (see
   Section 4.6) permits use of a content-transfer-encoding.

2.  Background and History

   Mailbox names often represent the names of human users.  Many of
   these users throughout the world have names that are not normally
   expressed with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would
   like to use more or less their real names in their mailbox names.
   These users are also likely to use non-ASCII text in their display

   names and subjects of email messages, both received and sent.  This
   protocol specifies UTF-8 as the encoding to represent email header
   field bodies.

   The traditional format of email messages [RFC5322] allows only ASCII
   characters in the header fields of messages.  This prevents users
   from having email addresses that contain non-ASCII characters.  It
   further forces non-ASCII text in display names, comments, and in free
   text (such as in the "Subject:" field) to be encoded (as required by
   MIME format [RFC2047]).  This specification describes a change to the
   email message format that is related to the SMTP message transport
   change described in the associated documents
   [I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis] and [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis], and that
   allows non-ASCII characters in most email header fields.  These
   changes affect SMTP clients, SMTP servers, mail user agents (MUAs),
   list expanders, gateways to other media, and all other processes that
   parse or handle email messages.

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis], an SMTP protocol extension
   "UTF8SMTP" is used to prevent the transmission of messages with UTF-8
   header fields to systems that cannot handle such messages.

   Use of this SMTP extension helps prevent the introduction of such
   messages into message stores that might misinterpret, improperly
   display, or mangle such messages.  It should be noted that using an
   ESMTP extension does not prevent transferring email messages with
   UTF-8 header fields to other systems that use the email format for
   messages and that may not be upgraded, such as unextended POP and
   IMAP servers.  Changes to these protocols to handle UTF-8 header
   fields are addressed in [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5721bis] and
   [I-D.ietf-eai-5378bis].

   The objective for this protocol is to allow UTF-8 in email header
   fields.

3.  Terminology

   A plain ASCII string is full compatible with [RFC5321] and [RFC5322].
   In this document, non-ASCII strings are UTF-8 strings if they are in
   header which contain at least one <UTF8-non-ascii>.

   Unless otherwise noted, all terms used here are defined in [RFC5321],
   [RFC5322], [I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis], or
   [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Changes on Message Header Fields

   SMTP clients can send header fields in UTF-8 format, if the UTF8SMTP
   extension is advertised by the SMTP server or is permitted by other
   transport mechanisms.

   This protocol does NOT change the [RFC5322] rules for defining header
   field names.  The bodies of header fields are allowed to contain
   UTF-8 characters, but the header field names themselves must contain
   only ASCII characters.

   To permit UTF-8 characters in field values, the header definition in
   [RFC5322] is extended to support the new format.  The following ABNF
   is defined to substitute those definitions in [RFC5322].

   The syntax rules not covered in this section remain as defined in
   [RFC5322].

4.1.  UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization

   UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms of octets using the
   following ABNF [RFC5234], taken from [RFC3629]:


   UTF8-non-ascii  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

   UTF8-2          =   <See Section 4 of RFC3629>

   UTF8-3          =   <See Section 4 of RFC3629>

   UTF8-4          =   <See Section 4 of RFC3629>

   See [RFC5198] for a discussion of normalization; the use of
   normalization form [NFC] is RECOMMENDED.  Actually, if one is going
   to do internationalization properly, one of the most often-cited
   goals is to permit people to spell their names correctly.  Since many
   mailbox local parts reflect personal names, that principle applies as
   well.  And NFKC is not recommended because it may lose information
   that is needed to correctly spell some names in unusual
   circumstances.

4.2.  Changes on MIME Headers

   This specification updates Section 6.4 of [RFC2045].  [RFC2045]
   prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding to any subtypes of
   "message/".  This specification relaxes the rule -- it allows newly
   defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding, and it allows
   content-transfer-encoding for message/global (see Section 4.6).

   Background: Normally, transfer of message/global will be done in
   8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will have "identity" encodings,
   that is, no decoding is necessary.  In the case where a message
   containing a message/global is downgraded from 8-bit to 7-bit as
   described in [RFC1652], an encoding may be applied to the message; if
   the message travels multiple times between a 7-bit environment and an
   environment implementing UTF8SMTP, multiple levels of encoding may
   occur.  This is expected to be rarely seen in practice, and the
   potential complexity of other ways of dealing with the issue are
   thought to be larger than the complexity of allowing nested encodings
   where necessary.

4.3.  Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322

   The following rules are intended to extend the corresponding rules in
   [RFC5322] in order to allow UTF-8 characters.

   FWS     =  <see Section 3.2.2 of RFC 5322>

   CFWS    =  <see Section 3.2.2 of RFC 5322>

   ctext   =/  UTF8-non-ascii
               ; Extending ctext in RFC 5322, Section 3.2.2
   comment =   "(" *([FWS] uCcontent) [FWS] ")"

   word    =   uAtom / uQuoted-String


   This means that all the [RFC5322] constructs that build upon these
   will permit UTF-8 characters, including comments and quoted strings.
   We do not change the syntax of <atext> in order to allow UTF-8
   characters in <addr-spec>.  This would also allow UTF-8 characters in
   <message-id>, which is not allowed due to the limitation described in
   Section 4.5.  Instead, <uAtext> is added to meet this requirement.

   uText          = %d1-9 /    ; all UTF-8 characters except
                    %d11-12 /  ; US-ASCII NUL, CR, and LF
                    %d14-127 /
                    UTF8-non-ascii

   uQuoted-Pair   = ("\" (VCHAR / WSP / UTF8-non-ascii )) / obs-qp

   VCHAR          = <See appendix B.1 of RFC 5234>

   WSP            = <See appendix B.1 of RFC 5234>

   uQtext         = qtext / UTF8-non-ascii

   uAtext         = ALPHA / DIGIT /
                    "!" / "#" /  ; Any character except
                    "$" / "%" /  ; controls, SP, and specials.
                    "&" / "'" /  ; Used for atoms.
                    "*" / "+" /
                    "-" / "/" /
                    "=" / "?" /
                    "^" / "_" /
                    "`" / "{" /
                    "|" / "}" /
                    "~" /
                    UTF8-non-ascii

   uAtom          = [CFWS] 1*uAtext [CFWS]

   uDot-Atom      = [CFWS] uDot-Atom-text [CFWS]

   uDot-Atom-text = 1*uAtext *("." 1*uAtext)


   To allow the use of UTF-8 in a Content-Description header field
   [RFC2045], the following syntax is used:


   description    = "Content-Description" ":" *uText
                   ; Replace description in RFC 2045, Section 8

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers              December 2010


   The <uText> syntax is extended above to allow UTF-8 in all
   <description> header fields.

   Note, however, this does not remove any constraint on the character
   set of protocol elements; for instance, all the allowed values for
   timezone in the "Date:" header fields are still expressed in ASCII.
   And also, none of this revised syntax changes what is allowed in a
   <msg-id>, which will still remain in pure ASCII.

4.4.  Change on addr-spec Syntax

   Internationalized email addresses are represented in UTF-8.  Thus,
   all header fields containing <mailbox>es are updated from [RFC5321]
   Section 4.1.2 to permit UTF-8 addresses.

   mailbox        = name-addr / addr-spec / uAddr-Spec
                    ; Replace mailbox in RFC 5322, Section 3.4

   angle-addr     =/ [CFWS] "<" uAddr-Spec ">" [CFWS]
                    ; Extending angle-addr in RFC 5322, Section 3.4

   uAddr-Spec     = uLocal-Part "@" uDomain

   uLocal-Part    = uDot-Atom / uQuoted-String / obs-local-part
                    ; Replace Local-Part in RFC 5322, Section 3.4.1

   uQuoted-String = [CFWS] DQUOTE *([FWS] uQcontent) [FWS] DQUOTE [CFWS]

   obs-local-part = <See Section 4.4 of RFC 5322>
   uDomain        = uDot-Atom / domain-literal / obs-domain

   domain-literal = <See Section 3.4.1 of RFC 5322>


   Below are a few examples of possible <mailbox> representations.



      "DISPLAY_NAME" <ASCII@ASCII>
      ; traditional mailbox format

      "DISPLAY_NAME" <non-ASCII@non-ASCII>
      ; message will be rejected if UTF8SMTP extension is not supported

      <non-ASCII@non-ASCII>
      ; without DISPLAY_NAME and quoted string
      ; message will be rejected if UTF8SMTP extension is not supported

4.5.  Trace Field Syntax

   The 'uFor' clause in "Received:" fields has been allowed the use of
   internationalized addresses in "For" fields.  It described in
   [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis], Section 3.6.3.

   The "Return-path" designates the address to which messages indicating
   non-delivery or other mail system failures are to be sent.  Thus, the
   header is augmented to carry UTF-8 addresses (see the revised syntax
   of <angle-addr> in Section 4.4 of this document).  This will not
   break the rule of trace field integrity, because the header field is
   added at the last MTA and described in [RFC5321].

   The <received-token> on "Received:" field ( described in Section
   3.6.7 of [RFC5322]) syntax is augmented to allow UTF-8 email address
   in the "For" field. <angle-addr> is augmented to include UTF-8 email
   address.  In order to allow UTF-8 email addresses in an <addr-spec>,
   <uAddr-Spec> is added to <received-token>.


   received-token =/ uAddr-Spec

4.6.  message/global

   Internationalized messages MUST only be transmitted as authorized by
   [I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis] or within a non-SMTP environment which
   supports these messages.  A message is a "message/global message", if

   o  it contains UTF-8 header values as specified in this document, or

   o  it contains UTF-8 values in the headers fields of body parts.

   The type message/global is similar to message/rfc822, except that it
   specifies that a message can contain UTF-8 characters in the headers
   of the message or body parts.  If this type is sent to a 7-bit-only
   system, it has to be encoded in MIME [RFC2045].  (Note that a system
   compliant with MIME that doesn't recognize message/global SHOULD
   treat it as "application/octet-stream" as described in Section 5.2.4
   of [RFC2046].)

   Type name:  message

   Subtype name:  global

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  none

   Encoding considerations:  Any content-transfer-encoding is permitted.
      The 8-bit or binary content-transfer-encodings are recommended
      where permitted.

   Security considerations:  See Section 5.

   Interoperability considerations:  The media type provides
      functionality similar to the message/rfc822 content type for email
      messages with international email headers.  When there is a need
      to embed or return such content in another message, there is
      generally an option to use this media type and leave the content
      unchanged or down-convert the content to message/rfc822.  Both of
      these choices will interoperate with the installed base, but with
      different properties.  Systems unaware of internationalized
      headers will typically treat a message/global body part as an
      unknown attachment, while they will understand the structure of a
      message/rfc822.  However, systems that understand message/global
      will provide functionality superior to the result of a down-
      conversion to message/rfc822.  The most interoperable choice
      depends on the deployed software.

   Published specification:  RFC XXXX

   Applications that use this media type:  SMTP servers and email
      clients that support multipart/report generation or parsing.
      Email clients which forward messages with international headers as
      attachments.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s):  none

   File extension(s):  The extension ".u8msg" is suggested.

   Macintosh file type code(s):  A uniform type identifier (UTI) of
      "public.utf8-email-message" is suggested.  This conforms to
      "public.message" and "public.composite-content", but does not
      necessarily conform to "public.utf8-plain-text".

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  This is a structured media type which embeds
      other MIME media types.  The 8-bit or binary content-transfer-
      encoding SHOULD be used unless this media type is sent over a
      7-bit-only transport.

5.  Security Considerations

   If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and an ASCII mailbox
   address, a digital certificate that identifies that user may have
   both addresses in the identity.  Having multiple email addresses as
   identities in a single certificate is already supported in PKIX
   (Public Key Infrastructure for X.509 Certificates) [RFC5280] and
   OpenPGP [RFC3156].

   Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to encode a single
   character, internationalized local parts and header value may cause
   mail addresses to become longer.  As specified in [RFC5322], each
   line of characters MUST be no more 998 octets, excluding the CRLF.
   On the other hand, MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) processes that parse,
   store, or handle email addresses or local parts must take extra care
   not to overflow buffers, truncate addresses, or exceed storage
   allotments.  Also, they must take care, when comparing, to use the
   entire lengths of the addresses.

   The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature systems such
   as Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP is
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis], Section 14.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the registration of the message/global
   MIME type using the registration form contained in Section 4.6.
