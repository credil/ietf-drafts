Internet-Draft               SRV for CalDAV                February 2010


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4791] defines the CalDAV Calendar Access protocol, based on HTTP
   [RFC2616], for accessing calendar data stored on a server.  CalDAV
   clients need to be able to discover appropriate CalDAV servers within
   their local area network and at other domains, e.g., to minimize the
   need for end users to know specific details such as the fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN) and port for their servers.

   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav] defines the CardDAV vCard Access protocol
   based on HTTP [RFC2616], for accessing contact data stored on a
   server.  As with CalDAV, clients also need to be able to discover
   CardDAV servers.

   [RFC2782] defines a DNS-based service discovery protocol that has
   been widely adopted as a means of locating particular services within
   a local area network and beyond, using DNS SRV Resource Records
   (RRs).

   This specification defines new SRV service types for the CalDAV
   protocol, and gives an example of how clients can use this together
   with other protocol features to enable simple client configuration.
   SRV service types for CardDAV are already defined in Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav].

   Another issue with CalDAV or CardDAV service discovery is that the
   service may not be located at the "root" URI of the HTTP server
   hosting it.  For example, if CalDAV is implemented as a "servlet" in
   a web server "container", the servlet "context path" might be
   "/caldav/".  So the URI for the CalDAV service would be, e.g.,
   "http://caldav.example.com/caldav/" rather than
   "http://caldav.example.com/".  SRV RRs by themselves only provide a
   FQDN and port for the service, not a path.  Since the client
   "bootstrapping" process requires initial access to the "context path"
   of the service, there needs to be a simple way for clients to also
   discover what that path is.

   This specification makes use of the "well known URI" feature
   [I-D.nottingham-site-meta] of HTTP servers to provide a well known
   URI for CalDAV or CardDAV services that clients can make use of.  The
   well known URI will point to a resource on the server that might be
   the actual "context path" of the CalDAV or CardDAV service, or it
   might simply be a "stub" resource that provides a redirect to the
   actual "context path".

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  CalDAV SRV Service Labels

   This specification adds two SRV service labels for use with CalDAV:

   _caldav:  Identifies a CalDAV server that uses HTTP without transport
      layer security ([RFC2818]).

   _caldavs:  Identifies a CalDAV server that uses HTTP with transport
      layer security ([RFC2818]).

   Clients SHOULD honor "Priority" and "Weight" values in the SRV RRs,
   as described by [RFC2782].

   Example: service record for server without transport layer security

       _caldav._tcp     SRV 0 1 80 calendar.example.com.

   Example: service record for server with transport layer security

       _caldavs._tcp    SRV 0 1 443 calendar.example.com.

4.  CalDAV and CardDAV Service Well-Known URI

   Two "well-known" URIs are registered by this specification for CalDAV
   and CardDAV services, "caldav" and "carddav" respectively (see
   Section 8).  These URIs point to a resource that the client can use
   as the "context path" for the service they are trying to connect to.
   The actual service could be located at that specific path.
   Alternatively the server MAY redirect HTTP requests for that resource
   (using the "301 Moved Permanently" status response) to the actual
   "context path".  Clients MUST handle HTTP redirects on the well-known
   URI.

4.1.  Example: well-known URI as context path

   A CalDAV server has a "context path" that is the same as the well-
   known URI, so the client will use "/.well-known/caldav" as the path
   for its "bootstrapping" process after it has first found the FQDN and
   port via an SRV lookup.

Internet-Draft               SRV for CalDAV                February 2010


4.2.  Example: well-known URI redirects to actual context path

   A CalDAV server has a "context path" that is "/servlet/caldav".  The
   client will use "/.well-known/caldav" as the path for its
   "bootstrapping" process after it has first found the FQDN and port
   via an SRV lookup.  When the client makes its initial HTTP request
   against "/.well-known/caldav", the server would issue an HTTP 301
   redirect response with a Location response header using the path
   "/servlet/caldav".  The client would then "follow" this redirect to
   the new resource and continue making HTTP requests there to complete
   its "bootstrapping" process.

5.  Client "Bootstrapping" Guidelines

   This section describes a procedure that CalDAV or CardDAV clients MAY
   use to do their initial configuration based on minimal user input.
   The goal is to determine an http: or https: URI that describes the
   full path to the user's principal-URI [RFC3744].

   For a CalDAV server, minimal input from a user would consist of a
   calendar user address.  A calendar user address is defined by
   iCalendar [RFC5545] to be a URI [RFC3986].  Provided a user
   identifier and a domain name can be extracted from the URI, this
   simple "bootstrap" configuration can be done.

   If the calendar user address is a "mailto:" [RFC2368] URI, the
   "mailbox" portion of the URI is examined and the "local-part" and
   "domain" portions extracted.

   If the calendar user address is an "http:" [RFC2616] or "https:"
   [RFC2818] URI, the "userinfo" and "host" portion of the URI is
   extracted.

   For a CardDAV server, minimal input from a user would consist of
   their email address [RFC5322] for the domain where the CardDAV
   service is hosted.  The "mailbox" portion of the email address is
   examined and the "local-part" and "domain" portions extracted.

   Once the user input has been processed, the following is done:

   o  An SRV lookup for _caldavs._tcp (for CalDAV) or _carddavs._tcp
      (for CardDAV) is done with the user provided "domain" as the
      service domain.

   o  If no result is found for that, the client can try _caldav._tcp
      (for CalDAV) or _carddav._tcp (for CardDAV) provided non-SSL
      connections are appropriate.

   o  If an SRV record is returned, the client extracts the target FQDN
      and port number.  If an SRV record is not found, the client will
      need to prompt the user to enter the FQDN and port information
      directly, or use some other heuristic.  In the case of multiple
      SRV records returned, the client MUST use the priority and weight
      fields in the record to determine which one to pick (as per
      [RFC2782]).

   o  Subsequent to configuration, the client will make HTTP requests to
      the service.  When using "_caldavs" or "_carddavs" services, a
      transport layer security negotiation is done immediately upon
      connection.  Certificate verification MUST use the procedure
      outlined in Section XXX of [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check] in
      regard to verification with an SRV RR as the starting point.

   o  The client will need to make authenticated HTTP requests to the
      service.  Typically a "user identifier" is required for some form
      of user/password authentication.  When a user identifier is
      required, clients MUST first use the "mailbox" portion of the
      calendar user address provided by the user in the case of a
      "mailto:" address, and if that results in an authentication
      failure, SHOULD fall back to using the "local-part" extracted from
      the "mailto:" address.  For an "http:" or "https:" calendar user
      address, the "userinfo" portion is used as the user identifier for
      authentication.  This is in line with the guidance outlined in
      Section 6.  If both these user identifiers result in
      authentication failure, the client SHOULD prompt the user for a
      valid identifier.

   o  The client does an authenticated "PROPFIND" [RFC4918] request with
      a request URI of "/.well-known/caldav" (for CalDAV) or "/.well-
      known/carddav" (for CardDAV).  The body of the request should
      include the DAV:current-user-principal [RFC5397] property as one
      of the properties to return.  Note that clients MUST properly
      handle HTTP redirect responses for the request.

   o  If the server returns a 404 Not Found HTTP status response to the
      request on the well-known URI, clients MAY try repeating the
      request on the "root" URI "/" or prompt the user for a suitable
      path.

   o  If the DAV:current-user-principal property is returned on the
      initial request, the client uses that value for the principal-URI
      of the authenticated user.  With that, it can execute a "PROPFIND"
      request on the principal-URI and discover additional properties
      for configuration.

Internet-Draft               SRV for CalDAV                February 2010


   o  If the DAV:current-user-principal property is not returned, then
      the client will need to request the principal-URI path from the
      user in order to continue with configuration.

6.  Guidance for Service Providers

   Service providers wanting to offer CalDAV or CardDAV services that
   can be configured by clients using SRV records need to follow certain
   guidelines to ensure proper operation.

   o  CalDAV or CardDAV servers SHOULD be configured to allow
      authentication with calendar user addresses (just the "mailbox"
      portion of a "mailto:" URI) or "user identifiers" extracted from
      them.  In the former case, the addresses MUST NOT conflict with
      other forms of permitted user login name.  In the latter case, the
      extracted "user identifiers" need to be unique across the server
      and MUST NOT conflict with any login name on the server.

   o  If the service provider uses transport layer security, the service
      provider MUST ensure a certificate is installed that can be
      verified by clients using the procedure outlined in Section XXX of
      [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check] in regard to verification
      with an SRV RR as the starting point.

   o  Install the appropriate SRV records for the offered services.

7.  Security Considerations

   Clients that support transport layer security as defined by [RFC2818]
   SHOULD try the "_caldavs" or "_carddavs" services first before trying
   the "_caldav" or "_carddav" services respectively.  If a user has
   explicitly requested a connection with transport layer security, the
   client MUST NOT use any service information returned for the
   "_caldav" or "_carddav" services.  Clients MUST follow the
   certificate verification process specified in
   [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check].

   A malicious attacker with access to the DNS server data, or able to
   get spoofed answers cached in a recursive resolver, can potentially
   cause clients to connect to any server chosen by the attacker.  In
   the absence of a secure DNS option, clients SHOULD check that the
   target FQDN returned in the SRV record matches the original service
   domain that was queried.  If the target FQDN is not in the queried
   domain, clients SHOULD verify with the user that the SRV target FQDN
   is suitable for use before executing any connections to the host.
   Alternatively, if transport layer security is being used for the
   service, clients MUST use the procedure outlined in Section XXX of
   [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check] to verify the service.
