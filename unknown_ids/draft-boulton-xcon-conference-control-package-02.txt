Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package          February 2008


1.  Introduction

   As part of the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) work group in the IETF
   a Data Model[5] has been created for the purpose of modeling
   conference based services in a standard way.  The XCON group also
   requires a standards based mechanism that will enable third party
   conference clients participating to interoperate with conference
   servers and manipulate conference parameters.

   The Media Control (MEDIACTRL) Work Group within the IETF has the
   explicit goal of creating an architecture and framework for
   controlling Media Servers.  As part of this work a Control Channel
   Framework[7] has been created that is based on the Session Initiation
   protocol (SIP).  It uses SIP to setup, maintain and terminate a
   reliable control channel for the purpose of exchanging control based
   interactions.  The Control Framework provides an extension template
   for creating extensions that specify the semantic detail associated
   with the operations.  The extension documents are known as Control
   Packages and an example is the 'Basic IVR Control Package'[8].  This
   document will specify a Control Package for Conference Control by
   participating clients using the SIP Control Framework.

   The Media Control Channel Framework provides the ideal mechanism for
   reliably exchanging control messages between a conference client and
   server.  It provides inherent properties such as:

   o  Reliable delivery of control messages.
   o  Lightweight Protocol Data Units (PDU).
   o  Linked asynchronous transactional mechanism.
   o  Asynchronous event mechanism.

   The SIP Control Framework uses SIP as its overlying rendezvous
   mechanism.  This provides all the inherent benefits like:

   o  SIP Service Location - Use SIP Proxies or Back-to-Back User Agents
      for discovering Control Servers..
   o  SIP Security Mechanisms - Leverage established security mechanisms
      such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Client Authentication.
   o  Connection Maintenance - The ability to re-negotiate a connection,
      ensure it is active, audit parameters, and so forth.
   o  Agnostic - Allows for ease of extension.

   Not only is the Media Control Channel Framework an ideal mechanism
   for controlling conference instances by participating clients, it
   also provides the property of re-use by conferencing systems of
   functionality implemented for controlling Media Servers etc.  This
   includes re-using the SIP stack for control channel setup as well as
   the Control Channel Framework stack for receiving/sending the PDUs

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package          February 2008


   for multiple control packages in an XCON conference system.

   It should be noted that this mechanism is a complementary technology
   to that specified in the document 'A Centralized Conferencing
   Manipulation Protocol (CCMP)'[9].  In fact this specification simply
   re-uses the SOAP bindings created in that document for a consistent
   view (so just the transport mechanism is different).  While the
   mechanism defined in [9] is ideal for certain network deployments
   (for example Service Orientated Architectures), it is important to
   offer an alternative access method for clients with non SOA based
   technologies.  Using the SIP Control Framework provides consistency
   across both XCON and MEDIACTRL work groups.


2.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology defined in the framework and
   data model for centralized conferencing [6].  In addition, the
   following acronyms and terms are used in this document:

   SOAP:  Simple Object Access Protocol.
   WSDL:  Web Services Description Language.  WSDL is an XML format for
      describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on
      messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented
      information.


4.  Overview

   The use of the Media Control Channel Framework offers an ideal
   mechanism for creating, deleting and manipulating XCON conference
   instances by participating clients.  As the Control Channel Framework
   is a generic mechanism, this section provides non-normative detail
   showing how the Control Channel Framework can be applied to this
   particular use-case.  In [6], two distinct roles are defined - A
   'Control Client' and a 'Control Server'.  Such roles are
   interchangeable between entities within a session depending on
   package requirements.  A simple diagram is illustrated in Figure 1

   The XCON Conference Control package will cast a participating XCON
   compliant User Agent that wishes to control a conference instance as
   a 'Control Client' as defined in the SIP Control Framework.  It will
   have permission to generate and issue commands in CONTROL messages as
   defined in Section 5.2 of this document.  It will also have the
   ability to receive responses to Conference Package CONTROL requests
   that are contained in either appropriate responses or subsequent
   REPORT messages, also specified in Section 5.2.  The specific format
   of the conference control messages and responses are defined in
   Section 5.4 and Section 5.5.  They re-use the format specified in
   CCMP[9].  This provides a common binding set with alternative access
   mechanism depending on client requirements.  The previous diagram can
   be updated as illustrated in Figure 2.

5.  Control Package Detail

   The Media Control Channel Framework defines rules that Control
   Package extensions must provide mandatory information as described in
   section 10 of [7].  This section fulfills the obligation.

5.1.  Control Package Name

   The SIP Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify and register a unique package name.  The name and version of
   this Control Package is "xcon-conf-control/1.0".

5.2.  Framework Message Usage

   The Conference Control package uses the SOAP WSDL [2] defined in
   CCMP[9].  To maintain the consistency with the design of the WSDL the
   SIP Control Framework messages will be applied in a similar manner.
   The CONTROL message will be used to contain requests that enable
   conference manipulation - as specified in Section 5.4 and can only
   travel from the client to a Conferencing System.  Responses, as
   specified in Section 5.5, can only travel from the Conferencing
   System to an expectant client.  Depending on the time it takes to
   process the request (as specified in [7]), responses can either be
   contained in a Control Framework 200 response or subsequent REPORT
   method.

5.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

   This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 16.1 of [7] MUST
   NOT be supported for media dialogs and conferences.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: This document could make use of the Conf common schema
   TBD.

5.4.  Control Message Bodies

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the WSDL defined in [9].
   To be precise, the CONTROL message body MUST comply only to the
   'input' element of the WSDL portType (CCMPPortType).

5.5.  REPORT Message Bodies

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the WSDL defined in [9].
   To be precise, the REPORT message body MUST comply only to the

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package          February 2008


   'output' element of the WSDL portType (CCMPPortType).

5.6.  Examples

   TODO


6.  IANA Considerations

   TODO


7.  Security Considerations

   Access to conference control functionality needs to be tightly
   controlled to avoid attackers disrupting conferences, adding
   themselves to conferences or engaging in theft of services.

   The Framework for Centralized Conferencing [6] specifies that the
   protocols used for manipulation and retrieval of confidential
   information MUST support a confidentiality and integrity mechanism.
   To support the confidentiality and integrity requirements, all
   conference control information included in the package defined in
   this document SHOULD be carried over TLS.

   Editor's Note: once the security requirements for the control
   packages are further specified in the Control Framework for SIP [7]
   additional information may be added to this section.

   There are also security issues associated with the authorization to
   perform actions on the conferencing system to invoke specific
   capabilities.  Implementers SHOULD deploy standard SOAP
   authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only
   authorized entities are able to manipulate the data.
