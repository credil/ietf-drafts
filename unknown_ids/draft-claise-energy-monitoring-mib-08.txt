     1. Introduction 

        This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
        Base (MIB) for use in energy management of devices within or 
        connected to communication networks.  The MIB modules in this 
        document are designed to provide a model for energy management, 
        which includes monitoring for power state and energy consumption 
        of networked elements.  This MIB takes into account the Power 
        Management Architecture [EMAN-FRAMEWORK], which in turn, is 
        based on the Power Monitoring Requirements [EMAN-REQ] . 
         
        Energy management is applicable to devices in communication 
        networks.  Target devices for this specification include (but 
        are not limited to): routers, switches, Power over Ethernet 
        (PoE) endpoints, protocol gateways for building management 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011          [Page 3] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        systems, intelligent meters, home energy gateways, hosts and 
        servers, sensor proxies, etc.   
         
        Where applicable, device monitoring extends to the individual 
        components of the device and to any attached dependent devices. 
        For example: A device can contain components that are 
        independent from a power-state point of view, such as line 
        cards, processor cards, hard drives.  A device can also have 
        dependent attached devices, such as a switch with PoE endpoints 
        or a power distribution unit with attached endpoints. 
         
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power-related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB, even though the ENTITY MIB compliance is not a 
        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The requirements in [EMAN-
        REQ] cover devices typically found in communications networks, 
        such as switches, routers, and various connected endpoints.  For 
        a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it should also 
        apply to facility meters, power distribution units, gateway 
        proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.  Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this 
        document is broader than that specified in [EMAN-REQ].  Several 
        use cases for Energy Management have been identified in the 
        "Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement" [EMAN-AS].

     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        Some of these scenarios are presented later in Section 8. " 
        Implementation Scenarios". 
         
         
     4. Terminology 

        The definitions of basic terms like Power Monitor, Power Monitor 
        Parent, Power Monitor Child, Power Monitor Meter Domain, Power 
        State can be found in the Power Management Architecture [EMAN-
        FRAMEWORK]. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: it is foreseen that some more term will follow 
        such a Proxy, Aggregator, Energy Management, etc... 
      
        Power State Series 
         
          A Power State Series is defined as a well known sequence of 
          incremental energy saving modes of a device.  This can be 
          viewed as an interface for the underlying device-implemented 
          power settings of a device.  Examples of Power State Series 
          include DTMF [DMTF], IEEE1621 [IEEE1621], ACPI [ACPI] and 
          EMAN.  
         
        Power State 
         
          A Power State is defined as a specific power settings for a 
          Power Monitor (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, high). Within the 
          context of a Power State Series, the Power State of a device 
          is one of the power saving modes in that Power State Series. 
      
        EDITOR'S NOTE: the definitions of Power State Series and Power 
        State should be copied over in [EMAN-FRAMEWORK], and referenced 
        here. 
         
         
     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section describes the concepts specified in the Power 
        Monitor Architecture [EMAN-FRAMEWORK] that pertain to power 
        usage, with specific information related to the MIB module 
        specified in this document.  This subsection maps to the section 
        "Architecture High Level Concepts" in the Power Monitoring 
        Architecture [EMAN-FRAMEWORK]. 
         
        The Energy Monitoring MIB has 2 independent MIB modules. The 
        first MIB module powerMonitorMIB is focused on measurement of 
        power and energy. The second MIB module powerQualityMIB is 
        focused on Power Quality measurement.

        first table pmPowerTable is indexed by pmPowerIndex and 
        pmPowerStateSeriesIndex. The second table pmPowerStateTable

     5.1. Power Monitor Information 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Information" section in [EMAN-
        FRAMEWORK] for background information.  An energy aware device 
        is considered an instance of a Power Monitor as defined in the 
        [EMAN-FRAMEWORK]. 
         
        The Power Monitor identity information is specified in the MIB 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] primary table, i.e. the 
        pmTable.In this table, every Power Monitor SHOULD have a 
        printable name pmName, and MUST HAVE a unique Power Monitor 
        index pmIndex.  The ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module returns the 
        relationship (parent/child) between Power Monitors. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: this last sentence will have to be updated with 
        terms such as Aggregator, Proxy, etc... when the [EMAN-
        FRAMEWORK] will stabilize. 
      

     5.2. Power State 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor States" section in [EMAN-FRAMEWORK] 
        for background information. 
         
        A Power Monitor may have energy conservation modes called Power 
        States.  Between the ON and OFF states of a device, there can be 
        several intermediate energy saving modes.  Those energy saving 
        modes are called as Power States.  
         
        Power States, which represent universal states of power 
        management of a Power Monitor, are specified by the pmPowerState 
        MIB object.  The actual Power State is specified by the 
        pmPowerOperState MIB object, while the pmPowerAdminState MIB 
        object specifies the Power State requested for the Power 
        Monitor.  The difference between  the values of pmPowerOperState 
        and pmPowerAdminState  can be attributed that the Power Monitor 
        is busy transitioning from pmPowerAdminState into the 
        pmPowerOperState, at which point it will update the content of 
        pmPowerOperState.  In addition, the possible reason for change 
        in Power State is reported in pmPowerStateEnterReason.  
        Regarding pmPowerStateEnterReason, management stations and Power

     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        Monitors should support any format of the owner string dictated 
        by the local policy of the organization.  It is suggested that 
        this name contain at least the reason for the transition change, 
        and one or more of the following: IP address, management station 
        name, network manager's name, location, or phone number. 
         
        The MIB objects pmPowerOperState,  pmPowerAdminState , and 
        pmPowerStateEnterReason are contained in the pmPowerTable MIB 
        table. 
            
        The pmPowerStateTable table enumerates the maximum power usage 
        in watts, for every single supported Power State of each Power 
        State Series supported by the Power Monitor In addition, 
        PowerStateTable provides additional statistics: 
        pmPowerStateEnterCount, the number of times an entity has 
        visited a particular Power State, and pmPowerStateTotalTime, the 
        total time spent in a particular Power State of a Power Monitor.  
         
         
     5.2.1. Power State Series 

        There are several standards and implementations of Power State 
        Series.  A Power Monitor can support one or multiple Power State 
        Series implementation(s) concurrently.  
         
        There are currently three Power State Series supported:  
         
          Reserved(0) 
          IEEE1621(1) - [IEEE1621] 
          DMTF(2)     - [DMTF] 
          EMAN(3)     - [EMAN-MONITORING-MIB] 
        
       The respective specific states related to each Power State 
        Series are specified in the following sections. 
        
         
     5.2.2. IEEE1621 Power State Series 

        The IEEE1621 Power State Series [IEEE1621] consists of 3 
        rudimentary states : on, off or sleep. 
          on(0)    - The device is fully On and all features of the 
        device are in working mode.  
          off(1)   - The device is mechanically switched off and does 
        not consume energy.

     5.2.3. DMTF Power State Series 

        DMTF [DMTF] standards organization has defined a power profile 
        standard based on the CIM (Common Information Model) model that 
        consists of 15 power states ON (2), SleepLight (3), SleepDeep 
        (4), Off-Hard (5), Off-Soft (6), Hibernate(7), PowerCycle Off-
        Soft (8), PowerCycle Off-Hard (9), MasterBus reset (10), 
        Diagnostic Interrupt (11), Off-Soft-Graceful (12), Off-Hard 
        Graceful (13), MasterBus reset Graceful (14), Power-Cycle Off-
        Soft Graceful (15), PowerCycle-Hard Graceful (16).  DMTF 
        standard is targeted for hosts and computers.  Details of the 
        semantics of each Power State within the DMTF Power State Series 
        can be obtained from the DMTF Power State Management Profile 
        specification [DMTF]. 
         
        DMTF power profile extends ACPI power states.  The following 
        table provides a mapping between DMTF and ACPI Power State 
        Series:

     5.2.4. EMAN Power State Series 

        The EMAN Power State Series represents an attempt for a uniform 
        standard approach to model the different levels of power 
        consumption of a device.  The EMAN Power States are an expansion 
        of the basic Power States as defined in IEEE1621 that also 
        incorporate the Power States defined in ACPI and DMTF.  
        Therefore, in addition to the non-operational states as defined 
        in ACPI and DMTF standards, several intermediate operational 
        states have been defined.  
         
        There are twelve Power States, that expand on IEEE1621 on,sleep 
        and off.  The expanded list of Power States are divided into six  
        operational states, and six non-operational states.  The lowest 
        non-operational state is 1 and the highest is 6.  Each non-
        operational state corresponds to an ACPI state [ACPI] 
        corresponding to Global and System states between G3 (hard-off) 
        and G1 (sleeping). For Each operational state represent a 
        performance state, and may be mapped to ACPI states P0 (maximum 
        performance power) through P5 (minimum performance and minimum 
        power).  
         
        An Power Monitor may have fewer Power States than twelve and 
        would then map several policy states to the same power state. 
        Power Monitor with more than twelve states, would choose which 
        twelve to represent as power policy states. 
         
        In each of the non-operational states (from mechoff(1) to 
        ready(6)), the Power State preceding it is expected to have a 
        lower power consumption and a longer delay in returning to an 
        operational state:

                               available.  The entity is unavailable. 
                               No energy is being consumed and the power 
                               connector can be removed.  This  
                               corresponds to ACPI state G3.      
                      
                 softoff(2)  : Similar to mechoff(1), but some  
                               components remain powered or receive 
                               trace power so that the entity  
                               can be awakened from its off state.  In  
                               softoff(2), no context is saved and the  
                               device typically requires a complete boot  
                               when awakened.  This corresponds to ACPI  
                               state G2. 
         
        IEEE1621 Power(sleep)

                               a complete boot, but the time for  
                               availability is longer than sleep(4). An  
                               example for state hibernate(3) is a save 
                               to-disk state where DRAM context is not  
                               maintained. Typically, energy consumption  
                               is zero or close to zero.  This  
                               corresponds to state G1, S4 in ACPI.

                               availability is longer than standby(5).  
                               An example for state sleep(4) is a save- 
                               to-RAM state, where DRAM context is  
                               maintained.  Typically, energy  
                               consumption is close to zero. This  
                               corresponds to state G1, S3 in ACPI. 
         
                 standby(5) : No entity features are available, except  
                              for out-of-band management, for example  
                              wake-up mechanisms. This mode is analogous   
                              to cold-standy.  The time for availability  
                              is longer than ready(6).  For example, the  
                              processor context is not maintained.  
                              Typically, energy consumption is close to  
                              zero. This corresponds to state G1, S2 in

                               analogous to hot-standby.  The entity can

                               processors are not executing, but  
                               processor context is maintained. This

     5.3. Power Monitor Usage Information 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Usage Measurement" section in [EMAN-

        For a Power Monitor, power usage is reported using pmPower.  The 
        magnitude of measurement is based on the pmPowerUnitMultiplier 
        MIB variable, based on the UnitMultiplier Textual Convention 
        (TC).  
           
        For example, if current power usage of a Power Monitor is 3, it 
        could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value of 
        pmPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout 
        the two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, 
        including pmPowerStatePowerUnitMultiplier, 
        pmEnergyIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and 
        pmACPwrQualityPowerUnitMultiplier. 
         
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to 
        know how a pmPower measurement was obtained.  An NMS can use 
        this to account for the accuracy and nature of the reading 
        between different implementations.  For this pmPowerOrigin 
        describes whether the measurements were made at the device 
        itself or from a remote source.  The pmPowerMeasurementCaliber 
        describes the method that was used to measure the power and can 
        distinguish actual or estimated values.  There may be devices in 
        the network, which may not be able to measure or report power 
        consumption. For those devices, the object 
        pmPowerMeasurementCaliber shall report that measurement 
        mechanism is "unavailable" and the pmPower measurement shall be 
        "0".  
         
        The nameplate power rating of a Power Monitor is specified in 
        pmPowerNameplate MIB object. 
         
         
     5.4. Optional Power Usage Quality 

        Refer to the "Optional Power Usage Quality" section in [EMAN-
        FRAMEWORK] for background information. 
         
        The optional powerQualityMIB MIB module can be implemented to 
        further describe power usage quality measurement.  The 
        powerQualityMIB MIB module adheres closely to the IEC 61850 7-2 
        standard to describe AC measurements.   
         
        The powerQualityMIB MIB module contains a primary table, the 
        pmACPwrQualityTable table, that defines power quality 
        measurements for supported pmIndex entities, as a sparse 
        extension of the pmPowerTable (with pmPowerIndex as primary 
        index).  This pmACPwrQualityTable table contains such 
        information as the configuration (single phase, DEL 3 phases,

        WYE 3 phases), voltage, frequency, power accuracy, total 
        active/reactive power/apparent power, amperage, and voltage.  
         
        In case of 3-phase power, the pmACPwrQualityPhaseTable 
        additional table is populated with power quality measurements 
        per phase (so double indexed by the pmPowerIndex and 
        pmPhaseIndex).  This table, which describes attributes common to 
        both WYE and DEL configurations, contains the average current, 
        active/reactive/apparent power, power factor, and impedance. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a DEL configuration, the 
        pmACPwrQualityDelPhaseTable table describes the phase-to-phase 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a Wye configuration, the 
        pmACPwrQualityWyePhaseTable table describes the phase-to-neutral 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
         
         
     5.5. Optional Energy Measurement 

        Refer to the "Optional Energy and demand Measurement" section in 
        [EMAN-FRAMEWORK] for the definition and terminology  
        information. 
         
        It is relevant to measure energy when there are actual power 
        measurements from a Power Monitor, and not when the power 
        measurement is assumed or predicted as specified in the 
        description clause of the object pmPowerMeasurementCaliber.    
         
        Two tables are introduced to characterize energy measurement of 
        a Power Monitor:  pmEnergyTable and pmEnergyParametersTable.  
        Both energy and demand information can be represented via the 
        pmEnergyTable.  Energy information will be an accumulation with 
        no interval.  Demand information can be represented as an 
        average accumulation per interval of time.  
         
        The pmEnergyParametersTable consists of the parameters defining 
        the duration of measurement intervals in seconds, 
        (pmEnergyParametersIntervalLength), the number of successive 
        intervals to be stored in the pmEnergyTable, 
        (pmEnergyParametersIntervalNumber), the type of measurement 
        technique (pmEnergyParametersIntervalMode), and a sample rate 
        used to calculate the average (pmEnergyParametersSampleRate).  
        Judicious choice of the sampling rate will ensure accurate 
        measurement of energy while not imposing an excessive polling 
        burden.

        There are three pmEnergyParametersIntervalMode types used for 
        energy measurement collection: period, sliding, and total. Note 
        that multiple pmEnergyParametersIntervalMode types MAY be 
        configured simultaneously.   
         
        These three pmEnergyParametersIntervalMode types are illustrated 
        by the following three figures, for which: 
         
        - The horizontal axis represents the current time, with the 
        symbol <--- L ---> expressing the 
        pmEnergyParametersIntervalLength, and the 
        pmEnergyIntervalStartTime is represented by S1, S2, S3, S4, ..., 
        Sx where x is the value of pmEnergyParametersIntervalNumber. 
         
        - The vertical axis represents the time interval of sampling and 
        the value of pmEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed can be obtained at the 
        end of the sampling period.  The symbol =========== denotes the 
        duration of the sampling period.

        in turn indicates if pmEnergyTable entries exist or not. 
         
        The pmEnergyTable consists of energy measurements 
        inpmEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed , the units of the measured energy 
        pmEnergyIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and the maximum observed 
        energy within a window - pmEnergyIntervalMax.

        Measurements of the total energy consumed by a Power Monitor may 
        suffer from interruptions in the continuous measurement of 
        energy consumption.  In order to indicate such interruptions, 
        the object pmEnergyIntervalDiscontinuityTime is provided for 
        indicating the time of the last interruption of total energy 
        measurement.  pmEnergyIntervalDiscontinuityTime shall indicate 
        the sysUpTime [RFC3418] when the device was reset.  
         
        The following example illustrates the pmEnergyTable and 
        pmEnergyParametersTable: 
         
        First, in order to estimate energy, a time interval to sample 
        energy should be specified, i.e. 
        pmEnergyParametersIntervalLength can be set to "900 seconds" or 
        15 minutes and the number of consecutive intervals over which 
        the maximum energy is calculated 
        (pmEnergyParametersIntervalNumber) as "10".  The sampling rate 
        internal to the Power Monitor for measurement of power usage 
        (pmEnergyParametersSampleRate) can be "1000 milliseconds", as 
        set by the Power Monitor as a reasonable value.  Then, the 
        pmEnergyParametersStatus is set to active (value 1) to indicate 
        that the Power Monitor should start monitoring the usage per the 
        pmEnergyTable. 
         
        The indices in the pmEnergyTable are pmPowerIndex, which 
        identifies the Power Monitor, and pmEnergyIntervalStartTime, 
        which denotes the start time of the energy measurement interval 
        based on sysUpTime [RFC3418].  The value of 
        pmEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed is the measured energy consumption 
        over the time interval specified 
        (pmEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Power Monitor 
        internal sampling rate (pmEnergyParametersSampleRate).  While 
        choosing the values for the pmEnergyParametersIntervalLength and 
        pmEnergyParametersSampleRate, it is recommended to take into 
        consideration either the network element resources adequate to 
        process and store the sample values, and the mechanism used to 
        calculate the pmEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed.  The units are derived 
        from pmEnergyIntervalPowerUnitMultiplier.  For example, 
        pmEnergyIntervalPowerUsed can be "100" with 
        pmEnergyIntervalPowerUnits equal to 0, the measured energy 
        consumption of the Power Monitor is 100 watt-hours.  The 
        pmEnergyIntervalMax is the maximum energyobserved and that can 
        be "150 watt-hours". 
         
        The pmEnergyTable has a buffer to retain a certain number of 
        intervals, as defined by pmEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.  If 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011         [Page 21] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        the default value of "10" is kept, then the pmEnergyTable 
        contains 10 energymeasurements, including the maximum.   
         
        Here is a brief explanation of how the maximum energy can be 
        calculated.  The first observed energy measurement value is 
        taken to be the initial maximum.  With each subsequent 
        measurement, based on numerical comparison, maximum energy may 
        be updated.  The maximum value is retained as long as the 
        measurements are taking place.  Based on periodic polling of 
        this table, an NMS could compute the maximum over a longer 
        period, i.e. a month, 3 months, or a year. 
      

     5.6. Fault Management 

        [EMAN-REQ] specifies requirements about Power States such as 
        "the current power state" , "the time of the last state change", 
        "the total time spent in each state", "the number of transitions 
        to each state" etc. Some of these requirements are fulfilled 
        explicitly by MIB objects such as pmPowerOperState, 
        pmPowerStateTotalTime and pmPowerStateEnterCount.  Some of the 
        other requirements are met via the SNMP NOTIFICATION mechanism.  
        pmPowerStateChange SNMP notification which is generated when the 
        value(s) of pmPowerStateSeries, pmPowerOperState, 
        pmPowerAdminState have changed.  
         
          
     6. Discovery 

     6.1. ENERGY-AWARE-MIB Module Implemented 

        The NMS must first poll the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-
        MIB], if available, in order to discover all the Power Monitors 
        and the relationships between those (notion of Parent/Child).  
        In the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module tables, the Power Monitors are 
        indexed by the pmIndex.   

        If an implementation of the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module is available 
        in the local SNMP context, for the same Power Monitor,  the 
        pmIndex value (EMAN-AWARE-MIB) MUST be assigned to the 
        pmPowerIndex for The pmPowerIndex characterizes the Power 
        Monitor in the powerMonitorMIB and powerQualityMIB MIB modules 
        (this document). 

        From there, the NMS must poll the pmPowerStateTable (specified 
        in the powerMonitorMIB module in this document), which 
        enumerates, amongst other things, the maximum power usage.  As 
        the entries in pmPowerStateTable table are indexed by the Power 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011         [Page 22] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        Monitor (pmPowerIndex), by the Power State Series 
        (pmPowerStateSeriesIndex), and by the Power State 
        (pmPowerStateIndex), the maximum power usage is discovered per 
        Power Monitor, per Power State Series, and per Power Usage.  In 
        other words, polling the pmPowerStateTable allows the discovery 
        of each Power State within every Power State Series supported by 
        the Power Monitor.               

        If the Power Monitor is an Aggregator or a Proxy, the MIB module 
        would be populated with the Power Monitor Parent and Children 
        information, which have their own Power Monitor index value 
        (pmPowerIndex).  However, the parent/child relationship must be 
        discovered thanks to the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module. 

        Finally, the NMS can monitor the Power Quality thanks to the 
        powerQualityMIB MIB module, which reuses the pmPowerIndex to 
        index the Power Monitor. 

     6.2. ENERGY-AWARE-MIB Module Not Implemented, ENTITY-MIB 
        Implemented 

        When the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] is not 
        implemented, the NMS must poll the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133] in order 
        to discover some more information about the Power Monitors.  
        Indeed, the index for the Power Monitors in the MIB modules 
        specified in this document is the pmPowerIndex, which specifies: 
        "If there is no implementation of the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module 
        but one of the ENTITY MIB module is available in the local SNMP 
        context, then the same index of an entity MUST be chosen as 
        assigned to the entity by object entPhysicalIndex in the ENTITY 
        MIB module." 
      
        As the Section 6.1. , the NMS must then poll the 
        pmPowerStateTable (specified in the powerMonitorMIB module in 
        this document), indexed by the Power Monitor (pmPowerIndex that 
        inherited the entPhysicalIndex value), by the Power State Series 
        (pmPowerStateSeriesIndex), and by the Power State 
        (pmPowerStateIndex).  Then the NMS has discovered every Power 
        State within each Power State Series supported by the Power 
        Monitor.  
         
        Note that, without the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module, the Power 
        Monitor acts as an standalone device, i.e. the notion of 
        parent/child can't be specified.

     6.3. ENERGY-AWARE-MIB Module and ENTITY-MIB Not Implemented 

        If neither the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] nor of 
        the ENTITY MIB module [RFC4133] are available in the local SNMP 
        context, then this MIB module may choose identity values from a 
        further MIB module providing entity identities.  
         
        Note that, without the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module, the Power 
        Monitor acts as an standalone device, i.e. the notion of 
        parent/child can't be specified. 
      
                                      
     7. Link with the other IETF MIBs 

         
     7.1. Link with the ENTITY MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB  

        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the ENTITY MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch, etc.) 
        and those physical entities indexed by entPhysicalIndex.  From 
        an energy-management standpoint, the physical entities that 
        consume or produce energy are of interest. 
         
        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
        provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
        value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
        data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
        devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
        entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus 
        of the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB is on measurement of 
        power usage of networking equipment indexed by the ENTITY MIB, 
        this MIB proposes a customized power scale for power measurement 
        and different power state states of networking equipment, and 
        functionality to configure the power state states. 
         
        When this MIB module is used to monitor the power usage of 
        devices like routers and switches, the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-
        SENSOR MIB SHOULD be implemented.  In such cases, the Power 
        Monitors are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through the 
        pmPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the pmTable in the 
        ENERGY-AWARE-MIB MIB module [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].   

        However, the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] does not have the ANSI 
        C12.x accuracy classes required for electricity (i.e., 1%, 2%, 
        0.5% accuracy classes). Indeed, entPhySensorPrecision [RFC3433] 
        represents "The number of decimal places of precision in fixed-
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011         [Page 24] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        point sensor values returned by the associated entPhySensorValue 
        object".  The ANSI and IEC Standards are used for power 
        measurement and these standards require that we use an accuracy 
        class, not the scientific-number precision model specified in 
        RFC3433.  The pmPowerAccuracy MIB object models this accuracy.  
        Note that pmPowerUnitMultipler represents the scale factor per 
        IEC 61850, which is a more logical representation for power 
        measurements (compared to entPhySensorScale), with the mantissa 
        and the exponent values X * 10 ^ Y. 

        Power measurements specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each 
        measured value in watts are used in the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, POE 
        [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.  The same 'UNITS' qualifier 
        is used for the power measurement values.    
         
        One cannot assume that the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB are 
        implemented for all Power Monitors that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmPhysicalEntity value 
        contains the zero value, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero textual 
        convention. 
         
        The pmPowerIndex MIB object has been kept as the unique Power 
        Monitor index.   The pmPower is similar to entPhySensorValue 
        [RFC3433] and the pmPowerUnitMultipler is similar to 
        entPhySensorScale. 
         
         
     7.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE MIB  

        For each entity in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133], the ENTITY-STATE 
        MIB [RFC4268] specifies the operational states (entStateOper: 
        unknown, enabled, disabled, testing), the alarm (entStateAlarm: 
        unknown, underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning, 
        indeterminate) and the possible values of standby states  
        (entStateStandby: unknown, hotStandby, coldStandby, 
        providingService). 
         
        From a power monitoring point of view, in contrast to the entity 
        operational states of entities, Power States are required, as 
        proposed in the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB module.  Those 
        Power States can be mapped to the different operational states 
        in the ENTITY-STATE MIB, if a formal mapping is required.  For 
        example, the entStateStandby "unknown", "hotStandby", 
        "coldStandby", states could map to the Power State "unknown",

        "ready", "standby", respectively, while the entStateStandby 
        "providingService" could map to any "low" to "high" Power State. 
         
         
     7.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB 

        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] provides an energy monitoring 
        and configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  
        The RFC introduces a concept of a port group on a switch to 
        define power monitoring and management policy and does not use 
        the entPhysicalIndex as the index.  Indeed, the  
        pethMainPseConsumptionPower is indexed by the 
        pethMainPseGroupIndex, which has no mapping with the 
        entPhysicalIndex.  
         
        One cannot assume that the Power-over-Ethernet MIB is 
        implemented for all Power Monitors that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmethPortIndex and 
        pmethPortGrpIndex values contain the zero value, thanks to new 
        PethPsePortIndexOrZero and textual PethPsePortGroupIndexOrZero 
        conventions. 
         
        However, if the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, 
        the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex contain 
        the pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively. 
         
        As a consequence, the pmPowerIndex MIB object has been kept as 
        the unique Power Monitor index. 
         
        Note that, even though the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] was 
        created after the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433], it does not reuse 
        the precision notion from the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB, i.e. the 
        entPhySensorPrecision MIB object. 
         
          
     7.4. Link with the UPS MIB 

        To protect against unexpected power disruption, data centers and 
        buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).  To 
        protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular 
        subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically lasts only 
        for a finite period of time, until normal power supply is 
        restored.  Planning is required to decide on the capacity of the 
        UPS based on output power and duration of probable power outage.  
        To properly provision UPS power in a data center or building, it 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011         [Page 26] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        is important to first understand the total demand required to 
        support all the entities in the site.  This demand can be 
        assessed and monitored via the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  

        UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS 
        network.  Implementation of the UPS MIB is useful at the 
        aggregate level of a data center or a building.  The MIB module 
        contains several groups of variables: 

        - upsIdent: Identifies the UPS entity (name, model, etc.).  

        - upsBattery group: Indicates the battery state 
        (upsbatteryStatus, upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining, etc.) 

        - upsInput group: Characterizes the input load to the UPS 
        (number of input lines, voltage, current, etc.). 

        - upsOutput: Characterizes the output from the UPS (number of 
        output lines, voltage, current, etc.) 

        - upsAlarms: Indicates the various alarm events.   

        The measurement of power in the UPS MIB is in Volts, Amperes and 
        Watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts and RMS 
        Amperes. They are not based on the EntitySensorDataScale and 
        EntitySensorDataPrecision of Entity-Sensor MIB. 

        Both the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB and the UPS MIB may be 
        implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without conflict.  In 
        this case, the UPS device itself is the Power Monitor Parent and 
        any of the UPS meters or submeters are the Power Monitor 
        Children. 
         
         
     7.5. Link with the LLDP and LLDP-MED MIBs 

        The LLDP Protocol is a Data Link Layer protocol used by network 
        devices to advertise their identities, capabilities, and 
        interconnections on a LAN network.  
         
        The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as 
        LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice 
        applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: capability 
        discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy 
        discovery, location identification discovery, inventory 
        discovery, and power discovery.   
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011         [Page 27] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        Of particular interest to the current MIB module is the power 
        discovery, which allows the endpoint device (such as a PoE 
        phone) to convey power requirements to the switch.  In power 
        discovery, LLDP-MED has four Type Length Values (TLVs): power 
        type, power source, power priority and power value.  
        Respectively, those TLVs provide information related to the type 
        of power (power sourcing entity versus powered device), how the 
        device is powered (from the line, from a backup source, from 
        external power source, etc.), the power priority (how important 
        is it that this device has power?), and how much power the 
        device needs. 
          
        The power priority specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB] 
        actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]. If 
        the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the exact 
        value from the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over 
        in the lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB]; otherwise 
        the value in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is "unknown". From 
        the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, it is possible to identify 
        the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621], thanks to the 
        pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex. 
         
        The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to 
        pmPowerOrigin in indicating if the power for an attached device 
        is local or from a remote device. If the LLDP-MED MIB is 
        supported, the following mapping can be applied to the 
        pmPowerOrigin: lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource fromPSE(2) and 
        local(3) can be mapped to remote(2) and self(1), respectively. 
      

     8. Implementation Scenarios 

         
        This section provides an illustrative example scenario for the 
        implementation of the Power Monitor, including Power Monitor 
        Parent and Power Monitor Child relationships.  
         
        Example Scenario of a campus network: Switch with PoE Endpoints 
        with further connected Devices  
         
        The campus network consists of switches that provide LAN 
        connectivity.  The switch with PoE ports is located in wiring 
        closet.  PoE IP phones are connected to the switch.  The IP 
        phones draw power from the PoE ports of the switch.  In 
        addition, a PC is daisy-chained from the IP phone for LAN 
        connectivity.   
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011         [Page 28] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        The IP phone consumes power from the PoE switch, while the PC 
        consumes power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The switch has implementations of Entity MIB [RFC4133] and 
        energy-aware MIB [EMAN-AWARE-MIB] while the PC does not have 
        implementation of the Entity MIB, but has an implementation of 
        energy-aware MIB.  The switch has the following attributes, 
        pmPowerIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity "2", and pmPowerMonitorId 
        "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the switch is "440 Watts".  The 
        switch does not have a Power Monitor Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes: The switch 
        port has pmPowerIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000:3".  The power metered at the POE 
        switch port is "12 watts".  In this example, the POE switch port 
        has the switch as the Power Monitor Parent, with its pmParentID 
        of "1000". 
      
        The attributes of the PC are given below.  The PC does not 
        implementation of Entity MIB, and thus does not have 
        pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmPowerIndex (pmPIndex) of the PC is 
        "57", the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000:57 ".  The PC has a 
        Power Monitor Parent, i.e. the switch port whose 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000:3".  The power usage of the PC is 
        "120 Watts" and is communicated to the switch port.  
         
        This example illustrates the important distinction between the 
        Power Monitor Children: The IP phone draws power from the 
        switch, while the PC has LAN connectivity from the phone, but is 
        powered from the wall outlet.  However, the Power Monitor Parent 
        sends power control messages to both the Power Monitor Children 
        (IP phone and PC) and the Children react to those messages.

     9. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
        PowerMonitorMIBObject.  The pmPowerTable table of 
        PowerMonitorMibObject describes the power measurement attributes 
        of a Power Monitor entity. The notion of identity of the device 
        in terms of uniquely identification of the Power Monitor and its 
        relationship to other entities in the network are addressed in 
        [EMAN-AWARE-MIB].   
          
         
        The power measurement of Power Monitor contains information 
        describing its power usage (pmPower) and its current power state 
        (pmPowerOperState). In addition to power usage, additional 
        information describing the units of measurement 
        (pmPowerAccuracy, pmPowerUnitMultiplier), how power usage 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>      Expires Novmeber 23, 2011         [Page 30] 
         
     Internet-Draft          <Energy Monitoring MIB>         May 2011 
      
        measurement was obtained  (pmPowerMeasurementCaliber),  the 
        source of power  (pmPowerOrigin) and the type of power 
        (pmPowerCurrentTtype) are described. 
         
         
        A Power Monitor may contain an optional pmPowerQuality table 
        that describes the electrical characteristics associated with 
        the current power state and usage. 
         
        A Power Monitor may contain an optional pmEnergyTable to 
        describe energy measurement information over time. 
         
        A Power Monitor may also contain optional battery information 
        associated with this entity.

              module but one of the ENTITY MIB module is available in

              cannot be indexed by the pmPowerStateTable.

     11. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
        - Unauthorized changes to the pmPowerOperState (via 
          thepmPowerAdminState ) MAY disrupt the power settings of the 
          different Power Monitors, and therefore the state of 
          functionality of the respective Power Monitors. 
        - Unauthorized changes to the pmEnergyParametersTable MAY 
          disrupt energy measurement in the pmEnergyTable table.  
         
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

     12. IANA Considerations 

     12.1. IANA Considerations for the MIB Modules 

         

        The MIB modules in this document uses the following IANA-
        assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers 
        registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
               ----------            ----------------------- 
               PowerMonitorMIB         { mib-2 xxx } 
               powerQualityMIB         { mib-2 yyy } 
         
        Additions to the MIB modules are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OIDs SHOULD be assigned to the new MIB 
        objects.  The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the 
        structure specified in Section 10.  and MUST be published using 
        a well-established and persistent publication medium.   
      

     12.2. IANA Registration of new Power State Series 

        This document specifies an initial set of Power State Series. 
        The list of these Power State Series with their numeric 
        identifiers is given in Section 5.2.1. The Internet Assigned 
        Numbers Authority (IANA) has created a new registry for Power 
        State Series numeric identifiers and filled it with the initial 
        list as in Section 5.2.1.  New Assignments to Power State Series 
        shall be administered by IANA and the guidelines and procedures 
        are listed in this Section.  
      
        New assignments in Power State Series require a Standards Action 
        [RFC5226], i.e., they are to be made via Standards Track RFCs 
        approved by the IESG.  The new Power State Series based on the 
        following guidelines; firstly check if there are devices or 
        entities that have implementations of the proposed Power State 
        Series or secondly, if the new Power State Series has been 
        adopted or approved by the respective energy management 
        standards organizations.  A pure vendor specific implementation 
        of Power State Series shall not be adopted; since it would lead 
        to proliferation of Power State Series.

     12.2.1. IANA Registration of the IEEE1621 Power State Series 

        This document specifies a set of values for the IEEE1621 Power 
        State Series [IEEE1621].  The list of these values with their 
        identifiers is given in Section 5.2.1.  The Internet Assigned 
        Numbers Authority (IANA) created a new registry for IEEE1621 
        Power State Series identifiers and filled it with the initial 
        list in Section 5.2.2.  
         
        New assignments (or potentially deprecation) for IEEE1621 Power 
        State Series will be administered by IANA through Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested state for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description. 
         
     12.2.2. IANA Registration of the DMTF Power State Series 

        This document specifies a set of values for the DMTF Power State 
        Series.  The list of these values with their identifiers is 
        given in Section 5.2.1.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
        (IANA) has created a new registry for DMTF Power State Series 
        identifiers and filled it with the initial list in Section 
        5.2.1.  
         
        New assignments (or potentially deprecation) for DMTF Power 
        State Series will be administered by IANA through Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        conformance with the DMTF standard [DMTF], on the top of 
        checking for completeness and accuracy of the description. 
         
         
     12.2.3. IANA Registration of the EMAN Power State Series 

        This document specifies a set of values for the EMAN Power State 
        Series.  The list of these values with their identifiers is 
        given in Section 5.2.1.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
        (IANA) has created a new registry for EMAN Power State Series 
        identifiers and filled it with the initial list in Section 
        5.2.1.  
         
        New assignments (or potentially deprecation) for EMAN Power 
        State Series New assignments in Power State Series require a 
        Standards Action , i.e., they are to be made via Standards Track 
        RFCs approved by the IESG.
