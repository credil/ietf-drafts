 IANA Registry for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Options
               draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-options-registry-01

Abstract

   It has been identified that Interactive Connectivity Establishment
   (ICE) RFC5245 is missing a registry for ICE options.  This document
   defines this missing IANA registry and updates RFC5245.

Internet-Draft            IANA Registry for ICE               March 2011


1.  Introduction

   "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network
   Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer" [RFC5245]
   defines a concept of ICE Options.  However, the ICE RFC fails to
   create an IANA registry for ICE options.  As there has come into
   existence at least one ICE option, there is need to create the
   registry.

   RFC 5245 says: "ICE provides for extensibility by allowing an offer
   or answer to contain a series of tokens that identify the ICE
   extensions used by that agent.  If an agent supports an ICE
   extension, it MUST include the token defined for that extension in
   the ice-options attribute."

   Thus, as future extensions are defined, these ICE options needs to be
   registered with IANA to ensure non-conflicting identification.  The
   ICE options identifiers are used in signalling between the ICE
   endpoints to negotiate extension support.  RFC 5245 defines one
   method of signalling these ICE options, using SDP with Offer/Answer
   [RFC3264].

   This document updates the ICE specification [RFC5245].


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a registry for ICE options that can be used in
   SDP "ice-options" attribute or other signalling parameters carrying
   the ICE options.

3.1.  ICE Options

   An ICE option identifier MUST fulfill the ABNF [RFC5234] syntax for
   "ice-option-tag" as specified in [RFC5245].  This syntax is
   reproduced here for simplicity, but the authoritative definition is
   in the ICE RFC:
   ice-option-tag        = 1*ice-char
   ice-char              = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"

   ICE options are of unlimited length by the syntax, however they are

   RECOMMENDED to be no longer than 20 characters.  This is to reduce
   message sizes and allow for efficient parsing.

   Registration of an ICE option is done using the Specification
   Required policy as defined in "Guidelines for Writing an IANA
   Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC5226].

   A registration request MUST include the following information:

   o  Name of contact person for the registration

   o  Email and Address of the Contact person

   o  Organization or individuals having the change control

   o  The ICE option identifier

   o  Short description of the ICE extension

   o  Reference(s) to the specification defining the ICE option and the
      related extensions


4.  Security Considerations

   As this document defines an IANA registry for an already existing
   concept there are no new security considerations.
