1. Introduction

   This draft describes the problem of control word negotiation 
   mechanism specified in [RFC4447].

   Based on the problem analysis, possible solutions and their potential 
   shortcomings are also discussed.

2. Problem Statement

   [RFC4447] section 6 describes the control word negotiation mechanism. 
   Each PW endpoint has the capability of being configurable with a 
   parameter that specifies whether the use of the control word is 
   PREFERRED or NOT PREFERRED.
 
   This negotiation mechanism will not work properly in the following 
   case:
             +-------+                    +-------+
             |       |         PW         |       |
             |  PE1  |====================|  PE2  |
             |       |                    |       |
             +-------+                    +-------+
                            Figure 1

     1. Initially, the control word on PE1 is configured to PREFERRED, 
        and on PE2 to NOT PREFERRED.

     2. The negotiation result for the control word for this PW is "not 
        supported", and PE1 send label mapping with CW=0 finally.

     3. PE2 then changes its control word configuration to PREFERRED.

     4. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

     5. According to the control word negotiation mechanism, the 
        received label mapping on PE2 from PE1 indicates CW=0, therefore 
        PE2 will still send label mapping with CW=0.

     6. The negotiation result for the PW control word is still "not 
        supported", even though the control word configuration on both 
        PE1 and PE2 is set to PREFERRED.

3. Possible Solutions

   The solution for this problem should be applicable to both SS-PW and 
   MS-PW.

   In this draft, possible solutions are discussed.

3.1. Option 1: Change PW LDP Dynamic Negotiation Process

   The first solution is only applicable for SS-PW.
 
   PE1 should have the capability to identify that local configuration 
   CW capability and advertised CW capability are different. 

   The control word negotiation mechanism can still follow the procedure 
   described in [RFC4447] section 6.

   The behaviour of PE1 and PE2 should be as follows:

     1. PE2 changes its control word configuration to PREFERRED.

     2. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

     3. When PE1 receives this label withdraw message, it should check 
        that the local configuration CW capability and the advertised CW 
        capability are different. PE1 will then send a label withdraw 
        message to PE2.

     4. PE1 then sends a new label mapping message with CW=1 to PE2. And 
	    then PE1 send label release to PE2 as a response to label 
		withdraw in step 2).

     5. PE2 sends a label release as a response to label withdraw sent 
        by PE1 (step 3).

     6. By receiving label release from PE1, PE2 will send new label 
        mapping with CW=1 to PE1 to setup the PW.

   By changing the message sequence of label release and label mapping 
   message on PE1, PE2 will be blocked to send out new label mapping 
   until receiving label release message from PE1. 

   The above mechanism cannot be applied to MS-PW, because the label 
   release message in MS-PW cannot be used as in SS-PW to block PE2 to 
   send new label mapping message.

3.2. Option 2: Make CW Non-Configurable

   The second solution is to change the control word to be not 
   configurable, and default value is PREFERRED which can be degraded to 
   NOT PREFERRED by negotiation automatically. The negotiation mechanism 
   can still follow the procedure described in [RFC4447] section 6.

   There is explicit requirement from some service providers to allow 
   control word to be configurable. This option will not fulfil their 
   need.

3.3. Option 3: Manual Configuration Process for CW
 
   The third solution is to abandon the control word negotiation 
   mechanism described in [RFC4447], and use a new simple mechanism.

   The control word configured on both PW end-points MUST be the same, 
   otherwise the PW will not be in operation UP.

   It is important to note that this control word negotiation mechanism 
   is not interoperable with the old mechanism defined in [RFC4447].

3.4. Option 4: Make CW Capability Mandatory

   This option is to make CW capability mandatory. The PW will only be 
   in operation UP when both PW end-points support control word 
   capability.

   We should consider some side effect while making CW capability 
   mandatory, which will be analyzed in future.

3.5. Extra Considerations

   The possible CW negotiation for multi-segment PW as well as potential 
   complications with FEC129 will be covered in later version of this 
   document.

   Backward compatibility issues will be further discussed in later 
   version of this document.

4. Security Considerations

   This will be added in later version of this document.

5. IANA Considerations

   This will be added in later version of this document.

6. Acknowledgements

   This will be added in later version of this document.
