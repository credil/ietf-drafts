Internet-Draft        Auth-Results VBR Registration        November 2010


1.  Introduction

   [AUTHRES] defined a new header field for electronic mail messages
   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in a
   machine-readable format.  In the interim, a proposal for rudimentary
   domain-level reputation called Vouch By Reference [VBR] was published
   and is now beginning to see popular use.

   Fortunately, [AUTHRES] created IANA registries of reporting
   properties, enabling an easy remedy for this problem.  This memo thus
   registers an additional reporting property allowing a VBR result to
   be relayed as an annotation in a message header.

2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  Discussion

   Vouch By Reference [VBR] introduced a mechanism by which a message
   receiver can query a "vouching" service to determine whether or not a
   trusted third party is willing to state that mail from a particular
   source can be considered legitimate.  When this assessment is done at
   an inbound border mail gateway, it would be useful to relay the
   result of that assessment to internal mail entities such as filters
   or user agents.

4.  Definition

   This memo adds to the "Email Authentication Method Name Registry",
   created by IANA upon publication of [AUTHRES], the "header.vbr-info"
   reporting item.  The value associated with this item in the header
   field MUST be the DNS domain name used to perform the VBR query.
   [VBR] describes the methods for selecting the construction and
   execution of that query.

   This memo also adds to the "Email Authentication Results Name
   Registry" the following result codes and definitions:

   none:  No valid VBR-Info header was found in the message, or a domain
      name to be queried could not be determined.

   pass:  A VBR query was completed and the vouching service queried
      gave a positive response.

   fail:  A VBR query was completed and the vouching service queried did
      not give a positive response.

   temperror:  A VBR query was attempted but could not be completed due
      to some error that is likely transient in nature such as a
      temporary DNS error.  A later attempt may produce a final result.

   permerror:  A VBR query was attempted but could not be completed due
      to some error that is likely not transient in nature such as a
      permanent DNS error.  A later attempt is unlikely to produce a
      final result.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], the following item is added to the "Email
   Authentication Method Name Registry":

   +------------+----------+--------+----------------+-----------------+
   |   Method   | Defined  | ptype  | property       | value           |
   +------------+----------+--------+----------------+-----------------+

   |            |          |        |                | used in a VBR   |
   |            |          |        |                | query           |
   +------------+----------+--------+----------------+-----------------+

   Also, the following item is added to the "Email Authentication Method
   Results Registry":

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo creates a mechanism for relaying [VBR] results using the
   structure already defined by [AUTHRES].  The Security Considerations
   sections of those documents should be consulted.

A.1.  VBR Results

   A message that triggered a VBR query, returning a result:

        Authentication-Results: mail-router.example.net;
              dkim=pass (good signature) header.d=newyork.example.com
                    header.b=oINEO8hg;
              vbr=pass (voucher.example.net)
                    header.vbr-info=newyork.example.com
        Received: from newyork.example.com
                  (newyork.example.com [192.0.2.250])
              by mail-router.example.net (8.11.6/8.11.6)
                  for <recipient@example.net>
                  with ESMTP id i7PK0sH7021929;
              Fri, Feb 15 2002 17:19:22 -0800
        DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; s=rashani;
              d=newyork.example.com;
              t=1188964191; c=relaxed/simple;
              h=From:Date:To:VBR-Info:Message-Id:Subject;
              bh=sEu28nfs9fuZGD/pSr7ANysbY3jtdaQ3Xv9xPQtS0m7=;
              b=oINEO8hgn/gnunsg ... 9n9ODSNFSDij3=
        From: sender@newyork.example.com
        Date: Fri, Feb 15 2002 16:54:30 -0800
        To: meetings@example.net
        VBR-Info: md=newyork.example.com; mc=transaction;
              mv=voucher.example.net
        Message-Id: <12345.abc@newyork.example.com>
        Subject: here's a sample

   Example 1: Header field reporting results from a VBR query

   Here we see an example of a message that was signed using DKIM and
   also included a VBR-Info header field.  On receipt it is found that
   the "md=" field in the latter and the "d=" field in the former
   matched and also that the DKIM signature verified, so a VBR query was
   performed.  The vouching service indicated the sender can be trusted,
   so a "pass" result is included in the Authentication-Results field
   affixed prior to delivery.
