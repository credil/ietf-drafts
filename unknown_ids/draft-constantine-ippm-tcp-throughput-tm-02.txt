Abstract

   This memo describes a methodology for measuring sustained TCP 
   throughput performance in an end-to-end managed network environment.  
   This memo is intended to provide a practical approach to help users 
   validate the TCP layer performance of a managed network, which should 
   provide a better indication of end-user application level experience.  
   In the methodology, various TCP and network parameters are identified 
   that should be tested as part of the network verification at the TCP 
   layer.

Internet-Draft      TCP Throughput Testing Methodology        March  2010


1. Introduction

   Even though RFC2544 was meant to benchmark network equipment and 
   used by network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), network providers 
   have used it to benchmark operational networks in order to  
   provide SLAs (Service Level Agreements) to their business customers. 
   Network providers are coming to the realization that RFC2544 testing 
   and TCP layer testing are required to more adequately ensure end-user 
   satisfaction. 

   Therefore, the network provider community desires to measure network
   throughput performance at the TCP layer. Measuring TCP throughput 
   provides a meaningful measure with respect to the end user's 
   application SLA (and ultimately reach some level of TCP testing 
   interoperability which does not exist today).

   The complexity of the network grows and the various queuing 
   mechanisms in the network greatly affect TCP layer performance (i.e. 
   improper default router settings for queuing, etc.) and devices such 
   as firewalls, proxies, load-balancers can actively alter the TCP 
   settings as a TCP session traverses the network (such as window size,
   MSS, etc.).  Network providers (and NEMs) are wrestling with end-end 
   complexities of the above and there is a strong interest in the 
   standardization of a test methodology to validate end-to-end TCP 
   performance (as this is the precursor to acceptable end-user 
   application performance).

   Before RFC2544 testing existed, network providers and NEMs deployed 
   a variety of ad hoc test techniques to verify the Layer 2/3 
   performance of the network.  RFC2544 was a huge step forward in the 
   network test world, standardizing the Layer 2/3 test methodology 
   which greatly improved the quality of the network and reduced 
   operational test expenses.  These managed networks are intended to be
   predictable, but therein lies the problem.  It is difficult if not 
   impossible, to extrapolate end user application layer performance 
   from RFC2544 results and the goal of RFC2544 was never intended 
   to do so.

   So the intent behind this draft TCP throughput work is to define 
   a methodology for testing sustained TCP layer performance.  In this 
   document, sustained TCP throughput is that amount of data per unit 
   time that TCP transports during equilibrium (steady state), i.e. 
   after the initial slow start phase. We refer to this state as TCP
   Equilibrium, and that the equalibrium throughput is the maximum 
   achievable for the TCP connection(s).

   One other important note; the precursor to conducting the TCP tests
   test methodlogy is to perform RFC2544 related Layer 2/3 tests.  It
   is highly recommended to run traditional RFC2544 type test to verify
   the integrity of the network before conducting TCP testing.

2. Goals of this Methodology

   Before defining the goals of this methodology, it is important to 
   clearly define the areas that are not intended to be measured or 
   analyzed by such a methodology.

   - The methodology is not intended to predict TCP throughput 
   behavior during the transient stages of a TCP connection, such 
   as initial slow start. 

   - The methodology is not intended to definitively benchmark TCP 
   implementations of one OS to another, although some users may find
   some value in conducting qualitative experiments
   
   - The methodology is not intended to provide detailed diagnosis 
   of problems within end-points or the network itself as related to 
   non-optimal TCP performance, although a results interpretation
   section for each test step may provide insight into potential
   issues within the network
   
   In contrast to the above exclusions, the goals of this methodology
   are to define a method to conduct a structured, end-to-end 
   assessment of sustained TCP performance within a managed business 
   class IP network.  A key goal is to establish a set of "best 
   practices" that an engineer should apply when validating the 
   ability of a managed network to carry end-user TCP applications.  
   
   Some specific goals are to:

   - Provide a practical test approach that specifies the more well 
   understood (and end-user configurable) TCP parameters such as Window 
   size, MSS, # connections, and how these affect the outcome of TCP 
   performance over a network

   - Provide specific test conditions (link speed, RTD, window size, 
   etc.) and maximum achievable TCP throughput under TCP Equilbrium
   conditions.  For guideline purposes, provide examples of these test 
   conditions and the maximum achievable TCP throughput during the 
   equilbrium state.  Section 2.1 provides specific details concerning 
   the definition of TCP Equilibrium within the context of this draft.
   
   - In test situations where the recommended procedure does not yield
   the maximum achievable TCP throughput result, this draft provides some 
   possible areas within the end host or network that should be 
   considered for investigation (although again, this draft is not 
   intended to provide a detailed diagnosis of these issues)

Internet-Draft      TCP Throughput Testing Methodology        March  2010

   - Testing end-end prioritization of services is a key goal.  This
   draft proposes the use of stateful TCP connections in the midst of 
   stateless background traffic such as UDP which is a very common 
   service condition in managed provider networks. The ability to test 
   stateful TCP with stateless traffic (with proper prioritization for 
   each) is a more thorough and realistic test than simply testing with
   only stateless traffic.  Further more, many networks will not tolerate
   TCP "traffic blasting" to emulate the TCP application traffic.

2.1 TCP Equilibrium State Throughput

   TCP connections have three (3) fundamental congestion window phases
   as documented in RFC-TBD.  These states are:

   - Slow Start, which occurs during the beginning of a TCP transmission
   or after a retransmission time out event

   - Congestion avoidance, which is the phase during which TCP ramps up
   to establish the maximum attainable throughput on an end-end network
   path.  Retransmissions are a natural by-product of the TCP congestion 
   avoidance algorithm as it seeks to achieve maximum throughput on 
   the network path.

   - Retransmission phase, which include Fast Retransmit (Tahoe) and Fast
   Recovery (Reno and New Reno).  When a packet is lost, the Congestion 
   avoidance phase transitions to a Fast Retransmission or Recovery
   Phase dependent upon the TCP implementation.

   The following diagram depicts these states.

            |        ssthresh
   TCP      |           |

            |           | \    /         |  Time-out           /
            |           |  \  /          |  _______          _/
            |  Slow   _/    |/           | /       | Slow  _/
            | Start _/      Congestion   |/        |Start_/   Congestion 
            |     _/         Avoidance   Loss      |   _/     Avoidance
            |   _/                       Event     | _/
            | _/                                   |/
            |/___________________________________________________________
                                                            Time

   This TCP methodology provides guidelines to measure the equilibrium
   throughput which refers to the maximum sustained rate obtained by
   congestion avoidance before packet loss conditions occur (which would
   cause the state change from congestion avoidance to a retransmission
   phase). All maximum achievable throughputs specified in Section 3 are 
   with respect to this Equilibrium state.

3. TCP Throughput Testing Methodology

   This section summarizes the specific test methodology to achieve the 
   goals listed in Section 2.

   As stated in Section 1, it is considered best practice to verify
   the integrity of the network from a Layer2/3 perspective by first
   conducting RFC2544 type testing.  If the network is not performing
   properly in terms of packet loss, jitter, etc. when running RFC2544
   tests, then the TCP layer testing will not be meaningful since the
   equalibrium throughput would be very difficult to achieve (in a 
   "dysfunctional" network).   

   The following provides the sequential order of steps to conduct the
   TCP throughput testing methodology:

   1. Baseline Round-trip Delay and Bandwidth. These measurements provide 
   estimates of the ideal TCP window size, which will be used in 
   subsequent test steps.

   2. Single TCP Connection Throughput Tests.  With baseline measurements
   of round trip delay and bandwidth, a series of single connection TCP 
   throughput tests can be conducted to baseline the performance of the 
   network against expectations.

   3. TCP MSS Throughput Testing.  By varying the MSS size of the TCP
   connection, the ability of the network to sustain expected TCP 
   throughput can be verified.

   4. Multiple TCP Connection Throughput Tests.  Single connection TCP 
   testing is a useful first step to measure expected versus actual TCP 
   performance. The multiple connection test more closely emulates 
   customer traffic, which comprise many TCP connections over a network
   link.

   5. TCP Sessions with Stateless Background Traffic.  This step assesses 
   the ability of the network to carry end user TCP application traffic
   concurrent with stateless background traffic.  The prioritization must 
   be configured properly throughout the network to allow either the TCP 
   traffic or the stateless traffic to receive the expected priority.

   Important to note are some of the key characteristics and 
   considerations for the TCP test instrument.  The test host may be a
   standard computer or dedicated communications test instrument 
   and these TCP test hosts be capable of emulating both a client and a
   server.  

   Whether the TCP test host is a standard computer or dedicated test
   instrument, the following areas should be considered when selecting
   a test host:

Constantine, et al.	Expires September 7, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      TCP Throughput Testing Methodology        March  2010


   - TCP implementation used by the test host OS, i.e. Linux OS kernel 
   using TCP Reno, TCP options supported, etc.  This will obviously be 
   more important when using custom test equipment where the TCP 
   implementation may be customized or tuned to run in higher 
   performance hardware

   - Most importantly, the TCP test host must be capable of generating 
   and receiving stateful TCP test traffic at the full link speed of the 
   network under test. This requirement is very serious and may require
   custom test equipment, especially on 1 GigE and 10 GigE networks.
   
3.1. Baseline Round-trip Delay and Bandwidth

   Before stateful TCP testing can begin, it is important to baseline 
   the round trip delay and bandwidth of the network to be tested.  
   These measurements provide estimates of the ideal TCP window size, 
   which will be used in subsequent test steps.     
   
   These latency and bandwidth tests should be run over a long enough 
   period of time to characterize the performance of the network over 
   the course of a meaningful time period.  One example would 
   be to take samples during various times of the work day. The goal 
   would be to determine a representative minimum, average, and maximum 
   RTD and bandwidth for the network under test.  Topology changes are 
   to be avoided during this time of initial convergence (e.g. in 
   crossing BGP4 boundaries).    

   In some cases, baselining bandwidth may not be required, since a 
   network provider's end-to-end topology may be well enough defined.

3.1.1 Techniques to Measure Round Trip Time

   We follow in the definitions used in the references of the appendix; 
   hence Round Trip Time (RTT) is the time elapsed between the clocking 
   in of the first bit of a payload packet to the receipt of the last 
   bit of the corresponding acknowledgement.  Round Trip Delay (RTD) 
   is used synonymously to twice the Link Latency.
 
   In any method used to baseline round trip delay between network 
   end-points, it is important to realize that network latency is the
   sum of inherent network delay and congestion.  The RTT should be
   baselined during "off-peak" hours to obtain a reliable figure for
   network latency (versus additional delay caused by congestion).

   During the actual sustained TCP throughput tests, it is critical
   to measure RTT along with measured TCP throughput. Congestive 
   effects can be isolated if RTT is concurrently measured.

   This is not meant to provide an exhaustive list, but summarizes some 
   of the more common ways to determine round trip time (RTT) through 
   the network. The desired resolution of the measurement (i.e. msec 
   versus usec) may dictate whether the RTT measurement can be achieved 
   with standard tools such as ICMP ping techniques or whether 
   specialized test equipment would be required with high precision 
   timers.  The objective in this section is to list several techniques 
   in order of decreasing accuracy.

   - Use test equipment on each end of the network, "looping" the 
   far-end tester so that a packet stream can be measured end-end.  This
   test equipment RTT measurement may be compatible with delay 
   measurement protocols specified in RFC5357.

   - Conduct packet captures of TCP test applications using for example 
  "iperf" or FTP, etc.  By running multiple experiments, the packet 
   captures can be studied to estimate RTT based upon the SYN -> SYN-ACK 
   handshakes within the TCP connection set-up.

  - ICMP Pings may also be adequate to provide round trip time 
   estimations.  Some limitations of ICMP Ping are the msec resolution 
   and whether the network elements / end points respond to pings (or 
   block them).

 
3.1.2 Techniques to Measure End-end Bandwidth

   There are many well established techniques available to provide 
   estimated measures of bandwidth over a network.  This measurement 
   should be conducted in both directions of the network, especially for 
   access networks which are inherently asymmetrical.  Some of the 
   asymmetric implications to TCP performance are documented in RFC-3449
   and the results of this work will be further studied to determine 
   relevance to this draft.

   The bandwidth measurement test must be run with stateless IP streams 
   (not stateful TCP) in order to determine the available bandwidth in 
   each direction.  And this test should obviously be performed at 
   various intervals throughout a business day (or even across a week).
   Ideally, the bandwidth test should produce a log output of the 
   bandwidth achieved across the test interval AND the round trip delay.  
   
   And during the actual TCP level performance measurements (Sections
   3.2 - 3.5), the test tool must be able to track round trip time
   of the TCP connection(s) during the test.  Measuring round trip time
   variation (aka "jitter") provides insight into effects of congestive
   delay on the sustained throughput achieved for the TCP layer test.

Internet-Draft      TCP Throughput Testing Methodology        March  2010

3.2. Single TCP Connection Throughput Tests

   This draft specifically defines TCP throughput techniques to verify
   sustained TCP performance in a managed business network.  Defined
   in section 2.1, the equalibrium throughput reflects the maximum
   rate achieved by a TCP connection within the congestion avoidance
   phase on a end-end network path.  This section and others will define 
   the method to conduct these sustained throughput tests and guidelines 
   of the predicted results.

   With baseline measurements of round trip time and bandwidth 
   from section 3.1, a series of single connection TCP throughput tests 
   can be conducted to baseline the performance of the network against 
   expectations.  The optimum TCP window size can be calculated from 
   the bandwidth delay product (BDP), which is:

   BDP = RTT x Bandwidth

   By dividing the BDP by 8, the "ideal" TCP window size is calculated.
   An example would be a T3 link with 25 msec RTT.  The BDP would equal 
   ~1,105,000 bits and the ideal TCP window would equal ~138,000 bytes.

   The following table provides some representative network link speeds,
   latency, BDP, and associated "optimum" TCP window size.  Sustained
   TCP transfers should reach nearly 100% throughput, minus the overhead
   of Layers 1-3 and the divisor of the MSS into the window.

   For this single connection baseline test, the MSS size will effect 
   the achieved throughput (especially for smaller TCP window sizes).
   Table 3.2 provides the achievable, equalibrium TCP 
   throughput (at Layer 4) using 1000 byte MSS.  Also in this table, 
   the case of 58 byte L1-L4 overhead including the Ethernet CRC32 is 
   used for simplicity.

   * Note that link speed is the minimum link speed throughput a network; 
   i.e. WAN with T1 link, etc.

   Also, the following link speeds (available payload bandwidth) were
   used for the WAN entries:

   - T1 = 1.536 Mbits/sec (B8ZS line encoding facility)
   - T3 = 44.21 Mbits/sec (C-Bit Framing)
   - T3(ATM) = 36.86 Mbits/sec (C-Bit Framing & PLCP, 96000 Cells per 
     second) 

   The calculation method used in this document is a 3 step process :


   1 - We determine what should be the optimal TCP Window size value 
       based on the optimal quantity of "in-flight" octets discovered by 
       the BDP calculation. We take into consideration that the TCP 
       Window size has to be an exact multiple value of the MSS.
   2 - Then we calculate the achievable layer 2 throughput by multiplying
       the value determined in step 1 with the MSS & (MSS + L2 + L3 + L4 
       Overheads) divided by the RTT.
   3 - Finally, we multiply the calculated value of step 2 by the MSS 
       versus (MSS + L2 + L3 + L4 Overheads) ratio.

   This gives us the achievable TCP Throughput value.  Sometimes, the 
   maximum achievable throughput is limited by the maximum achievable 
   quantity of Ethernet Frames per second on the physical media. Then 
   this value is used in step 2 instead of the calculated one. 

   There are several TCP tools that are commonly used in the network 
   provider world and one of the most common is the "iperf" tool.  With 
   this tool, hosts are installed at each end of the network segment; 
   one as client and the other as server.  The TCP Window size of both 
   the client and the server can be maunally set and the achieved 
   throughput is measured, either uni-directionally or bi-directionally.  
   For higher BDP situations in lossy networks (long fat networks or 
   satellite links, etc.), TCP options such as Selective Acknowledgment 
   should be considered and also become part of the window 
   size / throughput characterization.

Internet-Draft      TCP Throughput Testing Methodology        March  2010

   The single connection TCP throughput test must be run over a 
   a long duration and results must be logged at the desired interval.  
   The test must record RTT and TCP retransmissions at each interval. 

   This correlation of retransmissions and RTT over the course of the 
   test will clearly identify which portions of the transfer reached
   TCP Equilbrium state and to what effect increased RTT (congestive
   effects) may have been the cause of reduced equilibrium performance.

   Host hardware performance must be well understood before conducting
   this TCP single connection test and other tests in this section. 
   Dedicated test equipment may be required, especially for line rates 
   of GigE and 10 GigE.
    

3.2.1 Interpretation of the Single Connection TCP Throughput Results

   At the end of this step, the user will document the theoretical BDP 
   and a set of Window size experiments with measured TCP throughput for
   each TCP window size setting.  For cases where the sustained TCP 
   throughput does not equal the predicted value, some possible causes 
   are listed:

   - Network congestion causing packet loss
   - Network congestion not causing packet loss, but effectively
   increasing the size of the required TCP window during the transfer
   - Network fragmentation at the IP layer 
   - Intermediate network devices which actively regenerate the TCP
   connection and can alter window size, MSS, etc.  


3.3. TCP MSS Throughput Testing

   This test setup should be conducted as a single TCP connection test.
   By varying the MSS size of the TCP connection, the ability of the 
   network to sustain expected TCP throughput can be verified.  This is 
   similar to frame and packet size techniques within RFC2-2544, which 
   aim to determine the ability of the routing/switching devices to 
   handle loads in term of packets/frames per second at various frame 
   and packet sizes.  This test can also further characterize the 
   performance of a network in the presence of active TCP elements 
   (proxies, etc.), devices that fragment IP packets, and the actual 
   end hosts themselves (servers, etc.).

3.3.1 TCP Test for Network Path MTU

   TCP implementations should use Path MTU Discovery techniques (PMTUD),
   but this technique does not always prove reliable in real world 
   situations.  Since PMTUD relies on ICMP messages (to inform the host
   that unfragmented transmission cannot occur), PMTUD is not always
   reliable since many network managers completely disable ICMP.

Internet-Draft      TCP Throughput Testing Methodology        March  2010
 
   Increasingly network providers and enterprises are instituting fixed 
   MTU sizes on the hosts to eliminate TCP fragmentation issues in the 
   application.

   Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery or PLPMTUD (RFC4821) should
   be conducted to verify the minimum network path MTU.  Conducting
   the PLPMTUD test establishes the upper limit upon the MTU, which in
   turn establishes the upper limit for the MSS testing of section 3.3.2.
   MSS refers specifically to the payload size of the TCP packet and does 
   not include TCP or IP headers.

3.3.2 MSS Size Testing Method

   The single connection testing listed in Section 3.2 should be 
   repeated, using the appropriate window size and collecting 
   throughput measurements per various MSS sizes. 

   The following are the typical sizes of MSS settings for various
   link speeds:

   - 256 bytes for very low speed links such as 9.6Kbps (per RFC1144). 
   - 536 bytes for low speed links (per RFC879) .
   - 966 bytes for SLIP high speed (per RFC1055).
   - 1380 bytes for IPSec VPN Tunnel testing
   - 1452 bytes for PPPoE connectivity (per RFC2516)
   - 1460 for Ethernet and Fast Ethernet (per RFC895).
   - 8960 byte jumbo frames for GigE

   Using the optimum window size determined by conducting steps 3.1 and 
   3.2, a variety of window sizes should be tested according to the link
   speed under test.  Using Fast Ethernet with 5 msec RTT as an example, 
   the optimum TCP window size would be 62.5 kbytes and the recommended 
   MSS for Fast Ethernet is 1460 bytes.

3.3.3 Interpretation of TCP MSS Throughput Results

   For cases where the predicted TCP throughput does not equal the 
   predicted throughput predicted for a given MSS, some possible causes 
   are listed:

   - TBD  
   

3.4. Multiple TCP Connection Throughput Tests 

   After baselining the network under test with a single TCP connection 
   (Section 3.2), the nominal capacity of the network has been 
   determined.  The capacity measured in section 3.2 may be a capacity 
   range and it is reasonable that some level of tuning may have been 
   required (i.e. router shaping techniques employed, intermediary 
   proxy like devices tuned, etc.). 

   Single connection TCP testing is a useful first step to measure 
   expected versus actual TCP performance and as a means to diagnose 
   / tune issues in the network and active elements.  However, the 
   ultimate goal of this methodology is to more closely emulate customer 
   traffic, which comprise many TCP connections over a network link.  
   This methodology inevitably seeks to provide the framework for 
   testing stateful TCP connections in concurrence with stateless 
   traffic streams, and this is described in Section 3.5.


3.4.1 Multiple TCP Connections - below Link Capacity

   First, the ability of the network to carry multiple TCP connections 
   to full network capacity should be tested.  Prioritization and QoS 

Constantine, et al.	Expires September 7, 2010               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      TCP Throughput Testing Methodology        March  2010
    
   settings are not considered during this step, since the network 
   capacity is not to be exceeded by the test traffic (section 3.3.2 
   covers the over capacity test case). 

   For this multiple connection TCP throughput test, the number of 
   connections will more than likely be limited by the test tool (host 
   vs. dedicated test equipment).  As an example, for a GigE link with 
   1 msec RTT, the optimum TCP window would equal ~128 KBytes. So under
   this condition, 8 concurrent connections with window size equal to 
   16KB would fill the GigE link.  For 10G, 80 connections would be 
   required to accomplish the same.

   Just as in section 3.2, the end host or test tool can not be the  
   processing bottleneck or the throughput measurements will not be 
   valid.  The test tool must be benchmarked in ideal lab conditions to 
   verify it's ability to transfer stateful TCP traffic at the given 
   network line rate. 

   For this test step, it should be conducted over a reasonable test 
   duration and results should be logged per interval such as throughput
   per connection, RTT, and retransmissions. 

   Since the network is not to be driven into over capacity (by nature 
   of the BDP allocated evenly to each connection), this test verifies 
   the ability of the network to carry multiple TCP connections up to 
   the link speed of the network.  


3.4.2 Multiple TCP Connections - over Link Capacity

   In this step, the network bandwidth is intentionally exceeded with 
   multiple TCP connections to test expected prioritization and queuing 
   within the network.

   All conditions related to Section 3.3 set-up apply, especially the
   ability of the test hosts to transfer stateful TCP traffic at network
   line rates.  

   Using the same example from Section 3.2, a GigE link with 1 msec 
   RTT would require a window size of 128 KB to fill the link (with 
   one TCP connection).  Assuming a 16KB window, 8 concurrent 
   connections would fill the GigE link capacity and values higher than 
   8 would over-subscribe the network capacity.  The user would select 
   values to over-subscribe the network (i.e. possibly 10 15, 20, etc.) 
   to conduct experiments to verify proper prioritization and queuing 
   within the network.

   Without any prioritization in the network, the over subscribed test 
   results could assist in the queuing studies.  With proper queuing, 
   the bandwidth should be shared in a reasonable manner.  The author

   understands that the term "reasonable" is too wide open, and future 
   draft versions of this memo would attempt to quantify this sharing 
   in more tangible terms.  It is known that if a network element 
   is not set for proper queuing (i.e. FIFO), then an oversubscribed
   TCP connection test will generally show a very uneven distribution of
   bandwidth.

   With prioritization in the network, different TCP connections can be 
   assigned various QoS settings via the various mechanisms (i.e. per 
   VLAN, DSCP, etc.), and the higher priority connections must be 
   verified to achieve the expected throughput.  


3.5. TCP Sessions with Stateless Background Traffic

   The ultimate intent of this methodology is to more accurately assess 
   the ability of the network to carry end user TCP application traffic
   concurrent with stateless background traffic.  The background traffic 
   may be of a lower priority than the TCP traffic (i.e. background is 
   best effort Internet), or the background traffic may be of higher 
   priority (i.e.UDP representing voice).  The prioritization must be 
   configured properly throughout the network to allow either the TCP 
   foreground traffic or the stateless background traffic to receive 
   the expected priority.

   For this test, each stateful TCP connection must be able to have a
   unique prioritization.  Depending upon the network prioritization 
   scheme (i.e. VLAN, DSCP, MPLS, etc.), the test system must allow for 
   unique identification of each connection.  The same applies for the 
   stateless background streams.  The individual background streams must
   also be tagged or identified based upon the prioritization mechanism.


3.5.1. TCP Foreground Traffic Control

   In addition to the prioritization of each individual TCP connection, 
   the desired bandwidth for each TCP connection must be configurable.  
   Depending upon the capabilities of the test system, this bandwidth 
   rate may be discretely controlled (or shaped) by the test system or 
   may also be controlled by limiting the window size of each 
   connection.  The sophistication of the test system will dictate which
   bandwidth control mechanism is used for the TCP connections.  The 
   window based approach allows the TCP traffic to reach the maximum
   achievable within the bandwidth capacity of the link (BDP), which
   may be the intended test configuration.  Each TCP foreground 
   connection should also have configurable MSS size as well.

3.5.2  Stateless Background Traffic Control

   Each stateless background traffic stream must be configurable in 
   terms of the offered network bandwidth. The frame / packet sizes
   of the background traffic streams should be individually 
   configurable.  Ideally, the test system should allow for the 
   stateless background traffic to ramp up from a configurable starting
   bandwidth to the final bandwidth setting (i.e. start at 10 Mbps,
   incrementing by 5 Mbps, until reaching 50 Mbps).  The time step of 
   the ramping function should also be programmable.  Ramping of the  
   background traffic facilitates the study of the effect of stateless
   background traffic on foreground TCP traffic.


3.5.3. Test Methodology for TCP + Stateless Background Traffic

   Depending upon the prioritization within the provider's network, 
   there are many permutations of prioritization between TCP sessions,
   background streams, and combinations between.  This memo will 
   summarize two common use cases: 1) higher priority TCP stateful 
   traffic in the midst of best effort background traffic; 2) higher
   priority stateless traffic (i.e. VoIP) in the midst of lower 
   priority TCP stateful traffic.

3.5.3.1. Prioritized Stateful TCP Traffic Test

   In this test, the intent is to verify that a business class data 
   service (i.e. thin client, web-based application traffic) is given
   proper priority in times of high utilization.  For this test
   case, the TCP connections are given priority via the prioritization
   mechanism used in the network (VLAN, DSCP, etc..) and the stateless
   background traffic is given lower priority (or best effort).

   By one of the traffic control techniques listed in Section 3.5.1, the
   stateful TCP connections are allocated bandwidth within the test 
   system and ideally the background traffic will perform a ramp traffic
   function.  The results of this test should show that the 
   prioritized stateful TCP traffic reaches the designated throughput
   and is not disturbed when the best effort background traffic exceeds
   the link capacity.  The test results should be logged during the test
   interval, with each TCP connection's throughput, retransmissions, and
   RTT recorded (along with the background traffic levels).


3.5.3.2. Prioritized Stateless Traffic Test

   The corollary to section 3.5.3.1 is the case where the stateless
   traffic is higher priority than the stateful TCP traffic.  This may
   be the case where a network provider is offering VoIP services in 
   addition to regular IP data service.  Even though the TCP traffic is

   prioritized lower than the stateless traffic, it is important to
   determine how the TCP traffic reacts in the presence of over
   subscription (this can again point to non-optimized queuing
   techniques in the network for the TCP traffic as discussed in 
   Section 3.3.2.).

   With the TCP offered bandwidth set by one of the traffic control 
   mechanisms listed in Section 3.5.1., the higher priority stateless 
   traffic should be ramped up to exceed the link capacity.  The results
   of this test should show that the higher priority stateless traffic 
   achieves the designated bandwidth and that the TCP connection 
   bandwidth is reduced.  By studying the logged TCP and stateless 
   traffic throughput over the test interval (and the retransmissions 
   + RTT for the TCP traffic), the manner in which the TCP connections 
   shared the remaining bandwidth may provide insight into possible 
   queuing optimizations in the network.
    
3.5.3.3.  Other Traffic Test Cases

   Sections 3.5.3.2 and 3.5.3.3 lay out the basic foundation for 
   testing the prioritization effects of TCP traffic and background
   stateless traffic.  There are many hybrids that can also be 
   pertinent, dependant upon the network provider's offering.  An 
   example would be strictly an IP service type test.  In this case,
   the network provider seeks to test various prioritizations of each
   stateful TCP connection and verify that the higher priority TCP
   connection(s) achieve the SLA bandwidth while the others do not.  
   Regardless of the prioritization profile of the TCP connections 
   and the background streams, the same test results should be 
   recorded across the entire test interval (as specified in Section
   3.5.3.1 and 3.5.3.2)
