Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link       July 2009


1.  Introduction

   In some deployments of the Mobile IPv6 Support for Dual Stack Hosts
   and Routers (DSMIPv6) [RFC5555] there may be IPv6-only access links
   that are also appear to a mobile nodes (MN) as their home link.  A
   particular example is a 2G/3G GPRS [3GPP.23.060] access where it is
   possible to provide IPv6-only access although the MN can be dual
   stack and the gateway terminating the access links can also be dual
   stack.  From now on we refer this kind of deployment as "IPv6-only
   home link" while we acknowledge it is not the best description of the
   deployment scenario.  When the MN is on its "IPv6-only home link"
   that does not imply the IPv4 Home Address (HoA) assigned to the MN is
   also conceptually on MN's home link.  Furthermore, there might not be
   other way to forward IPv4 traffic to the MN than tunnel them from the
   home agent (HA) over the IPv6-only access link to the MN.  This
   basically implies that there are situations where the MN is on its
   "home link" from the IPv6 point of view but must still retain the
   DSMIPv6 binding to be able to send and receive IPv4 traffic.

   DSMIPv6 does not allow the MN to maintain a binding with the HA for
   its IPv4 HoA while being attached to the home link from IPv6 point of
   view, as stated in Section 4.4.2.1 of [RFC5555].  This document
   extends the DSMIP6 protocol to allow usage of the IPv4 HoA from the
   IPv6-only access link that also appear as the "IPv6 home link" to the
   MN.  A MN attached to an "IPv6-only home link" is allowed to register
   its IPv6 home address as a care-of address for its IPv4 home address
   while at the same time de-registering the IPv6 binding.  In such
   configuration there is no tunneling overhead for the IPv6 traffic and
   the MN is able to tunnel IPv4 traffic using the IPv4 HoA over the
   IPv6 access link.

   Section Section 3 of this specification discusses the envisioned
   deployment scenarios in more detail.

   Section Section 4 describes how a DSMIPv6-enabled MN that is attached
   to a foreign network returns to the "IPv6-only home link" while
   maintaining the IPv4 connectivity.

   Section Section 5 provides detailed requirements for MN and HA.


2.  Terminology

   General Mobile IPv6 related terminology is defined in [RFC3775].
   DSMIPv6 related terminology is described in [RFC5555].

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link       July 2009


   IPv6-only Home Link

      A deployment where a dual stack mobile node is attached to an
      access link that is only able to provide IPv6 transport and that
      access link also appear to the mobile node as its Mobile IPv6 home
      link.  The gateway (most likely collocated with a home agent
      functionality) terminating the IPv6-only access link is dual stack
      internally and connected to the IPv4/IPv6 Internet.


3.  Example Deployment Configuration

   This section describes an example scenario, where a MN's "home link"
   provides IPv6-only access.  In this scenario the HA is collocated
   with the default router, and the MN's access link (i.e. the "home
   link" from the MN point of view) is configured to support only IPv6.
   However, the HA has connectivity to IPv4/IPv6 Internet on its
   northbound interface.  Since the HA is a fully functional DSMIPv6 HA,
   it can provide IPv4 HoA and IPv4 connectivity service to the MN.  In
   this case the IPv4 home link appears as a "virtual home link" to the
   MN (meaning the MN is always attached to a foreign link from the
   Mobile IP point of view) and the MN tunnels the IPv4 traffic via its
   on-link IPv6 address to the HA, and vice versa.  As the MN is IPv6-
   wise at home, there is no tunnel overhead for the IPv6 traffic.  This
   configuration is shown in Figure 1.

4.  Solution Overview

   Following sections describe how the Binding Update (BU) and the
   Binding Acknowledgement (BA) messages has to be updated in order to
   avoid complete binding de-registration when a MN attaches to an
   "IPv6-only home link".  Currently when a MN attaches to its home
   link, as described in Section 4.4.2.1. of [RFC5555] and in Sections
   9.5. and 11.5.4. of [RFC3775]), would cause a de-registration of the
   whole binding including the IPv4 HoA.

4.1.  Binding Update Extensions

   This specification extends the Binding Update message with a new 'X'
   flag.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 2: Binding Update Message

   Tunnel flag 'X'

   A new flag 'X' is introduced in the Binding Update message to
   indicate a request to register the IPv6 HoA as the Care-of Address
   (CoA) for the IPv4 HoA.  The MN MAY set this flag only when it sends
   a BU message from an IPv6-only link that appears as the Mobile IPv6
   home link to the MN.  If this flag is set, the BU message MUST also
   contain the IPv4 HoA option [RFC5555] and the HA MUST retain the
   binding for the IPv4 HoA.

4.2.  Binding Acknowledgment Extensions

   This specification extends the BA message with a new 'X' flag.

                 Figure 3: Binding Acknowledgement Message

   Tunnel Flag 'X'

   A new flag 'X' is included in the BA message to indicate that the HA
   has created the Binding Cache Entry (BCE) for the IPv4 HoA with the
   IPv6 HoA as the CoA.

4.3.  Registration Process on the Home Link

   Assume a MN has been configured with the following three addresses:

       v6HoA  MN's IPv6 home address
       v4HoA  MN's IPv4 home address
       v6HA   HA's IPv6 address

   and currently is located in an IPv6 foreign network using

       v6CoA  MN's IPv6 care-of address

   The MN has, using DSMIPv6, already made a registration with the HA
   for both of its home addresses.

   When the MN returns home to an IPv6-only home link, the MN sends the
   following packet in order to register its on-link IPv6 address as the
   CoA for the IPv4 HoA.  The usage of the Alternate Care-of Address
   option [RFC3775] while on the home link is optional and hence it may
   be omitted:

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link       July 2009


       IPv6 Header (src = v6HoA, dst = v6HA)
       ESP Header
       Mobility Header
           type = 5 (Binding Update), X-flag=1
           lifetime non-zero
           [Alternate Care-of Address option (v6HoA)]
           IPv4 Home Address option (v4HoA)

   The HA sends the following response:

       IPv6 Header (src = v6HA, dst = v6HoA)
       ESP Header
       Mobility Header
           type = 6 (Binding Acknowledgement), X-flag=1
           lifetime non-zero
           IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option (v4HoA)

   Although the packet exchange specified above appears obvious, the
   packet exchange modifies the normal semantics of bindings in two
   ways.

   First, according to [RFC3775] Section 9.5, the HA when processing the
   BU will determine the specified CoA to be the address found in the
   Alternate Care-of Address option, i.e. v6HoA, or detect that the
   Alternate Care-of Address option was omitted.  Furthermore, it will
   determine the HoA to be the source address of the IPv6 header, i.e.
   v6HoA.  With this input, the HA will conclude the binding update is a
   de-registration, even if lifetime is non-zero.  When a DSMIPv6 HA
   detects a de-registration of the IPv6 home address, it releases the
   entries for both the IPv6 and IPv4 HoAs.  Therefore, the 'X' flag
   introduced by this specification changes the normal semantics of
   deletion of a Binding Cache Entry (BCE) as it requires that only the
   IPv6 entry is removed.

   Another point relates to the de-registration of the IPv4 HoA from the
   IPv6-only home link.  Suppose the MN has installed the entry:

       v4HoA -> v6HoA

   in the Binding Cache (BE).  Assume the MN no longer wants IPv4
   connectivity, and wants to clear the BCE.  The MN will clear the
   entry by sending a BU message with a lifetime of zero.  This message
   is sent using v6HoA as source address.  However, the BC has no v6HoA
   entry.  This means the entry in the BCE cannot be found and cleared.

   One way to resolve this is to mandate that the MN includes the IPv4
   HoA as part of the de-registration BU message which is then used by
   the HA to locate the corresponding BCE.

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link       July 2009


   Another way to resolve this is to ensure the HA maintains a dummy
   entry for the v6HoA, such that the BC reads:

       v6HoA -> v6HoA
       v4HoA -> v6HoA

   Inserting such a dummy entry in order to bypass tunneling seems a
   substantial change of semantics.  This is essentially the same as the
   concept of the home binding described in Section 5.6.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa].

   The packet exchanges used above for returning to an IPv6-only home
   link are also used when the MN boots on an IPv6-only home link, or
   when making a re-registration to extend the lifetime.  They are also
   to be used when the MN is attached to the native dual stack home
   network, and discovers that, for some reason, the native IPv4
   connectivity no longer works.  When the that IPv4 connectivity later
   resumes and the MN discovers that by some means, the MN MAY remove
   the IPv4 HoA binding and use IPv4 natively (assuming it is acceptable
   for applications that the used IPv4 address may change).


5.  Protocol Operation

   This specification introduces the new 'X' flag in the BU and BA
   messages.  The 'X' flag in the BU message indicates a request to bind
   the IPv4 home address to the IPv6 home address as the CoA.  The 'X'
   flag in BA indicates that the HA successfully created the binding
   between the IPv4 HoA and the IPv6 HoA.

5.1.  Mobile Node Considerations

   When a DSMIPv6-enabled MN is connected to an IPv6-only home link, it
   MAY register its IPv6 HoA as the CoA for its IPv4 HoA by setting the
   'X' flag in the BU message, including the IPv4 Home Address option
   and setting the CoA in the BU message to its IPv6 HoA.  In this case
   the MN MUST tunnel any IPv4 traffic sourced from the IPv4 HoA via its
   IPv6 HoA to the HA.

   If the MN registered its IPv6 HoA as the CoA for its IPv4 HoA, the MN
   MUST maintain a BU list entry for the IPv4 HoA containing the IPv6
   HoA as the CoA.

5.2.  Home Agent Considerations

   If the MN's current CoA as received in the BU message equals the MN's
   IPv6 HoA, the HA MUST deprecate the BCE for the IPv6 HoA.  If the 'X'
   flag was set and the IPv4 HoA was included in the same BU message and



Premec & Korhonen       Expires January 14, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link       July 2009


   the lifetime filed is non-zero, the HA MUST update the BCE for the
   IPv4 HoA with the IPv6 HoA as the CoA.

   If the HA updated the IPv4 BCE with the IPv6 HoA as the CoA, it MUST
   set the 'X' flag in the BA message.

   When the MN registers its IPv6 HoA as the CoA for the IPv4 HoA, the
   HA MUST intercept the traffic destined to the MN's IPv4 HoA and
   tunnel it to the MN's IPv6 HoA.

   When the HA receives the BU that was sent from the "IPv6-only home
   link" and where the lifetime is set to zero, the HA releases both the
   IPv6 and IPv4 BCEs.  If no IPv6 BCE was found, but the BU message
   contains the IPv4 HoA, the HA MUST use the IPv4 HoA from the BU
   message to locate the corresponding IPv4 BCE and release it.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends that the same level of security is applied
   to the packets sent natively to/from the MN's on-link home address
   and to the packets on the virtual home link that are tunneled to the
   MN's on-link home address.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new flag 'X' in the Binding Update
   and Binging Acknowledgement messages from the RFC3775 Binding Update
   Flags and the RFC3775 Binding Acknowledgment Flags registries.
