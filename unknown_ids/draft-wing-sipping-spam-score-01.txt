Internet-Draft               SIP Spam Score                February 2008


1.  Introduction

   It is desirable for SIP proxies to insert a spam score so that
   downstream SIP proxies and downstream SIP user agents can use a high
   score to decide that special handling is required.  For example, a
   score above 20 might cause one of the spam avoidance techniques
   described in [RFC5039] to be triggered for this call.

   This specification allows each SIP proxy to contribute spam scoring
   information that can be useful to downstream SIP proxies and the SIP
   user agent (UA).  The downstream SIP proxies or SIP UA might ignore
   that information (e.g., it doesn't trust the SIP proxy that generated
   the spam score) or might use it.

   Note that this document does not make the attempt to define how the
   spam score was derived nor to distribute information that could be
   used to verify the spam score generation.  Furthermore, this document
   does not attempt to cryptographically bind the identity of the entity
   generating the score to the value itself.  Hence, its usage is likely
   to be useful only between neighboring administrative domains
   communicating such a score.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Operation of Spam-Scoring Proxy

   A SIP proxy evaluates an incoming SIP request and generates a spam
   score using a local mechanism.  This score is between 0 (indicating
   the message is not spam) and 100 (indicating the message is spam).
   Values between 0 and 100 indicate the 'likelihood' that the SIP
   request is spam, with higher values indicating a higher likelihood
   the message is spam.

   This spam score is inserted into the new "Spam-Score" header.  This
   header field contains a summary spam score and optionally contains
   detail information.  The detail information is implementation
   dependent.  The detail information is valuable for debugging and to
   provide the SIP user agent or SIP proxy with additional information
   regarding how the spam-scoring SIP proxy's local mechanism arrived at
   the summary spam score.

4.  Operation of Proxy or User Agent

   A downstream proxy or the SIP user agent MAY use the spam score or
   spam-detail information to change call routing or call handling.  It
   is envisioned that some form of policies indicate the trusted proxies
   in order to decide which spam scores to consider for special call
   treatment.

      In some jurisdictions, the end user needs to authorize call
      handling, including rejection of a call based on a spam score.
      Mechanisms to allow users to influence such policies are, however,
      out of scope of this document.

   The behavior of the SIP proxy or user agent when the spam score is
   above a certain value is a local policy matter.  Examples of behavior
   include:

   o  a SIP request with a high spam score might cause a proxy or user
      agent to redirect the SIP request to company's main telephone
      extension or to the user's voicemail

   o  a user agent might alert the user by flashing the phone (without
      audible ringing)

   o  a user agent might allow calls with a spam score below a certain
      value during daylight hours, but deny such calls at night.

   o  a proxy might challenge the caller to complete a Turing test.

5.  Grammar

   ABNF using the ABNF syntax of [RFC3261]:

     extension-header   = spam-score [ SP ";" spam-detail ]

     spam-score         = score SP "by" SP hostname
     score              = 1*3DIGIT [ "." 0*3DIGIT ]

     spam-detail        = "detail" EQUAL detail
     detail             = QUOTE mech SEMI rule-score
                          *(COMMA rule-score) QUOTE
                          ; mathematical average of the rule-scores
                          ; MUST be same as spam-score

     rule-score         = rule [ "=" score ]
     mech               = token
     rule               = token

                              Figure 1: ABNF


6.  Examples

   The following example shows a SIP score generated and inserted by two
   SIP proxies, sip.example.com and sip.example.net.  In this example,
   sip.example.com is owned by a spammer who is trying to fool
   downstream systems with their low spam score (0).  However, the
   example.net proxies and user agents only pay attention to spam scores
   from Spam-Score headers generated by example.net proxies, so
   example.com's attempts to fool the downstream proxies (with its low
   spam score) are in vain.

7.  Security Considerations

   SIP proxies and SIP user agents need to ignore spam scores generated
   by proxies that aren't trusted.
