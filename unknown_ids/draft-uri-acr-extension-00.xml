    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme "acr".
      The "acr" URI describes an anonymous reference, that can be mapped to a resource or user.
      There are multiple situations where the true identity of a user or a resources can not be disclosed.
      The "acr" URI is a globally unique identifier ( "name" ) only;
      it does not describe the steps necessary to reach the user or the device.
      However it can contain a parameter indication what body or organisation that could resolve it.
      It is intended for privacy protection, where a user trusts a translating party,
      that can route or forward the request or message to the true user or resource.
      </t>

    </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>
        and indicate the requirements levels for compliant implementations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="URI syntax">

        <t>The URI is defined using AB-NF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form)
        as described in <xref target="RFC2234">RFC 2234</xref>
        and uses elements from the core definitions (appendix A of RFC 2234).</t>

   <t>The syntax definition follows <xref target="RFC2396">RFC 2396</xref>, indicating the
   actual characters contained in the URI.  If the reserved characters
   "+", ";", "=", and "?" are used as delimiters between components of
   the "tel" URI, they MUST NOT be percent encoded.  These characters
   MUST be percent encoded if they appear in tel URI parameter values.</t>

   <t>Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
   <xref target="RFC2396">RFC 2396</xref> ) are equivalent to their "% HEX HEX" percent
   encoding.</t>

   <t>The "acr" URI has the following syntax:</t>

<t>The "anonymous-subscriber-identifier" can be created from some suitable user or customer
	 data such as, phone number, and validation date. 
	 In order to provide anonymisation, this data MUST not be included unchanged within the ACR. 
	 Rather it MUST be encrypted, hashed, represented by a lookup reference or otherwise obfuscated. 
	 The issuing provider is responsible for dereferencing the ACR to the user or resource. 
	 For example the SHA-256 algorithm can hash the sensitive data:</t>

<t>SHA256("")= e3b0c442 98fc1c14 9afbf4c8 996fb924 27ae41e4 649b934c a495991b 7852b855</t>

	 	<t>In order to know who issued the identifier the Network Code or domain name MUST be included,
	 	for cross-operator identification and to ensure it is known which entity can dereference the ACR. 
	 	In addition a network country identifier MUST be provided (either as part of the network code, 
	 	or separately) to avoid confusion where networks operate in multiple countries. 
	 	A URI for ACR documentation MAY be included; for example, to discover further metadata, 
	 	or to list the service endpoints which can consume the ACR. </t>

    <section anchor="Rationale" title="Rationale">
    	<section title="Privacy policies">
    		<t>Existing privacy policies and legislation restrict the sharing of certain user identifiers, 
    			such as the MSISDN, since it may be used to broach a user&rsquo; s privacy (unauthorized location lookup, 
    			cold calling, SMS Spam etc.). An ACR prevents such identifiers from being circulated.</t> 
    		</section>
    	<section title="Cookie support">
    		<t>Cookie support is inconsistent across mobile devices. An acr can help identify a returning mobile user to a Website, 
    			and hence facilitate the provisioning of a personalized service based on previous preferences and activity.</t>
    		</section>
    	<section title="Sharing identity">
    		<t>Mobile, broadband and other access networks do not typically share a user identifier. 
    			The acr is not bound to a particular access network and can hence be used to provision user identifiers between networks.</t>
    		</section>
    	<section title="Relation to SIP">
    		<t>The ACR can help the implementation of SIP privacy considerations, as detailed in 
    			<xref target="RFC3323">RFC3323</xref>,
    			 &#8216;A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol&#8217;. 
    			 Specifically the ACR can be used as the value for the &#8216;anonymous from&#8217; header field [section 4.1], 
    			 and is consistent with the recommendation to remove Subject, Call-info, Organization, User Agent, 
    			 Reply-To, In-Reply-To in [section 5.3].</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document includes a request to IANA.</t>

      <t>The editors of this draft request the protocol scheme name "acr" to be reserved for this RFC.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Since the "acr" is used to protect the identity of a user or a device the
      	forwarding party must not disclose information that would or can be used to reveal the
      	identity of the user. However the network code or domain name will reveal some information
      	of the the "acr" affiliation.</t>

      <t>The security considerations parallel those for the tel URI
   <xref target="RFC3966">RFC3966</xref>.</t>

   <t>Web clients and similar tools MUST NOT use the "acr" URI to place
   telephone calls or send messages without the explicit consent of the user of that
   client.  Placing calls or sending messages automatically without appropriate user
   confirmation may incur a number of risks, such as those described
   below:</t>

   <t><list style="symbols">
     <t>Calls or messages may incur costs.</t>
     <t>The URI may be used to place malicious or annoying calls.</t>
     <t>A call will take the user's phone line off-hook, thus preventing
        its use.</t>
     <t>A call may reveal the user's possibly unlisted phone number to the
        remote host in the caller identification data and may allow the
        attacker to correlate the user's phone number with other
        information, such as an e-mail or IP address.</t>
   </list></t>



   <t>This is particularly important for "acr" URIs embedded in HTML links,
   as a malicious party may hide the true nature of the URI in the link
   text, as in</t>

   <t>"acr" URIs may reveal private information, similar to including phone
   numbers as text.  However, the presence of the acr: schema identifier
   may make it easier for an adversary using a search engine to discover
   these numbers, and hence search engines should avoid indexing these identifiers.

<abstract>
<t>
   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters
   for identifying an abstract or physical resource.  This document
   defines the generic syntax of URI, including both absolute and
   relative forms, and guidelines for their use; it revises and replaces
   the generic definitions in RFC 1738 and RFC 1808.
</t>
<t>
   This document defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URI,
   such that an implementation can parse the common components of a URI
   reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
   possible identifier type.  This document does not define a generative
   grammar for URI; that task will be performed by the individual
   specifications of each URI scheme.
</t></abstract>
<note title='IESG Note'>
<t>
   This paper describes a "superset" of operations that can be applied
   to URI.  It consists of both a grammar and a description of basic
   functionality for URI.  To understand what is a valid URI, both the
   grammar and the associated description have to be studied.  Some of
   the functionality described is not applicable to all URI schemes, and
   some operations are only possible when certain media types are
   retrieved using the URI, regardless of the scheme used.
