      <t>The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) <xref
      target="RFC6179"></xref> is a new internetworking architecture based on
      encapsulation of inner network layer packets within outer network layer
      headers using a non-broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface
      model. IRON suggests a third-party global deployment of servers and
      relays to achieve a Provider-Independent (PI) routing and addressing
      framework, but there may be instances in which an Internet Service
      Provider (ISP) wishes to manage its own Provider-Managed IRON
      deployment.</t>

      <t>By managing its own IRON deployment, an ISP can ensure optimal
      placement of servers and relays so that clients receive a high quality
      of service with minimal routing path stretch. The ISP can further
      delegate native IP prefixes to clients even if they are located behind
      one or several layers of NATs, and even if they move between different
      network points of attachment. Since most ISPs service limited regional
      areas, however, routing stretch may become significant for mobile users
      that travel far from their homes (e.g., to a different continent). This
      situation is no different than that for corporate travelers who
      establish Virtual Private Network (VPN) links to their home enterprise
      networks when they travel abroad, and can be mitigated by ISP placement
      of minimal support infrastructure outside of their primary coverage
      region.</t>

      <t>This document presents a Provider-Managed IRON framework, and shows
      that it can offer ISPs a fast path alternative for deployment of a long
      term solution.</t>

    <section anchor="iron" title="IRON Conceptual Model">
      <t>IRON is descended from the RANGER architecture <xref
      target="RFC5720"></xref><xref target="RFC6139"></xref>; it uses Virtual
      Enterprise Traversal (VET) <xref
      target="I-D.templin-intarea-vet"></xref> and the Subnetwork
      Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) <xref
      target="I-D.templin-intarea-seal"></xref> as its functional building
      blocks. IRON uses the VET NBMA virtual interface model for coordination
      between neighboring routers on a virtual overlay network. It also uses
      SEAL as an IP-in-IP encapsulation sublayer, and uses the SEAL Control
      Message Protocol (SCMP) for signaling between tunnel endpoints. In
      particular, IRON clients use SEAL and SCMP to establish bidirectional
      tunnels with IRON servers and to inform the servers of any outer network
      layer address changes. IRON clients can also establish unidirectional
      tunnels to servers that are closer to the final destination based on
      route optimization signaling.</t>

      <t>IRON clients connect End User Networks (EUNs) which are assigned EUN
      prefixes (EPs) taken from highly-aggregated IP prefixes known as Virtual
      Prefixes (VPs). IRON servers connect their clients to a virtual overlay
      network configured over an internetwork such as the global Internet.
      IRON relays in turn connect the virtual overlay network to the native
      (i.e., non-IRON) Internet. The IRON relays in the virtual overlay
      network belong to a single Autonomous System (AS) and use eBGP to
      advertise the VPs externally into the native Internet default-free
      routing system. IRON relays and servers further use an interior routing
      protocol such as iBGP to track the EPs assigned to clients.</t>

      <t>To provide better service to clients, sufficient numbers of IRON
      relays and servers should be uniformly distributed throughout the
      internetwork over which the virtual overlay network is configured. Since
      the number of IRON servers needed may be very large, each server is
      required only to keep track of its own set of clients and to convey its
      client constituency to each of the relays. The iBGP peerings between
      servers and relays is therefore arranged as a partial mesh in which
      servers report their client constituencies to each relay but not to
      other servers. In this arrangement, servers have partial topology
      information and relays have full topology information. Routing within
      the virtual overlay network may therefore direct the initial packets in
      a flow through a suboptimal path that involves extraneous relays and
      servers as intermediate hops, but redirect messages will quickly inform
      the client of a better route.</t>

        </figure>The flows of packets that can occur in this model
      include:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>From Host(A) in IRON EUN A to Host(B) in IRON EUN B (depicted in

          <t>From Host(C) in the Internet to Host(A) in IRON EUN A</t>
        </list>In case 1, the initial packets in the flow sourced from Host(A)
      are forwarded through EUN(A) to Client(A), which then forwards them via
      the bidirectional tunnel to Server (A). Server(A) then forwards the
      packets to a Relay, which returns redirect messages and tunnels the
      packets further to Server(B). Server(B) then forwards the packets via
      the bidirectional tunnel to Client(B), where they are forwarded across
      EUN(B) and delivered to Host B. Following the redirect messages,
      subsequent packets flow directly via a unidirectional tunnel from
      Client(A) to Server(B) with the Relay and Server(A) removed from the
      path.</t>

      <t>In case 2, packets sourced from Host(A) are forwarded through EUN(A)
      to Client(A), which forwards them via the bidirectional tunnel to
      Server(A). Server(A) then forwards them to a Relay, which in turn
      forwards them via normal Internet routing until they reach host C.</t>

      <t>In case 3, packets sourced from host C are forwarded through normal
      Internet routing until they reach a Relay that connects the
      Provider-Managed virtual overlay network to the rest of the Internet.
      The Relay then forwards the packets to Server(A), where they are
      forwarded through the bidirectional tunnel to Client(A) then delivered
      to Host(A).</t>

      <t>These fundamental communication flow archetypes apply to the case of
      IRON virtual overlay networks configured over the unbounded global
      Internet when a third party supplies EUNs with PI prefixes. However, the
      same archetypes apply when the virtual overlay network is configured
      over a more limited topology such as an ISP's service network where the
      IP prefixes assigned to EUNs are Provider-Managed. The following section
      discusses a Provider-Managed IRON model.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Provider-Managed IRON">
      <t>The generic IRON use case assumes that the internetwork over which
      IRON overlay networks will be configured is the Internet itself. In
      other words, the generic use case assumes a global deployment of relays
      and servers by a third-party agency that does not coordinate with any
      specific ISPs. In that case, the VPs/EPs served by the third party would
      be independent of any Provider-Managed prefix space, and hence would be
      PI. However, an ISP wishing to roll out a useful service for its
      customers could choose to establish an IRON deployment using its own
      service network as the internetwork over which the virtual overlay is
      configured. In that case, the VPs/EPs serviced by the ISP would be
      Provider-Managed and there would be no third-party agencies for
      customers to coordinate with. The ISP would also be in the best position
      to provide optimal or nearly-optimal placement of IRON relays and
      servers within its managed network.</t>

      <t>When an ISP deploys its own IRON virtual overlay system, it
      establishes relays at the border of the virtual overlay network that
      connect the overlay to the global Internet. These relays run eBGP on
      their Internet-facing interfaces, and advertise the VPs that have been
      delegated to the ISP. The ISP should only need to advertise a small
      number of VPs that would only very rarely need to be withdrawn and
      re-announced within the global routing system. The ISP also deploys
      servers close to its customer EUNs in sufficient numbers so that the
      customers receive a high quality of service. While the IRON architecture
      allows for the relay and server function to be deployed on the same
      physical platform, for reasons of scaling it is expected that they will
      often be deployed on separate platforms.</t>

      <t>In terms of scaling, in the limiting case in which all of the ISP's
      IRON routers provide both the relay and server function, the
      relay/servers would engage in a full mesh iBGP session the same as
      described in the Softwire Mesh Framework <xref target="RFC5565"></xref>.
      However, a full mesh framework would present a limiting factor for
      scaling in multiple dimensions.</t>

      <t>First, each relay/server would only be able to service a limited set
      of customer client EUNs, since each client requires that the server
      maintain bidirectional tunnel state and engage in periodic keepalive
      exchanges. Second, since an ISP wishing to support a large number of
      customer clients would need to deploy a large number of relay/servers,
      the number of iBGP peering sessions between them would grow with the
      square of the number of relay/servers. This scaling situation can be
      addressed through the use of route reflectors, but the route reflectors
      cannot convey reachability state from one relay/server to another.
      Moreover, there is no reason that each server needs to have full
      knowledge of all EPs assigned to all customer EUNs. Instead, it should
      only have to know about the EPs assigned to its own current set of
      client customers and maintain a default route pointing to the relay
      router anycast address.</t>

      <t>Hence, when the server and relay functions are deployed on separate
      platforms, the IRON system enables a "partial mesh" topology in which
      servers report only the EP-to-client relationships for all of their
      client customers and maintain default routes to relays. Relays in turn
      discover all EP-to-server relationships and thus have full topology
      knowledge of the EP distributions throughout the ISP network. Moreover,
      servers can be placed close to the customers to support optimal routes,
      and more servers can be added as the client load grows.</t>

      <t>As an example, assume that an ISP deploys a Provider-Managed IRON
      deployment using a single IPv6 ::/24 VP, from which it assigns IPv6
      ::/56 EPs to its client customers. The ISP can establish a reasonable
      number of relays (e.g., 100) at the virtual overlay network border with
      the Internet. The ISP could then uniformly distribute a sufficient
      number of servers (e.g., 2^16) located close to customers throughout its
      network, where each server would be sized to serve 2^16 customers. Such
      a deployment would enable service for all 2^32 ::/56 EPs taken from the
      single ::/24 VP while advertising only a single VP into the global
      routing system. Each of the 100 relays would need to maintain iBGP
      peering sessions with each of the 2^16 servers to discover all
      client-to-server mappings in the IRON system. Each of the 2^16 servers
      would only need to report their client constituency via the 100 iBGP
      peering sessions and would not need to discover the client
      constituencies of other servers since they only require the relay router
      anycast address as the default route.</t>

      <t>Since the servers would have only partial topology information (i.e.,
      they would only know about their own clients and about the relay anycast
      default route) packets originated by one of their clients A and destined
      to a client B that is serviced by a different server would need to be
      forwarded through a relay. Using the IRON secure redirection system,
      however, the relay would return a redirect message which the server
      would forward to the client customer. Thereafter, packets originating
      from client A and destined to client B would be forwarded directly to
      client B's server without involving either client A's server nor any
      relays. This technique is often known as route optimization, and is a
      fundamental requirement for any production-quality routing system.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Dealing with NATs">
      <t>In typical ISP deployments, customer EUNs are located behind Customer
      Premises Equipment (CPE) routers that perform a Network Address
      Translation (NAT) function internally. With the impending runout of IPv4
      addresses, ISPs are now also faced with a situation in which they may
      need to assign private-use IP addresses to the outward-facing interfaces
      of CPEs and perform a second level of NATing withing the ISP network.
      Hence, devices in customer EUNs will be located behind one or several
      layers of NATs which impart special requirements on tunneling
      technologies. In particular, tunneling technologies will need to be
      configured over the UDP protocol which can traverse NATs.</t>

      <t>In the 6a44 proposal <xref
      target="I-D.despres-softwire-6a44"></xref>, the authors present a novel
      method of supporting IPv6 clients in EUNs through stateless
      coordinations with servers in the ISP network. Each client in this model
      receives only a single address that is constructed based on the outer
      NAT address and port mapping values, however, and these values can
      change across NAT reboots and/or loss of state. Hence, it may not be
      practical for administrators to represent the 6a44 addresses in a static
      name resolution system such as the DNS and/or for communicating peers to
      rely on a stable address for session continuity.</t>

      <t>Using the Provider-Managed IRON approach and its constituent SEAL
      mechanism, however, a client device in the customer EUN can receive an
      EP from its service provider (e.g., an IPv6 ::/56) and then register
      this EP with a nearby server that it discovers through an anycast router
      solicitation. Once registered, the server distributes this new EP
      registration to all relays.</t>

      <t>This stateful registration establishes next hop information in the
      server which the client must refresh periodically by sending beacons
      which have the side effect of keeping state alive in any NATs on the
      path. Since NATs may lose state and create new mappings, however, the
      server does not rely on the IP address and port mapping information to
      identify the client. Instead it relies on the SEAL identification tags
      that were established when the client first registered with the server.
      In this arrangement, it does not matter if the address and port mappings
      change periodically as long as the client sends beacons frequently
      enough to keep the NAT state synchronized with the server state.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Dealing with Mobility">
      <t>When a client moves to a new network point of attachment, it simply
      sends a new anycast router solicitation message to register with a new
      server. Unlike the global IRON case, however, a client in a
      Provider-Managed IRON deployment can only discover a server in its home
      ISP even if it has moved far away from home. For example, if a customer
      from ISP A located in the United States takes their IRON client router
      to Beijing they can still continue to use their Provider-Managed EPs,
      but all traffic to and from the EPs would need to be routed through the
      relays and servers in the ISP A US-based network even if both
      correspondent hosts are located in Beijing. Although clearly not
      optimal, this situation is no different than for a corporate employee
      who takes their laptop to a distant country and uses a VPN to connect to
      their home office.</t>

      <t>However, if ISP A wishes to provide better mobility service to its
      customers, it can deploy additional relays and servers in the networks
      of other ISPs worldwide simply by leasing public IP addresses and
      establishing equipment in the foreign ISPs networks. In that case, the
      Provider-Managed IRON case begins to look identical to the
      Provider-Independent case, and mobile clients can achieve a high quality
      of service even if they have moved far away from their home network. It
      therefore becomes immaterial as to whether the customer would pay an ISP
      for their IRON services or pay some third party entity - the service
      they would receive would be equivalent and dependent only on the quality
      of the IRON deployment.</t>
