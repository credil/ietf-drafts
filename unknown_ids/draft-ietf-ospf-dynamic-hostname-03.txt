Abstract

   Currently, there does not exist a simple and dynamic mechanism for
   routers running OSPF to learn about symbolic hostnames just like for
   routers running IS-IS.  This document defines a new OSPF Router
   Information (RI) TLV which allows the OSPF routers to flood their
   hostname-to-Router ID mapping information across the OSPF network.
   This mechanism is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

Internet-Draft         Dynamic Hostnames for OSPF             April 2009


1.  Introduction

   OSPF uses a 32-bit Router ID to uniquely represent and identify a
   node in the network.  For management and operational reasons, network
   operators need to check the status of OSPF adjacencies, entries in
   the routing table and the content of the OSPF link state database.
   It is obvious that, when looking at diagnostic information, numerical
   representations of Router IDs (e.g., dotted-decimal or hexadecimal
   representations) are less clear to humans than symbolic names.

   One way to overcome this problem is to define a hostname-to-Router ID
   mapping table on a router.  This mapping can be used bidirectionally
   (e.g., to find symbolic names for Router IDs, and to find Router IDs
   for symbolic names) or unidirectionally (e.g., to find symbolic
   hostnames for Router IDs).  Thus every router has to maintain a table
   with mappings between router names and Router IDs.

   These tables need to contain all names and Router IDs of all routers
   in the network.  If these mapping tables are built by static
   definitions, it can become a manual and tedious process in
   operational networks currently; modifying these static mapping
   entries when additions, deletions or changes occur becomes a non-
   scalable process very prone to error.

   This document analyzes possible solutions to this problem (see
   Section 2) and provides a way to populate tables by defining a new
   OSPF Router Information TLV for OSPF, the Dynamic Hostname TLV (see
   Section 3).  This mechanism is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Possible solutions

   There are various approaches to providing a name-to-Router ID mapping
   service.

   One way to build this table of mappings is by static definitions.
   The problem with static definitions is that the network administrator
   needs to keep updating the mapping entries manually as the network
   changes; this approach does not scale as the network grows, since
   there needs to be an entry in the mapping table for each and every
   router in the network, on every router in the network.  Thus, this
   approach greatly suffers from maintainability and scalability

   considerations.

   Another approach is having a centralized location where the name-to-
   Router ID mapping can be kept.  DNS can be used for the same.  A
   disadvantage with this centralized solution is that its a single
   point of failure; and although enhanced availability of the central
   mapping service can be designed, it may not be able to resolve the
   hostname in the event of reachability or network problems.  Also, the
   response time can be an issue with the centralized solution, which
   can be particularly problematic in times of problem resolution.  If
   DNS is used as the centralized mapping table, a network operator may
   desire a different name mapping than the existing in the DNS, or new
   routers may not yet be in DNS.

   Additionally for OSPFv3, in native IPv6 deployments, the 32-bit
   Router ID value will not map to IPv4-addressed entities in the
   network, nor will it be DNS resolvable (see Section 4).

   The third solution that we have defined in this document is to make
   use of the protocol itself to carry the name-to-Router ID mapping in
   a TLV.  Routers that understand this TLV can use it to create the
   symbolic name-to-Router ID mapping and Routers who don't understand
   can simply ignore it.  This specification provides these semantics
   and mapping mechanisms for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, leveraging the OSPF
   Router Information (RI) LSA ([RFC4970]).


3.  Implementation

   This extension makes use of the Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA
   defined in [RFC4970] for both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, by defining a new
   OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV: The Dynamic Hostname TLV.

   The Dynamic Hostname TLV (see Section 3.1) is OPTIONAL.  Upon receipt
   of the TLV a router may decide to ignore this TLV, or to install the
   symbolic name and Router ID in its hostname mapping table.

3.1.  Dynamic Hostname TLV

   The format of Dynamic Hostname TLV is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Type     Dynamic Hostname TLV Type (TBD, see Section 6)

   Length   Total length of the hostname (value field) in octets, not
            including the optional padding.

   Value    Hostname, a string of 1 to 255 octets, padded to 4-octet
            alignment, encoded in the US-ASCII charset.

   Routers that do not recognize the Dynamic Hostname TLV Type, ignore
   the TLV (see [RFC4970]).

   The value field identifies the symbolic hostname of the router
   originating the LSA.  The string is not null-terminated.  The Router
   ID of this router is derived from the LSA header, in the Advertising
   Router field of the Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA.

   The Value field is encoded in 7-bit ASCII.  If a user-interface for
   configuring or displaying this field permits Unicode characters, that
   user-interface is responsible for applying the ToASCII and/or
   ToUnicode algorithm as described in [RFC3490] to achieve the correct
   format for transmission or display.

   The Dynamic Hostname TLV is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

3.1.1.  Flooding Scope

   The Dynamic Hostname TLV MAY be advertised within an area-local or AS
   scope Router Information (RI) LSA.  But the Dynamic Hostname TLV
   SHOULD NOT be advertised into an area in more than one RI LSA
   irrespective of the scope of the LSA.

   In other words, if a router originates a Dynamic Hostname TLV with an
   IGP domain (AS) flooding scope, it SHOULD NOT send area-scoped
   Dynamic Hostname TLV except into any attached Not-So-Stubby Area
   (NSSA) area(s).  Similarly, if a router originates area-scoped
   Dynamic Hostname TLV (other than NSSA area scoped), it SHOULD NOT
   send AS-scoped Dynamic Hostname TLV.  When the Dynamic Hostname TLV
   is advertised in more than one LSA (e.g., multiple area-scoped LSAs,
   or AS-scoped LSAs plus NSSA area-scope LSA(s)), the hostname SHOULD
   be the same.

   If a router is advertising any AS scope LSA (other than Dynamic TLV
   RI LSA) such router SHOULD advertise Dynamic TLV RI LSA in AS scope.
   Otherwise, it SHOULD advertise Dynamic TLV RI LSA in area scope.  For
   example, an AS boundary router (ASBR) SHOULD send an AS scope Dynamic
   Hostname TLV, whereas area boundary router (ABRs) and internal
   routers SHOULD send an area scope Dynamic Hostname TLV.

Internet-Draft         Dynamic Hostnames for OSPF             April 2009


   The flooding scope is controlled by the Opaque LSA type in OSPFv2 and
   by the S1 and S2 bits in OSPFv3.  For area scope, the Dynamic
   Hostname TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 Type 10 RI LSA or an
   OSPFv3 RI LSA with the S1 bit set and S2 bit clear.  If the flooding
   scope is the entire routing domain (AS scope), the Dynamic Hostname
   TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 Type 11 RI LSA or OSPFv3 RI LSA
   with the S1 bit clear and the S2 bit set.

3.1.2.  Multiple OSPF Instances

   When an OSPF Router Information (RI) LSA, including the Dynamic
   Hostname TLV, is advertised in multiple OSPF instances, the hostname
   SHOULD either be preserved, or include a common base element.  It may
   be useful for debugging or other purposes to assign separate
   instances different hostnames with a consistent set of suffixes or
   prefixes that can be associated with a specific instance.  In
   particular, when an instance is used for a discrete address family or
   non-routing information.


4.  IPv6 Considerations

   Both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 employ Router IDs with a common size of 32-
   bits.  In IPv4 the Router ID values were typically derived
   automatically from an IPv4 address configured on a loopback or
   physical interface defined on the local system, or explicitly defined
   within the OSPF process configuration.  With broader deployment of
   IPv6, it's quite likely that OSPF networks will exist that have no
   native IPv4 addressed interfaces.  As a result, a 32-bit OSPF Router
   ID will either need to be explicitly specified, or derived in some
   automatic manner that avoids collisions with other OSPF routers
   within the local routing domain.

   Because this 32-bit value will not map to IPv4-addressed entities in
   the network, nor will it be DNS resolvable, it is considered
   extremely desirable from an operational perspective that some
   mechanism exist to map OSPF Router IDs to more easily interpreted
   values, ideally, human-readable strings.  This specification enables
   a mapping functionality which eases operational burdens that may
   otherwise be introduced with native deployment of IPv6.


5.  Security Considerations

   Since the hostname-to-Router ID mapping relies on information
   provided by the routers themselves, a misconfigured or compromised
   router can inject false mapping information.  Thus, this information
   needs to be treated with suspicion when, for example, doing

   diagnostics about a suspected security incident.

   This document raises no other new security issues for OSPF.  Security
   considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in [RFC2328]
   and [RFC5340].  The use of authentication for the OSPF routing
   protocols is encouraged.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs" registry
   reachable at [IANA-RI].  An additional OSPF Router Information TLV
   Type is defined in Section 3.  It is required to be assigned by IANA
   from the Standards Action allocation range [RFC4970].
