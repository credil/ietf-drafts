INTERNET DRAFT                                              October 2009


1. Introduction

   RFC 2585 [RFC2585] defines the MIME content types for public key
   certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  This document
   specifies a MIME content type for use with attribute certificates as
   defined in RFC 3281 [RFC3281].

   Attribute certificates are ASN.1 encoded [X.680].  RFC 3281 [RFC3281]
   tells which portions of the attribute certificate must use the
   distinguished encoding rules (DER) [X.690] and which portions are
   permitted to use the basic encoding rules (BER) [X.690].  Since DER
   is a proper subset of BER, BER decoding all parts of a properly
   constructed attribute certificate will be successful.

2. IANA Considerations

   The content type for an attribute certificate is
   application/pkix-attr-cert.

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: pkix-attr-cert

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: None

      Encoding considerations: 8bit

      Security considerations:
        An attribute certificate provides authorization information.  An
        attribute certificate is most often used in conjunction with
        public key certificate [RFC5280], and the two certificates
        should use the same encoding of the distinguished name as
        described in the Security Considerations of this document.

      Interoperability considerations:
        The content type will be used with HTTP to fetch attribute
        certificates.  Other uses may emerge in the future.

      Published specification: RFC 3281

      Applications which use this media type:
        The content type is used with MIME-complaint transport to
        transfer an attribute certificate.  Attribute certificates
        convey authorization information, and they are most often used
        in conjunction with public key certificates [RFC5280].

3. Security Considerations

   Attribute certificate issuers must encode the holder entity name in
   exactly the same way as the public key certificate distinguished
   name.  If they are encoded differently, implementations may fail to
   recognize that the attribute certificate and public key certificate
   belong to the same entity.
