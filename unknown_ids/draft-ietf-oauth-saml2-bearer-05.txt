Internet-Draft        OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles             Aug 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
   [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] is an XML-based framework that allows
   identity and security information to be shared across security
   domains.  The SAML specification, while primarily targeted at
   providing cross domain Web browser single sign-on, was also designed
   to be modular and extensible to facilitate use in other contexts.

   The Assertion, an XML security token, is a fundamental construct of
   SAML that is often adopted for use in other protocols and
   specifications.  An Assertion is generally issued by an identity
   provider and consumed by a service provider who relies on its content
   to identify the Assertion's subject for security related purposes.

   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] provides a
   method for making authenticated HTTP requests to a resource using an
   access token.  Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an
   authorization server (AS) with the (sometimes implicit) approval of
   the resource owner.  In OAuth, an authorization grant is an abstract
   term used to describe intermediate credentials that represent the
   resource owner authorization.  An authorization grant is used by the
   client to obtain an access token.  Several authorization grant types
   are defined to support a wide range of client types and user
   experiences.  OAuth also allows for the definition of new extension
   grant types to support additional clients or to provide a bridge
   between OAuth and other trust frameworks.  Finally, OAuth allows the
   definition of additional authentication mechanisms to be used by
   clients when interacting with the authorization server.

   The OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile [I-D.ietf.oauth-assertions] is an
   abstract extension to OAuth 2.0 that provides a general framework for
   the use of assertions as client credentials and/or authorization
   grants with OAuth 2.0.  This specification profiles the OAuth 2.0
   Assertion Profile [I-D.ietf.oauth-assertions] to define an extension
   grant type that usues a SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion to request an OAuth
   2.0 access token as well as for use as client credentials.  The
   format and processing rules for the SAML Assertion defined in this
   specification are intentionally similar, though not identical, to
   those in the Web Browser SSO Profile defined in SAML Profiles
   [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os].  This specification is reusing, to the
   extent reasonable, concepts and patterns from that well-established
   Profile.

   This document defines how a SAML Assertion can be used to request an
   access token when a client wishes to utilize an existing trust
   relationship, expressed through the semantics of (and digital
   signature calculated over) the SAML Assertion, without a direct user

   approval step at the authorization server.  It also defines how a
   SAML Assertion can be used as a client authentication mechanism.  The
   use of an Assertion for client authentication is orthogonal and
   separable from using an Assertion as an authorization grant and can
   be used either in combination or in isolation.

   The process by which the client obtains the SAML Assertion, prior to
   exchanging it with the authorization server or using it for client
   authentication, is out of scope.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.


2.  HTTP Parameter Bindings for Transporting Assertions

   The OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile [I-D.ietf.oauth-assertions] defines
   generic HTTP parameters for transporting assertions during
   interactions with a token endpoint.  This section defines the values
   of those parameters for use with SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertions.

2.1.  Using SAML Assertions as Authorization Grants

   To use a SAML Bearer Assertion as an authorization grant, use the
   following paramter values and encodings.

   The value of "grant_type" parameter MUST be
   "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer"

   The value of the "assertion" parameter MUST contain a single SAML 2.0
   Assertion.  The SAML Assertion XML data MUST be encoded using
   base64url, where the encoding adheres to the definition in Section 5
   of RFC4648 [RFC4648] and where the padding bits are set to zero.  To
   avoid the need for subsequent encoding steps (by "application/
   x-www-form-urlencoded" [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], for example), the
   base64url encoded data SHOULD NOT be line wrapped and pad characters
   ("=") SHOULD NOT be included.

2.2.  Using SAML Assertions for Client Authentication

   To use a SAML Bearer Assertion for client authentication grant, use
   the following paramter values and encodings.

Internet-Draft        OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles             Aug 2011


   The value of "client_assertion_type" parameter MUST be
   "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:saml2-bearer"

   The value of the "client_assertion" parameter MUST contain a single
   SAML 2.0 Assertion.  The SAML Assertion XML data MUST be encoded
   using base64url, where the encoding adheres to the definition in
   Section 5 of RFC4648 [RFC4648] and where the padding bits are set to
   zero.  To avoid the need for subsequent encoding steps (by
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" [W3C.REC-html401-19991224], for
   example), the base64url encoded data SHOULD NOT be line wrapped and
   pad characters ("=") SHOULD NOT be included.


3.  Assertion Format and Processing Requirements

   In order to issue an access token response as described in The OAuth
   2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] or to rely on an
   assertion for client authentication, the authorization server MUST
   validate the Assertion according to the criteria below.  Application
   of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the
   authorization server.

   o  The Assertion's <Issuer> element MUST contain a unique identifier
      for the entity that issued the Assertion.

   o  The Assertion MUST contain an <AudienceRestriction> element with
      an <Audience> element containing a URI reference that identifies
      the authorization server, or the service provider SAML entity of
      its controlling domain, as an intended audience.  The token
      endpoint URL of the authorization server MAY be used as an
      acceptable value for an <Audience> element.  The authorization
      server MUST verify that it is an intended audience for the
      Assertion.

   o  The Assertion MUST contain a <Subject> element.  The subject MAY
      identify the resource owner for whom the access token is being
      requested.  For client authentication, the Subject MUST be the
      client_id of the OAuth client.  When using assertions as an
      authorization grant, the Subject SHOULD identify an authorized
      accessor for whom the access token is being requested (typically
      the resource owner, or an authorized delegate).  Additional
      information identifying the subject/principal of the transaction
      MAY be included in an <AttributeStatement>.

   o  The Assertion MUST have an expiry that limits the time window
      during which the it can be used.  The expiry can be expressed
      either as the NotOnOrAfter attribute of the <Conditions> element
      or as the NotOnOrAfter attribute of a suitable

Internet-Draft        OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles             Aug 2011


      <SubjectConfirmationData> element.

      If the Assertion has a NotOnOrAfter attribute on the <Conditions>
      element, the authorization server MUST verify that the
      NotOnOrAfter instant has not passed, subject to allowable clock
      skew between systems.  The authorization server SHOULD reject
      assertions with an expiry instant that is unreasonably far in the
      future.

      If the Assertion does not have a NotOnOrAfter attribute on the
      <Conditions> element, then the Assertion's <Subject> element MUST
      contain at least one <SubjectConfirmation> element that allows the
      authorization server to confirm it as a Bearer Assertion.
      Conditions for bearer subject confirmation are described below.

      *  The <SubjectConfirmation< MUST have a Method attribute with a
         value of "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer" and MUST
         contain a <SubjectConfirmationData> element.

      *  The <SubjectConfirmationData> element MUST have a Recipient
         attribute with a value indicating the token endpoint URL of the
         authorization server.  The authorization server MUST verify
         that the value of the Recipient attribute matches the token
         endpoint URL (or an acceptable alias) to which the Assertion
         was delivered.

      *  The <SubjectConfirmationData> element MUST have a NotOnOrAfter
         attribute that limits the window during which the Assertion can
         be confirmed.  The authorization server MUST verify that the
         NotOnOrAfter instant has not passed, subject to allowable clock
         skew between systems.  The authorization server MAY ensure that
         Bearer Assertions are not replayed, by maintaining the set of
         used ID values for the length of time for which the Assertion
         would be considered valid based on the NotOnOrAfter attribute
         in the <SubjectConfirmationData>.  The authorization server MAY
         reject assertions with a NotOnOrAfter instant that is
         unreasonably far in the future.

      *  The <SubjectConfirmationData> element MAY also contain an
         Address attribute limiting the client address from which the
         Assertion can be delivered.  Verification of the Address is at
         the discretion of the authorization server.

   o  If the Assertion issuer authenticated the subject, the Assertion
      SHOULD contain a single <AuthnStatement> representing that
      authentication event.

Internet-Draft        OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles             Aug 2011


   o  If the Assertion was issued with the intention that the presenter
      act autonomously on behalf of the subject, an <AuthnStatement>
      SHOULD NOT be included.  The presenter SHOULD be identified in the
      <NamseID> or similar element, the <SubjectConfirmation> element,
      or by other available means like [OASIS.saml-deleg-cs].

   o  Other statements, in particular <AttributeStatement> elements, MAY
      be included in the Assertion.

   o  The Assertion MUST be digitally signed by the issuer and the
      authorization server MUST verify the signature.

   o  Encrypted elements MAY appear in place of their plain text
      counterparts as defined in [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os].

   o  The authorization server MUST verify that the Assertion is valid
      in all other respects per [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os], such as (but
      not limited to) evaluating all content within the Conditions
      element including the NotOnOrAfter and NotBefore attributes,
      rejecting unknown condition types, etc.

3.1.  Authorization Grant Processing

   If present, the authorization server MUST also validate the client
   credentials.

   Authorization servers SHOULD issue access tokens with a limited
   lifetime and require clients to refresh them by requesting a new
   access token using the same assertion, if it is still valid, or with
   a new assertion.  The authorization server SHOULD NOT issue a refresh
   token.

   If the Assertion is not valid, or its subject confirmation
   requirements cannot be met, the authorization server MUST construct
   an error response as defined in [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  The value of
   the error parameter MUST be the "invalid_grant" error code.  The
   authorization server MAY include additional information regarding the
   reasons the Assertion was considered invalid using the
   error_description or error_uri parameters.

   For example:


   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error":"invalid_grant",
     "error_description":"Audience validation failed"
   }


3.2.  Client Authentication Processing

   If the client Assertion is not valid, or its subject confirmation
   requirements cannot be met, the authorization server MUST construct
   an error response as defined in [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  The value of
   the error parameter MUST be the "invalid_client" error code.  The
   authorization server MAY include additional information regarding the
   reasons the Assertion was considered invalid using the
   error_description or error_uri parameters.


4.  Authorization Grant Example (non-normative)

   Though non-normative, the following examples illustrate what a
   conforming Assertion and access token request would look like.

   o  Allow for subject confirmation data to be optional when Conditions
      contain audience and NotOnOrAfter

   o  Rework most of the spec to profile draft-ietf-oauth-assertions for
      both authn and authz including (but not limited to):

      *  remove requirement for issuer to be
         urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity

      *  change wording on Subject requirements

   o  using a MAY, explicitly say that the Audience can be token
      endpoint URL of the authorization server

   o  Change title to be more generic (allowing for client authn too)

   o  added client authentication to the abstract

   o  register and use urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer for
      grant type rather than http://oauth.net/grant_type/saml/2.0/bearer

   o  register urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:saml2-bearer

   o  remove scope paramter as it is defined in
      http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-assertions

   o  remove assertion param registration because it [should] be in
      http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-assertions

   o  fix typo(s) and update/add references

   draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-04

   o  Changed the grant_type URI from
      "http://oauth.net/grant_type/assertion/saml/2.0/bearer" to
      "http://oauth.net/grant_type/saml/2.0/bearer" - dropping the word
      assertion from the path.  Recent versions of draft-ietf-oauth-v2
      no longer refer to extension grants using the word assertion so
      this URI is more reflective of that.  It also more closely aligns
      with the grant type URI in draft-jones-oauth-jwt-bearer-00 which
      is "http://oauth.net/grant_type/jwt/1.0/bearer".

   o  Added "case sensitive" to scope definition to align with
      draft-ietf-oauth-v2-15/16.

   o  Updated to reference draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16

   draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-03

   o  Cleanup of some editorial issues.

   draft-ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer-02

   o  Added scope parameter with text copied from draft-ietf-oauth-v2-12
      (the reorg of draft-ietf-oauth-v2-12 made it so scope wasn't
      really inherited by this spec anymore)
