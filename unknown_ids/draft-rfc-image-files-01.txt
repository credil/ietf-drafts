Abstract

   Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII
   characters and a fixed-width font.  However, there is sometimes a
   need to supplement the ASCII text with graphics or picture images.
   The historic solution to this requirement, allowing secondary PDF and
   Postscript files, is seldom used because it is awkward for authors
   and publisher.  This memo sugests a more convenient scheme for
   attaching authoritative diagrams, illustrations, equations or other
   graphics to RFCs.

1.  Introduction

   Published documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text
   ASCII characters and a fixed-width font [RFC2223].  This simple
   convention has the advantage of a stable encoding for which a wide
   variety of tools are readily available for viewing, searching,
   editing, etc.

   Inclusion of diagrams, state machines, complex equations, and other
   graphics in RFC text has generally relied on the imaginative use of
   ASCII characters ("ASCII artwork".)  However, in a few cases over the
   years, ASCII artwork has been inadequate for images needed or desired
   in RFCs.  The old solution to this dilemma has been to allow three
   versions of an RFC: a primary ASCII version and secondary versions
   that are encoded using PDF and Postcript.  The PDF and Postscript
   versions are "complete", containing a copy of the text as well as the
   full images [RFC2223].  The textual content and layout of the PDF/PS
   version is required to match the base version as closely as possible.
   However, except in a few rare exception cases (see, e.g., [RFC1129])
   the ASCII text version is considered the official expression of the
   RFC, and it is always normative for standards track documents.  We
   will refer to this old approach as ".txt+.pdf+.ps" encoding.

   The three versions of an RFC using .txt+.pdf+.ps encoding are in
   separate files in the primary RFC repository
   (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/"), with suffixes ".txt", ".pdf", and
   ".ps".  The RFC Editor search engine returns links to all three
   versions when they are present in the repository.

   Unfortunately, the .txt+.pdf+.ps scheme has been awkward for both
   editor and author, and it is error-prone, so it has seldom been used
   (roughly 50 out of 5000+ RFCs).  The problem is that, in general,
   only the author has the tools to prepare the PDF and Postscript
   versions.  The RFC Editor edits (only) the primary text version, and
   then the author must incorporate all the resulting changes into the
   PDF/PS version while maintaining the "look" of the RFC to the extent
   possible.  There is no practical way for the RFC Editor to verify
   that this is done correctly, perhaps leading to editorial errors and
   usually lengthening publication time for these documents.

   This memo suggests a much better scheme for including figures,
   illustrations, and graphics to an RFC.  We hope that the method
   proposed here will solve the image problem for RFC publication, while
   preserving the convenience, stability, and searchability of ASCII
   base documents, although the .txt+.pdf+.ps approach would still be
   possible (and in any case, RFCs using the historic scheme will
   continue to exist in the RFC repository forever).

   mailing list.  For subscription information and archives, see

2.  A New Scheme for Images

   Under our scheme, an RFC may be either a single ASCII file as
   commonly used today, or a composite of two files: an ASCII-only "base
   file" containing the text of the RFC, and an "image file".  When
   present, the image file would be a PDF file that contained only
   images, captions, and title information.  Neither file of the
   composite would be complete without the other, and a reference to the
   RFC would be considered a reference to both files.  An RFC would then
   be a logical entity whose complete representation could require two
   files, base and image.

   The base file would be formatted exactly like current ASCII RFCs,
   with three minor exceptions described below.

   The intellectual property boilerplate in the base file ("Rights in
   Contributions BCP 78, RFC 4748 [RFC4748] ) would apply equally to the
   image file.  An image file would contain one or more items that will
   be known collectively as "figures", whether they are actually
   diagrams, pictures, tables, artwork, or other non-textual
   constructions.

   This scheme was inspired by the tradition in book publishing, where
   pictures, figures, or "plates" may be grouped together following the
   text ("end figures"), or even bound separately from the main body of
   the text.

   In principle, we could allow an image file to be encoded using both
   PDF and Postscript, since mechanical translation is possible in both
   directions.  However, in the 20 years since the adoption of the .txt+
   .pdf+.ps scheme, the PDF format has become a defacto standard for
   electronic documents, and readers for it are universally available.
   Furthermore, PDF has been standardized as a format for document
   archiving, as discussed further in the next section.  Therefore, we
   propose to allow only PDF for image files, simplifying the new
   approach by not including a Postscript file option.

   An ASCII RFC traditionally uses a file name in the form of
   "rfcN.txt", where N is integer RFC number without leading zeros.  The
   image file that is associated with RFC number N could be named
   "rfcN.img.pdf".  As noted earlier, the repository contains RFCs with
   file names "rfcN.ps" and "rfcN.pdf", using the historic .txt+.pdf+.ps
   scheme.

3.  Construction of the Image File

   An image file would be a single PDF file, consistent with the
   description in [RFC3778] and defined in [ISO32000-1].  The particular
   PDF form must be version-stable and must not contain any external
   references in scripts or otherwise.  Those requirements are satisfied
   by the PDF/A [ISO19005-1] profile.  The RFC Editor may authorize
   other variants of PDF in the future.

   There is an issue of whether particular generators of PDF that claim
   to satisfy PDF/A actually do so.  Future experience may require
   published guidelines on PDF-generating software that claims to
   satisfy PDF/A but does not.

   Except as otherwise specified in this document, an image file should
   contain only figures, supporting labels and captions, headers, and
   footers.  It should not contain explanatory text or other materials
   that could reasonably be expressed in plain-text form in the base
   file.  In particular, required sections of RFCs, such as
   considerations for IANA or references, must be completely
   understandable from base RFC text.  Any figures referenced from those
   sections must contain only supplemental material.

   Figures in the image file may be used to show groups of equations in
   highly formatted forms that are easier to understand than ASCII
   layouts.  However, since it is probable that documents will be
   searched for terms of equations, it is preferable (and the RFC Editor
   may require) that ASCII forms be present in the base RFC.

   Pages of the image file would be consecutively numbered.  The first
   page number of the image file would follow the last page number of
   the base RFC, exclusive of the number of the end-of-RFC boilerplate
   page.  The page number of the end-of-RFC boilerplate (in the base RFC
   file) would be the first page number after those in the image file.
   Each page of the image file would contain the same headers and
   footers as the base file, except for one change in the footer,
   suggested below.

   Figures included in the image file would have to be labeled in a
   fashion that facilitated referencing from the base RFC.  They should
   normally be numeric and monotonic.  Simple consecutive integer will
   usually be the best choice, but in some cases it might be desirable
   to use a hierarchical scheme like: <section #>.<fig #>.  An author
   who believes that another labeling scheme would increase clarity
   should check with the RFC Editor.

4.  Requirements for the Base File

4.1.  Overview

   A base file would be unchanged by the presence of an image file,
   except for the following.

   o  The page number of the end-of-RFC boilerplate page would be
      changed to be logically one page after the last image file page.

   o  A new unnumbered "Figures" section would be required.  This is
      described below.

   o  For a composite RFC, a minor modification to the first-page header
      of the base file and to the footers of both base and image files
      could tie the two files together.  This is described below.

4.2.  Figures Section

   An RFC that used this scheme (and had any figures) would need to
   include a Figures section in the ASCII base file.  The Figures
   section should immediately follow the Table of Contents, if any, and
   precede the body of the document.  The Figures section should list
   all figures in tabular form, indicating for each one the figure
   identification, title, and page number(s).

   The style for the Figures section has not yet been fully specified.
   Here is a suggested example.

___________________________________________________________________________

   An RFC that includes a base file may include ASCII artwork that is
   suggestive of a figure in the image file, but there is no requirement
   to do so.  When such an approximate figure appears as ASCII artwork
   in the base file, its figure identification and caption must match
   those of the corresponding figure in the image file, and the entry in
   the Figures table should specify the page numbers in both the base
   and image file, In the example shown above, image file page numbers
   are marked with an asterisk.  Note that very simple ASCII artwork
   need have corresponding material in the image file.

4.3.  Formatting Changes

   It would be necessary to tie the base and image files together, to
   make clear they are part of one RFC.  Here is an initial suggestion
   for formatting, which needs further consideration before it is
   adopted.

      The header line "Request for Comments: nnnn" in the base file
      could be changed to "Request for Comments: nnnn/Base".  For
      consistency, the lefthand footer could become "RFC nnnn/Base".
      The lefthand footer in the image file could then be: "RFC nnnn/
      Image.

      The following sentence could be placed in the "Status of this
      Memo" section: "This RFC is a composite of this base file and a
      PDF image file."


5.  Submission and Processing of the Image File

   If an image file is needed, it should be submitted as an .img.pdf
   file along with the ASCII text file.  The image file should be
   submitted without headers or footers.  The RFC Editor will overlay
   the image file with the appropriate headers and footers, with correct
   pagination.  The RFC Editor will not normally do any editing of the
   image file beyond this.  If editing the base file reveals problems
   with figures in the image file, the authors will be asked to create a
   new image file.


6.  Implementation Issues

   This scheme has a number of implications.

   1.  The Internet Draft repository must allow submission and retrieval
       of both base and (when present) image files.

   2.  Internet Draft file names could be draft-...-vv.txt and
       (optionally) draft-...-vv.img.pdf, where "vv" is the normal
       version number.  Updating either file of the composite RFC should
       increase the version numbers "vv" in both files.  We DO NOT want
       two separate version numbers for one I-D. vspace/>[[anchor10:
       Placeholder: it has been proposed that documents using this
       model, whether I-Ds, RFCs, or both, should be retrievable from
       the repository in a bundled format (e.g., a zip or tar file), in
       addition to the separate .txt and .img files.  The RFC Editor may
       require submissions to be unbundled, in which case they would do
       the bundling upon publication.  This option needs further
       discussion.  It would clearly change the discussion about naming
       conventions.]]

   3.  The RFC Editor would need to be able to overlay headers, footers,
       and page numbers on a given image file.  It is claimed that at
       least Adobe Acrobat Professional includes this capability, and
       that it also has limited editing capability.

   4.  The RFC Editor would also need a tool to verify that a given
       image file satisfies the constraints of PDF/A or the ability to
       generate combined files (the original image and the overlaid
       headers and footers) in which they had confidence.

Internet-Draft               Images in RFCs               September 2008


   5.  Some RFC Editor scripts and tools would need small extensions.

   6.  Some small extensions to xml2rfc [RFC2629] to include image files
       would be useful.  It should generate the boilerplate with a non-
       sequential page number.  For example, an attribute on <back>
       might specify the number of pages of image file.  One could
       presumably add a mechanism to generate the Figures section.


7.  RFC Repository File Formats

   A frequent reaction to the suggestion given in this memo is some
   confusion over the different file formats that appear in the RFC
   repository.  Here is a brief summary.

   If a PDF image file exists along with a base ASCII RFC, then RFCs in
   any other format (e.g., complete PDF files, HTML, or Postscript)
   remain supplemental, with the reader taking responsibility for
   assuring that they are equivalent to the base RFC and image file.
   That arrangement is identical to the relationship between traditional
   all-ASCII RFCs and supplemental forms: the RFC Editor has never taken
   responsibility for guaranteeing that the two are identical in
   content.

   The existing .txt.pdf files are not affected by this proposal.  The
   .txt.pdf files are facsimiles of .txt (base files) in PDF, introduced
   to help Windows users read RFCs online.  However, Microsoft has more
   recently provided an elementary ASCII editor, which probably makes
   the .txt.pdf files unnecessary in any case.

   In summary:

   o  .txt: ASCII-only file.  In old scheme, complete normative file.
      In new scheme, text part of normative composite RFC, or stand-
      alone normative text file.

   o  .ps: Old scheme -- a Postscript file that includes figures and
      whose text is intended to be the same as the normative .txt file.

   o  .pdf: Old scheme -- a PDF file that includes figures and whose
      text is intended to be the same as the normative .txt file.

   o  .img.pdf: New scheme: image file part of a composite with .txt
      file.

   o  .txt.pdf: Old scheme: Facsimile of corresponding .txt file.

   We note that it would be possible to combine the base and image files

Internet-Draft               Images in RFCs               September 2008


   into a single PDF file, which would have to follow a naming
   convention to distinguish it from the .pdf case listed above.
   However, we regard this an an undesirable step away from the
   principle of universal ASCII encoding of the text of the document.


8.  Internationalization Considerations

   Our scheme of image files does not, and is not intended to, support
   character set internationalization for RFCs.  It does not allow an
   author to omit the ASCII text from the base file and instead include
   the entire RFC text as one (very large) image file.

   However, we should note, by example, two special cases.

   1.  RFC 3743 [RFC3743] on internationalized domain names for Chinese,
       Japanese,, and Korean contains a number of examples that may be
       hard to follow because they can represent those characters only
       in "U+nnnn" form.  An image file could be used that would show
       the alternative Chinese characters for the examples.  This would
       not diminish either the ability to search the base text or index
       the document or its readability for those of us for whom reading
       Chinese characters is difficult, but it should help those who can
       read them.

   2.  Suppose that a proposed RFC contained a section derived from
       Japanese text.  The author might put an English translation into
       that section of the base document, note that the original was
       really in Japanese, and attach the Japanese as an appendix in an
       image file.  This should raise no difficulties for informative
       documents.  For normative documents, however, the existence of
       the Japanese original would raise some issues about what was
       actually authoritative, which is very undesirable.


9.  Approval and Authorization

   [[anchor14: Placeholder: In its capacity as the body that approves
   the general policy followed by the RFC Editor (see), the IAB will
   eventually need to review and sign off on this proposal.]][RFC2850]


10.  Security Considerations

   This specifications addresses documentation standards and adding
   additional flexibility to them.  It does not, in general, raise any
   security issues.  However, unless the specifications of this document
   are carefully followed, the image format recommended, PDF, may

Internet-Draft               Images in RFCs               September 2008


   potentially contain external references or scripts that could
   introduce security problems.  The RFC Editor and other publishers
   should exercise due care to ensure that no such references or scripts
   appear in the archives.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions by the IANA.  An intentional
   consequence of the model is that IANA will not need to inspect the
   image file in order to carry out its task of evaluating proposed RFCs
   for potential actions.


12.  Acknowledgments

   The impetus for this specification arose during a discussion during
   an RFC Editorial Board meeting in the aftermath of one of the IETF's
   seeming-interminable discussions about allowing RFC's in "modern"
   formats.  Aaron Falk made several specific suggestions that have been
   reflected in the document.  The RFC Editor staff and other Editorial
   Board members contributed suggestions without which this version
   would not have been possible as did Steve Bellovin, Olaf Kolkman, and
   Henrik Levkowetz.
