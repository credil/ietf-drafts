     TO DO  
           
          . Do we need the pmIndex persistence?  
             Agreement among us: should be optional, like for ifIndex.  
             Option: the implementation might indicate it. Persistent or 
             not might be in shown in a OID, using the StorageType ::= 
             TEXTUAL-CONVENTION. One OID that explains the persistence 
             of all objects, not more granularity. This must also be 
             covered in the architecture draft. 
              
          . ACTION: change the pmPowerLevel to pmRequestedPowerLevel, 
             and pmPowerActualLevel to pmPowerLevel? The 3 drafts need 
             to be changed. DMTF uses "requestedLevel" 
           
          . "Power Monitor Child" Feedback received: it's the object to 
             be monitored, not the monitoring device. Power 
             Monitoring/Monitored Child?  
           
          . If [POWER-MON-ARCH] covers the notion of transition state, 
             we must be covering this topic in this MIB module.    
      
              
         
     1. Introduction 

        This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
        Base (MIB) for use in energy management of devices within or 
        connected to communication networks.  The MIB modules in this 
        document are designed to provide a model for energy management, 
        which includes monitoring for power state and energy consumption 
        of networked elements.  This MIB takes into account the Power 
        Management Architecture [POWER-MON-ARCH], which in turn, is 
        based on the Power Monitoring Requirements [POWER-MON-REQ] . 
      
        Energy management is applicable to devices in communication 
        networks.  Target devices for this specification include (but 
        are not limited to): routers, switches, Power over Ethernet 
        (PoE) endpoints, protocol gateways for building management 
        systems, intelligent meters, home energy gateways, hosts and 
        servers, sensor proxies, etc.   
         
        Where applicable, device monitoring extends to the individual 
        components of the device and to any attached dependent devices. 
        For example: A device can contain components that are 
        independent from a power-state point of view, such as line 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011            [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Oct 2010 
      
        cards, processor cards, hard drives. A device can also have 
        dependent attached devices, such as a switch with PoE endpoints 
        or a power distribution unit with attached endpoints. 
         
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power-related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB, even though the ENTITY MIB compliance is not a 
        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  The requirements in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ] cover devices typically found in communications 
        networks, such as switches, routers, and various connected 
        endpoints.  For a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it  
        should also apply to facility meters, power distribution units, 
        gateway proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.  Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this 
        document is broader than that specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  
        Several scenarios that cover these broader use cases are 
        presented later in Section 6 - Implementation Scenarios. 
         
     4. Terminology 

        The definitions of basic terms like Power Monitor, Power Monitor 
        Parent, Power Monitor Child, Power Monitor Meter Domain, Power 
        Level, and Manufacturer Power Level can be found in the Power 
        Management Architecture [POWER-MON-ARCH].

     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section describes the concepts specified in the Power 
        Monitor Architecture [POWER-MON-ARCH] that pertain to power 
        usage, with specific information related to the MIB module 
        specified in this document. This subsection maps to the section 
        "Architecture High Level Concepts" in the Power Monitoring 
        Architecture [POWER-MON-ARCH]. 
         
         
       5.1 Power Monitor Information    

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Information" section in [POWER-MON-
        ARCH] for background information.  An energy aware device is 
        considered an instance of a power monitor as defined in the 
        [POWER-MON-ARCH]. 
         
        The Power Monitor information is specified in the MIB module 
        primary table, i.e. the pmTable.  Every Power Monitor SHOULD 
        have a printable name pmName, and MUST HAVE a unique Power 
        Monitor index pmIndex, as specified in [POWER-AWARE-MIB]. 
      
      
       5.2 Power Monitor Levels 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Levels" section in [POWER-MON-ARCH] 
        for background information. 
         
        Power Levels, which represent universal states of power 
        management of a Power Monitor, are specified by the pmPowerLevel 
        MIB object. 
         
        Via the pmManufacturerActualPowerLevel MIB variable, the 
        Manufacturer Power Levels might be read, in case the Power 
        Levels specified in this document are not (yet) supported.  The 
        Manufacturer Power Level name can be read with the 
        pmManufacturerActualPowerLevel Name MIB variable.   
         
        When a Power Monitor requires a mapping with the Manufacturer 
        Power Level, the Power Monitor configuration is done via the 
        Power Level settings, and not directly via the Manufacturer 
        Power Levels, which are read-only. The actual Power Level is 
        specified by the pmPowerActualLevel MIB object, while the 
        pmPowerLevel MIB object specifies the Power Level requested for 
        the Power Monitor.  A difference in values between the 
        pmPowerLevel and pmPowerActualLevel indicates that the Power 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011            [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Oct 2010 
      
        Monitor is busy going into the pmPowerLevel, at which point it 
        will update the content of pmPowerActualLevel. 
         
        The MIB objects pmPowerLevel and pmManufacturerDefinedPowerLevel 
        are contained in the pmTable MIB table. 
              
        The pmPowerLevelTable table enumerates the maximum power usage 
        in watts, for every single supported Power Level of each Power 
        Monitor. 
         
        The pmPowerLevelMappingTable table enumerates the maximum power 
        usage in watts, for every single Manufacturer Power Level.  
        Furthermore, this table maps the Manufacturer Power Levels to 
        the Power Levels specified in this document (more specifically 
        with the PowerMonitorLevel textual convention).  Finally, this 
        table returns the name of each Manufacturer Power Level.  
         
         
       5.3 Power Monitor Usage Measurement 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Usage Measurement" section in 
        [POWER-MON-ARCH] for background information. 
         
        For a Power Monitor, power usage is reported using pmPower.  The 
        magnitude of measurement is based on the pmPowerUnitMultiplier 
        MIB variable, based on the UnitMultiplier Textual Convention 
        (TC).  
                    
        For example, if current power usage of a Power Monitor is 3, it 
        could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value of 
        pmPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout 
        the two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, 
        including pmPowerLevelPowerUnitMultiplier, 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and 
        pmACPwrQualityPowerUnitMultiplier. 
                                         
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful to 
        know how a pmPower measurement was obtained.  An NMS can use 
        this to account for the accuracy and nature of the reading 
        between different implementations.  For this pmPowerOrigin 
        describes whether the measurements were made at the device 
        itself or from a remote source.  The pmPowerMeasurementCaliber 
        describes the method that was used to measure the power and can 
        distinguish actual or estimated values.  
         
        The nameplate power rating of a Power Monitor is specified in 
        pmPowerNameplate MIB object.

       5.4 Optional Power Usage Quality 

        Refer to the "Optional Power Usage Quality" section in [POWER-
        MON-ARCH] for background information. 
         
        The optional powerQualityMIB MIB module can be implemented to 
        further describe power usage quality measurement.  The 
        powerQualityMIB MIB module adheres closely to the IEC 61850 7-2 
        standard to describe AC measurements.   
         
        The powerQualityMIB MIB module contains a primary table, the 
        pmACPwrQualityTable table, that defines power quality 
        measurements for supported pmIndex entities, as a sparse 
        extension of the pmTable (with pmIndex as primary index).  This 
        pmACPwrQualityTable table contains such information as the 
        configuration (single phase, DEL 3 phases, WYE 3 phases), 
        voltage, frequency, power accuracy, total active/reactive 
        power/apparent power, amperage, and voltage.  
         
        In case of 3-phase power, the pmACPwrQualityPhaseTable 
        additional table is populated with power quality measurements 
        per phase (so double indexed by the pmIndex and pmPhaseIndex).  
        This table, which describes attributes common to both WYE and 
        DEL configurations, contains the average current, 
        active/reactive/apparent power, power factor, and impedance. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a DEL configuration, the 
        pmACPwrQualityDelPhaseTable table describes the phase-to-phase 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a Wye configuration, the 
        pmACPwrQualityWyePhaseTable table describes the phase-to-neutral 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
      
      
       5.5 Optional Energy Measurement 

        Refer to the "Optional Energy Measurement" section in [POWER-
        MON-ARCH] for background information. 
         
        It is relevant to measure the demand only when there are actual 
        power measurements from a Power Monitor, and not when the power 
        measurement is assumed or predicted as specified in the 
        description clause of the object pmPowerMeasurementCaliber.    
         
        Two tables are introduced to characterize the energy demand: 
        pmDemandEnergyTable and pmDemandEnergyParametersTable.  The 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011            [Page 8] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Oct 2010 
      
        pmDemandEnergyParametersTable table consists of parameters 
        defining the duration of the demand intervals in seconds, 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength), the number of demand 
        intervals kept in the pmDemandEnergyTable, 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber), the type of demand 
        intervals (pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode), and a sample 
        rate used to calculate the average 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate).  Judicious choice of the 
        SamplingRate will ensure accurate measurement of power while not 
        imposing an excessive polling burden. 
                   
        There are three pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode types used 
        for energy measurement collection: period, sliding, and total. 
        Note that multiple pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode types 
        MAY be configured simultaneously.   
         
        These three pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode types are 
        illustrated by the following three figures, for which: 
         
        - The horizontal axis represents the current time, with the 
        symbol <--- L ---> expressing the 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength, and the 
        pmDemandEnergyIntervalStartTime is represented by S1, S2, S3,

        A pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode type of 'total' specifies 
        a continuous measurement since the last reset.  The value of 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber should be (1) one and 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength is ignored. 
      
        The pmDemandEnergyParametersStatus is useful to specify that the 
        energy measurement is actual and thus to indicate if the 
        pmDemandEnergyTable entries exist or not. 
         
        The pmDemand Table consists of energy measurements in 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUsed, the scale of energy measured, 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and the maximum observed 
        demand in a window - pmDemandIntervalMax. 
         
        The following example illustrates the pmDemandEnergyTable and 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersTable: 
         
        First, in order to estimate demand, an interval to sample energy 
        should be specified, i.e.  
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength can be "900 seconds" and 
        the number of consecutive intervals over which the maximum 
        demand is calculated (pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber) as 
        "10".  The sampling rate internal to the Power Monitor for 
        measurement of power usage (pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate) 
        can be "1000 milliseconds", as set by the Power Monitor as a 
        reasonable value.  Then, the pmDemandEnergyParametersStatus is 
        set to active (value 1) to indicate that the Power Monitor 
        should start monitoring the usage per the pmDemandEnergyTable. 
         
        The indices in the pmDemandEnergyTable are pmIndex, which 
        identifies the Power Monitor, and pmDemandIntervalStartTime, 
        which denotes the start time of the demand measurement interval 
        based on sysUpTime.  The value of pmDemandIntervalEnergyUsed is 
        the measured energy consumption over the time interval specified 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Power 
        Monitor internal sampling rate 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate).  While choosing the values 
        for the pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength and 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate, it is recommended to take 
        into consideration either the network element resources adequate 
        to process and store the sample values, and the mechanism used 
        to calculate the pmDemandEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed.  The units 
        are derived from pmDemandIntervalPowerUnitMultiplier.  For 
        example, pmDemandIntervalPowerUsed can be "100" with 
        pmDemandIntervalPowerUnits equal to 0, the demand is 100 watt-
        hours.  The pmDemandIntervalMax is the maximum demand observed 
        and can be "150 watt-hours".

        The pmDemandEnergyTable has a buffer to retain a certain number 
        of intervals, as defined by 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.  If the default value of 
        "10" is kept, then the pmDemandEnergyTable contains 10 demand 
        measurements, including the maximum.   
         
        Here is a brief explanation of how the maximum demand can be 
        calculated.  The first observed demand measurement value is 
        taken to be the initial maximum.  With each subsequent 
        measurement, based on numerical comparison, maximum demand may 
        be updated.  The maximum value is retained as long as the 
        measurements are taking place.  Based on periodic polling of 
        this table, an NMS could compute the maximum over a longer 
        period, i.e. a month, 3 months, or a year. 
         
         
       5.6 Optional Battery Information 

        EDITOR NOTE: Since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
        POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG/EMAN IETF 
        WG wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
        [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].   
         

     6. Implementation Scenarios 

        The scope of power and energy monitoring consists of devices 
        that consume power within and that are connected to a 
        communications network.  These devices include: 
         
        - Network devices and sub-components: Devices such as routers 
        and switches and their sub-components. 
         
        - Network attached endpoints: Devices that use the 
        communications network, such as endpoints, PCs, and facility 
        gateways that proxy energy monitor and control for commercial 
        buildings or home automation.  
         
        - Network attached meters or supplies: Devices that can monitor 
        the electrical supply, such as smart meters or Universal Power 
        Supplies (UPS) that meter and provide availability. 
          
        This section provides illustrative examples that model different 
        scenarios for implementation of the Power Monitor, including 
        Power Monitor Parent and Power Monitor Child relationships.

     Scenario 1: Switch with PoE Endpoints  

        Consider a PoE IP phone connected to a switch, as displayed in 
        Figure 4.  The IP phone consumes power from the PoE switch.  The 
        switch has the following attributes, also illustrated in Figure 
        4: pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity "2", and pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 
        1000".  The power usage of the switch is "440 Watts".  The 
        switch does not have a Power Monitor Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes: The switch 
        port has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power metered at the POE 
        switch port is "12 watts".  Note that the PoE switch port 
        doesn't consume any power, it meters the usage.  When summing 
        power usage for the Power Monitor Meter Domain, the PoE switch 
        port meter usage should be kept separate from actual Power 
        Monitor Children usage.   
         
        In this example, the POE switch port has the switch as the Power 
        Monitor Parent, with its pmParentID of "1000". 
         
        The IP phone has the following attributes: the IP phone has 
        pmIndex "31" and pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 2003", but does not have 
        an entry for pmPhysicalEntity, as the ENTITY MIB is not 
        supported on this device.  The IP phone has a Power Monitor 
        Parent: the switch whose pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000".  The 
        power usage of the IP phone is metered at the POE switch port 
        and the pmPower on the PoE IP phone reports 12.

     Scenario 2: Switch with PoE Endpoints with Further Connected 
        Devices  

        Consider the same scenario as example 1 with an IP phone 
        connected to PoE port of a switch.  Now, in addition, a PC is 
        daisy-chained from the IP phone for LAN connectivity.  The phone 
        draws power from the PoE port of the switch, while the PC draws 
        power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The attributes of the switch, switch port and IP phone are the 
        same as in Scenario 1.  The attributes of the PC are given 
        below.  The PC does not have pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmIndex of 
        the PC is "57", the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3003".  The PC has 
        a Power Monitor Parent, i.e. the switch whose pmPowerMonitorId 
        is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the PC is "120 Watts" and is 
        communicated to the switch port.  
         
        This example illustrates the important distinction between the 
        Power Monitor Children: The IP phone draws power from the 
        switch, while the PC has LAN connectivity from the phone, but is 
        powered from the wall outlet.  However, the Power Monitor Parent 
        sends power control messages to both the Power Monitor Children 
        (IP phone and PC) and the Children react to those messages.

     Scenario 3: Switch with Wireless Access Points 

        Consider a Wireless Access Point connected to the PoE port of a 
        switch.  There are several PCs connected to the Wireless Access 
        Point over Wireless protocols.  All PCs draw power from the wall 
        outlets.

        The switch port is the Power Monitor Parent for the Wireless 
        Access Point (WAP) and the PCs.  There is a distinction between 
        the Power Monitor Children, as the WAP draws power from the PoE 
        port of the switch and the PCs draw power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The switch has pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity is "2" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the switch 
        is "440 Watts".  The switch does not have a Power Monitor 
        Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes: The switch 
        port has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power usage of the POE 
        switch port is "20 watts".  The POE switch port has the switch 
        as the parent and the pmParentID is "UUID 1000".  
         
        The WAP has the following attributes:  The WAP has no entry for 
        pmPhysicalEntity, pmIndex "47", and pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 
        2004".  The WAP has a parent: the switch whose pmPowerMonitorId 
        is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the WAP is measured at the 
        PoE switch port.  
         
        Neither of the two PCs - PC1 and PC2 - has pmPhysicalEntity. 
         
        The pmIndex of PC1 is "53" and the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3". 
        PC1 has a parent: the switch whose pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        1000".  The power usage of PC1 is "120 Watts" and is 
        communicated to the switch port.  
         
        The pmIndex of PC2 is "58" and the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 5".   
        PC2 has a parent: the switch whose pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        1000".  The power usage of the PC is "120 Watts" and is 
        communicated to the switch port.

        A simplified illustration of the building gateway network is 
        presented in Figure 7.  At the top of the network hierarchy of a 
        building network is a gateway device that can perform protocol 
        conversion between many facility management devices. The south 
        building gateway communicates to the controllers, via RS-232/RS-
        485 interfaces, ethernet interfaces, and building management 
        protocols such as BACNET or MODBUS.  Each controller is 
        associated with a specific energy-consuming function, such as 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011           [Page 18] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Oct 2010 
      
        HVAC, electrical or lighting.  The controllers are in turn 
        connected to the actual building energy management devices: 
        meters, sub-meters, valves, actuators, etc.  Controller 1 is 
        associated with a meter for the HVAC system and controller 2 can 
        be associated with a meter for the Lighting.   
         
        Assuming that the MIB is implemented on the gateway device, the 
        building gateway can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent, 
        and the controllers associated with the meters can be considered 
        as Power Monitor Children. Tthe power measurement collected is 
        therfore at the granularity of a controller, which aggregates 
        all the energy measurement collected from all the meters and 
        sub-meters.  However, if energy measurement needs to be 
        collected at a meter level, then the MIB should be implemented 
        at the controller level.  
      
        In building management, the EntPhysicalIndex usually is not 
        defined for these Power Monitor Parents or Children, as the 
        ENTITY MIB is generally not implemented for these devices.  
        Hence the gateway, controller 1, and controller 2 all have 
        pmPhysicalEntities of value zero.   
         
        The pmIndex of the gateway is "7", and the pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 1000".  The gateway does not have a Power Monitor Parent. 
        The total power usage of the gateway and its children is "2000 
        Watts".  
         
        Controller 1 has pmIndex "707", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        5007". Controller 1 will report a power usage of "2000 watts".  
        Controller 1 has the gateway as the parent and its pmParentID is 
        "UUID 1000".  
         
        Controller 2 has pmIndex "708", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        5008". Controller 2 will report a power usage of "500 watts".  
        Controller 2 has the gateway as the Power Monitor Parent and its 
        pmParentID is "UUID 1007".

     Scenario 5: Data Center Network 

        A typical data center network consists of a hierarchy of 
        switches.  At the bottom of the hierarchy are servers mounted on 
        a rack, and these are connected to the top-of-the-rack switches.  
        The top switches are connected to aggregation switches that are 
        in turn connected to core switches.  As an example, Server 1 and 
        Server 2 are connected to different switch ports of the top 
        switch, as shown in Figure 9.  
         
        The proposed MIB can be implemented on the switches.  The switch 
        can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent.  The servers can 
        be considered as the Power Monitor Children.  
         
        The switch has pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity is "2", and the 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the switch 
        is "440 Watts". The switch does not have a parent. 
         
        The switch ports are non-PoE and have the following attributes: 
        Server 1 is connected to Switch port 1.  Switch port 1 has 
        pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12", and pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 1003".  Switch port 2 has pmIndex "4", pmPhysicalEntity is

        "13", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1004".  The power usage of 
        the non-POE switch port cannot be measured.  The switch ports 
        have the switch as the Power Monitor Parent and its pmParentID 
        is "1000".  
         
         
        Server 1 has a value of zero for pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmIndex 
        of Server 1 is "5", and the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 2006".  
        Server 1 has a Power Monitor Parent: The switch whose 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "1000".  The power usage of Server 1 is "200 
        Watts" and is communicated to the switch port.  
         
        Server 2 has a value of zero for pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmIndex 
        of Server 2 is "6", and the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3006".  
        Server 1 has a parent: The switch whose pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "1000".  The power usage of the Server 2 is "140 Watts" and is 
        communicated to the switch port.  
         
        Communication of power usage of Server1 and Server2 to the 
        switch is out of scope of this document.

                      Figure 9: Scenario 5 

     Scenario 6: Switch with Power Distribution Units (PDU) 

        Consider Scenario 1 again, this time with two PDUs.  The switch 
        draws power from one of the PDUs, while the PDUs are plugged 
        into the switch for LAN connectivity.  
         
        The attributes of the switch and switch ports are the same as 
        in Scenario 1.  The attributes of the PDUs are given in Figure 
        11.   
         
        The PDUs are network peers of the switch, with their own 
        management agent and no pmPowerMonitor parent pmPowerMonitorId, 
        as the PDUs are Power Monitor Parents themselves.  The power 
        usage of the PDUs are reporting 3000 watts and 12000 watts 
        categorized as 'Meter'. 
         
        This example illustrates the distinction between power supply, 
        metering, and LAN connectivity.  The PDUs supply and meter 
        power to the switch, while the PC has LAN connectivity from the 
        phone, but is powered from the wall outlet.  However, the Power 
        Monitor Parent sends power control messages to both the Power 
        Monitor Children (IP phone and PC) and the children react to 
        those messages.

     Scenario 7: Power Consumption of UPS 

        Data centers and commercial buildings can have Uninterruptible 
        Power Supplies (UPS) connected to the network. The Power Monitor 
        can be used to model a UPS as a Power Monitor Parent with the 
        connected devices as Power Monitor Children. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: the example will be completed in the future. 
         
     Scenario 8: Power Consumption of Battery-Based Devices 

        As specified in [POWER-MON-REQ], battery-state monitoring is a 
        requirement for the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  
        EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
        POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
        wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
        [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB]. 
         
         
     7. Link with the other IETF MIBs 

                     
     7.1. Link with the ENTITY MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB  

        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the ENTITY MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch, etc.) 
        and those physical entities indexed by entPhysicalIndex.  From 
        an energy-management standpoint, the physical entities that 
        consume or produce energy are of interest. 
         
        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
        provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
        value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
        data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
        devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
        entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus 
        of the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB is on measurement of 
        power usage of networking equipment indexed by the ENTITY MIB, 
        this MIB proposes a customized power scale for power measurement 
        and different power level states of networking equipment, and 
        functionality to configure the power level states. 
         
        When this MIB module is used to monitor the power usage of 
        devices like routers and switches, the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-
        SENSOR MIB SHOULD be implemented.  In such cases, the Power 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011           [Page 24] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Oct 2010 
      
        Monitors are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through the 
        pmPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the pmTable.   

        However, the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] does not have the ANSI 
        C12.x accuracy classes required for electricity (i.e., 1%, 2%, 
        0.5% accuracy classes). Indeed, entPhySensorPrecision [RFC3433] 
        represents "The number of decimal places of precision in fixed-
        point sensor values returned by the associated entPhySensorValue 
        object".  The ANSI and IEC Standards are used for power 
        measurement and these standards require that we use an accuracy 
        class, not the scientific-number precision model specified in 
        RFC3433.  The pmPowerAccuracy MIB object models this accuracy.  
        Note that pmPowerUnitMultipler represents the scale factor per 
        IEC 61850, which is a more logical representation for power 
        measurements (compared to entPhySensorScale), with the mantissa 
        and the exponent values X * 10 ^ Y. 

        Power measurements specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each 
        measured value in watts are used in the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, POE 
        [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.  The same 'UNITS' qualifier 
        is used for the power measurement values.    
         
        One cannot assume that the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB are 
        implemented for all Power Monitors that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmPhysicalEntity value 
        contains the zero value, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero textual 
        convention. 
         
        The pmIndex MIB object has been kept as the unique Power Monitor 
        index.   The pmPower is similar to entPhySensorValue [RFC3433] 
        and the pmPowerUnitMultipler is similar to entPhySensorScale. 
      
         
     7.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE MIB  

        For each entity in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133], the ENTITY-STATE 
        MIB [RFC4268] specifies the operational states (entStateOper: 
        unknown, enabled, disabled, testing), the alarm (entStateAlarm: 
        unknown, underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning, 
        indeterminate) and the possible values of standby states  
        (entStateStandby: unknown, hotStandby, coldStandby, 
        providingService). 
         
        From a power monitoring point of view, in contrast to the entity 
        operational states of entities, Power Levels are required, as 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011           [Page 25]

        proposed in the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB module.  Those 
        Power Levels can be mapped to the different operational states 
        in the ENTITY-STATE MIB, if a formal mapping is required.  For 
        example, the entStateStandby "unknown", "hotStandby", 
        "coldStandby", states could map to the Power Level "unknown", 
        "ready", "standby", respectively, while the entStateStandby 
        "providingService" could map to any "low" to "high" Power Level. 
         
         
     7.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB 

        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] provides an energy monitoring 
        and configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  
        The RFC introduces a concept of a port group on a switch to 
        define power monitoring and management policy and does not use 
        the entPhysicalIndex as the index.  Indeed, the  
        pethMainPseConsumptionPower is indexed by the 
        pethMainPseGroupIndex, which has no mapping with the 
        entPhysicalIndex.  
         
        One cannot assume that the Power-over-Ethernet MIB is 
        implemented for all Power Monitors that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol like BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmethPortIndex and 
        pmethPortGrpIndex values contain the zero value, thanks to new 
        PethPsePortIndexOrZero and textual PethPsePortGroupIndexOrZero 
        conventions. 
      
        However, if the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, 
        the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex contain 
        the pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively. 
         
        As a consequence, the pmIndex MIB object has been kept as the 
        unique Power Monitor index. 
         
        Note that, even though the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] was 
        created after the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433], it does not reuse 
        the precision notion from the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB, i.e. the 
        entPhySensorPrecision MIB object. 
         
          
     7.4. Link with the UPS MIB 

        To protect against unexpected power disruption, data centers and 
        buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).  To 
        protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular

        subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically lasts only 
        for a finite period of time, until normal power supply is 
        restored.  Planning is required to decide on the capacity of the 
        UPS based on output power and duration of probable power outage.  
        To properly provision UPS power in a data center or building, it 
        is important to first understand the total demand required to 
        support all the entities in the site.  This demand can be 
        assessed and monitored via the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  

        UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS 
        network.  Implementation of the UPS MIB is useful at the 
        aggregate level of a data center or a building.  The MIB module 
        contains several groups of variables: 

         - upsIdent: Identifies the UPS entity (name, model, etc.).  

        - upsBattery group: Indicates the battery state 
        (upsbatteryStatus, upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining, etc.) 

        - upsInput group: Characterizes the input load to the UPS 
        (number of input lines, voltage, current, etc.). 

        - upsOutput: Characterizes the output from the UPS (number of 
        output lines, voltage, current, etc.) 

        - upsAlarms: Indicates the various alarm events.   

        The measurement of power in the UPS MIB is in Volts,  Amps and 
        Watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts and RMS 
        Amps. They are not based on EntitySensorDataScale and 
        EntitySensorDataPrecision of Entity-Sensor MIB. 

        Both the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB and the UPS MIB may be 
        implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without conflict.  In 
        this case, the UPS device itself is the Power Monitor Parent and 
        any of the UPS meters or submeters are the Power Monitor 
        Children. 
         
         
     7.5. Link with the LLDP and LLDP-MED MIBs 

        The LLDP Protocol is a Data Link Layer protocol used by network 
        devices to advertise their identities, capabilities, and 
        interconnections on a LAN network.  
         
        The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as 
        LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice 
        applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: capability

        discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy 
        discovery, location identification discovery, inventory 
        discovery, and power discovery.   
         
        Of particular interest to the current MIB module is the power 
        discovery, which allows the endpoint device (such as a PoE 
        phone) to convey power requirements to the switch.  In power 
        discovery, LLDP-MED has four Type Length Values (TLVs): power 
        type, power source, power priority and power value.  
        Respectively, those TLVs provide information related to the type 
        of power (power sourcing entity versus powered device), how the 
        device is powered (from the line, from a backup source, from 
        external power source, etc.), the power priority (how important 
        is it that this device has power?), and how much power the 
        device needs. 
          
        The power priority specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB] 
        actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]. If 
        the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the exact 
        value from the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over 
        in the lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB]; otherwise 
        the value in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is "unknown". From 
        the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, it is possible to identify 
        the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621], thanks to the 
        pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex. 
         
        The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to 
        pmPowerOrigin in indicating if the power for an attached device 
        is local or from a remote device. If the LLDP-MED MIB is 
        supported, the following mapping can be applied to the 
        pmPowerOrigin: lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource fromPSE(2) and 
        local(3) can be mapped to remote(2) and self(1), respectively. 
      
      
     8. Structure of the MIB 

       The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
       PowerMonitorMIBObject.  The pmTable table of 
       PowerMonitorMibObject describes an entity in the network that is 
       a Power Monitor. 
         
       A Power Monitor contains information describing itself as an 
       entity in the context of the network (such as its Power Monitor 
       Meter Domain pmDomainName) and attributes for describing its 
       business context (such as pmImportance, pmRoleDescription and 
       pmKeywords).  
        

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011           [Page 28] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Oct 2010 
      
       A Power Monitor contains information describing its power usage 
       (pmPower) and its power state (pmPowerLevel).  Along with the 
       power usage is information describing how the power usage was 
       determined (such as pmPowerMeasurementCaliber and 
       pmPowerOrigin). 
        
       The pmPowerLevelMappingTable table enumerates the maximum power 
       usage in watts for every Manufacturer Power Level.  This table 
       also maps the Manufacturer Power Levels to the Power Levels 
       specified in this document (more specifically, to the 
       PowerMonitorLevel textual convention).  Finally, this table 
       returns the name of each Manufacturer Power Level.  
        
       A Power Monitor may contain an optional pmPowerQuality table 
       that describes the electrical characteristics associated with 
       the current power state and usage. 
        
       A Power Monitor may contain an optional pmDemandEnergyTable to 
       describe energy information over time. 
        
       A Power Monitor may also contain optional battery information 
       associated with this entity.  
        
       EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
       POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
       wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
       [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].

            DESCRIPTION 
        "An enumerated integer value that represents the value of the 
        power policy level, a current power setting at which a Power 
        Monitor uses power. 
                 
        There are twelve power policy levels, divided into six  
        operational states, and six non-operational states.  The lowest 
        non-operational state is 1 and the highest is six.  Each non-
        operational state corresponds to an ACPI level [ACPI] 
        corresponding to Global and System levels between G3 (hard-off) 
        and G1 (sleeping).  For operational levels, 6 is the lowest, and 
        12 the highest (full power).  Each operational level represent a 
        performance state, and may be mapped to ACPI states P0 (maximum 
        performance & power) through P5 (minimum performance and minimum 
        power).   
                 
        An entity may have fewer power levels than twelve and would then 
        map several policy levels to the same power state.  Entities 
        with more than twelve levels, would choose which twelve to 
        represent as power policy levels. 
                 
        Note that Power Monitor Parents MUST report some of the non-
        operational Power Levels of their Power Monitor Children who are 
        unable to report their Power Level.  For example: A phone may 
        notify its Power Monitor Parent that it will go into a 
        mechoff(1) or hibernate(3) state so that the Power Monitor 
        Parent can report the phone's current state (such as zero or 1 
        watt).  Conversely, a PC with Desktop and mobile Architecture 
        for System Hardware [DASH] out-of-band management is an example 
        where a Power Monitor Child can report its usage and level even 
        when in a non-operational state. 
                 
        In each of the non-operational levels (from mechoff(1) to 
        ready(6)), the Power Level preceding it is expected to have a 
        lower power consumption and a longer delay in returning to an 
        operational state:

                               No energy is being consumed and the power

                               trace power so that the entity  
                               can be awakened from its off state.  In  
                               softoff(2), no context is saved and the  
                               device typically requires a complete boot  
                               when awakened.  This corresponds to ACPI  
                               level G2. 
         
                 hibernate(3): No entity features are available.  The 
                               entity may be awakened without requiring  
                               a complete boot, but the time for  
                               availability is longer than sleep(4). An  
                               example for state hibernate(3) is a save- 
                               to-disk state where DRAM context is not  
                               maintained. Typically, energy consumption  
                               is zero or close to zero.  This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S4 in ACPI. 
         
                 sleep(4)    : No entity features are available, except  
                               for out-of-band management, for example   
                               wake-up mechanisms. The time for  
                               availability is longer than standby(5).  
                               An example for state sleep(4) is a save- 
                               to-RAM state, where DRAM context is  
                               maintained.  Typically, energy  
                               consumption is close to zero. This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S3 in ACPI. 
         
                 standby(5) : No entity features are available, except  
                              for out-of-band management, for example  
                              wake-up mechanisms. This mode is analogous   
                              to cold-standy.  The time for availability  
                              is longer than ready(6).  For example, the  
                              processor context is not maintained.  
                              Typically, energy consumption is close to  
                              zero. This corresponds to level G1, S2 in

     10. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmPowerLevel MAY disrupt the 
             power settings of the different Power Monitors, and 
             therefore the level of functionality of the respective 
             Power Monitors. 
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDemandControlTable MAY 
             disrupt energy measurement in the pmDemandEnergyTable 
             table.  
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires April 16, 2011           [Page 65] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Oct 2010 
      
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         

     11. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
               ----------            ----------------------- 
               PowerMonitorMIB         { mib-2 xxx } 
         
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.   
         
         

     12. Acknowledgment 

        The authors would like to thank Shamita Pisal for her prototype 
        of this MIB module, and her valuable feedback.  The authors 
        would like to Michael Brown for improving the text dramatically.
