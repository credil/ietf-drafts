    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Designing routing in low power devices and lossy link networks
      imposes great challenges, mainly due to low data rates, high probability
      of packet delivery failure, and strict energy constraint in nodes. The
      IETF ROLL Working Group has specified the Routing Protocol for Low power
      and Lossy Networks (RPL) in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      <t>RPL is designed to meet the core requirements specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs"></xref>,<xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"></xref>,<xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"> </xref> and <xref
      target="RFC5548"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document’s contribution is to provide several routing
      performance metrics of RPL using a decrete event simulator in various
      real-life deployment scenarios. Each result has been checked against
      several real-life deployed networks. Several routing metrics are
      evaluated in this document:</t>

          <t>Path quality metrics;</t>

          <t>Control plane overhead;</t>

          <t>Ability to cope with unstable situations (link churns, node
          dying);</t>

          <t>Required resource constraints on nodes (routing table size,
          etc.).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Feedback from the ROLL Working Group are welcome to add new
      evaluation metrics of potential interest in further revisions of this
      document.</t>

      <t>Although simulation cannot prove formally that a protocol operates
      properly in all situations, it could give a good level of confidence in
      protocol behavior in highly stressful conditions, if and only if real
      life data are used. Simulation is particularly useful especially when
      theoretical model assumptions may not be applicable to such networks and
      scenarios. Therefore, real deployed network data traces have been used
      to model link behaviors.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Method">
      <t>RPL was simulated using OMNET++ <xref target="OMNETpp"></xref>, a
      well-known discrete event based simulator written in C++ and NED.
      Castalia-2.2 <xref target="Castalia-2.2"></xref> has been used as
      Wireless Sensor Network Simulator framework within OMNET++. The output
      and events in the simulating are visualized with the help of the Network
      AniMator or NAM, which is distributed with NS (Network Simulator)<xref
      target="NS-2">.</xref></t>

      <t>Note that NS or any of its versions were not used in this simulation
      study. Only the visualization tool was borrowed for verification
      purposes. As noted, real link layer data gathered from networks deployed
      on the field were used to compute the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) for
      each of the links in the network. By contrast with theoretical models
      (e.g. Markov Chains) which may have assumptions not applicable to lossy
      links, real-life data has been used for two aspects of the
      simulations:</t>

      <t>* Link failure model: Time varying real network traces containing
      packet delivery probability for each link and over all channels for both
      indoor network deployment and outdoor network deployment were used.
      Thus, different types of link characteristics are used in the study.</t>

      <t>* Topology: The topologies are gathered from real-life deployment
      (traces mentioned above) as opposed to random topology simulations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Simulation Setup ">
      <t>A 45 node topology, shown in Figure 1, gathered from a real
      deployment, was used in the simulations.</t>

      <figure>
        <preamble></preamble>

        <artwork>Figure 1</artwork>

        <postamble>Figure 1: Network topology for preliminary simulation
        results.</postamble>
      </figure>

      <t></t>

      <t>Note that this is just a start to validate the simulation before
      using large scale networks.</t>

      <t>A database of time varying link quality data, gathered from real
      network deployment, was created. Each link in the topology randomly
      'picks up' a link model from the database, and the link’s PDR varies
      according to the gathered data. Packets are dropped randomly from that
      link with probability (1 - PDR). Each link has a PDR that varies with
      time (in the simulation, the new PDR is read from the database every 10
      minutes). Each time a packet arrives at the Radio of a node, the module
      generates a random number by the Mersenne Twister Random number
      generation method. The random number is compared to the PDR to determine
      whether the packet should be dropped or not. Note that each link use a
      different random number generator to maintain true randomness in the
      simulator, and to avoid correlation between links. Also, the packet drop
      applies to all kinds of data and control packets (RPL) such as the DIO,
      DAO, DIS packets defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In simulating RPL, the LBR first initiates sending out DIO messages,
      and the DAG is gradually constructed. The trickle time interval for
      emitting DIO message assumes the initial value of 1 second, and then
      changes over simulation time as mentioned in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      <t>I_min is initially set to 1 second and I_doubling is equal to 16, so
      that maximum time between two consecutive DIO emissions by a node (under
      a steady network condition) is 18.2 hours. Another objective of this
      study is to give insight to the network administrator on how to tweak
      the trickle values. These recommendations could then be used in
      applicability statement documents. Further revision of this document
      will include simulations for large scale networks with varied parameters
      and show how quickly the network will stabilize, comparing data/control
      traffic and studying the tradeoff between reactivity and lifetime.</t>

      <t>Each node in the network, other than the LBR, also emits DAO messages
      as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>, to initially
      populate the routing tables with the prefixes received from children via
      the DAO messages in support of the Point to Point (P2P) and Point to
      Multipoint traffic (P2MP) in the "down" direction. In this revision of
      the document, it is assumed that each node is capable of storing route
      information for other nodes in the network. In futher revision of this
      document nodes without storage capability will be added to the network
      to see the influence of extra states on the nodes and the additional
      control plane overhead to propagate the route records thanks to Reverse
      Route Stacks in the DAO messages.</t>

      <t>For nodes implementing RPL, the routing table memory requirement
      varies according to the position in the DAG. The worst-case assumption
      that there is no route summarization in the network is made. Thus a node
      closer to the DAG will have to store more routing entries. Further
      revision of this document will explore the influence of performing route
      summarization along the DAG, which could be performed thanks to a newly
      defined Objective Function or new address provisioning techniques. It is
      also assumed that all nodes have equal memory capacity to store the
      routing states, therefore no source routing is required.</t>

      <t>Each node sends traffic according to a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) to all
      other nodes in the network over the simulation period. To simulate a
      more realistic scenario, 20% of the generated packets by each node are
      destined to the root, and the remaining 80% of the packets are
      uniformily assigned as destined to nodes other than the root. Therefore
      the root receives a considerably larger amount of data than other nodes.
      These values may be revised when studying the P2P traffic so as to have
      a majority of traffic going to all nodes as opposed to the root.</t>

      <t>The packets are routed through the DAG built by RPL according to the
      mechanisms specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Since RPL is an IP routing protocol, no assumption is made on the
      link layer, thus potential gains in terms of header compression provided
      by 6loWPAN is not under consideration <xref
      target="draft-iphc"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A number of RPL parameters are configured (such as Packet Rate from
      each source, Time Period of the LBR emitting new DAG sequence number) to
      observe their effect on RPL performance metric of interest.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Metrics to evaluate RPL">
      <section title="Common Assumptions">
        <t>Routing Table Size: as the DAO messages help to feed the routing
        tables in the network, routing table size for each node are recorded.
        Currently, the routing table size is not in terms of Kbyte of memory
        usage but measured in terms of number of entries for each node. Each
        entry has next hop node and path cost associated with the destination
        node. In further revision a single full 128-bit address per leaf plus
        a few bits to store other information and flags will be used.</t>

        <t>The ETX (Expected Transmission Count) metric is used to build the
        DAG as specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref>. Further revisions of
        this document will include other metrics and constraints such as the
        Hop count.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Path Quality">
        <t>Number of Hops: For each pair of source and destination, the
        average number of hops for both RPL and shortest path routing is
        computed. Shortest path routing refers to an hypothetical ideal
        routing protocol that would always provide the shortest path in term
        of Total ETX (or whichever metric is used) in the network. The
        Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of hop distance for all paths
        (which is equal to n*(n-1) in an n node network) in the network with
        respect to number of hops is plotted in Figure 2 for both RPL and
        shortest path routing. One can observe that the CDF corresponding to 4
        hops is around 80% for RPL and 90% for shortest path routing. This
        means, for the given topology, 90% of paths will have path length of 4
        hops or less with an ideal shortest path routing methodology, whereas
        in RPL Point-to-Point (P2P) routing, 90% of paths will have a length
        shorter or equal to 5 hops. This result shows that despite having a
        non optimized P2P routing scheme, the path quality of RPL is not much
        worse than an optimized one for the topology in consideration. Another
        reason may be, the sink is at the center of the network, so routing
        through the sink is often close to an optimal (shortest path) routing.
        This result may be different in a topology where the sink is located
        at one end of the network.</t>

          <postamble>Figure 2: CDF: hop distance versus number of
          hops.</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>Total ETX: When optimizing ETX metric along the path is used as an
        objective function, the total ETX along the path is computed for each
        pair. Figure 3 shows the CDF of the total number of ETX to deliver a
        packet from a source to any destination node with respect to total ETX
        of the path from each source to each destination for the network, for
        both RPL, and a shortest path mechanism. Here also one observes that
        total ETX along the path from all source to all destination is close
        to that of a shortest path for the network in our simulation.</t>

          value.</postamble>

      </section>

      <section title="Routing Table Size">
        <t>The objective of this metric is to observe the distribution of the
        the number of entries per node. Figure 4 shows the CDF of required
        number of routing table entries for all nodes. One can see, that 90%
        of the nodes need to store less than 10 entries in their routing
        cache.</t>

          number of nodes.</postamble>

      </section>

      <section title="Control Packet Overhead">
        <t>The control plane overhead is an important routing metric in Low
        power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Indeed, it is imperative to bound the
        control plane overhead. One of the distinctive charateristics of RPL
        is that it makes use of trickle timers so as to reduce the number of
        control plane packets by eliminating redundant messages. The aim of
        this metric is thus to analyse the control plane overhead in stable
        condition (no network element failure overhead) and in the presence of
        failures.</t>

        <t>Data and control plane traffic comparison for each node: Figure 5
        shows the comparison of the amount of data packets transmitted
        (including forwarded) and control packets (DIO and DAO messages)
        transmitted for each node when minimizing ETX is used by the OCP along
        the DAG. Here one can observe that considerable amount of traffic is
        routed through the sink itself. And also the fact that the amount of
        control traffic is really negligible in the protocol is reinforced. As
        expected, the nodes closer to sink and that act as forwarders have
        much more data packet transmission than other nodes. The leaf nodes
        have comparable amount of data and control packet transmission, as
        they do not take part in routing the data.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork>Figure 5</artwork>

          <postamble>Figure 5: Amount of data and control packets transmitted
          for each node when minimizing ETX is used OCP along the
          DAG.</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>Data and Control Packet Transmission with respect to time: In
        Figures 6, 7 and 8, the amount of data and control packets transmitted
        for node 12 (high rank in DAG), node 43 (in the middle) and node 31
        (leaf node)are shown, respectively. These values stand for number of
        packets transmitted for each 10 minutes intervals, to help understand
        what is the density of data and control packet exchange in the
        network. One can observe as the node is closer to the sink, the amount
        of data is larger, and the amount of control traffic is negligible in
        comparison to the data traffic. Also, the variation in data traffic is
        much larger for a node closer to sink, because the destination of the
        packets varies over time, and 20% of the packets are destined to sink
        only. For the nodes that are further away from sink , the variation in
        data traffic becomes lesser, and the amount of data traffic is also
        smaller.</t>

        <t>The control traffic for the nodes has a wave-like pattern. The
        amount of control packets for each node drops quickly as the DAG
        stabilizes due to the effect of trickle timer. However, as a new DAG
        Sequence is advertised, the trickles are reset and the nodes start
        emiting DIO frequently again to stabilize the DAG. One can see, for a
        node closer to sink, the data packet amount is much higher than
        control packet, and somewhat oscillatory around a mean value. The
        control packet amount exhibits a 'saw-tooth' behavior, mainly because
        as ETX was used, and as when PDR changes, ETX for a child node to its
        parent changes, which results in changing DAG depth of the child. This
        event resets the trickle timer and emit RA-DIO. Also, issue of a new
        DAG Sequence number triggers DAG recomputation and resets the trickle
        timers. Therefore, one can observe that the number of control packets
        attains a high value for one interval, and the amount comes down to
        lower values for subsequent intervals. Also, for leaf nodes the amount
        of control packets are more than data packets, as leaf nodes are more
        prone to face changes in their DAG depth as opposed to nodes closer to
        sink when the link PDR in the topology changes dynamically.</t>

      <section title="Loss of connectivity">
        <t>Upon link failures, a node may loose both his parents (preferred
        and backup) and its sibling (if any). In this case, if a packet has to
        be sent and the routing table does not contain an entry for the
        corresponding destination the packet is dropped. RPL proposes two
        mechanims for DAG repairs, known as global repair and local repair. In
        this version of the document, simulation results are presented to
        evaluate the amount of time packets are lost because of loss of
        connectivity. The idea is to tune the frequency at which new
        DAGSequenceNumbers are generated by the DAG root that are used for
        global repair. It is expected that a higher frequency will lead to
        shorter duration of connectivity loss at a price of a higher rate of
        control packet in the network.</t>

        <t>Figure 9 shows the CDF of time spent by any node without any
        service, when the packet rate from the sources is a packet each 10
        seconds, and new DAG sequence number is issued every 10 minutes. This
        plot reflects the property of RPL without any Local Repair scheme.
        When all the parents (and siblings) are temporarily unreachable from a
        node, the time before it hears a DIO from another node is recorded,
        which gives the time without service. In some cases, this value might
        go up to the DAG Repair Timer value, because untill a DIO is heard,
        the link outage is not solved.</t>

        <t>The effect of the DAG Repair Timer on time without service is
        plotted in Figure 10, where the source rate is 20seconds/packet and in
        Figure 11, where the source sends a packet every 10 seconds. In the
        next revision, Local Repair scheme will be implemented along with RPL
        to compare the service outage time with Global Repair scheme.</t>

        <t>Figure 12 shows effect of DAG Global repair timer period on control
        traffic. As the period to emit new DAG sequence increases, the amount
        of control traffic also decreases because the trickle interval gets
        larger for each node, which is pretty intuitive. However this smaller
        amount of control traffic comes at a price of increased time for loss
        of connectivity.</t>
