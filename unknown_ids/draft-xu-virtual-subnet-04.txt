1. Problem Statement 

   With the popularity of cloud services, the scale of today's data 
   centers expands larger and larger. In addition, virtual machine 
   migration technology, which allows a virtual machine to be able to 
   migrate to any physical server while keeping the same IP address, is 
   becoming more and more prevalent for achieving service agility in 
   data centers. As a result, large Layer 2 networks are needed for 
   server-to-server connectivity. Meanwhile, due to the huge-volume 
   traffic exchanged between servers, the Layer 2 networks SHOULD 
   provide enough capacity for server-to-server interconnections. 

   Unfortunately, today's data center network using the Spanning-Tree 
   Protocol (STP) bridge technology, can not address the above 
   challenges facing today's large-scale data centers in several ways. 
   First, STP can calculate out only one single forwarding tree for all 
   connected servers of a particular Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 
   and it can not support multi-path routing, e.g., Equal Cost Multi-
   Path (ECMP), hence the available network capacity in data center 
   networks can't be highly utilized so as to provide enough bandwidth 
   between servers; Second, since the bridge forwarding is based on the 
   flat MAC addresses, the scalability of the bridge forwarding table 
   would become a big issue, especially when the existing large Layer 2 
   network scales even larger; Third, broadcast storm impacts imposed 
   by some protocols, e.g., Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and the 
   flooding of unknown destination unicast frames become much more 
   serious and unpredictable in the continually growing large-scale STP 
   bridge networks.  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4364], [MVPN], 
   [RFC2236] and [RFC2131]. Below are provided terms specific to this 
   document: 

      - Service Domain: A group of servers which are dedicated for a 
      given service and are usually located on a separate IP subnet. 

3. Design Goals 

   To overcome the limitations of the STP bridge networks as mentioned 
   above, this document describes Virtual Subnet (VS), a new IP-only 
   L2VPN solution which is intended to be a practical and scalable data 
   center network architecture meeting the following objectives:  

      - Bandwidth Utilization Maximization

Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                January 2011 
 
   To provide enough bandwidth between servers, the server-to-server 
   traffic SHOULD always be delivered along the shortest paths while 
   multi-path routing is used for load-balancing purpose.  

      - Layer 2 Connectivity 

   To be backwards compatible with existing applications and protocols 
   running in today's data centers (e.g., virtual machine migration), 
   servers of a given service domain SHOULD be connected as if they 
   were on a Local Area Network (LAN) or an IP subnet. 

      - Domain Isolation 

   To achieve performance and security isolation, servers belonging to 
   different service domains SHOULD be isolated just as if they were 
   located on separate Virtual LANs (VLAN) or IP subnets. 

      - Forwarding Table Scalability 

   To accommodate tens to hundreds of thousands of servers in a single 
   data center network, the forwarding tables of those forwarding 
   devices (e.g., routers or bridges) SHOULD be scalable enough. 

      - Broadcast Storm Suppression 

   To alleviate the serious impacts on network performance which are 
   imposed by broadcast storms, broadcast domains SHOULD be limited to 
   their smallest scopes. 

4. Architecture Description 

   VS uses BGP/MPLS IP VPN technology [RFC4364] with some extensions, 
   together with other proven technologies including ARP proxy 
   [RFC925][RFC1027] to provide scalable IP-only L2VPN services across 
   a MPLS/IP backbone.  

   Since VS constructs large-scale IP subnets, rather than real LANs, 
   across the MPLS/IP backbone, the non-IP traffic would not be 
   supported in VS anymore. However, given that IP traffic is the 
   predominant type of traffic in today's data center networks and the 
   non-IP traffic will disappear from the data center networks with the 
   elapse of time, we believe that VS can be used as a practical data 
   center network solution in most cases. 

   The following sections describe VS in detail.

                 Figure 1: Unicast inside a Service Domain 

   As shown in Figure 1, BGP/MPLS IP VPN technology with some 
   extensions is deployed in a data center network. To maintain proper 
   isolation of one service domain from another, each service domain is 
   mapped to a distinct VPN and servers of a given service domain, as 
   Customer Edge (CE) hosts, are attached to Provider Edge (PE) routers 
   directly or through one or more Ethernet bridges. In addition, to 
   build large IP subnets across the MPLS/IP backbone, different sites 
   of a particular VPN are associated with an identical IP subnet. PE 
   routers create host routes for their local CE hosts automatically 
   according to the corresponding ARP entries. Instead of distributing 
   the routes for the configured VPN subnets, PE routers distribute 
   host routes for their local CE hosts to each other. In addition, 
   each PE router automatically creates a route for the configured VPN 
   subnet whose next-hop is pointed to a null interface. With such 
   special route, packets destined for the nonexistent hosts of that 
   subnet will be discarded directly by the ingress PE routers. APR 
   proxy is implemented on PE routers for every attached VPN, thus, 
   upon receiving from a local CE host an ARP request for a remote CE

   host, the PE as an ARP proxy returns its own MAC address as a 
   response. 

   Assume host A broadcasts an ARP request for host B before 
   communicating with B, upon the receipt of this ARP request, PE-1 
   lookups the associated VRF to find the host route for B. If found 
   and the route is learnt from a remote PE, PE-1 acting as an ARP 
   proxy returns its own MAC address in the response to that ARP 
   request. Otherwise, no ARP reply SHOULD be sent. After obtaining the 
   ARP reply from PE-1, A sends an IP packet to B with destination MAC 
   address of PE-1's MAC address. Upon receiving this packet, PE-1 
   acting as an ingress PE, tunnels the packet towards PE-2 which in 
   turn, as an egress PE, forwards the packet to B.

                 Figure 2: Unicast between Service Domains 

   As shown in Figure 2, for a CE host (e.g., host A) to communicate 
   with other hosts outside its subnet, the PE router (e.g., PE-2) 
   which is connected to the default gateway router (e.g., GW) for that 
   VPN SHOULD be configured with a default route with the next-hop of

Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                January 2011 
 
   the default gateway router and then advertise such default route to 
   other PE routers of the same VPN. Now host A sends an ARP request 
   for its default gateway (i.e., GW) before sending a packet to a host 
   outside its subnet. Upon receiving this ARP request, PE-1 lookups 
   the associated VRF to find the host route for GW. If found and that 
   found host route is learnt from a remote PE, PE-1 as an ARP proxy, 
   returns its own MAC address in the ARP reply. Host A then sends an 
   IP packet for the destination host with destination MAC address of 
   PE-1's MAC. Upon receiving this packet, PE-1 as an ingress PE, 
   tunnels it towards PE-2 according to the best route (i.e., the 
   default route learnt from PE-2) for the destination host. PE-2 as an 
   egress PE, in turn, forwards the received packet towards the default 
   gateway router (i.e., GW). Due to the null route for the subnet, 
   packets destined for those nonexistent CE hosts of that subnet would 
   not be mistakenly forwarded to the default gateway router of that 
   subnet. 

   In the scenario where more than one default gateway router running 
   Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC2338] is connected to 
   a given VPN for redundancy purpose, only the PE router which is 
   connected to the Virtual Router Master SHOULD be allowed to announce 
   a default route into that VPN. To achieve that goal, a default route 
   with the next-hop of the corresponding Virtual Router IP address is 
   configured for that VPN instance on each of the PE routers which are 
   connected to the VRRP routers. In addition, the default route SHOULD 
   not be deemed as valid until there is an active host route for its 
   next-hop address. Since only the Virtual Router Master is allowed to 
   respond to ARP requests for the Virtual Router IP address and 
   broadcast gratuitous ARP requests containing the Virtual Router IP 
   address, only the PE router which is connected to the Virtual Router 
   Master could have an active ARP entry for the Virtual Router IP 
   address and therefore could have an active host route for the 
   Virtual Router IP address (i.e., the next-hop address of the 
   configured default route). In this way, all packets destined for the 
   outside would be sent to the corresponding Virtual Router Master. 

   4.2. Multicast/Broadcast 

   The MVPN technology [MVPN], in particular, the Protocol-Independent-
   Multicast (PIM) tree option with some extensions, is partially 
   reused here to support IP multicast and broadcast between CE hosts 
   of the same VPN. For example, PE routers attached to a given VPN 
   join a default provider multicast distribution tree which is 
   dedicated for that VPN. PE routers receiving customer multicast or 
   broadcast traffic from local CE hosts forward such traffic to other 
   remote PE routers over the corresponding default provider multicast 
   distribution tree. When customer multicast or broadcast traffic is

Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                January 2011 
 
   received from a provider multicast distribution tree, PE routers 
   forward such traffic to the associated VRF attachment circuits.  

   For the customer multicast group of a particular VPN which carries 
   high-volume traffic and not all sites of that VPN need the traffic 
   of that customer multicast group, a dedicated provider multicast 
   distribution tree other than the default provider multicast 
   distribution tree for that VPN can be assigned optionally. As a 
   result, those PE routers of that VPN that have no local CE hosts 
   which are interested in that customer multicast group will not 
   receive such traffic from remote PE routers anymore. 

   More details about how to support multicast and broadcast traffic in 
   VS will be explored in a later version of this document. 

   4.3. CE Host Discovery 

   To discover all local CE hosts including gateway routers, PE routers 
   SHOULD perform at least once ARP scan on the attached VPN subnet 
   after rebooting. For example, a PE broadcasts an ARP request for 
   each IP address within the subnet of each attached VPN. 
   Alternatively, this PE could also broadcast an ARP request for a 
   directed broadcast address (i.e., 255.255.255.255) or an ALL-Systems 
   multicast group address (i.e., 224.0.0.1), that is to say, the 
   target protocol address field is filled with 2555.255.255.255 or 
   224.0.0.1. Any CE host receiving this ARP request SHOULD respond 
   with an ARP reply containing its IP and MAC addresses. After a round 
   of such ARP scan, the PE will discover all local CE hosts and cache 
   their ARP entries in its ARP table. After that, the PE could send 
   ARP requests in unicast to each already-learnt local CE host 
   periodically so as to check whether the CE host is still present on 
   the subnet. Using unicast ARP requests has the advantage that it is 
   quieter than using the broadcast because it won't be received by all 
   CE hosts on the subnet. When receiving a gratuitous ARP from a local 
   CE host, the PE SHOULD cache the ARP entry of that CE host in its 
   ARP table immediately if no ARP entry for that CE host exists yet. 
   Otherwise, the PE SHOULD just update the corresponding ARP entry of 
   that CE host. Most operating systems generate a gratuitous ARP 
   request when the host boots up, the host's network interface or 
   links comes up, or an address assigned to the interface changes. In 
   the scarce scenarios where a host does not generate a gratuitous ARP, 
   the PE would have to perform ARP scan periodically. 

   4.4. CE Host Multi-homing and Mobility 

   When a given PE receives a host route for one of its local CE hosts 
   from a remote PE, it SHOULD immediately send an ARP request for that

   CE host to the attached VPN subnet so as to determine whether that 
   CE host is still connected locally. If an ARP reply is received in a 
   short amount of time (imaging the CE host multi-homing scenario), 
   the PE just needs to update the ARP entry for that CE host as normal. 
   Otherwise (considering the virtual machine migration scenario), the 
   PE SHOULD delete the ARP entry corresponding to that host from its 
   APR table. Meanwhile, the PE SHOULD broadcast a gratuitous ARP on 
   the attached VPN subnet on behalf of that CE host, with the sender 
   hardware address field being filled with one of its own MAC 
   addresses. As a result, the ARP entry for that CE host which has 
   been cached on other local CE hosts is updated.  

   4.5. APR Proxy 

   The PE, acting as an ARP proxy, SHOULD only respond to the ARP 
   requests for those CE hosts which have been learnt from other remote 
   PE routers. Especially, the PE SHOULD not respond to ARP requests 
   for local CE hosts. Otherwise, in case that the ARP reply from the 
   PE covers that from the requested CE host, the packet for that local 
   CE host which is sent from another local CE would be unnecessarily 
   relayed by the PE.  

   When VRRP, together with ARP proxy is enabled on multiple PE routers 
   which are attached to the same VPN site, only the PE acting as 
   Virtual Router Master is delegated to perform ARP proxy function on 
   the shared VPN subnet. In addition, it SHOULD use the Virtual Router 
   MAC address in any ARP packet it sends. 

   4.6. DHCP Relay Agent 

   To avoid flooding Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   [RFC2131] broadcast messages through the data center network, DHCP 
   Relay Agent can be implemented on PE routers for each attached VPN. 
   Thus, DHCP broadcast messages received from DHCP clients on local CE 
   hosts would be relayed by DHCP Relay Agents on PE routers to DHCP 
   servers in unicast. 

5. Comparison 

   5.1. VS vs VPLS 

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4761, RFC4762] provides 
   private LAN services for IP as well as other protocols. Since PE 
   routers in VPLS work much similar as STP bridges, broadcast storm 
   issues are intactly inherited from traditional STP bridge networks 
   to VPLS.

Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                January 2011 
 
   At the cost of being lacking in support for non-IP traffic, VS 
   alleviates the broadcast storm issues by using Layer 3 routing and 
   ARP proxy technologies on PE routers. 

   In addition, if CE hosts of multiple VPNs are attached to a PE 
   router through an intermediate Ethernet bridge, in VPLS, this 
   intermediate bridge would have to learn the MAC addresses of both 
   local CE hosts and remote CE hosts of these attached VPNs. However, 
   in VS, such intermediate bridge only needs to learn MAC addresses of 
   local CE hosts and local PE routers due to the ARP proxy implemented 
   on PE routers.  

   5.2. VS vs IPLS 

   Both VS and IP LAN Service (IPLS) [IPLS] are IP only L2VPN 
   technologies.  

   However, IPLS is different from VS in several aspects. First, in 
   IPLS, ARP packets even including the unicast ARP reply packets are 
   forwarded from attachment circuits to "multicast" PWs and the 
   received APR packets from the "multicast" PWs will be flooded to all 
   CE hosts (although broadcast ARP request packets can be suppressed 
   by PE routers on which there are matching ARP entries for the ARP 
   requests in their ARP caches). As a result, the broadcast storm 
   imposed by ARP traffic is worsened to some extent, rather than being 
   alleviated. In contrast, by using ARP Proxy on PE routers in VS, ARP 
   traffic is limited within small network scopes. Second, as said in 
   [IPLS], "An IP frame received over a unicast PW is prepended with a 
   MAC header before transmitting it on the appropriate attachment 
   circuits and the source MAC address is the PE router's own local MAC 
   address or a MAC address which has been specially configured on the 
   PE router for this use." However, the destination MAC address of the 
   packet to a remote CE host which is sent from a local CE host is the 
   MAC of the remote CE host, rather than the local PE router's MAC. 
   Thus, flooding unknown destination unicast frames on the above 
   Ethernet bridges would not be avoided anymore unless these 
   intermediary bridges are configured to not age out the learned MAC 
   entries (whether such configuration has any side-effects is 
   uncertain). In contrast, such intermediate bridges in VS only need 
   to learn MAC addresses of local CE hosts and local PE routers. Third, 
   IPLS prohibits connection of a common LAN or VLAN to more than one 
   PE router. In other words, IPLS can not allow CE hosts to be multi-
   homed to multiple PE routers for redundancy and load-balancing. In 
   contrast, VS can support CE multi-homing easily.

6. Conclusion 

   By using Layer 3 routing on the backbone of the data center network 
   to replace the STP bridge forwarding, traffic between any two 
   servers is forwarded along shortest paths between them and multi-
   path routing is easily achieved. Thus, the totally available 
   bandwidth in data center networks is utilized to the maximum extent. 

   By reusing the BGP/MPLS IP VPN technology to build large IP subnets 
   across the backbones of data center networks, servers of a given VPN 
   are allowed to communicate with each other just as if they were on 
   the same subnet. 

   Due to the BGP/MPLS IP VPN technology, forwarding tables of P 
   routers are sized to the number of PE routers rather than the total 
   number of CE hosts. Meanwhile, forwarding tables of PE routers can 
   also scale well by distributing VPN instances and their 
   corresponding routing tables among multiple PE routers. Especially, 
   thanks to the Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) capability of BGP, PE 
   routers only needs to maintain the routing tables of their attached 
   VPN instances. Thus, the forwarding table scalability issues with 
   today's data center networks are largely alleviated. 

   By enabling APR proxy function on PE routers, ARP broadcast messages 
   from local CE hosts are blocked by local PE routers. Thus, APR 
   broadcast messages will not flood the whole data center network. 
   Besides, by enabling DHCP Relay Agent function on PE routers, DHCP 
   broadcast messages from local CE hosts are intercepted by DHCP Relay 
   Agents and forwarded to DHCP servers in unicast. Thus, the broadcast 
   storms in data center networks are largely suppressed. 

7. Future work 

   How to support IPv6 CE hosts in VS is for future study. 

8. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

9. IANA Considerations 

   There is no requirement for IANA.
