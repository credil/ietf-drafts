    1. Introduction

   The goal of all-optical meshed networks consists in the transport of
   optical circuit connections, with limited usage of Optical-
   Electrical-Optical conversion through photonic nodes. The gain
   brought by the use of fewer regenerators is balanced by the
   constraint of maintaining the optical signal continuity between the
   source and the destination nodes. In GMPLS controlled networks, the
   induced signal continuity brings the technological challenge of
   wavelength assignment using control plane protocols, which is
   discussed in [WSON-Frame].

Internet-Draft    OSPF Extensions for O-E-O in WSON         March 2010


   The drawback of wavelength assignment computation in a single entity
   is the need to gather and convey all relevant and up-to-date
   information to this single entity. Whether the computing entity takes
   the form of a PCE or the form of a Constrained-Shortest-Path-First
   (C-SPF) engine in each node of the network, the IGP is supposed to do
   the job of gathering this information.

   Hence, this solution demands the flooding of a detailed view of the
   network comprising more information than the usual topological ones,
   [WSON-Info] and [WSON-encode] are addressing these concerns.

   In order to complement this work and to extend the Traffic
   Engineering (TE) properties of OSPF TE which are defined in
   [RFC3630], [RFC4202], and [RFC4203], this draft proposes a layout of
   information inside OSPF-TE LSAs. The TE LSA, is an opaque LSA with
   one (at least) top-level TLV containing several sub-TLVs. The top-
   level TLV can take one of five values (1) Router Address [RFC3630],
   (2) Link [RFC3630], (3) Router IPv6 address [RFC5329], (4) Link Local
   [RFC4203], (5) Node Attribute [OSPF-Node]. In this document, we
   enhance the sub-TLVs for the Node Attribute TLV and we also introduce
   a 6th type of top-level TLV, (6) O-E-O Pool Attribute.

   The detailed encoding of OSPF extensions are not yet defined in this
   document.

    2. Node Information

   The node information includes Node ID and Connectivity Matrix. The
   Node ID should comply with Routing Address described in [RFC3630],
   the Connectivity Matrix is defined in this document.

   [OSPF-Node] defines a new top TLV named the Node Attribute TLV which
   carries attributes related to a router/node. This Node Attribute TLV
   contains one or more sub-TLVs. This draft introduces a new one which
   description can be found at the end of the section:

    Sub-TLV Type   Length     Name

        TBD        variable   Connectivity Matrix

   This TLV is optional. Usually this Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV would
   appear in the LSA because the all-optical switches would present some
   switching constraints (spatial and/or spectral). Omitting this sub-
   TLV from the LSA would mean a fully flexible switch.

   The Connectivity Matrix is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of the
   Node Attribute TLV. The length is the length of value field in
   octets. The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in Section


Peloso and Meuric      Expires September 1, 2010              [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    OSPF Extensions for O-E-O in WSON         March 2010


   4.3 of [WSON-Encode]. One sub-TLV contains one matrix. The
   Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV may occur more than once to contain
   multi-matrices within the Node Attribute TLV.

   Note: Check that connectivity matrix uses interfaces references
   consistent with Link Local/Remote Identifiers sub-TLV of the Top TLV
   type 2 (Link) in order to ensure the consistency of the objects.

    3. O-E-O Pool Information

   This draft defines a new top-TLV named "O-E-O pool Attribute" TLV. It
   carries attributes related to a pool of Optical-Electric-Optical
   regeneration resource, thus allowing route computation to take into
   account available signal regenerators in the network. Multiple O-E-O
   resources are logically gathered in a pool when they share a common
   transmission media before (and after) entering (exiting) the actual
   switching matrix of the node. This Node Attribute TLV contains one or
   more sub-TLVs.

   The O-E-O pool information related to pools in WSON nodes include
   Pool ID, lists of available wavelength on the ingress and egress side
   of the pool, and the features of the O-E-O in the pool on the ingress
   and egress side of the pool. These pieces of information are defined
   in this document. The O-E-O pool information would also include some
   sub-TLVs identical to sub-TLVs of the TE-link top-TLV: TE-metric
   [rfc3630], Administrative Group [rfc3630], Link Local/Remote
   Identifiers [rfc4203], Shared-Risk Link Group [rfc4203].

   The following new sub-TLVs are added to the "O-E-O Pool Attribute"
   TLV. Detailed description for newly defined sub-TLVs is provided at
   the end of the section.

    Sub-TLV Type   Length     Name

        TBD        4 Bytes    Pool ID

        TBD        variable   Ingress Available Wavelength

        TBD        variable   Egress Available Wavelength

        TBD        fixed      Ingress O-E-O Features

        TBD        fixed      Egress O-E-O Features

   In "O-E-O Pool", the sub-TLVs "Ingress Available Wavelength" and
   "Ingress O-E-O Features" are mandatory, the other sub-TLVs listed
   above are optional. The omission of egress sub-TLV implies a symmetry
   status of egress and ingress.

Internet-Draft    OSPF Extensions for O-E-O in WSON         March 2010



   The following sub-TLVs to the "O-E-O Pool Attribute" TLV are
   identical to the ones defined respectively in [RFC3630] and
   [RFC4203], and being defined for the TE-link top-TLV. Detailed
   description for newly defined sub-TLV is provided at the end of the
   section.

    Sub-TLV Type   Length     Name

        TBD        4 Bytes    TE-metric [alike RFC3630]

        TBD        4 Bytes    Administrative Group [alike RFC3630]

        TBD        8 Bytes    Link Local/Remote Identifiers [alike
   RFC4203]

        TBD        variable   Shared Risk Link Group [alike RFC4203]

   In "O-E-O Pool", the sub-TLV "Link Local/Remote Identifiers" is
   mandatory as it is needed to ensure the consistency with the Node
   Information described in Section 2. The other sub-TLVs listed above
   are optional.


3.1. Pool ID

   This optional sub-TLV can be used to provide an identifier to the
   regenerator pool.

3.2. Ingress/Egress Available Wavelength

   These sub-TLVs provide the list of available wavelength respectively
   to reach the pool from the Node and to reach the Node from the pool
   (meaning first before and second after the signal crosses the O-E-O).
   These sub-TLVs share the same format as the Available Wavelength sub-
   TLVs depicted in [WSON-Encode]. The omission of the egress sub-TLV is
   depicting a symmetrical usage of wavelength on each side of the pool.

3.3. Ingress/Egress O-E-O Features

   Both these sub-TLVs provide the features of a given O-E-O resource,
   respectively on its incoming and on its outgoing side. The encoding
   of this sub-TLV is not provided yet, but is likely to resemble
   elements of [OSPF-signal-compatibility] and of Wavelength Converter
   Range define in [WSON-encode]

   Elements of the sub-TLVs:

      . Signal Type: Modulation Format, Bit-Rate, Modulation parameters,
        etc...

      . Wavelength constraints: (alike Wavelength Converter Range).

   A pair of these sub-TLVs is describing a given O-E-O piece of
   equipment. Hence, there will be an instance of a pair of these sub-
   TLVs for each O-E-O resource present in the pool, which shall in fine
   construct a list of these sub-TLVs to describe the list of O-E-O
   resource.

   The omission of the egress sub-TLV translates symmetry in the
   features of the O-E-O on its ingress and on its egress side.

    4. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203].

    5. IANA Considerations

   [RFC3630] says that the top level Types in a TE LSA and Types for
   sub-TLVs for each top level Types must be assigned by Expert Review,
   and must be registered with IANA.

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the sub-TLVs as defined
   in Sections 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 as follows:

5.1. Node Information

   This document introduces the following sub-TLVs of Node Attribute TLV
   (Value TBD, see [OSPF-Node])

         Type    sub-TLV

         TBD    Connectivity Matrix

         TBD    Wavelength Converter Accessibility

         TBD    Wavelength Conversion Range

    TBD WC Usage State

5.2.     O-E-O Pool Information

   This document introduces the "O-E-O Pool Attribute" top-TLV, value
   TBD with the following sub-TLVs:
