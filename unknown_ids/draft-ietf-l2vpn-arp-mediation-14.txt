     Abstract 
      
     The VPWS service [L2VPN-FRM] provides point-to-point connections 
     between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does so by 
     binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device 
     with a Provider Edge, PE, device) to a pseudowire (connecting 
     the two PEs).  In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of 
     the same technology (e.g., both Ethernet, both ATM), and the 
     pseudowire must carry the frames of that technology.  However, 
     if it is known that the frames' payload consists solely of IP 
     datagrams, it is possible to provide a point-to-point connection 
     in which the pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits of 
     different technologies. This requires the PEs to perform a 
     function known as "ARP Mediation". ARP Mediation refers to the 
     process of resolving Layer 2 addresses when different resolution 
     protocols are used on either Attachment Circuit. The methods 
     described in this document are applicable even when the CEs run 
     a routing protocol between them, as long as the routing protocol 
     runs over IP.

     2. Introduction 
         
     Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN) are constructed over a 
     Service Provider IP backbone but are presented to the Customer 
     Edge (CE) devices as Layer 2 networks.  In theory, L2VPNs can 
     carry any Layer 3 protocol, but in many cases, the Layer 3 
     protocol is IP. Thus it makes sense to consider procedures that 
     are optimized for IP. 
      
     In a typical implementation, illustrated in the diagram below, 
     the CE devices are connected to the Provider Edge (PE) devices 
     via Attachment Circuits (AC). The ACs are Layer 2 links.  In a 
     pure L2VPN, if traffic sent from CE1 via AC1 reaches CE2 via 
     AC2, both ACs would have to be of the same type (i.e., both 
     Ethernet, both FR, etc.). However, if it is known that only IP 
     traffic will be carried, the ACs can be of different 
     technologies, provided that the PEs provide the appropriate 
     procedures to allow the proper transfer of IP packets.

     A CE, which is connected via a given type of AC, may use an IP  
     Address Resolution procedure that is specific to that type of 
     AC. For example, an Ethernet-attached IPv4 CE would use ARP 
     [ARP] and a FR-attached CE might use Inverse ARP [INVARP].  If 
     we are to allow the two CEs to have a Layer 2 connection between 
     them, even though each AC uses a different Layer 2 technology, 
     the PEs must intercept and "mediate" the Layer 2 specific 
     address resolution procedures.  
      
     In this draft, we specify the procedures for VPWS services, 
     which the PEs must implement in order to mediate the IP address 
     resolution mechanism. We call these procedures "ARP Mediation".  
     Consider a Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) constructed 
     between CE1 and CE2 in the diagram above.  If AC1 and AC2 are of 
     different technologies, e.g. AC1 is Ethernet and AC2 is Frame 
     Relay (FR), then ARP requests coming from CE1 cannot be passed 
     transparently to CE2. PE1 must interpret the meaning of the ARP 
     requests and mediate the necessary information with PE2 before 
     responding. 
      
     The draft uses "ARP" terminology to mean any protocol that is 
     used to resolve IP address to Link Layer address association 
     purposes. For instance in IPv4, ARP and Inverse ARP protocols 
     are used for address resolution while in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
     and Inverse Neighbor Discovery protocol based on ICMPv6 is used 
     for address resolution. 
      
     3. ARP Mediation (AM) function

                  Draft-ietf-l2vpn-arp-mediation-14.txt 
                                            
     The ARP Mediation (AM) function is an element of a PE node that 
     deals with the IP address resolution for CE devices connected 
     via an VPWS L2VPN. By placing this function in the PE node, ARP 
     Mediation is transparent to the CE devices.  
      
     For a given point-to-point connection between a pair of CEs, the 
     ARP Mediation procedure depends on whether the packets being 
     forwarded are IPv4 or IPV6. A PE that is to perform ARP 
     Mediation for IPv4 packets must perform the following logical 
     steps:  
      
        1. Discover the IP address of the locally attached CE device 
        2. Terminate, do not distribute ARP and Inverse ARP requests 
           from CE device at local PE.  
        3. Distribute the IP Address to the remote PE using 
           pseudowire control signaling. 
        4. Notify the locally attached CE of the IP address of the 
           remote CE.  
        5. Respond appropriately to ARP and Inverse ARP requests from 
           local CE device, using IP address of remote CE and 
           hardware address of local PE. 
      
     A PE that is to perform ARP Mediation for IPv6 packets must 
     perform the following logical steps: 
      
       1. Discover the IPv6 addresses of the locally attached CE device, 
          together with those of the remote CE device. 
       2. Intercept Neighbor Discovery and Inverse Neighbor Discovery 
          packets received from the local CE device, learning 
          information about the IPv6 configuration of the CE, before 
          forwarding the packets across the VPWS to the remote PE. 
       3. Intercept Neighbor Discovery and Inverse Neighbor Discovery 
          packets received over the VPWS from the remote PE, possibly 
          modifying them (if required for the type of outgoing AC) 
          before forwarding to the local CE, and also learning 
          information about the IPv6 configuration of the remote CE.

     PEs MUST support ARP mediation for IPv4 L2 Interworking 
     circuits. Support for IPv6 L2 interworking circuits is OPTIONAL.  
      
     Details for the above-described procedures are given in the 
     following sections. 
      
     4. IP Layer 2 Interworking Circuit 
      
     The IP Layer 2 interworking Circuit refers to interconnection of 
     the Attachment Circuit with the IP Layer 2 Transport pseudowire 
     that carries IP datagrams as the payload. The ingress PE removes 
     the data link header of its local Attachment Circuit and 
     transmits the payload (an IP packet) over the pseudowire with or 
     without the optional control word. In some cases, multiple data 
     link headers may exist, such as bridged Ethernet PDU on ATM 
     Attachment Circuit. In this case, ATM header as well as the 
     Ethernet header is removed to expose the IP packet at the 
     ingress. The egress PE encapsulates the IP packet with the data 
     link header used on its local Attachment Circuit.  
      
     The encapsulation for the IP Layer 2 Transport pseudowire is 
     described in [RFC4447]. The "IP Layer 2 interworking circuit" 
     pseudowire is also commonly referred to as "IP pseudowire". 
      
     In the case of an IPv6 L2 Interworking Circuit, the egress PE 
     may modify the contents of Neighbor Discovery or Inverse 
     Neighbor Discovery packets before encapsulating the IP packet 
     with the data link header. 
      
      
     5. IP Address Discovery Mechanisms 
         
     An IP Layer 2 Interworking Circuit enters monitoring state 
     immediately after the configuration. During this state it 
     performs two functions.  
      
        - Discovery of the CE IP device(s)  
        - Establishment of the PW  
           
     The establishment of the PW occurs independently from local CE 
     IP address discovery. During the period when the PW has been 
     established but the local CE IP device has not been discovered, 
     only broadcast/multicast IP frames are propagated between the

                  Draft-ietf-l2vpn-arp-mediation-14.txt 
                                            
     Attachment Circuit and pseudowire; unicast IP datagrams are 
     dropped. The IP destination address is used to classify 
     unicast/multicast packets.  
      
     The unicast IP frames are propagated between AC and pseudowire 
     only when CE IP devices on both Attachment Circuits have been 
     discovered, notified and proxy functions have completed. 
      
     The need to wait for address resolution completion before the 
     unicast IP traffic can flow is simple. 
        . PEs do not perform routing operations 
        . Destination IP address in the packet is not necessarily 
          that of the attached CE 
        . On a broadcast link, there is no way to find out the MAC 
          address of the CE based on the Destination IP address of 
          the packet. 
         
     5.1. Discovery of IP Addresses of Locally Attached IPv4 CE 
         
     A PE MUST support manual configuration of IPv4 CE addresses. 
     This section also describes automated mechanisms by which a PE 
     MAY also discover an IPv4 CE address. 
      
     5.1.1. Monitoring Local Traffic 
      
     The PE devices may learn the IP addresses of the locally 
     attached CEs from any IP traffic, such as link local multicast 
     packets (e.g., destined to 224.0.0.x), and are not restricted to 
     the operations below.   
      
     5.1.2. CE Devices Using ARP 
      
     If a CE device uses ARP to determine the IP address to MAC 
     address binding of its neighbor, the PE processes the ARP 
     requests to learn the IP address of local CE for the local 
     Attachment Circuit. 
      
     This document mandates that there MUST be only one CE per 
     Attachment Circuit. However, customer facing access topologies 
     may exist whereby more than one CE appears to be connected to 
     the PE on a single Attachment Circuit. For example, this could 
     be the case when CEs are connected to a shared LAN that connects 
     to the PE. In such case, the PE MUST select one local CE. The

     selection could be based on manual configuration or the PE may 
     optionally use following selection criteria. In either case, 
     manual configuration of IP address of the local CE (and its MAC 
     address) MUST be supported.   
      
        o  Wait to learn the IP address of the remote CE (through PW 
           signaling) and then select the local CE that is sending 
           the request for IP address of the remote CE.  
        o  Augment cross checking with the local IP address learned 
           through listening for link local multicast packets (as per 
           section 5.1.1. above).     
        o  Augment cross checking with the local IP address learned 
           through the Router Discovery protocol (as described below 
           in section 5.1.5. ). 
        o  There is still a possibility that the local PE may not 
           receive an IP address advertisement from the remote PE and 
           there may exist multiple local IP routers that attempt to 
           'connect' to remote CEs. In this situation, the local PE 
           may use some other criteria to select one IP device from 
           many (such as "the first ARP received"), or an operator 
           may configure the IP address of local CE. Note that the 
           operator does not have to configure the IP address of the 
           remote CE (as that would be learned through pseudowire 
           signaling).      
      
     Once the local and remote CEs has been discovered for the given 
     Attachment Circuit, the local PE responds with its own MAC 
     address to any subsequent ARP requests from the local CE with a 
     destination IP address matching the IP address of the remote CE. 
      
     The local PE signals IP address of the CE to the remote PE and 
     may initiate an unsolicited ARP response to notify the IP 
     address to MAC address binding for the remote CE to local CE 
     (again using its own MAC address).  
      
     Once the ARP mediation function is completed (i.e. the PE device 
     knows both the local and remote CE IP addresses), unicast IP 
     frames are propagated between the AC and the established PW. 
      
     The PE may periodically generate ARP request messages for the IP 
     address of the CE as a means of verifying the continued 
     existence of the IP address and its MAC address binding. The 
     absence of a response from the CE device for a given number of 
     retries could be used as a trigger for withdrawal of the IP

     address advertisement to the remote PE. The local PE would then 
     re-enter the address resolution phase to rediscover the IP 
     address of the attached CE. Note that this "heartbeat" scheme is 
     needed only for broadcast links (such as Ethernet AC), where the 
     failure of a CE device may otherwise be undetectable.  
      
     5.1.3. CE Devices Using Inverse ARP  
         
     If a CE device uses Inverse ARP to determine the IP address of 
     its neighbor, the attached PE processes the Inverse ARP request 
     from the Attachment Circuit and responds with an Inverse ARP 
     reply containing the IP address of the remote CE, if the address 
     is known. If the PE does not yet have the IP address of the 
     remote CE, it does not respond, but records the IP address of 
     the local CE and the circuit information. Subsequently, when the 
     IP address of the remote CE becomes available, the PE may 
     initiate the Inverse ARP request as a means of notifying the IP 
     address of the remote CE to the local CE.  
      
     This is the typical mode of operation for Frame Relay and ATM 
     Attachment Circuits. If the CE does not use Inverse ARP, the PE 
     can still discover the IP address of local CE using the 
     mechanisms described in section 5.1.1. and 5.1.5.  
      
     5.1.4. CE Devices Using PPP  
         
     The IP Control Protocol [PPP-IPCP] describes a procedure to 
     establish and configure IP on a point-to-point connection, 
     including the negotiation of IP addresses. When such Attachment 
     Circuit is configured for IP interworking, PPP negotiation is 
     not performed end-to-end between CE devices. Instead, PPP 
     negotiation takes place between the CE and its local PE. The PE 
     performs proxy PPP negotiation and informs the attached CE the 
     IP address of the remote CE during IPCP negotiation using the 
     IP-Address option (0x03). 
       
     When a PPP link completes LCP negotiations, the local PE MAY 
     perform the following IPCP actions:

                  Draft-ietf-l2vpn-arp-mediation-14.txt 
                                            
        o  The PE learns the IP address of the local CE from the 
           Configure-Request received with the IP-Address option 
           (0x03). If the IP address is non-zero, PE records the 
           address and responds with Configure-Ack. However, if the 
           IP address is zero, PE responds with Configure-Reject (as 
           this is a request from CE to assign it an IP address). 
           Also, the IP address option is set with zero value in the 
           Configure-Reject response to instruct the CE to not 
           include that option in subsequent new Configure-Request. 
        o  If the PE receives Configure-Request without the IP-
           Address option, it responds with a Configure-Ack. In this 
           case the PE is unable to learn the IP address of the local 
           CE using IPCP and hence must rely on other means as 
           described in sections 5.1.1. and 5.1.5.  Note that in 
           order to employ other learning mechanisms, the IPCP 
           negotiations must have reached the open state.  
        o  If the PE does not know the IP address of the remote CE, 
           it sends a Configure-Request without the IP-Address 
           option.  
        o  If the PE knows the IP address of the remote CE, it sends 
           a Configure-Request with the IP-Address option containing 
           the IP address of the remote CE.       
      
     The IPCP IP-Address option MAY be negotiated between the PE and 
     the local CE device. Configuration of other IPCP options MAY be 
     rejected. Other NCPs, with the exception of the Compression 
     Control Protocol (CCP) and Encryption Control Protocol (ECP), 
     MUST be rejected. The PE device MAY reject configuration of the 
     CCP and ECP.   
           
     5.1.5. Router Discovery method  
         
     In order to learn the IP address of the CE device for a given 
     Attachment Circuit, the PE device may execute Router Discovery 
     Protocol [RFC 1256] whereby a Router Discovery Request (ICMP - 
     router solicitation) message is sent using a source IP address 
     of zero. The IP address of the CE device is extracted from the 
     Router Discovery Response (ICMP - router advertisement) message 
     from the CE. It is possible that the response contains more than 
     one router addresses with the same preference level; in which 
     case, some heuristics (such as first on the list) is necessary.  
     The use of the Router Discovery method by the PE is optional.

     5.1.6. Manual Configuration  
         
     In some cases, it may not be possible to discover the IP address 
     of the local CE device using the mechanisms described in section 
     5.1. above. In such cases manual configuration MAY be used. All 
     implementations of this draft MUST support manual configuration 
     of the IPv4 address of the local CE. This is the only REQUIRED 
     mode for a PE to support. 
           
     5.2. How a CE Learns the IPv4 address of a remote CE   
         
     Once the local PE has received the IP address information of the 
     remote CE from the remote PE, it will either initiate an address 
     resolution request or respond to an outstanding request from the 
     attached CE device.  
           
     5.2.1. CE Devices Using ARP 
         
     When the PE learns IP address of the remote CE as described in 
     section 6.1. , it may or may not already know IP address of the 
     local CE. If the IP address is not known, the PE must wait until 
     it is acquired through one of the methods described in sections 
     5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.5. If IP address of the local CE is known, 
     the PE may choose to generate an unsolicited ARP message to 
     notify the local CE about the binding of the IP address of the 
     remote CE with the PE's own MAC address.  
      
     When the local CE generates an ARP request, the PE must proxy 
     the ARP response [PROXY-ARP] using its own MAC address as the 
     source hardware address and IP address of remote CE as the 
     source protocol address. The PE must respond only to those ARP 
     requests whose destination protocol address matches the IP 
     address of the remote CE.   
           
     5.2.2. CE Devices Using Inverse ARP  
         
     When the PE learns the IP address of the remote CE, it should 
     generate an Inverse ARP request. If the Attachment Circuit 
     requires activation (e.g. Frame Relay) the PE should activate it

     first before the Inverse ARP request. It should be noted, that 
     PE might never receive the response to its own request, nor see 
     any Inverse ARP request from the CE, in cases where CE is pre-
     configured with IP address of the remote CE or where the use of 
     Inverse ARP has not been enabled. In either case the CE has used 
     other means to learn the IP address of his neighbor.  
           
     5.2.3. CE Devices Using PPP  
         
     When the PE learns the IP address of the remote CE, it should 
     initiate a Configure-Request and set the IP-Address option to 
     the IP address of the remote CE to notify the IP address of the 
     remote CE to the local CE.  
      
      
     5.3. Discovery of IP Addresses of IPv6 CE Devices 
         
     5.3.1. Distinguishing Factors Between IPv4 and IPv6 
         
     IPv6 uses ICMPv6 extensions to resolve IP address and link 
     address associations. These are ICMPv6 packets, as compared to 
     ARP and inverse ARP in IPv4 which are dedicated address 
     resolution protocols and not IP packets. The IP pseudowire 
     cannot be used to carry ARP and Inverse ARP packets and hence 
     requires local processing of these PDUs and signaling of IP 
     address information between the PEs using the Pseudowire control 
     plane. 
      
     5.3.2. Requirements for PEs 
         
     A PE device that supports IPv6 MUST be capable of, 
        - Intercepting ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC 2461] and 
          Inverse Neighbor Discovery [RFC 3122] packets received 
          over the AC as well as over the PW. 
        - Recording the IPv6 interface addresses and CE link-layer 
          addresses present in these packets

        - Possibly modifying these packets as dictated by the data 
          link type of the egress AC (described in the following 
          sections), and 
        - Forwarding them towards the original destination 
     The PE MUST also be capable of generating packets in order to 
     interwork between Neighbor Discovery (ND) and Inverse Neighbor 
     Discovery (IND). This is specified in Sections 5.3.3. to 5.3.6.  
     below. 
      
     If an IP PW is used to interconnect CEs that use IPv6 Router 
     Discovery [RFC 2461], a PE device MUST also be capable of 
     intercepting and processing those Router Discovery packets. This 
     is required in order to translate between different link layer 
     addresses. If a Router Discovery message contains a link layer 
     address, then the PE MAY also use this message to discover the 
     link layer address and IPv6 interface address. This is described 
     in more detail in Section 5.3.7. and Section 5.3.8.  
      
     The PE device MUST learn a list of CE IPv6 interface addresses 
     for its directly-attached CE and another list of CE IPv6 
     interface addresses for the far-end CE. The PE device MUST also 
     learn the link-layer address of the local CE and be able to use 
     it when forwarding traffic between the local and far-end CEs. 
     The PE MAY also wish to monitor the source link-layer address of 
     data packets received from the CE, and discard packets not 
     matching its learned CE link-layer address.  
      
     5.3.3. Processing of Neighbor Solicitations 
         
     A Neighbor Solicitation received on an AC from a local CE SHOULD 
     be inspected to determine and learn an IPv6 interface address 
     (if provided, this will not be the case for Duplicate Address 
     Detection) and any link-layer address provided. The packet MUST 
     then be forwarded over the pseudowire unmodified. A Neighbor 
     Solicitation received over the pseudowire SHOULD be inspected to 
     determine and learn an IPv6 interface address for the far-end 
     CE. If a source link-layer address option is present, the PE 
     MUST remove it. The PE MAY substitute an appropriate link-layer 
     address option, specifying the link-layer address of the local 
     AC. Note that if the local AC is Ethernet, failure to substitute 
     a link-layer address option may mean that the CE has no valid 
     link-layer address with which to transmit data packets.

     When a PE with a local AC of the type point-to-point link 
     receives a Neighbor Solicitation from a far end PE over the 
     pseudowire, after learning the IP address of the far-end CE, the 
     PE MAY use one of the following procedures: 
      
        1. Forward the Neighbor Solicitation to the local CE after 
           replacing the source link-layer address with the link-
           layer address of the local AC. 
        2. Send an Inverse Neighbor Solicitation to the local CE, 
           specifying the far-end CE's IP address and the link-layer 
           address of the local AC. 
        3. Reply to the far end PE with a Neighbor Advertisement, 
           using the IP address of the local CE learned using IPv6CP 
           as the source address, and an appropriate link-layer 
           address option, specifying the link-layer address of the 
           local AC. 
      
     5.3.4. Processing of Neighbor Advertisements 
         
     A Neighbor Advertisement received on an AC from a local CE 
     SHOULD be inspected to determine and learn an IPv6 interface 
     address and any link-layer address provided. The packet MUST 
     then be forwarded over the IP pseudowire unmodified. 
      
     A Neighbor Advertisement received over the pseudowire SHOULD be 
     inspected to determine and learn an IPv6 interface address for 
     the far-end CE. If a source link-layer address option is 
     present, the PE MUST remove it. The PE MAY substitute an 
     appropriate link-layer address option, specifying the link-layer 
     address of the local AC. Note that if the local AC is Ethernet, 
     failure to substitute a link-layer address option may mean that 
     the local CE has no valid link-layer address with which to 
     transmit data packets. 
      
     When a PE with a local AC of the type point-to-point link 
     receives a Neighbor Advertisement over the pseudowire, it should 
     perform the following steps: 
      
        o  Learn the IPv6 addresses of the far-end CE.

        o  If the AC supports Inverse Neighbor Discovery and the PE 
           had already processed an Inverse Neighbor Solicitation 
           (IND-SOL) from local CE, it SHOULD send an Inverse 
           Neighbor Advertisement (INA) on the local AC using source 
           IP address information received in ND-ADV and its own 
           local AC link layer information. 
        o  If the PE has not received any Inverse Neighbor 
           Solicitation (INS) from the local CE, and the AC supports 
           Inverse Neighbor Discovery, it SHOULD send an INS on the 
           local AC using source IP address information received in 
           the INA together with its own local AC link layer 
           information. 
      
     5.3.5. Processing Inverse Neighbor Solicitations 
         
     An Inverse Neighbor Solicitation received on an AC from a local 
     CE SHOULD be inspected to determine and learn the IPv6 addresses 
     and the link-layer addresses. The packet MUST then be forwarded 
     over the pseudowire unmodified. 
      
     An Inverse Neighbor Solicitation received over the pseudowire 
     SHOULD be inspected to determine and learn one or more IPv6 
     addresses for the far-end CE. If the local AC supports Inverse 
     Neighbor Discovery (e.g., a switched Frame Relay AC), the packet 
     may be forwarded to the local CE, after modifying the link-layer 
     address options to match the type of the local AC.  
      
     If the local AC does not support Inverse Neighbor Discovery 
     (IND), processing of the packet depends on whether the PE has 
     learned at least one interface address for its directly-attached 
     CE. If it has learned at least one IPv6 address for the CE, the 
     PE MUST discard the Inverse Neighbor Solicitation (INS) and 
     generate an Inverse Neighbor Advertisement (INA) back into the 
     pseudowire. The destination address of the INA is the source 
     address from the INS, the source address is one of the local 
     CE's interface addresses, and all the local CE's interface 
     addresses that have been learned so far SHOULD be included in 
     the Target Address List. The Source and Target Link-Layer 
     addresses are copied from the INS. In addition, the PE should 
     generate ND advertisements on the local AC using the IPv6 
     address of the remote CE and link-layer address of the local PE.

     The INS MUST be discarded if the PE has not yet learned at least 
     one IPv6 and link-layer address for its directly-connected CE. 
     This processing continues until the PE learns an IPv6 and link-
     layer address from the local CE (through receiving, for example, 
     a Neighbor Solicitation). After this has occurred, the PE will 
     be able to respond to INS messages received over the pseudowire. 
      
     5.3.6. Processing of Inverse Neighbor Advertisements 
         
     An Inverse Neighbor Advertisement (INA) received on an AC from a 
     local CE SHOULD be inspected to determine and learn one or more 
     IPv6 addresses for the CE. It MUST then be forwarded unmodified 
     over the pseudowire. 
      
     An INA received over the pseudowire SHOULD be inspected to 
     determine and learn one or more IPv6 addresses for the far-end 
     CE. 
      
     If the local AC supports Inverse Neighbor Discovery (e.g., a 
     Frame Relay AC), the packet MAY be forwarded to the local CE, 
     after modifying the link-layer address options to match the type 
     of the local AC.  
      
     If the local AC does not support Inverse Neighbor Discovery, the 
     PE MUST discard the INA and generate a Neighbor Advertisement 
     (NA) towards its local CE. The source IPv6 address of the NA is 
     the source IPv6 address from the INA, the destination IPv6 
     address is the destination IPv6 address from the INA and the 
     link-layer address is that of the local AC on the PE. 
      
     5.3.7. Processing of Router Solicitations 
         
     A Router Solicitation received on an AC from a local CE SHOULD 
     be inspected to determine and learn an IPv6 address for the CE, 
     and, if present, the link-layer address of the CE. It MUST then 
     be forwarded unmodified over the pseudowire. 
      
     A Router Solicitation received over the pseudowire SHOULD be 
     inspected to determine and learn an IPv6 address for the far-end 
     CE. If a source link-layer address option is present, the PE 
     MUST remove it. The PE MAY substitute a source link-layer 
     address option specifying the link-layer address of its local 
     AC. The packet is then forwarded to the local CE.

     5.3.8. Processing of Router Advertisements 
         
     A Router Advertisement received on an AC from a local CE SHOULD 
     be inspected to determine and learn an IPv6 address for the CE, 
     and, if present, the link-layer address of the CE. It MUST then 
     be forwarded unmodified over the pseudowire. 
      
     A Router Advertisement received over the pseudowire SHOULD be 
     inspected to determine and learn an IPv6 address for the far-end 
     CE. If a source link-layer address option is present, the PE 
     MUST remove it. The PE MAY substitute a source link-layer 
     address option specifying the link-layer address of its local 
     AC. If an MTU option is present, the PE MAY reduce the specified 
     MTU if the MTU of the pseudowire is less than the value 
     specified in the option. The packet is then forwarded to the 
     local CE. 
      
     5.3.9. Duplicate Address Detection [RFC 2462] 
         
     Duplicate Address Detection allows IPv6 hosts and routers to 
     ensure that the addresses assigned to interfaces are unique on a 
     link. As with all Neighbor Discovery packets, those used in 
     Duplicate Address Detection will simply flow through the 
     pseudowire, being inspected at the PEs at each end. Processing 
     is performed as above. However, the source IPv6 address of 
     Neighbor Solicitations used in Duplicate Address Detection is 
     the unspecified address, so the PEs cannot learn the CE's IPv6 
     interface address (nor would it make sense to do so, given that 
     at least one address is tentative at that time). 
      
     5.3.10. CE address discovery for CEs attached using PPP  
       
     The IPv6 Control Protocol (IPv6CP) [PPP-IPV6] describes a 
     procedure to establish and configure IPv6 on a point-to-point 
     connection, including the negotiation of link-local interface 
     identifier. As in the case of IPv4, when such an AC is 
     configured for IP interworking, PPP negotiation is not performed 
     end-to-end between CE devices. Instead, PPP negotiation takes 
     place between the CE and its local PE. The PE performs proxy PPP 
     negotiation and informs the attached CE of the link-local 
     identifier of its local interface using the Interface-Identifier

     option (0x01). This local interface identifier is used by 
     stateless address auto configuration [RFC 2462]. 
      
      
     When a PPP link completes IPv6CP negotiations and the PPP link 
     is open, a PE MAY discover the IPv6 unicast address of the CE 
     using any of the mechanisms described above.   
      
      
     6. CE IPv4 Address Signaling between PEs  
         
     6.1. When to Signal an IPv4 address of a CE   
      
     A PE device advertises the IPv4 address of the attached CE only 
     when the encapsulation type of the pseudowire is IP Layer2 
     Transport (the value 0x0000B, as defined in [PWE3-IANA]). It is 
     quite possible that the IPv4 address of a CE device is not 
     available at the time the PW labels are signaled. For example, 
     in Frame Relay the CE device sends an inverse ARP request only 
     when the DLCI is active. If the PE signals the DLCI to be active 
     only when it has received the IPv4 address along with the PW FEC 
     from the remote PE, a chicken and egg situation arises. In order 
     to avoid such problems, the PE must be prepared to advertise the 
     PW FEC before the IPv4 address of the CE is known and hence uses 
     IPv4 address value zero. When the IPv4 address of the CE device 
     does become available, the PE re-advertises the PW FEC along 
     with the IPv4 address of the CE.   
      
     Similarly, if the PE detects that an IP address of a CE is no 
     longer valid (by methods described above),the PE must re-
     advertise the PW FEC with null IP address to denote the 
     withdrawal of IP address of the CE. The receiving PE then waits 
     for notification of the remote IP address. During this period, 
     propagation of unicast IPv4 traffic is suspended, but multicast 
     IPv4 traffic can continue to flow between the AC and the 
     pseudowire.  
      
     If two CE devices are locally attached to the PE on disparate AC 
     types (for example, one CE connected to an Ethernet port and the 
     other to a Frame Relay port), the IPv4 addresses are learned in 
     the same manner as described above. However, since the CE 
     devices are local, the distribution of IPv4 addresses for these 
     CE devices is a local step.  
      
     Note that the PEs discover the IPv6 addresses of the remote CE 
     by intercepting Neighbor Discovery and Inverse Neighbor

     Discovery packets that have been passed in-band through the 
     pseudowire. Hence, there is no need to communicate the IPv6 
     addresses of the CEs through LDP signaling. 
      
     If the pseudowire is only carrying IPv6 traffic, the address 
     specified in the IP Address List TLV will always be zero. If the 
     pseudowire is carrying both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, the 
     mechanisms used for IPV6 and IPv4 should not overlap. In 
     particular, just because a PE has learned a link-layer address 
     for IPv6 traffic by intercepting a Neighbor Advertisement from 
     its directly-connected CE, it should not assume that it can use 
     that link-layer address for IPv4 traffic until that fact is 
     confirmed by reception of, for example, an IPv4 ARP message from 
     the CE. 
      
           
     6.2. LDP Based Distribution of CE IPv4 Addresses  
      
     [RFC4447] uses Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) transport to 
     exchange PW FECs in the Label Mapping message in the Downstream 
     Unsolicited (DU) mode. The PW FEC comes in two flavors; PWid and 
     Generalized ID FEC elements and has some common fields between 
     them. The discussions below refer to these common fields for IP 
     L2 Interworking encapsulation.   
          
     In addition to PW-FEC, this document defines an IP address list 
     TLV that is to be included in the optional parameter field of 
     the Label Mapping message when advertising the PW FEC for the IP 
     Layer2 Transport. The use of optional parameters in the Label 
     Mapping message to extend the attributes of the PW FEC is 
     specified in the [RFC4447].   
           
     As defined in [RFC4447], when processing a received PW FEC, the 
     PE matches the PW ID and PW type with the locally configured PW 
     ID and PW Type. If there is a match and if the PW Type is IP 
     Layer2 Transport, the PE further checks for the presence of an 
     Address List TLV (as specified in [RFC 3036]) in the optional 
     parameter TLVs. The processing of the address list TLV is as 
     follows. 
      
        o  If a pseudowire is configured for AC with IPv4 CEs only, 
           the PE should advertise address list tlv with address 
           family type to be of IPv4 address. The PE should process 
           the IPv4 address list TLV as described in this document.

        o  If a pseudowire is configured for AC with both IPv4 and 
           IPv6 CEs, the PE should advertise IPv6 capability using 
           the procedures described in Section 7. below.   
        o  If a PE does not receive any address list TLV or IPv6 
           capability advertisement, it MAY assume IPv4 behavior. The 
           address resolution for IPv4 MUST then depend on local 
           manual configuration. 
      
           
     We use the Address List TLV as defined in [RFC 3036] to signal 
     the IPv4 address of the local CE. This IP address list TLV is 
     included in the optional parameter field of the Label Mapping 
     message. 
      
     The Address List TLV is only used for IPv4 addresses.  
      
              
     Encoding of the IP Address List TLV is:   
      
     0                   1                   2                   3

          that encodes the address contained in the Address field.   
                
     IP Address of CE   
          IPv4 address of the CE attached to the advertising PE.  The

          Family (which may be of value zero).

     The IP address field is set to all zeroes to denote that 
     advertising PE has not learned the IPv4 address of its local CE. 
     Any non-zero value of the IP address field denotes the IPv4 
     address of advertising PE's attached CE device. 
      
     The IPv4 address of the CE is also supplied in the optional 
     parameters field of the LDP Notification message along with the 
     PW FEC. The LDP Notification message is used to signal any 
     change in the status of the CE's IPv4 address.  
      
     The encoding of the LDP Notification message is as follows.

     The Status TLV status code is set to 0x0000002C "IP address of 
     CE", to indicate that IP Address update follows. Since this 
     notification does not refer to any particular message the 
     Message Id, and Message Type fields are set to 0. [note: Status 
     Code 0x0000002C is pending IANA allocation].  
      
     The PW FEC TLV SHOULD not include the interface parameters as 
     they are ignored in the context of this message. 
        
     7. IPv6 Capability Advertisement 
         
     A 'Stack Capability' Interface Parameter sub-TLV is signaled by 
     the two PEs so that they can agree which stack(s) they should be 
     using. It is assumed by default that the IP PW will always be

     capable of carrying IPv4 packets. Thus this capability sub-TLV 
     is used to indicate if other stacks need to be supported 
     concurrently with IPv4.  
      
     The 'Stack Capability' sub-TLV is part of the interface 
     parameters of the PW FEC. The proposed format for the Stack 
     Capability interface parameter sub-TLV is as follows: 
      
      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     | Parameter ID  |     Length    |       Stack Capability        | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      
     Parameter ID = 0x16 
      
     Length = 4 
      
     Stack capability = 0x0001 to indicate IPv6 stack capability 
      
     The Value of Stack capability is dependent on the PW type 
     context. For IP PW type, a setting of 0x0001 indicates IPv6 
     stack capability. 
      
     A PE that supports IPv6 on an IP PW MUST signal the stack 
     capability sub-TLV in the initial label mapping message for the 
     PW. The PE nodes compare the value advertised by the remote PE 
     with the local configuration and only use a capability which is 
     advertised by both.  
      
     The behavior of a PE that does not understand an interface 
     parameter sub-TLV is specified in RFC4447 [RFC4447]. 
      
     In some deployment scenarios, it may be desirable to take a PW 
     operationally down if there is a mismatch of the stack 
     capability between the PEs. In other deployment scenarios, an 
     operator may wish the IP version supported by both PEs to fall-
     back to IPv4 if one of the PEs does not support IPv6. The 
     following procedures MUST be followed for each of these cases.   
       
       
     7.1 PW Operational Down on Stack Capability Mis-Match 
      
       
     If a PE that supports IPv6 and has not yet sent a label mapping, 
     receives an initial label mapping message from the far end PE

     that does not include the 'stack capability' sub-TLV, or one is 
     received but it is set to a reserved value, then the PE 
     supporting this procedure MUST NOT send a label mapping for this 
     PW. 
       
     If a PE that supports IPv6 has already sent an initial label 
     mapping message for the PW, does not receive a 'stack 
     capability' sub-TLV in the label mapping message from the far-
     end PE, or one is received but it is set to a reserved value, 
     the PE supporting this procedure MUST withdraw its PW label with 
     the LDP status code meaning  
     "IP Address type mismatch" (Status Code 0x0000004A).     
       
       
     7.2 Stack Capability Fall-back 
       
     If a PE that supports IPv6 and has not yet sent a label mapping, 
     receives an initial label mapping from the far end PE that does 
     not include the 'stack capability' sub-TLV, or one is received 
     but it is set to a reserved value, then it MAY send a label 
     mapping for this PW but MUST NOT include the stack capability 
     sub-TLV.  
       
     If a PE that supports IPv6 and has already sent a label mapping 
     for the PW with the stack capability sub-TLV, but does not 
     receive a 'stack capability' sub-TLV from the far-end PE in the 
     initial label mapping message, or one is received but it is set 
     to a reserved value, the PE following this procedure MUST send 
     label withdraw for its PW label with the LDP status code meaning 
     "Wrong IP Address type" (Status Code 0x000004B - TBD) followed 
     by a label mapping message that does not include stack 
     capability sub-TLV.  
       
     If a Label Withdraw message with the "Wrong IP Address Type" 
     status code is received by a PE, it SHOULD treat this as a 
     normal Label Withdraw, but MUST NOT respond with a Label 
     release. It MUST continue to wait for the next control message 
     for the PW.

     9.1. Control plane security  
      
     Control plane security pertains to establishing the LDP 
     connection, and to pseudowire signaling and CE IP address 
     distribution over that LDP connection. The LDP connection 
     between two trusted PEs can be achieved by each PE verifying the 
     incoming connection against the configured address of the peer 
     and authenticating the LDP messages using MD5 authentication. 
     Pseudowire signaling between two secure LDP peers do not pose 
     security issue but mis-wiring could occur due to configuration 
     error. Some checks, such as, proper pseudowire type and other 
     pseudowire options may prevent mis-wiring due to configuration 
     errors.  
      
     Learning the IP address of the appropriate CE can be a security 
     issue. It is expected that the Attachment Circuit to the local 
     CE will be physically secured. If this is a concern, the PE must 
     be configured with IP and MAC address of the CE when connected 
     with Ethernet or IP and virtual circuit information (DLCI or 
     VPI/VCI when connected over Frame Relay or ATM and IP address 
     only when connected over PPP). During each ARP/inARP frame 
     processing, the PE must verify the received information against 
     local configuration before forwarding the information to the 
     remote PE to protect against hijacking the connection. 
      
     For IPv6, the preferred means of security is Secure Neighbor 
     Discover (SEND) [RFC3971]. SEND provides a mechanism for 
     securing Neighbor Discovery packets over media (such as wireless 
     links) that may be insecure and open to packet interception and 
     substitution. SEND is based upon cryptographic signatures of 
     Neighbor Discovery packets. These signatures allow the receiving 
     node to detect packet modification and confirm that a received 
     packet originated from the claimed source node. 
     SEND is incompatible with the Neighbor Discovery packet 
     modifications described in this document. As such, SEND cannot 
     be used for Neighbor Discovery across an ARP Mediation 
     pseudowire. PEs taking part in IPv6 ARP Mediation must remove 
     all SEND packet options from Neighbor Discovery packets before 
     forwarding into the pseudowire. If the CE devices are configured 
     to only accept SEND Neighbor Discovery packets, this will lead 
     to Neighbor Discovery failing. Thus, the CE devices must be 
     configured to accept non-SEND packets, even if they treat them 
     with lower priority than SEND packets.

     Because SEND cannot be used in combination with IPv6 ARP 
     Mediation, it is suggested that IPv6 ARP Mediation is only used 
     with secure Attachment Circuits. 
          
     9.2. Data plane security  
      
     The data traffic between CE and PE is not encrypted and it is 
     possible that in an insecure environment, a malicious user may 
     tap into the CE to PE connection and generate traffic using the 
     spoofed destination MAC address on the Ethernet Attachment 
     Circuit. In order to avoid such hijacking, local PE may verify 
     the source MAC address of the received frame against the MAC 
     address of the admitted connection. The frame is forwarded to PW 
     only when authenticity is verified. When spoofing is detected, 
     PE must sever the connection with the local CE, tear down the PW 
     and start over.

     APPENDIX A:  
      
     A.1. Use of IGPs with IP L2 Interworking L2VPNs   
      
     In an IP L2 interworking L2VPN, when an IGP on a CE connected to 
     a broadcast link is cross-connected with an IGP on a CE 
     connected to a point-to-point link, there are routing protocol 
     related issues that must be addressed. The link state routing 
     protocols are cognizant of the underlying link characteristics 
     and behave accordingly when establishing neighbor adjacencies, 
     representing the network topology, and passing protocol packets.  
         
     A.1.1. OSPF   
      
     The OSPF protocol treats a broadcast link type with a special 
     procedure that engages in neighbor discovery to elect a 
     designated and a backup designated router (DR and BDR 
     respectively) with which each other router on the link forms 
     adjacencies. However, these procedures are neither applicable 
     nor understood by OSPF running on a point-to-point link. By 
     cross-connecting two neighbors with disparate link types, an IP 
     L2 interworking L2VPN may experience connectivity issues.  
      
     Additionally, the link type specified in the router LSA will not 
     match for the two cross-connected routers. 
      
     Finally, each OSPF router generates network LSAs when connected 
     to a broadcast link such as Ethernet, receipt of which by an 
     OSPF router which believes itself to be connected to a point-to-
     point link further adds to the confusion.      
      
     Fortunately, the OSPF protocol provides a configuration option 
     (ospfIfType), whereby OSPF will treat the underlying physical 
     broadcast link as a point-to-point link.  
      
     It is strongly recommended that all OSPF protocols on CE devices 
     connected to Ethernet interfaces use this configuration option 
     when attached to a PE that is participating in an IP L2 
     Interworking VPN.       
           
     A.1.2. RIP   
      
     RIP protocol broadcasts RIP advertisements every 30 seconds. If 
     the multicast/broadcast traffic snooping mechanism is used as

     described in section 5.1, the attached PE can learn the local CE 
     router's IP address from the IP header of its advertisements. No 
     special configuration is required for RIP in this type of Layer 
     2 IP Interworking L2VPN. 
        
      
     A.1.3. IS-IS 
         
     The IS-IS protocol does not encapsulate its PDUs in IP, and 
     hence cannot be supported in IP L2 Interworking L2VPNs.
