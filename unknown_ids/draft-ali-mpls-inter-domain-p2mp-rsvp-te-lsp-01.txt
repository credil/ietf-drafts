      address many issues that comes when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in 
      a multi-domain networks. Specifically, one of the issues in 
      multi-domain networks is how to allow computation of a loosely 
      routed P2MP-TE LSP such that it is remerge free. This document 
      provides a framework and required protocol extensions needed for 
      establishing and controlling P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in 
      multi-domain networks.  
       
         This document borrows inter-domain TE terminology from
      [RFC4726], e.g., for the purposes of this document, a domain 
      is considered to be any collection of network elements within 
      a common sphere of address management or path computational 
      responsibility.  Examples of such domains include Interior 
      Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).

      MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
      networks.  
       
        As with all other RSVP controlled LSPs, P2MP LSP state is 
      managed using RSVP messages.  While the use of RSVP messages is 
      mostly similar to their P2P counterpart, P2MP LSP state differs 
      from P2P LSP in a number of ways. E.g., the P2MP LSP must also 
      handle the state "re-merge" problem, see [RFC4875]. The term "re-
      merge" refers to the case of an ingress or transit node that 
      creates a branch of a P2MP LSP, a re-merge branch that intersects 
      the P2MP LSP at another node farther down the tree.  This may 
      occur due to such events as an error in path calculation, an 
      error in manual configuration, or network topology changes during 
      the establishment of the P2MP LSP. Consequently one of the 
      requirements for signaling P2MP LSP is for the Ingress node to 
      compute a P2MP path that is re-merge free. In some deployments, 
      it may also be requires to signal P2MP LSPs that are both remerge 
      and crossover free [RFC4875].  
         
      This requirement becomes more acute to address when P2MP LSP 
      spans multiple domains. For the purposes of this document, a 
      domain is considered to be any collection of network elements 
      within a common sphere of address management or path 
      computational responsibility.  Examples of such domains include 
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems 
      (ASes). This is because in an inter-domain environment, the 
      ingress node may not have topological visibility into other 
      domains to be able to compute and signal a re-merge free P2MP 
      LSP. In an inter-domain environment, signaling for a given 
      (Source-to-Leaf) S2L or a set of S2Ls may contain MPLS Traffic 
      Engineering loosely routed explicit LSPs. A loosely routed 
      explicit LSP path is a path specified as a combination of strict 
      and loose hop(s) that contains at least one loose hop and zero or 
      more strict hop(s). When a border node is presented with a loose 
      ERO (for a given S2L or a subset of S2Ls), it may not have full 
      visibility on the P2MP LSP destinations to be able to expend the 
      ERO such that overall P2MP LSP is remerge free. The issue becomes 
      even more acute when one path message per S2L is used.  
       
      The document propose a simple extension to allow border nodes 
      with just enough information about the P2MP LSP so that they can 
      expand EROs for individual S2Ls such that overall P2MP LSP is 
      remerge free. Specifically, this document proposes a notion of 
      passing a list of addresses to a border node, for all S2Ls of a 
      P2MP LSP that transits from that border node. This list of 
      addresses contains addresses for which the given border node 
      needs to expend the EROs to, for all S2L of the P2MP LSP that 
      transit through the border router. Alternatively, if aggregated 
      signaling is used, path messages for all S2Ls that transit

      through a given domain can be aggregated into a single Path 
      message using signaling option specified in [RFC4875]. In either 
      case, the idea is provide a border node with the knowledge of 
      other IP addresses w.r.t. which the route has to be re-merge 
      free. This enables the border node to expend route for a given 
      P2MP LSP in a re-merge free manner. This also allows a border 
      node to find an overall better P2MP path for the LSP.  
       
      Need for finding an end-to-end path that is remerge free also 
      increases chances for crankbacks during setting up a P2MP LSP 
      from their P2P counterpart. Nonetheless, crankback mechanisms for 
      P2MP LSP are not addressed by [RFC4875]. The document also 
      describes how crankback signaling extensions for MPLS and GMPLS 
      RSVP-TE defined in [RFC4920] applies to setting up P2MP TE LSPs. 

      The solution also does not guarantee optimization of the overall 
      P2MP tree. PCE can be used, instead, to address optimization of 
      the overall P2MP tree [PCE-P2MP-BRPC].

   3. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

      This section describes the signaling extensions required to 
      address the above-mentioned functionality.  

   3.1. Multiple S2L Sub-LSPs in One Path Message  

      When multiple S2Ls are carried in the single Path messages it is 
      RECOMMENDED that P2MP LSP is partitioned in such a way that the 
      Path message to a border node, where ERO expansion is desired, 
      contains all S2Ls of the P2MP LSP that transit through that 
      border router. This enabled border node to get the information 
      about all nodes this border node needs to expend EROs to. Hence, 
      the border node to expend all routes in a re-merged free and a 
      more cost effective manner without any protocol expansion.  

      When multiple S2Ls are carried in the single Path messages but 
      the above mentioned criteria cannot be or is not satisfied, is to 
      be addressed in a later version of the document.  
       
   3.2. Single S2L Sub-LSPs in One Path Message  

      When a Path message contains only one S2L sub-LSP, the following 
      extension MAY be followed to achieve ERO expansion in a remerge 
      free and a more cost effective manner. As specified in [RFC3209],

      loose hops are listed in the ERO object of the RSVP Path message 
      with the L flag of the IPv4 or the IPv6 prefix sub-object set. 
      When ERO in the Path message of a P2MP LSP contains a loose hop, 
      the Path message MAY (optionally) contain a "Related Addresses 
      for Sibling S2L sub-LSP" object for each loose hop specified in 
      the ERO.

      IPv6 address of the border node 
    
         IPv6 address of the target border node, where ERO extension 
      for this and related S2L sub-LSPs of the P2MP LSP is desired. 
      This address MUST match with on of the IPv6 addresses contained 
      in the ERO with L flag.  
       
      IPv6 address from related sibling S2L sub-LSP x  
    
         IPv6 address of a node on another sibling S2L sub-LSP x, which 
      is signaled in a separate Path message but which also require ERO 
      extension at the border node contained in IPv6 address of the 
      border node field. Together this list contains all addresses on a 
      given P2MP LSP to which the border node needs to expend the EROs.  
       
   3.3. Grafting 

      Grafting for an S2L sub-LSP achieved by the Ingress node 
      signaling it with the same P2MP ID and LSP ID, via existing or 
      new border nodes with loose hop expansion. If an existing border 
      node is used along the path, the border node locally finds how 
      ERO expansions for other siblings of the P2MP LSP transiting 
      through this border node is done and expends the route of new S2L 
      such that it's remerge free. 
       
   3.4. Crankback and Path Error 

      If a (border) node is unable to find a route that can supply the 
      required resources or is not remerge free, it can generate 
      crankback or Path Error for a subset of S2L it's not able to 
      expend the Path. For this purpose the (border) node SHOULD try to 
      find a minimum subset of S2L for which crankback or Path Error 
      needs to be generated. This rule applies equally to the case 
      where Multiple S2L Sub-LSPs are signaled using one Path message, 
      as well as to the case where a single S2L Sub-LSPs is signaled 
      using one Path message. More details on crankback signaling 
      extensions for P2MP-TE LSP are to be added in a later version.  
       
   4. Security Considerations 

      Security considerations and requirements from [RFC3209] and 
      [RFC4875] apply equally to this document. Furthermore, there are 
      some additional security considerations that may be induced by 
      the use of "Related Addresses for Sibling S2L sub-LSP" object
