Internet-Draft   Policy for Registering SRTP Transforms    December 2009


1.  Introduction

   It is desirable to extend SRTP and its keying mechanisms to support
   country-specific cryptographic transforms.  This document resolves a
   clash between IETF procedure and existing RFCs.  IETF procedure
   requires that country-specific cryptographic transforms be published
   as Informational-track documents [citation needed], but existing
   documents require extensions to SRTP and extensions to SRTP keying to
   be published as Standards-Track documents.

   The IANA Considerations section of this document resolves this clash
   by allowing Informational-track documents to register new
   cryptographic transforms.


2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this document.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates Section 6 and 12 of [RFC3711] and Section
   10.2.1 of [RFC4568].  New SRTP cryptographic transforms for those
   documents MUST be allocated by IANA using the "IETF Review" policy of
   [RFC5226] using either informational-track or standards-track RFCs.
