          Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata
                     draft-ietf-siprec-metadata-04

Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes the metadata model as
   viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS) and the Recording metadata
   format.

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata           September 2011


1.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document focuses on the Recording metadata
   which describes the communication session.  The document describes a
   metadata model as viewed by Session Recording Server and the
   Recording metadata format, the requirements for which are described
   in [RFC6341] and the architecture for which is described in
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs."


3.  Definitions

   Metadata Model: The Metadata model is a class diagram in Unified
   Modelling Language(UML).  The model is a structure diagram that
   describes the structure of a recording's Metadata by showing the
   classes, their attributes, and the relationships among the classes.
   Each block in the model above represents a class.  The linkages
   between the classes represents the relationships between the classes.
   Object diagrams represents instance diagrams of the class diagram and
   conveys snapshot of metadata.

   Metadata classes: Each block in the model represents a class.  In the
   metadata model each class is represented as a block having the block
   name.  The description of each class also has representation of its
   attributes in a second compartment below the class name.  Each
   instance of a class(namely the object) contributes some information
   to the recording's Metadata.

   Attributes: Attributes represents the attributes listed in each of
   the classes.  The attributes of a class are listed in the second
   compartment below the class name.  Each instance of class conveys
   values for these attributes which adds to the recording's Metadata.

   Linkages: Linkages represents the relationship between the classes in

   the model.  It represents the logical connections betweens classes(or
   objects) in class diagrams/ object diagrams.  The linkages can be
   associations or composition in the Metadata model of this document.
   An association represents a family of links.  Binary associations
   (with two ends) are normally represented as a line, with each end
   connected to a class/object box.  An association can be named, and
   the ends of an association can be adorned with role names, ownership
   indicators, multiplicity, visibility, and other properties.  For
   instance, in the metadata model we have "sends" association between
   participant and media stream classes.The relation composition
   represents owns/holds relationship to show classes contained in
   another class.  For instance, extension data class is contained in
   one of the other class(like stream or participant or any of the other
   in the model).The UML graphical representation of a composition
   relationship is a filled diamond shape on the containing class end of
   the tree of lines that connect contained class(es) to the containing
   class.

   XML element: An XML element represent one XML schema complexType
   element (xs:complexType) of XML schema

   XML attributes: An XML attribute represent one XML schema element
   (xs:element) of XML schema


4.  Metadata Model

   Metadata is the information that describes recorded media and the CS
   to which they relate.  Below diagram shows a model for Metadata as
   viewed by Session Recording Server (SRS).

   The Metadata model is a class diagram in Unified Modelling
   Language(UML).  The model is a structure diagram that describes the
   structure of a recording's Metadata by showing the classes, their
   attributes, and the relationships among the classes.  Each block in
   the model above represents a class.  The linkages between the classes
   represents the relationships which can be associations or
   Composition.  Session Recording Client (SRC) MAY initiate the
   Recording Session.  Here, Recording Session is a completely
   independent from the Communication Session that is being recorded at
   both the SIP dialog level and at the session level.  The metadata

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata           September 2011


   MUST be conveyed from SRC to SRS.

   The model allows the capture of a snapshot of a recording's Metadata
   at a given instant in time.  Metadata changes to reflect changes in
   what is being recorded.  For example, if the call is transferred from
   one participant to another, then the SRC conveys the changes in the
   model ( In this instance change of participant and the properties of
   the new media stream) to the SRS.

   Some of the metadata is not required to be conveyed explicitly from
   the SRC to the SRS, if it can be obtained contextually by the SRS.
   For instance, the timing of RS object changes(like Start / Stop time)
   may not be explicitly conveyed from the SRC to the SRS (The Date
   header in RS dialog SIP message provides the timing, but it is
   optional).  In such cases the time a change occurred may be assumed
   to be the same as the time when notification of the change is
   received by the SRS.  This is not true in cases where SRS requests a
   snapshot of metadata from SRC.


5.  Recording Metadata Format

   This section gives an overview of Recording Metadata Format.  Some
   data from the metadata model is assumed to be made available to the
   SRS through Session Description Protocol (SDP)[RFC4566], and
   therefore this data is not represented in the XML document format
   specified in this document.  SDP attributes describes about different
   media formats like audio, video.  The other metadata attributes like
   participant details are represented in a new Recording specific XML
   document namely application/rs-metadata+xml.  The SDP label attribute
   [RFC4574] provides an identifier by which a metadata XML document can
   refer to a specific media description in the SDP sent from the SRC to
   the SRS.

   The XML document format can be used to represent either the complete
   metadata or a partial update to the metadata.  The latter includes
   only elements that have changed compared to the previously reported
   metadata.

5.1.  XML data format

   Recording Metadata document is an XML document. recording element
   MUST present in all recording metadata XML document. recording acts
   as container for all other elements in this XML document.

   Recording object is a XML document.  It MUST have the XML declaration
   and it SHOULD contain an encoding declaration in the XML declaration,
   e.g., "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>".  If the charset

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata           September 2011


   parameter of the MIME content type declaration is present and it is
   different from the encoding declaration, the charset parameter takes
   precedence.

   Every application conforming to this specification MUST accept the
   UTF-8 character encoding to ensure the minimal interoperability.

   Syntax and semantics error in recording XML document has to be
   informed to the originator using application specific mechanism.

5.1.1.  Namespace

   The namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a
   Uniform Resource Namespace (URN) [RFC2141], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [RFC2648] and extended by [RFC3688].

   The URN is as follows: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:recording

5.1.2.  recording

   recording element MUST contain an xmlns namespace attribute with
   value as urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:recording.  One recording element
   MUST present in the all recording metadata XML document.

   dataMode element shows whether the XML document is complete document
   or partial update.  The default value is complete.


6.  Recording Metadata classes

   This section describes each class of the metadata model, and the
   attributes of each class.  This section also describes how different
   classes are linked and the XML element for each of them.

   Each instance of a Recording Session class (namely the Recording
   Session Object) represents a SIP session created between an SRC and
   SRS for the purpose of recording a Communication Session.

6.1.1.  Attributes

   A Recording Session class has the following attributes:
   o  Start/End Time - Represents the Start/End time of a Recording
      Session object.

6.1.2.  Linkages

   Each instance of Recording Session has:

   o  Zero or more instances of Communication Session Group.  CSG may be
      zero because it is optional metadata object.  Also the allowance
      of zero instances is to accommodate persistent recording, where
      there may be none.
   o  Zero or more instances of Communication Session objects.

6.1.3.  XML element

   Recording Session object is represented by recording XML element.
   That in turn relies on the SIP/SDP session with which the XML
   document is associated to provide some of the attributes of the
   Recording Session element.

   Start and End time value are derivable from Date header(if present in
   SIP message) in RS.  In cases where Date header is not present,
   Start/End time are derivable from the time at which SRS receives the
   notification of SIP message to setup RS / disconnect RS.

    Communication Session (CS)


   One instance of a Communication Session Group class (namely the
   Communication Session Group object) provides association or linking
   of Communication Sessions.

6.2.1.  Attributes

   A CS Group has the following attributes:
   o  Unique-ID - This Unique-ID is to group different CSs that are
      related.  SRC (or SRS) is responsible for ensuring the uniqueness
      of Unique-ID in case multiple SRC interacts with the same SRS.
      The mechanism by which SRC groups the CS is outside the scope of
      SIPREC.
   o  Associate-time - Associate-time for CS-Group shall be calculated
      by SRC as the time when a grouping is formed.  The rules that
      determine how a grouping of different Communication Session
      objects is done by SRC is outside the scope of SIPREC.
   o  Disassociate-time - Disassociate-time for CS-Group shall be
      calculated by SRC as the time when the grouping ends

6.2.2.  Linkages

   The linkages between Communication Session Group class and other
   classes is association.  A communication Session Group is associated
   with RS and CS in the following manner:

   o  There is one or more Recording Session objects per Communication
      Session Group.
   o  Each Communication Session Group object has to be associated with
      one or more RS [Here each RS can be setup by the potentially
      different SRCs]
   o  There is one or more Communication Sessions per CS Group [e.g.
      Consult Transfer]

6.2.3.  XML element

   Group element is an optional element provides the information about
   the communication session group

   Each communication session group (CSG)object is represented using one
   group element.  Each group element has unique URN UUID attribute
   which helps to uniquely identify CSG.

   A Communication Session class and its object in the metadata model
   represents Communication Session and its properties needed as seen by
   SRC.

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata           September 2011


6.3.1.  Attributes

   A communication Session class has the following attributes:

   o  Termination Reason - This represents the reason why a CS was
      terminated.  The communication session MAY contain a Call
      Termination Reason.  This MAY be derived from SIP Reason header of
      CS.
   o  CS Identifier - This attribute is used to uniquely identify a CS.
   o  Start Time - This optional attribute represents CS start time
   o  End Time - This optional attribute represents CS end time

   This document does not specify attributes relating to what should
   happen to a recording of a CS after it has been delivered to the SRS,
   e.g., how long to retain the recording, what access controls to
   apply.  The SRS is assumed to behave in accordance with policy.  The
   ability for the SRC to influence this policy is outside the scope of
   this document.  However if there are implementations where SRC has
   enough information, this could be sent as Extension Data attached to
   CS

6.3.2.  Linkages

   A Communication Session is linked to CS-Group, Participant, Media
   Stream and Recording Session classes using the association
   relationship.  Association between CS and Participant allows:

   o  CS to have atleast two or more participants
   o  Participant is associated with one or more CS's.  This includes
      participants who are not directly part of any CS.  An example of
      such a case is participants in a premixed media stream.  The SRC
      may have knowledge of such Participants, yet not have any
      signaling relationship with them.  This might arise if one
      participant in CS is a conf focus.  To summarize even if SRC does
      not have direct signalling relationships with all participants in
      a CS, it should nevertheless create a Participant object for each
      participant that it knows about
   o  The model also allows participants in CS that are not participants
      in the media.  An example is the identity of a 3pcc controller
      that has initiated a CS to two or more participants of the CS.
      Another example is the identity of a conference focus.  Of course
      a focus is probably in the media, but since it may only be there
      as a mixer, it may not report itself as a participant in any of
      the media streams.

   Association between CS and Media Stream allows:

   o  A CS to have zero or more Streams
   o  A stream can be associated with 1 or more CS.  An example is
      multicast MoH stream which might be associated with many CSs.

   Association between CS and RS allows:

   o  Each instance of RS has Zero or more instances of Communication
      Session objects.
   o  Each CS has to be associated with one more RS [ Here each RS can
      be potentially setup by different SRCs]

6.3.3.  XML element

   Session element provides the information about the communication
   session

   Each communication session(CS) object is represented by one session
   element.  Each session element has unique URN UUID attribute which
   helps to uniquely identify CS.

   Reason element MAY be included to represent the Termination Reason
   attribute. group-ref element MAY exist to indicate the group where
   the mentioned session belongs.

   A Participant class and its objects has information about a device
   that is part of a CS and/or contributes/consumes media stream(s)
   belonging to a CS.

6.4.1.  Attributes

   Participant has attributes like:

   o  AoR list - Has list of AoRs.  An AoR MAY be SIP/SIPS/TEL URI.
      There are cases where a participant can have more than one AoR [
      e.g.  P-Asserted-ID which can have both SIP and TEL URIs]
   o  Name - This attribute represents Participant name(SIP display
      name) or DN number ( in case it is known)
   o  Associate-time - associate-time is calculated by SRC as the time
      it sees a participant is associated to CS
   o  Disassociate-time- Disassociate-time is calculated by SRC as the
      time it see a participant disassociate from a CS.  It is possible
      that a given participant can have multiple associate/disassociate
      times within given communication session.
   o  Capabilities - A participant capabilities as defined in RFC 3840
      [RFC3840] is an optional attribute that includes the capabilities
      of a participant in a CS.  This attribute is an attribute of
      association of participant to CS.  Each participant shall have
      Zero or more capabilities.  A participant may use different
      capabilities depending on the role it plays at a particular
      instance.  IOW if a participants moves across different CSs ( due
      to transfer e.t.c) OR is simultaneously present in different CSs
      its role may be different and hence the capability used.

   NOTE: How to represent capabilities attribute in XML is an open item.

   This document does not specify other attributes relating to
   participant e.g.  Participant Role, Participant type.  An SRC which
   has information of these attributes can indicate the same as part of
   extension data to Participant from SRC to SRS.

6.4.2.  Linkages

   The participant class is linked to MS and CS class using association
   relationship.  The association between participant and Media Stream
   allows:

   o  Participant to receives zero or more media streams
   o  Participant to send zero or more media streams.  (Same participant
      provides multiple streams e.g. audio and video)
   o  Media stream to be received by zero or more participants.  Its
      possible, though perhaps unlikely, that a stream is generated but
      sent only to the SRC and SRS, not to any participant.  E.g.  In

      conferencing where all participants are on hold and the SRC is
      collocated with the focus.  Also a media stream may be received by
      multiple participants (e.g.  Whisper calls, side conversations).
   o  Media stream to be sent by one or more participants (pre-mixed
      streams).

   Example of a case where a participant receives Zero or more streams -
   a Supervisor may have side conversation with Agent, while Agent
   converses with customer.

6.4.3.  XML element

   A participant element represents a Participant object.

   There MUST be atleast 2 participant for any given session. "send" or
   "recv" element in each participant is associating SDP m-lines with
   the participant. send element indicates that participant is sending
   the stream of media with the mentioned media description. recv
   element indicates that participant is receiving the stream and by
   default all participant will receive the stream. recv element has
   relevance in case whisper call scenario wherein few of the
   participant in the session receives the stream and not others.

   Participant MUST have AOR element which contains SIP/SIPS URI to
   identify the participant.  AOR element is SIP/SIPS URI FQDN or IP
   address which represents the user. name is an optional element to
   represent display name.

   Each participant element has unique URN UUID attribute which helps to
   uniquely identify participant and session URN UUID to associate
   participant with specific session element.  URN UUID of participant
   *MUST* used in the scope of CSG and no new URN UUID has to be created
   for the same element (participant, stream) between different CS in
   the same CSG.  In case URN UUID has to be used permanent, careful
   usage of URN UUID to original AoR has to be decided by the
   implementers and it is implementer's choice.

   A Media Stream class (and its objects) has the properties of media as
   seen by SRC and sent to SRS.  Different snapshots of media stream
   object may be sent whenever there is a change in media (e.g. dir
   change like pause/resume and/or codec change and/or participant
   change.).

6.5.1.  Attributes

   A Media Stream class has the the following attributes:

   o  Media Stream Reference - In implementations this can reference to
      m-line
   o  Content - The content of an MS element will be described in terms
      of value from the RFC 4796 [RFC4796] registry.
   o  CSRC - The linkage between the participants to its contributing
      media stream in a mixed RS stream is provided by CSRC attribute.
      Not all SRC may have the capability to determine this and hence
      this is a optional attribute.  Having this info can allow the SRS
      to determine which participants are part(contributors) of
      particular parts of the mixed stream.

   NOTE: How CSRC can be represented in XML is still an open item.  CSRC
   attribute is an attribute of media stream to participant association.
   Another open items if there is a need for multiple CSRCs.  A
   participant may have multiple CSRCs - potentially a different one for
   each stream in which it participates.

   The metadata model should include media streams that are not being
   delivered to the SRS.  Examples include cases where SRC offered
   certain media types but SRS chooses to accept only a subset of them
   OR an SRC may not even offer a certain media type due it its
   restrictions to record

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata           September 2011


6.5.2.  Linkages

   A Media Stream is linked to participant and CS classes using the
   association relationship.  The details of association with the
   Participant are described in the Participant class section.  The
   details of association with CS is mentioned in the CS section.

6.5.3.  XML element

   stream element represents a Media Stream object.  Stream element
   indicates SDP media lines associated with the session and
   participants.

   This element indicates the SDP m-line properties like label
   attributes, media mode.  Label attribute is used to link m-line SDP
   body using label attribute in SDP m-line.  The media mode helps in
   understanding whether the media is mixed or not.

   Each stream element has unique URN UUID attribute which helps to
   uniquely identify stream and session URN UUID to associate stream
   with specific session element.

   The content attribute if an SRC wishes to send is conveyed in RS SDP.

6.6.  Extension Data

   A recording metadata object contains additional data not specified as
   part of siprec.  This is intended to accommodate future standards
   track extensions, as well as vendor and user specific extensions.
   The mechanism MUST provide a means of unambiguously distinguishing
   such extension data.

6.6.1.  Linkages

   Extension data class is linked to other classes using the composition
   relationship.  An extension data class ( and its objects) is
   contained/owned by another Metadata class.  Each instance of Metadata
   class(except extension data class itself) has

   o  Zero or more instances of Extension data class
   o  Each Extension data class is contained/owned by a Metadata class
      other than itself

6.6.2.  XML element

   Extensiondata element provides the mechanism by which namespace/
   element MAY be extended with standard or proprietary information.

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata           September 2011


   extensiondata element MUST include any other XML namespace.  Multiple
   namespace MAY exists under extensiondata. extensiondata element exist
   in each level like recording, session, participant, stream to provide
   extensiondata specific to each element. extensiondata element MUST be
   part of parent element for which the additional information is sent
   and hence no Unique ID is needed.

6.7.  associate-time/disassociate-time

   associate-time/disassociate-time contains a string indicating the
   date and time of the status change of this tuple.  The value of this
   element MUST follow the IMPP datetime format [RFC3339].  Timestamps
   that contain 'T' or 'Z' MUST use the capitalized forms.  At a time,
   any of the time tuple associate-time or disassociate-time MAY exist
   in the element namely group, session, participant and not both
   timestamp at the same time.

   As a security measure, the timestamp element SHOULD be included in
   all tuples unless the exact time of the status change cannot be
   determined.

6.8.  Unique ID format

   UUID encoded more densely than the UUID URN (e.g. radix64 of the
   binary uuid form defined in RFC 4122 [RFC4122]) SHOULD be used as a
   format for Unique ID.  How to represent this id in XML is still an
   open item.

9.  Security Considerations

   The metadata information sent from SRC to SRS MAY reveal sensitive
   information about different participants in a session.  For this
   reason, it is RECOMMENDED that a SRC use a strong means for
   authentication and metadata information protection and that it apply
   comprehensive authorization rules when using the metadata format
   defined in this document.  The following sections will discuss each
   of these aspects in more detail.

9.1.  Connection Security

   It is RECOMMENDED that a SRC authenticate SRS using the normal SIP
   authentication mechanisms, such as Digest as defined in Section 22 of
   [RFC3261].  The mechanism used for conveying the metadata information
   MUST ensure integrity and SHOULD ensure confidentially of the
   information.  In order to achieve these, an end-to-end SIP encryption
   mechanism, such as S/MIME described in [RFC3261], SHOULD be used.

   If a strong end-to-end security means (such as above) is not
   available, it is RECOMMENDED that a SRC use mutual hop-by-hop
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication and encryption
   mechanisms described in "SIPS URI Scheme" and "Interdomain Requests"

10.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a new XML namespace, and a new XML
   schema.

10.1.  SIP recording metadata Schema Registration

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:recording

   Registrant Contact: IETF SIPREC working group, Ram mohan
   R(rmohanr@cisco.com)

   XML: the XML schema to be registered is contained in Section 6.

   Its first line is <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> and its last
   line is </xs:schema>

   We wish to thank Joe Hildebrand(Cisco), Peter Saint-Andre(Cisco) for
   the valuable XML related guidance and Martin Thompson for validating
   the XML schema and providing comments on the same.


12.  Appendix A: Metadata Model Object Instances

   This section describes the metadata model object instances for
   different use cases of SIPREC.  For the sake of simplicity as the
   media streams sent by each of the participants is received by every
   other participant in these use cases, it is NOT shown in the object
   instance diagrams below.  Also for the sake of ease not all
   attributes of each object are shown in these instance diagrams.

12.1.  Use case 1: Basic Call

   Basic call between two Participants A and B. In this use case each
   participant sends one Media Stream.  For the sake of simplicity

12.3.  Use case 3: Basic call with Transfer

   Basic call between two Participants A and B and with Participant A
   transfer(consult transfer) to Participant C. In this use case each
   participant sends one Media Stream.  After transfer the properties of
   Participant A Media can change.  For the sake of simplicity
   "receives" lines are not shown in this instance diagram.  Media
   Streams sent by each participant is received all other participants
   of that CS.

12.4.  Conference Use Cases

   Depending on who act as SRC and the information that an SRC has there
   can be several ways to model conference use cases.  This section has
   instance diagrams for the following cases:

   o  A CS where one of the participant (which is also SRC) is a user in
      a conference
   o  A CS where one of the participant is focus ( which is also SRC)
   o  A CS where one of the participant is user and the SRC is a
      different entity like B2BUA

   o  A CS where one of the participant is focus and the SRC is a
      different entity like B2BUA

   NOTE: There MAY be other ways to model the same use cases depending
   on what information the SRC has.

12.4.1.  Case 1:

   This is the usecase where there is a CS with one of the participant
   (who is also SRC) as a user in a conference.  For the sake of
   simplicity the receive lines for each of the participant is not
   shown.

   In this example we have two participants A and B who are part of a
   Communication Session(CS).  One of the participants B is part of a
   conference and also acts as SRC.There can be two cases here.  B can
   be a participant of the conference or B can be a focus.  In this
   instance diagram Participant B is a user in a conference.  The SRC
   (Participant B) subscribes to conference event package to get the
   details of other particiants.  Participant B(SRC) sends the same
   through the metadata to SRS.  In this instance diagram the Media
   Stream(mixed stream) sent from Participant B has media streams
   contributed by conference participants (D,E,F and G).  For the sake
   of simplicity the "receives" line is not shown here.  In this example
   the media stream sent by each participant(A or B) of CS is received
   by all other participant(A or B).

12.4.2.  Case 2:

   This is the usecase where there is a CS where one of the participant
   is focus ( which is also SRC).

   In this example we have two participants A and B who are part of a
   Communication Session(CS).  One of the participants (C) is focus of a
   conference and also acts as SRC.  The SRC (Participant C) being the
   Focus of the conference has access to the details of other
   particiants.  SRC (Participant C) sends the same through the metadata
   to SRS.  In this instance diagram the Media Stream(mixed stream) sent
   by C has media streams contributed by conference participants (A, B,
   D and E).  Participants A, B,D and E sends Media Streams A1, B1, D1
   and E1 respectively.  The media stream sent by Participant C(Focus)
   is received by all other participants of CS.  For the sake of
   simplicity the "receives" line is not shown linked to all other
   participants.

   NOTE: SRC ( Participant C) can send mixed stream or seperate streams
   to SRS

12.4.3.  Case 3:

   A CS where one of the participant is user and the SRC is a different
   entity like B2BUA.  In this case the SRC may not know that one of the
   user is part of conference.  Hence the instance diagram will not have
   information about the conference participants.

12.4.4.  Case 4:

   A CS where one of the participant is focus and the SRC is a different
   entity like B2BUA.  In this case the participant which is focus sends
   "isfocus" in SIP message to SRC.  The SRC subscribe to conference
   event package on seeing this "isfocus".  SRC learns the details of
   other participants of conference from the conference package and send
   the same in metadata to SRS.  The instance diagram for this use case
   is same as Case 1.

13.  Appendix B: Metadata XML schema Instances

   This section describes the metadata model XML instances for different
   use cases of SIPREC.  For the sake of simplicity the complete SIP
   messages are NOT shown here.

13.1.  Use case 1: Basic Call

   Basic call between two Participants A(Ram) and B(Partha) who are part
   of one session.  In this use case each participant sends two Media
   Streams.  Media Streams sent by each participant is received all
   other participants of that CS in this use-case.  Below is the initial
   snapshot sent by SRC that has complete metadata.  For the sake of
   completeness even snippets of SDP is shown.  For the sake of
   simplicity these use-cases assume the RS stream is unmixed.

13.3.  Use case 3: Basic Call with transfer

   Basic call between two Participants A and B is connected as in Use-
   case 1.  Transfer is initiated by one of the participants of by other
   entity(3PCC case).  SRC sends a snapshot of the participant changes
   to SRS.  In this instance participant A(Ram) drops out during the
   transfer and Participant C(Paul) joins the session.  There can be two
   cases here, same session continues after transfer or a new session
   (e.g.  REFER based transfer) is created

   Transfer with same session retained - (.e.g.  RE-INVITE based
   transfer).  Participant A drops out and C is added to the same
   session.  No change to session/group element.  C will be new stream
   element which maps to RS SDP using the same labels in this instance.

   Transfer with new session - (.e.g.  REFER based transfer).  In this
   case new session is part of same grouping (done by SRC).

   SRC may send an optional snapshot indicating stop for the old
   session.
