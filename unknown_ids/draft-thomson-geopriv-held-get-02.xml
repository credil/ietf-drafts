    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how an HTTP GET request to an HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) resource is handled by the server responsible for that resource.  This ensures that requests generated by user agents that are unaware of the special status of a URI do not result in unhelpful responses and enables the use of HTTP GET for location configuration and dereference.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol</xref> prohibits the use of the HTTP GET method.  It does this because a HELD request is not always <xref target="RFC2616">safe and idempotent</xref>, an attribute necessary for use of GET.
      </t>

      <t>The behaviour that is expected when a client makes an HTTP GET request to the a HELD URI is therefore undefined.  GET is the method assumed by generic user agents, therefore unless context identifies an <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> URI as a HELD URI, such a user agent might simply send an HTTP GET.
      </t>

      <t>Rather than providing an HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) response indicating that POST is the only permitted method, this document describes a way for a LIS to provide a HELD location response if it receives an HTTP GET request.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>. </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="lo" title="HTTP GET Behaviour">
      <t>A HELD URI is an <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">http:</spanx> URI that is either the product of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery">LIS discovery</xref> or a location URI generated by a LIS <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-deref-protocol"/>.
      </t>

      <figure>
        <preamble>An HTTP GET request to a HELD URI produces a HELD response as if the following HELD request had been sent using HTTP POST:
        </preamble>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
  <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
    <locationType exact="false">
      geodetic civic
    </locationType>
  </locationRequest>
]]></artwork>
      </figure>


      <t>If the URI is a location URI, this request complies with the limited profile of HELD described in <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-deref-protocol"/>.  However, a location URI MUST NOT be provided in response to a location dereferencing request.
      </t>

      <t>HTTP GET requests must be safe and idempotent - that is, there are no side-effects of making the request and repeating the request does not change the result.  If the response provides a location object, this does not pose a problem.  Changes in the location information do not occur as a result of requests, they are a result of a change in the value of the resource (the resource being the location of the Target).
      </t>

      <t>To ensure that these requests are idempotent, a LIS MUST NOT generate a location URI as a result of serving a GET request.  However, if a location URI for the target already exists, it MAY be provided.  This approach only works as long as the location URI operates on the "authorization by possession" authorization model (<xref target="RFC5808"/>).
