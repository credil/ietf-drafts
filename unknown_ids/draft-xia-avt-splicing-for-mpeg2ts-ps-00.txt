        Splicing for MPEG2-TS Problem Statement in RTP Sessions
                draft-xia-avt-splicing-for-mpeg2ts-ps-00

Abstract

   The base splicing related protocols, i.e., Digital Program Insertion
   Splicing API [SCTE30] and Digital Program Insertion Cueing Message
   for Cable [SCTE35], only take into account how to insert the content
   (e.g. spot advertisements of various lengths, program substitution,
   public service announcements etc.) into any MPEG-2 Output Multiplex
   in the Splicer and how to carry notification of upcoming Splicing and
   other timing information in the transport stream, but not give enough
   mechanisms to direct underlying transport protocol such as RTP how to
   work compatibly with the spliced MPEG2-TS.  This memo highlights the
   issues of what's the impact on RTP layer when performing splicing
   between the primary channel and the insertion channel.

1.  Introduction

   MPEG2 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS) [MPEG2TS] is an encapsulation
   method and transport that multiplexes digital video and audio
   content, together with ancillary metadata, and produces a
   synchronized multiplexed stream that is tailored for transport over
   packet or cell-oriented networks.  MPEG2-TS are composed of 188 byte
   TS Packets, whose payloads may contain program information as well as
   Packetized Elementary Streams (PES), typically video and audio
   streams.  The RTP payload format for carrying TS packets in an RTP
   stream is specified in [RFC2250].

   With the expansive application of the MPEG2-TS, cable operators will
   need solutions that can efficiently manage and process an increasing
   number of ads.  Solutions that can process and splice hundreds of ads
   in a single device is Digital Program Insertion (DPI) which involve
   the splicing of a single program transport stream and advertisements
   in most cases, into a broadcast program.  The splicer will seamlessly
   insert valuable ads into primary programs.  The details for
   describing splicing configuration defined in [SCTE30] are shown in
   Figure 1.

   [SCTE30] creates a standardized method for communication between
   Server and Splicer for the insertion of content into any MPEG2 output
   multiplex in the Splicer.  Based on the cue message [SCTE35], Server
   and Splicer know when and how long for a insertion channel to splice
   into the specific primary channel.

   However SCET only takes into account the splicing process on
   application layer for MPEG2-TS regardless of the underlying transport
   protocol, such as RTP.  From this viewpoint, this does not cause any
   problem for CATV operators who directly carry MPEG2-TS over cable.
   CATV operators concurrently output the ads MPEG2-TS instead of
   primary program on Splicer and return to the primary program after
   the Avail time.  The whole procedure is processed only within the
   MPEG2-TS layer and without any transport protocol limitation.  But
   IPTV operators who provide IP-based video services have to face the
   issues raised by splicing.

   In IPTV deployments, Splicer not only performs MPEG2-TS splicing but
   also needs to coordinate underlying RTP layer to compatibly with
   MPEG2-TS splicing.  By deeply detecting the timing information
   conveied in MPEG2-TS payload, Splicer can clearly know when to
   perform splicing.  However, during the certain Avail time, the number
   of insertion RTP packets, which are inserted into primary program by
   Splicer, is variable due to the different entropy coding.  In such
   case, if the splicing between Insertion channel and Primary channel
   can not be appropriately handled by Splicer at the beginning and end
   of Avail time, the RTP sequence number gap or overlay between
   Insertion channel and Primary channel maybe result in the RTP
   receiver to request unnecessary retransmission for inexistent packet
   missing or to discard the useful packets due to the reduplicate
   sequence number.  The use cases where the problems exist are briefly
   described in section Section Section 3.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, the terms used have specific meanings.
   Because some of the terms that are defined in SCTE30 and SCTE35 have
   very specific technical meanings, the reader is referred to the
   original source for their definition.  For terms used in this
   document, brief definitions are given below.

   Digital Program Insertion (DPI)

      the digital splicing of MPEG programs into other MPEG programs.

   Avail

      Time space provided to cable operators by cable programming
      services during a program for use by the CATV operator; the time
      is usually sold to local advertisers or used for channel self
      promotion.

   Channel

      Channel is a synonym for a "Service" in DVB terminology, or a
      "Program" in MPEG terminology.

   Primary Channel

      The Primary Multiplex Channel carrying MPEG2-TS.  It is spliced in
      whole or in part by insertion channle.

   Insertion Channel

      The Insertion Multiplex Channel(s) that replace the Primary
      Channel in whole or in part for the duration of a splicing.

   Splicer

      The device that splices the Insertion Channel(s) into the Primary
      Channel(s).  It may receive cue messages [SCTE35].  This device
      also communicates with the Server about when and what to splice.

   Output Channel

      The Channel that is produced at the output of the Splicer

   Server

      The device that originates the Insertion Channel(s) to be spliced
      into the Primary Channel(s).  This device communicates with the
      Splicer about when and what to splice.


3.  Use Cases

   In this section, two use cases are listed to illustrate the issues
   resulting from this imperfect switch on RTP layer.

3.1.  Overlap between Insertion Channel and Primary Channel

   Figure 2 gives the overlay issue at the beginning and end of Avail
   time.

             Figure 2: Overlap at the end of insertion


   1.  Before the splicing, the stream of Output Channel on Splicer is
       from Primary Channel.

   2.  At the beginning of Avail time, The Splicer switches this
       Insertion Channel stream to the Output Channel.  In order to
       achieve seamless switch-over, Splicer needs to coordinate the RTP
       sequence number of Insertion Channel packets with pervious
       Primary Channel packets prior to delivering them to Output
       Channel.  For example, in figure 2, the RTP sequence number of
       last Primary Channel packet is SN15, the new RTP sequence number
       of next insertion packet should be changed to SN16 from SN1.

   3.  At the end of Avail time, The Splicer returns to the Primary
       Channel for direction to the Output Channel.  If the Insertion
       Channel packets delivered through Output channel are more than
       the overridden Primary Channel packets during the Avail time,
       Splicer needs to coordinate the RTP sequence number of Primary
       Channel packets with pervious Insertion Channel packets again at
       this time prior to delivering them to Output Channel.  For
       example, in figure 2, two Primary Channel packets are overridden
       by three Insertion Channel packets during the Avail time, the new

       RTP sequence number of next Primary Channel packet should be
       changed to SN19 from SN18.


3.2.  Gap between Insertion Channel and Primary Channel

       Channel for direction to the Output Channel.  If the Insertion
       Channel packets delivered through Output channel are less than
       the overridden Primary Channel packets during the Avail time,
       Splicer needs to coordinate the RTP sequence number of Primary
       Channel packets with pervious Insertion Channel packets again at
       this time prior to delivering them to Output Channel.  For
       example, in figure 3, three Primary Channel packets are
       overridden by two Insertion Channel packets during the Avail

       time, the new RTP sequence number of next Primary Channel packet
       should be changed to SN18 from SN19.



4.  Potential Approach

   Using a powerful Splicer for splicing is a possibility.  Splicer
   takes off the RTP header of Primary Channel packets and Insertion
   Channel packet when receiving them and performs MPEG2-TS splicing
   specified in [SCTE30], then recomposes RTP packets to carry the
   compound Output Channel MPEG2-TS packets.

   However, Splicer has to decode and encode RTP packets for primary
   program even if no splicing occur.  So the additional overhead is
   introduced on Splicer when Splicer performs unnecessary decoding and
   encoding.  If we assume Splicer to decode and encode only after
   splicing occurs, the rest RTP packets of primary program still need
   to be recomposed even if the splicing is end, i.e., the overhead
   issue still exists.

   Furthermore, a Splicer may serve more than one Primary Channel
   simultaneously, the heavy-laden Splicer may has unpredictable
   overheads when performing splicing.

   Based on the above observations, a more efficient splicing mechanism
   on RTP layer can be justified that would be part of the RTP/RTCP base
   protocol.
