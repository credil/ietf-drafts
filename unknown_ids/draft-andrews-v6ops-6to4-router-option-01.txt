Internet-Draft        6to4 DHCP Relay Router Option             May 2011


1.  Introduction

   Using 6to4 [RFC3056] currently requires manual configuration of the
   relay router or the use of a anycast relay router [RFC3068].  The
   latter has a number of well known issues (add reference).

   This document attempts to address some of those issues by providing a
   method for clients to discover the address of a 6to4 relay router.
   It is expected that the 6to4 relay router will be managed and that it
   will be topologically close to the client thereby reducing some of
   the issues with using public anycast relay routers.

   Additionally not all IPv4 address allocated to clients are suitable
   for use with 6to4.  Whether they be [RFC1918] address, or other
   addresses behind a NAT, or are behind a firewall which blocks 6to4
   encapsulted traffic.  This document provides a method for the DHCP
   server operator to signal that the address being returned is not
   suitable for use with 6to4.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  6to4 Relay Router Option

   The 6to4 DHCP Relay Router Option (6to4RRO) has code TBD and consists
   of a single IPv4 address specifing the IPv4 address of the 6to4 relay
   router.  Setting the relay router address to 0.0.0.0 indicates that
   6to4 will not work for returned lease address.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      TBD      |       4       |          relay router         ~
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
      ~            address            |
      +-------------------------------+

   The presence of a 6to4RRO in a reply MUST NOT be used as a indication
   that the client should use 6to4.  It is only a instruction to client
   of how it should do 6to4 if it is otherwise configured to use 6to4.

3.  CPE Equipment

   CPE equipment SHOULD be configured to request the 6to4RRO option if
   6to4 has been enabled.  If 0.0.0.0 is returned in response to the
   6to4RRO option the CPE SHOULD disable 6to4 and withdraw any
   advertised 6to4 prefixes.


4.  Deployment Senarios

4.1.  Enterprise Deployment

   To prevent accidental 6to4 tunnels a enterprise would set 6to4RRO to
   0.0.0.0.  This is intended to turn off mobile clients that have
   accidently left 6to4 enabled when connecting to the enterpises
   network.

4.2.  ISP Deployment

   ISPs, with a IPv6 connection to the public Internet, would set
   6to4RRO to point to 6to4 relay routers run by the ISP.  This will
   provide their customers with a managed 6to4 routers which are
   topologically close to the client.  If the ISP does not have IPv6
   connectivity it SHOULD NOT set the 6to4RRO option unless it knows the
   addresses it it returning will not work with 6to4.

   If the ISP is returning a IPv4 addresses which will be subject to
   network address translation, regardless of whether they have IPv6
   connectivity or not, it SHOULD set the returned 6to4RRO option to
   0.0.0.0.  This is intended stop clients using IPv4 addresses which
   will not work with 6to4.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a DHCP option code point.


6.  Security Considerations

   A rogue DHCP server advertising this option can cause 6to4 traffic to
   be redirected anywhere in the world.

   Setting the returned address to 0.0.0.0 can be used to deny 6to4
   service when it would otherwise work.
