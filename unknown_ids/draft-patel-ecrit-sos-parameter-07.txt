Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency      October 2009


1.  Introduction

   One way to differentiate a SIP-based emergency call from an ordinary
   call is by the presence of the Service URN as defined in RFC 5031
   [RFC5031] (and used in the IETF emergency services architecture
   described in PhoneBCP[I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]).  The 3GPP IP
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) emergency services architecture,
   illustrated in 3GPP TS 23.167 [3GPP.23.167], specifies that the User
   Equipment (UE) performs emergency registration prior to or during the
   initiation of an emergency call.  The circumstances where such an
   emergency registration is beneficial are listed below:

   - the UE is not registered with its home network;

   - the UE is currently registered but roaming (to ensure that the
   emergency call is handled in the visited network, as required by some
   jurisdictions).

   Emergency registration is possible only when the UE has sufficient
   credentials to register with its home network and can detect that an
   emergency session is initiated.  Unfortunately, marking of the
   emergency registration can not be fulfilled by the use of the Service
   URN.

   In some countries, it is a regulatory requirement that devices be
   able to place emegency calls in circumstances where other calls may
   not be permitted.  When a UAC issues an emergency marked REGISTER
   request it informs the registrar that the contact address and the
   address-of-record being registered are to be used for emergency
   calls, and roaming and barring restrictions should not be applied for
   the registered address-of-record.

   This document concentrates on a use case defined by 3GPP as described
   above.  However, the solution proposed does not preclude other
   systems that require emergency registration to occur prior to placing
   an emergency call.

   This document proposes a way to mark a REGISTER request as an
   emergency registration.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]

Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency      October 2009


3.  Requirements

   Req: Where emergency registration is required prior to placing an
   emergency call, it shall be possible to distinguish emergency
   registration from non-emergency registration.


4.  The "reg-type" URI Parameter

   This section provides an overview of the proposed new URI parameter
   to be used for marking REGISTER requests related to emergency
   services.

   A new URI parameter "reg-type" is defined in this document.  The
   "reg-type" parameter is appended to a URI consistent with RFC 3261
   [RFC3261].  It is proposed that use of this URI parameter is
   restricted to the Contact header included in the REGISTER request
   (and the 2xx response to the REGISTER request) related to an
   emergency call only.

   The "reg-type" URI parameter SHALL take a value of "sos" to indicate
   that the REGISTER request pertains to emergency registration.  The
   "reg-type" URI parameter with value "sos" MUST NOT be considered as a
   replacement for the Service URN for emergency calls originated by a
   UA.

   Other use cases where specific instances of SIP registration need to
   be identified are also possible.  One such case may be by an end-user
   registering their address-of-record with the specific purpose of
   making "test" calls within a network.  Such cases not specific to the
   use case identified in this draft for identifying emergency
   registration are not dealt with in this document.  However the "reg-
   type" URI parameter is extensible to allow other "reg-type" values to
   be defined in the future.

4.1.  REGISTER Request

   In networks where the UA sends a REGISTER request for emergency
   registration prior to placing an emergency call, the "reg-type" URI
   parameter with value "sos" MUST be appended to the URI in the Contact
   header.  This serves as an indication to the registrar that the
   request is for emergency registration.

   Example:

   Contact: "Alice" <sip:alice@example.com;reg-type=sos> ;q=0.7;
   expires=3600

Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency      October 2009


   In the event that more than one Contact header field is included in
   the REGISTER request, only the contact addresses that include the
   "reg-type" URI parameter with value "sos" shall be considered as
   emergency registered contact addresses.

   The "reg-type" URI parameter with value "sos" MUST NOT be included in
   non-REGISTER requests, and MUST NOT be included in REGISTER requests
   that do not pertain to emergency calls.

4.2.  2xx Response to REGISTER Request

   If the registrar receives a REGISTER request that includes the "reg-
   type" URI parameter with value "sos" in the Contact heade field, the
   registrar MUST include the "reg-type" URI parameter with value "sos"
   in the Contact header field in the 200 (OK) response sent by the
   registrar upon successful registration.  The "reg-type" URI parameter
   with value "sos" is appended to the URI included in the Contact
   header, thus indicating to the UA that it needs to include this
   contact address in the Contact header of an INVITE for emergency call
   initiation.

4.3.  Backwards compatibility issues

   The backwards compatibility scenario considered in this document is
   where a legacy registrar does not support the "reg-type" URI
   parameter with value "sos".  In this case, if the registrar receives
   a REGISTER request that includes the "reg-type" URI parameter with
   value "sos" in the Contact header field, the registrar proceeds with
   registration procedures and silently ignores the URI-parameter in
   accordance with RFC 3261[RFC3261].  This ensures the user is
   registered and thus can successfully initiate an emergency call.

   The drawback of proceeding with registration is if the address-of-
   record is for example barred or has roaming restrictions applied,
   then these restrictions will not be lifted and thus registration will
   be unsuccessful.  This can limit the UAC's ability to successfully
   place an emergency call.

   If registration is successful, the 200 (OK) response from a legacy
   registrar is unlikely to include the "reg-type" URI parameter in the
   Contact header field since this registration is treated as a non-
   emergency registration.


5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

Internet-Draft     SOS URI Parameter for SIP Emergency      October 2009


   The "reg-type" URI parameter is a "uri-parameter", as defined by RFC
   3261[RFC3261].

   uri-parameter =/ reg-type-param

   reg-type-param = "reg-type=" ("sos" / genvalue)

   genvalue = 1*(alphanum / "-" / "." )


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new SIP URI parameter, as per the
   registry created by RFC 3969 [RFC3969]

   Parameter Name: reg-type

   Predefined Values: sos

   Reference: [RFCXXXX]

   [NOTE TO IANA: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number of this
   specification.]


7.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the "reg-type" parameter itself does not raise any
   particular security issues.  The semantic described by the "reg-type"
   parameter are meant to be well-known so privacy considerations do not
   apply to the URI parameter.  The main possibility of attack involves
   use of the "reg-type" parameter to bypass the normal procedures in
   order to achieve fraudulent use of services or to bypass security
   procedures.  The usage of this parameter as described in this
   document is purely for the purpose of the REGISTER request and hence
   in presence of user authentication it is ensured that the respective
   user can be held accountable.

   It is RECOMMENDED to log events of misuse of the "reg-type" URI
   parameter with value "sos", for example by including it in a request
   or response not related to an emergency call.
