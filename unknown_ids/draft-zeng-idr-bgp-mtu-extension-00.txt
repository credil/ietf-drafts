         Maximum Transmission Unit Extended Community for BGP-4
                  draft-zeng-idr-bgp-mtu-extension-00

Abstract

   Proper functioning of [RFC1191] path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
   discovery requires that IP routers have knowledge of the MTU for each
   link to which they are connected.  As MPLS progresses, [RFC3988]
   specifies some extensions to LDP in support of LDP LSP MTU discovery.
   For the LSP created using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107], it
   does not have the ability to signal the path MTU to the ingress Label
   Switching Router (LSR).  In the absence of this functionality, the
   MTU for the BGP LSP must be statically configured by network
   operators or by equivalent off-line mechanisms.

   This document defines the MTU Extended Community for BGP in support
   of BGP LSP MTU discovery.

Internet-Draft      MTU Extended Community for BGP-4           July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Proper functioning of [RFC1191] path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
   discovery requires that IP routers have knowledge of the MTU for each
   link to which they are connected.  As MPLS progresses, [RFC3988]
   specifies some extensions to LDP in support of LDP LSP MTU discovery.
   For the LSP created using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107], it
   does not have the ability to signal the path MTU to the ingress Label
   Switching Router (LSR).  Without knowledge of the path MTU of the
   whole BGP LSP, ingress BGP LSRs may transmit packets along that LSP
   which are either too big or too small, thus these packets may be
   silently discarded by LSRs or inefficient transmitted.  In the
   absence of this functionality, the MTU for each BGP LSP must be
   statically configured by network operators or by equivalent off-line
   mechanisms.

   This document defines the MTU Extended Community for BGP in support
   of BGP LSP MTU discovery.


2.  BGP LSP MTU Discovery

2.1.  Definitions

   BGP LSP Path MTU: The Path MTU of the LSP from given BGP LSR to a
   specific prefix.  It is carried as a Extended Community with the BGP
   labeled IPv4 (or IPv6) route.

   BGP LSR Link MTU: If the two BGP LSRs are directly adjacent, the BGP
   LSR Link MTU is the MTU of the interface; If the two BGP LSRs are not
   directly adjacent, the BGP LSR Link MTU is the Path MTU of the
   underlying tunnel.  If there are multiple links between the two BGP
   LSRs, the BGP LSR Link MTU is the minimum of those link MTUs.

2.2.  MTU Extended Community

   BGP LSP Path MTU is carried in the MTU extended community for BGP-4.
   The MTU extended community is an optional transitive attribute.

   The MTU extended community type is to be assigned by IANA.  The first
   four octets of the value field should be reserved, and the MTU value

   is carried in the following two octets of the value field.

2.3.  Signaling

   The MTU is advertised hop-by-hop from BGP egress LSR to BGP ingress
   LSR along an BGP LSP.  The steps are as follows:

   A. If BGP speaker A is originator of the labeled IPv4 (or IPv6)
   route, A sets its BGP LSP Path MTU to the maximal value, advertises
   the labeled IPv4 (or IPv6) route with the MTU Extended Community to
   its BGP Peer (its upstream BGP LSR).

   B. BGP speaker B receives the labeled IPv4 (or IPv6) route with BGP
   LSP Path MTU from its BGP peer.

   a) B SHOULD computes the BGP LSR Link MTU to the Next Hop of the
   received message, then sets its BGP LSP Path MTU to the minimum of
   the received BGP LSP Path MTU and the BGP LSR Link MTU.

   b).  If B distributes the route with the Next Hop attribute
   unchanged, it MUST keep the MTU Extended Community unchanged when
   advertising the message to its upstream BGP LSRs.

   c).  If B would change the Next Hop attribute to itself in the
   subsequent advertisement, it SHOULD set the MTU Extended Community in
   the message with its BGP LSP Path MTU obtained through step (a).


3.  Applicability Considerations

   The BGP MTU Extended Community is applicable to the BGP LSP defined
   in [RFC3107].


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a type and sub-type value for BGP MTU
   extended community.


5.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   in [RFC4271].
