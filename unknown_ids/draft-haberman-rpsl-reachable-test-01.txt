Internet-Draft           RPSL Pingable Attribute                May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The deployment of new IP connectivity typically results in
   intermittent reachability for numerous reasons which are outside the
   scope of this document.  In order to aid in the debugging of these
   persistent problems, this document proposes the creation of a new
   Routing Policy Specification Language object [RFC4012] that allows a
   network to advertise an IP address which is reachable and can be used
   as a target for diagnostic tests (e.g., pings).

   The goal of this diagnostic address is to provide operators a means
   to advertise selected hosts that can be targets of tests for such
   common issues as reachability and Path MTU discovery.

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  RPSL Extension for Diagnostic Address

   Network operators wishing to provide a diagnostic address for its
   peers, customers, etc. can advertise its existence via the Routing
   Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] [RFC2622].  The pingable
   attribute is a member of the route object of the RPSL.  The debug
   attribute has the following characteristics:

   +-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+
   | Attribute |             Value             |          Type         |
   +-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+
   |  pingable |       <ipv6-address> or       |       optional,       |
   |           |         <ipv4-address>        |      multi-valued     |
   |  ping-poc |        <email-address>        |       optional,       |
   |           |                               |      multi-valued     |
   +-----------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+

   The pingable attribute allows a network operator to advertise an IP
   address of a node which should be reachable from outside networks.
   This node can be used as a destination address for diagnostic tests.
   The ping-poc provides an e-mail address of a contact capable of
   responding to queries concerning the specified IP address.  An
   example of using the pingable attribute is shown in Figure 1.

   route: AS64500
   pingable: 2001:DB8::DEAD:BEEF
   ping-poc: nobody@example.com

3.  Using the RPSL Pingable Attribute

   The presence of one or more pingable attributes signals to network
   operators that the maintainer of the referenced network is providing
   the address(es) for external diagnostic testing.  Tests involving the
   advertised address(es) MUST be rate limited to no more than ten
   probes in a five minute window.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None.


5.  Acknowledgements

   Randy Bush and David Farmer provided the original concept for the
   pingable attribute and useful comments on preliminary versions of
   this draft.  Joe Abley provided comments that justified moving the
   attribute to the route object and the inclusion of a point of
   contact.
