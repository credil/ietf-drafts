Internet-Draft              CoAP-Size-Option                    May 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification adds a new option Size to the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP).  The main purpose is to indicate the
   resource size in a Put/Post request, or in a Get response.

1.1.  Justification

   If the requester wants to retrieve large resource data using a Get
   request, it is better to know in advance the size of the resource
   data.  Currently in the Link Format [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]
   specification, the maximum size estimate attribute "sz" is defined to
   give an indication of the estimated maximum size of the resource
   data.  By using this, the requester is able to know whether it is
   capable to accept the resource data.  However it is not possible for
   the requester to know exactly how many blocks will be transmitted,
   therefore, concurrent Get can't be supported.

   Also in the Post/Put request (for example, a firmware update), it is
   not possible for the recipient to know in advance what is the size of
   the data to be transmitted.  According to the current CoAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap] specification, when transmitting large data, the
   recipient will return an error code 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large)
   to the requester when the data size is too big to be accepted by the
   recipient.  In this case the whole transmission has failed, and the
   previous received data will be useless.  This is a waste of
   transmission resources.

   This document adds the new Size Option to provide the capability to
   indicate the accurate size in a Get response or in a Post/Put
   request.

   By using the Size Option in a Get response, the CoAP Server can let
   the requester know the actual size of the resource in advance.  This
   is especially useful for large resources, and can facilitate the
   requester to allocate enough buffer space before transmission.  Also,
   using the block size, the requester can calculate the total number of
   blocks and can use concurrent Get requests to retrieve resource data
   using the Block Option.  Finally, the receipent can check the
   resource size after the data transmission has been completed.

   By using the Size Option in a Put/Post request, the requester can
   indicate the resource size in the first Block Option message, to let
   the recipient know the resource data size in advance.  If the
   recipient is not able to receive the data with the indicated size,
   the recipient can tell the requester in a response code, avoiding the
   cost of the actual data transmission.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Size Option Extension

2.1.  Size Option Definition


           +------+-----+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+
           | Type | C/E | Name  | Data type | Length | Default       |
           +------+-----+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+
           |  12  |  E  | Size  | uint      | 1-4 B  |               |
           +------+-----+-------+-----------+--------+---------------+

2.2.  Using the Size Option

   The Size Option is used to indicate the size of the resource data
   measured in bytes.

   It can be used in a Get response to give indication about the
   resource data size.

   The Get request including Size=0 is treated as a request to get the
   size of the resource representation (but not the resource payload).

   Also it can be used in a Post/Put request in the first Block Option
   message.

   The Size option is not expected to be included for small resources
   that can easily be carried in a single MTU, but SHOULD be included
   for resources larger than that, if the Size information is available.

   In the absence of the option, the size of the resource data is
   calculated after the data transmitted to the recipient, either from
   the CoAP payload length or based on number of blocks and block size.

   If the Size option is specified it SHOULD be accurate at that time,
   and SHOULD NOT be an estimate.

   But due to the dynamic change of the resource data, the Size may not
   be accurate.  If the value of Size option is not the same as the
   actual transmitted data, the recipient MUST take the size of the
   actual transmitted data as accurate, and ignore the Size option.  In
   case that the recipient gets all the data but it is still smaller

Internet-Draft              CoAP-Size-Option                    May 2011


   than the Size, the recipient SHOULD stop the transmission.  If the
   recipient finds out the transmitted data reaches the Size limit, and
   there's more data left, the recipient SHOULD continue to transmit the
   remaining data.

   This option is "Elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.


3.  Interaction with Block option

3.1.  Usage in Post/Put Request

   In the Put/Post request for the large resource data, the requester
   can indicate the size of the resource using the Size option.  If the
   recipient is not capable to receive the data with the indicated size,
   the recipient MUST return a 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large) response
   code to the requester, and the data transmission is avoided, so that
   the cost of the actual data transmission is saved.

3.2.  Usage in Get Response

   In the Get response for the large resource data, the CoAP Server can
   use Size option to indicate the resource size and return the first
   block data.  The requester can calculate the number of blocks to be
   transferred based on the block size and the resource size, and use
   concurrent Get requests to retrieve resource data.


4.  Examples

   This section gives a number of short examples with message flows to
   illustrate the use of Size option in GET response, or in a PUT/POST
   request.

   The first example (Figure 1) shows that the requester does not know
   the resource data size, and sends the Get request, the recipient can
   send back the resource size using the Size option and the first
   block.  In the subsequent Get request, the requester can calculate
   the number of blocks and use concurrent Get requests to retrieve
   resource data.

                         Figure 1: Size Option in a GET response

   The second example (Figure 2) shows that the requester sends a Put
   request with the Size option to indicate the resource data size, the
   recipient determines that the resource data is too large to be
   accepted according to the size information, and sends back a 4.13
   (Request Entity Too Large) response code.

        | CON [MID=1234], Put, /options, 1/0/128, Size: 5000 ----> |

5.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 10
   of the base CoAP specification [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and in section 5
   of the block specification [I-D.ietf-core-block].


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following Option Number entry.
