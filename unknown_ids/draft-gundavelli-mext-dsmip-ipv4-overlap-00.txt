 Overlapping IPv4 Address Assignment Support for Dual-stack Mobile IPv6
            draft-gundavelli-mext-dsmip-ipv4-overlap-00.txt

Abstract

   There are number of deployment scenarios where there is a need for a
   home agent to allocate the same private IPv4 address to multiple
   mobile nodes that it is serving.  A service provider hosting home
   agent service for enterprises, or for supporting some of the IPv6
   transitioning solutions related to IPv4 address exhaust problem, a
   home agent may have to allocate the same private IPv4 address to
   multiple mobile nodes.  The Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 does not have such
   support.  This document specifies extensions to Dual-stack Mobile
   IPv6 for supporting overlapping private IPv4 address assignment
   support.

Internet-Draft      Overlapping IPv4 Address Support        October 2010


1.  Introduction

   IPv4 support for Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] is specified in Dual-stack
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5555].  However, it does not have explicit support
   for allocating IPv4 addresses to the mobile nodes that it is serving.

   There are number deployment scenarios where there is a need for a
   home agent to allocate the same private IPv4 address to multiple
   mobile nodes.  For example, in service provider hosted home agent
   deployment models, two mobile nodes from different enterprises may
   have to assigned IPv4 addresses from the same overlapping address
   space.

   Additionally, the IPv6 transitioning solutions such as Per-Interface
   Bindings [I-D.draft-arkko-dual-stack-extra-lite] and Gateway
   Initiated Dual-stack Lite [I-D.draft-softwire-gateway-init-ds-lite],
   both the solutions require support for overlapping private IPv4
   addressing support.

   This document specifies extensions to Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 for
   supporting overlapping private IPv4 address assignment support.

        Figure 2: Support for Per-Interface Bindings Specification

   Figure 2, illustrates the scenario where an home agent supports Per-
   Interface Bindings solution, specified in
   [I-D.draft-arkko-dual-stack-extra-lite].  In this scenario, the CGN
   is collocated with the home agent, and each the mobile node NAT
   binding entries have the interface identifier of the DSMIPv6 tunnel,
   established between the mobile node and the home agent.  The home
   agent uses the interface identifier for making the packet forwarding
   decision.

          Figure 3: Support for Gateway Initiated Dual-stack Lite

   Figure 3, illustrates the scenario where an home agent has support
   for the IPv6 transitioning solution, Gateway Initiated Dual-stack
   lite solution, specified in
   [I-D.draft-softwire-gateway-init-ds-lite].  In this scenario, there
   is typically a GRE tunnel between the CGN gateway and the home agent.
   Every IPv4 packet tunneled between the CGN and the home agent carries
   a context identifier in the GRE Key header unique to a mobile node,
   which allows the home agent to forward the packet to the correct
   mobile node.

4.  Protocol Considerations


4.1.  Home Agent Considerations

4.1.1.  Extensions to Binding Cache Entry

   To support this feature, the conceptual Binding Cache entry data
   structure maintained by the home agent needs to be extended to
   include the following new parameter.

   o  IPv6-overlap-ctx-id: A 4-byte field used for storing the context
      identifier field.  The home agent uses this value in this field
      for making the forwarding decision.

4.1.2.  Signaling Considerations

   The following considerations MUST be applied by the home agent when
   allocating overlapping private IPv4 address to a mobile node from an
   overlapping IPv4 private address space.

   o  On receiving a Binding Update message [RFC3775] from a mobile node
      with the home address option [RFC5555], the home agent MUST
      process the request as specified in [RFC5555].

   o  If the home agent based on the policy considerations determines
      that the mobile node MUST be assigned an IPv4 address from a non-
      overlapping IPv4 address space, no additional considerations from
      this specification need to be applied.

   o  If the Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC4283] is not present in
      the received Binding Update message, but if the protocol
      configuration variable
      EnableOverlappingIPv4SupportWithRealmUniqueness is set to value of
      (1), the home agent MUST reject the request and send a Binding
      Acknowledgement message with Status field set to
      MISSING_MN_IDENTIFIER_OPTION (160) [RFC5213].

   o  If the Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC4283] is present in the
      received Binding Update message, but if the protocol configuration
      variable EnableOverlappingIPv4SupportWithRealmUniqueness is set to
      value of (1), the home agent MUST assign a private IPv4 address
      from the overlapping address space from the realm associated with
      the mobile node identifier.

   o  If the protocol configuration variable
      EnableOverlappingIPv4Support is set to a value of (1), the home
      agent MUST assign a private IPv4 address from the configured

Internet-Draft      Overlapping IPv4 Address Support        October 2010


      overlapping address space.  This configured overlapping address
      space is not associated with any realm.

   o  When the home agent assigns an IPv4 private address from an
      overlapping address space, the home agent MUST NOT set up an IPv4
      host route over the tunnel to the mobile node, as that IPv4
      address is not uniquely assigned to a single mobile node.  The
      home agent MUST make the forwarding decision based on the context
      identifier that is associated with the received packet and the
      context identifier in the Binding Cache entry.

   o  In deployments where the home agent is supporting hosted home
      agent service model, the context identifier field of the Binding
      Cache entry MUST be set to the identifier of the tunnel
      established between the home agent and the enterprise gateway.
      Any IPv4 packets recieved from the mobile node over the DSMIPv6
      tunnel, after removing the outer header, MUST be forwarded to the
      enterprise to which the mobile node belongs.  The home agent MUST
      use the context identifier field of the mobile node Binding Cache
      entry for performing the correlation.  Similarly, any IPv4 packets
      received for the mobile node from the enterprise gateway, MUST be
      tunneled to the mobile node.

   o  In deployments related to supporting Per-Interface Binding
      Support, where the home agent is collocated with the CGN, the NAT
      binding entries created for that mobile node for any IPv4 flows
      MUST be associated with the tunnel identifier established between
      the home agent and the mobile node.  Considerations from
      [I-D.draft-arkko-dual-stack-extra-lite] MUST be applied for making
      IPv4 packet forwarding decisions.

   o  In deployments related to supporting Gateway Initiated Dual-stack
      lite, considerations from
      [I-D.draft-softwire-gateway-init-ds-lite] MUST be applied with
      respect to IPv4 packet forwarding decisions and on the use of the
      context identifier.

4.2.  Mobile Node Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any new considerations for the
   mobile node implementation.  The IPv4 private address assigned from
   an overlapping address space, when used as the source address in any
   IP sessions will get NAT translated at the CGN and is not exposed to
   the session peers, or any other network elements.

Internet-Draft      Overlapping IPv4 Address Support        October 2010


5.  Protocol Configuration Variables

   A home agent when supporting this specification MUST allow the
   following variables to be configured by the system management.  The
   configured values for these protocol variables MUST survive server
   reboots and service restarts.

   EnableOverlappingIPv4SupportWithRealmUniqueness

      This flag indicates whether or not the home agent should be
      allowed to assign overlapping IPv4 addresses to mobile nodes.
      However, the assigned addresses MUST be unique within a realm
      scope (Ex: @cisco.com).  The default value for this flag is set to
      (0), indicating that the home agent MUST follow the default
      behavior as per [RFC5555] with respect to IPv4 address assignment.

      The value of the flag MUST be set to (0), when the value of the
      flag, EnableOverlappingIPv4Support is set to (1).

   EnableOverlappingIPv4Support

      This flag indicates whether or not the home agent should be
      allowed to assign overlapping IPv4 addresses to mobile nodes.  The
      assigned addresses MAY be overlapping within a realm.  The default
      value for this flag is set to (0), indicating that the home agent
      must follow the default behavior per [RFC5555] with respect to
      IPv4 address assignment.

      The value of the flag MUST be set to (0), when the value of the
      flag, EnableOverlappingIPv4SupportWithRealmUniqueness is set to
      (1).

7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies extensions to Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 for
   supporting overlapping private IPv4 address assignment support.
   These protocol extensions do not introduce any new security
   vulnerabilities for the following reasons:

   Any IPv4 packets sent (or received) by a mobile node using an IPv4
   address from an overlapping IPv4 private address space, or from a
   non-overlapping address space are tunneled between the mobile node
   and the home agent.  These addresses are hidden from the routing
   topology and from on-path network devices and hence will not
   introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
