    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for
      the Diameter Network address and port translation Control Application.
      This Diameter application allows per endpoint control of Network Address
      Translators and Network Address and Port Translators, which are added to
      networks to cope with IPv4-address space completion. This Diameter
      application allows external devices to configure and manage a Network
      Address Translator device - expanding the existing Diameter-based AAA
      and policy control capabilities with a Network Address Translators and
      Network Address and Port Translators control component. These external
      devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network
      Access Server, or can be more centralized control plane devices such as
      AAA-servers. This Diameter application establishes a context to commonly
      identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server, and a Network
      Address Translator and Network Address and Port Translator device. This
      includes, for example, the control of the total number of Network
      Address Translator bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific
      Network Address Translator binding for a particular endpoint. In
      addition, it allows Network Address Translator devices to provide
      information relevant to accounting purposes.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Internet service providers have started to deploy Network Address
      Translators (NATs) and Network Address and Port Translators (NAPTs) in
      their networks to deal with the depletion of available public IPv4
      addresses. This document defines a Diameter application allowing
      providers to control the behavior of these NAT and NAPT devices. The use
      of a Diameter application allows for simple integration into the
      existing Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) environment
      of a provider.</t>

      <t>The Diameter Network address and port translation Control Application
      (DNCA) offers the following capabilities:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Limits or defines the number of NAPT/NAT bindings made available
          to an individual subscriber or end point.</t>

          <t>Supports the allocation of specific NAPT/NAT bindings. Two types
          of specific bindings can be distinguished:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Allocation of a pre-defined NAT binding: Both the internal
              and external IP address and port pair are specified within the
              request. Some deployment cases, such as access to a web-server
              within a user&rsquo;s home network with IP address and port,
              benefit from statically configured bindings.</t>

              <t>Allocation of an external IP address for a given internal IP
              address: The allocated external IP address is reported back to
              the requestor. In some deployment scenarios, the application
              requires immediate knowledge of the allocated binding for a
              given internal IP address but does not control the allocation of
              the external IP address; for example, SIP-proxy server
              deployments.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Defines the external address pool(s) to be used for allocating an
          external IP address: External address pools can either be
          pre-assigned at the NAPT/NAT device, or specified within a request.
          If pre-assigned address pools are used, a request needs to include a
          reference to identify the pool. Otherwise, the request contains a
          description of the IP address pool(s) to be used; for example, a
          list of IP-subnets. Such external address pools can be used to
          select the external IP address in NAPT/NAT bindings for multiple
          subscribers.</t>

          <t>Generates reports and accounting records: Reports established
          bindings for a particular user. The collected information is used by
          accounting systems for statistical purposes.</t>

          <t>Queries and retrieves details about bindings on demand: This
          feature complements the previously mentioned accounting
          functionality (see item 4).</t>

          <t>Identifies a subscriber or endpoint on multiple network devices
          (NAT/NAPT device, the AAA-server, or the Network Access Server
          (NAS)): Endpoint identification is facilitated through a Global
          Endpoint ID. Endpoints are identified through a single or a set of
          classifiers, such as IP address, Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
          identifier, or interface identifier which uniquely identify the
          traffic associated with a particular global endpoint.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document is structured as follows: Section 2 lists terminology,
      while Section 3 provides an introduction to DNCA and its overall
      deployment framework. Sections 4 to 8 cover DNCA specifics, with Section
      4 describing session management, Section 5 the use of the Diameter base
      protocol, Section 6 new commands, Section 7 AVPs used, and Section 8
      accounting aspects. Section 9 presents an AVP occurence table. IANA and
      security considerations are addressed in Sections 10 and 11.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig-NAT-deployment"></xref> depicts the deployment
        scenario when a service provider introduces a NAT-device to increase
        the efficiency of the global IPv4 address pool utilization. The
        objective is to provide the customer with connectivity to the public
        IPv4 Internet. The NAT-device performs network address and port (and
        optionally address family) translation, depending on whether the
        access network uses private IPv4 addresses or public IPv6 addresses,
        to public IPv4 addresses. If the NAT-device would be put in place

      <section title="Diameter NAPT Control Application Overview">
        <t>DNCA runs between two DNCA Diameter peers. One DNCA Diameter peer
        resides within the NAT-device, the other DNCA Diameter peer resides
        within the NAT-Controller. DNCA allows per endpoint control and
        management of NAT within the NAT-device. Based on Diameter, DNCA
        integrates well with the suite of Diameter applications deployed for
        per endpoint authentication, authorization, accounting, and policy
        control in service provider networks.</t>

        <t>DNCA offers:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Request and answer commands to control the allowed number of
            NAT bindings per endpoint , to request the allocation of specific
            bindings for an endpoint, to define the address pool to be used
            for an endpoint.</t>

            <t>Provides per endpoint reporting of the allocated NAT
            bindings.</t>

            <t>Provides unique identification of an endpoint on NAT-device,
            AAA-server and NAS, to simplify correlation of accounting data
            streams.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>DNCA allows controlling the behavior of a NAT-device on a per
        endpoint basis during initial session establishment and at later
        stages by providing an update procedure for already established
        sessions. Using DNCA, per endpoint NAT binding information can be
        retrieved either using accounting mechanisms or through an explicit
        session query to the NAT.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deployment Scenarios For DNCA">
        <t>DNCA can be deployed in different ways. Two common deployment
        scenarios are outlined in <xref
        target="fig-NAT-integrated-deployment"></xref> (&ldquo;integrated
        deployment&rdquo;) and <xref
        target="fig-NAT-autonomous-deployment"></xref> (&ldquo;autonomous
        deployment&rdquo;). The two scenarios differ in which entity fulfills
        the role of the NAT-controller. Within the figures (C) denotes the
        network element performing the role of the NAT-controller.</t>

        <t>The integrated deployment approach hides the existence of the
        NAT-device from external servers, such as the AAA-server. It is suited
        for environments where minimal changes to the existing AAA deployment
        are desired. The NAS and the NAT-device are Diameter peers supporting
        the DNCA. The Diameter peer within the NAS, performing the role of the
        NAT-controller, initiates and manages sessions with the NAT-device,
        exchanges NAT specific configuration information and handles reporting
        and accounting information. The NAS receives reporting and accounting
        information from NAT-device. With this information, the NAS can
        provide a single accounting record for the endpoint. A system
        correlating the accounting information received from NAS and
        NAT-device would not be needed.</t>

        <t>An example network attachment for an integrated NAT deployment can
        be described as follows: An endpoint connects to the network, with the
        NAS being the point of attachment. After successful authentication,
        the NAS receives endpoint related authorization data from the
        AAA-server. A portion of the authorization data applies to per
        endpoint configuration on the NAS itself, another portion describes
        authorization and configuration information for NAT control aimed at
        the NAT-device. The NAS initiates a DNCA session to the NAT-device and
        sends relevant authorization and configuration information for the
        particular endpoint to the NAT-device. This can comprise NAT-bindings,
        which have to be pre-established for the endpoint, or management
        related configuration, such as the maximum number of NAT-bindings
        allowed for the endpoint. The NAT-device sends its per endpoint
        accounting information to the NAS, which aggregates the accounting
        information received from the NAT-device with its local accounting
        information for the endpoint into a single accounting stream towards
        the AAA-server.</t>

        <t>The autonomous deployment approach decouples user management on NAS
        and NAT-device. In the autonomous deployment approach, the AAA-system
        and the NAT-device are the Diameter peers running the DNCA. The
        AAA-system also serves as NAT-controller. It manages the connection to
        the NAT-device, controls the per endpoint configuration, and also
        receives accounting and reporting information from the NAT-device.
        Different from the integrated deployment scenario, the autonomous
        deployment scenario does not &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the existence of the
        NAT-device from the AAA infrastructure. Here two accounting streams
        are received by the AAA-server for one particular endpoint, one from
        the NAS, and one from the NAT-device.</t>

             title="DNCA Session Establishment and Management">
      <t>Note that this section forward references some of the commands and
      AVPs defined for DNCA. Please refer to <xref
      target="sec-dnca-commands"></xref> and <xref
      target="sec-dnca-avps"></xref> for details. DNCA runs between a Diameter
      peer residing in a NAT-controller and a Diameter peer residing in a
      NAT-device. The Diameter peer within the NAT-controller is always the
      control requesting entity: It initiates, updates, or terminates the
      sessions. Sessions are initiated when the NAT-controller learns about a
      new endpoint (i.e., host) that requires a NAT service. This could for
      example be due to the entity hosting the NAT-controller receiving
      authentication, authorization, or accounting requests for or from the
      endpoint. Alternate methods that could trigger session set up include
      local configuration, receipt of a packet from a formerly unknown
      IP-address, etc.</t>

      <section title="Session Establishment">
        <t>The DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-controller establishes a
        session with the DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device to control
        the behavior of the NAT function within the NAT-device. During session
        establishment, the DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-controller passes
        along configuration information to DNCA Diameter peer within the
        NAT-device. The session configuration information comprises the
        maximum number of bindings allowed for the endpoint associated with
        this session, a set of pre-defined NAT bindings to be established for
        this endpoint, or a description of the address pool, that external
        addresses are to be allocated from.</t>

        <t>The DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-controller generates a
        NAT-Control Request (NCR) message to the DNCA Diameter peer within the
        NAT-device with NC-Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST to initiate
        a Diameter NAT control session. On receipt of a NCR the DNCA Diameter
        peer within the NAT-device sets up a new session for the endpoint
        associated with the endpoint classifier(s) contained in the NCR. The
        DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device notifies its DNCA Diameter
        peer within the NAT-controller about successful session setup using a
        NAT-Control Answer (NCA) message with Result-Code set to
        DIAMETER_SUCCESS. <xref target="fig-session-establishment"></xref>
        shows the initial protocol interaction between the two DNCA Diameter
        peers.</t>

        <t>The initial NAT-Control-Request may contain configuration
        information for the session, which specifies the behavior of the
        NAT-device for the session. The configuration information which may be
        included, comprises: <list style="symbols">
            <t>A list of NAT bindings, which should be pre-allocated for the
            session; for example, in case a user requires a fixed external
            IP-address/port pair for one of his applications.</t>

            <t>The maximum number of NAT-bindings allowed for an endpoint.</t>

            <t>A description of the external IP-address pool(s) to be used for
            the session.</t>

            <t>A reference to a predefined binding rule on the NAT-device,
            which is applied to the session. Such a predefined binding rule on
            the NAT-device may contain, for example, the name of the
            IP-address pool that external IP-addresses should be allocated
            from, the maximum number of bindings permitted for the endpoint,
            etc.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In certain cases, the NAT-device may not be able to perform the
        tasks requested within the NCR. These include the following: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>If a DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device receives a NCR
            from a DNCA Diameter peer within a NAT-controller with NC-
            Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST that identifies an already
            existing session; that is, DNCA Diameter peer and endpoint
            identifier match an already existing session, the DNCA Diameter
            peer within the NAT-device returns NCA with Result-Code set to
            SESSION_EXISTS, and provides the Session-Id of the existing
            session in the Duplicate-Session-Id AVP.</t>

            <t>If a DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device receives a NCR
            from a DNCA Diameter peer within a NAT-controller with NC-
            Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST that matches more than one
            of the already existing sessions; that is, DNCA Diameter peer and
            endpoint identifier match already existing sessions, the DNCA
            Diameter peer within the NAT-device returns a NCA with Result-Code
            set to INSUFFICIENT-CLASSIFIERS. In case a DNCA Diameter peer
            receives a NCA that reports Insufficient-Classifiers, it may
            choose to retry establishing a new session using additional or
            more specific classifiers.</t>

            <t>If the NCR contains a binding rule not defined on the
            NAT-device, the DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device returns
            NCA with Result-Code AVP set to UNKNOWN_BINDING_RULE.</t>

            <t>In case the NAT-device is unable to establish all of the
            bindings requested in the NCR, the DNCA Diameter peer will return
            a NCA with Result-Code set to BINDING_FAILURE. A DNCA Diameter
            peer within a NAT-device treats a NCR as an atomic operation;
            hence none of the requested bindings will be established by the
            NAT-device. Either all requested actions within a NCR are
            completed successfully, or the entire request fails.</t>

            <t>If a NAT-device does not have sufficient resources to process a
            request, the DNCA Diameter peer returns a NCA with Result-Code set
            to RESOURCE_FAILURE.</t>

            <t>In case Max-NAT-Binding and NAT-Control-Definition are included
            in the NCR along with a reference to a binding rule; that is, a
            predefined template on NAT-device, and the values in
            Max-NAT-Binding and NAT-Control-Definition contradict those
            specified in the pre-defined binding rule, Max-NAT-Binding and
            NAT-Control-Definition override the values specified in the

            Typically the NAT-device refrains from enforcing the new limit
            immediately; that is, actively remove bindings, but rather
            disallow the establishment of new bindings until the current

            this case the NCR MUST NOT contain a NAT-Control-Definition AVP.
            Each NAT-binding is reported in a NAT-Control-Definition AVP. In
            case the session ID is unknown, the DNCA Diameter peer within the
            NAT-device returns NCA with Result-Code set to
            DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.</t>

            <t>Retrieve session IDs and internal IP address/port pairs for one
            or multiple external IP-address/port pairs: If the DNCA Diameter
            peer within the NAT-controller wishes to retrieve the session
            ID(s) for one or multiple external IP-address/port pairs, it MUST
            include the external IP-address/port pair(s) as part of the
            NAT-Control-Definition AVP of the NCR. The session ID is not
            included in the NCR or the NCA for this type of a query. The DNCA
            Diameter peer within the NAT-device reports the NAT-bindings and
            associated session IDs corresponding to the external
            IP-address/port pairs in a NCA message with Result-Code set to
            DIAMETER_SUCCESS with the same session ID, which was used in NCR.
            In case an external IP-address/port pair has no associated
            existing NAT-binding, the NAT-Control-Definition AVP contained in
            the reply just contains the NAT-External-Address AVP.</t>

        <t>Similar to session initiation, session tear down is always
        initiated by the DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-controller. The

        its peer within the NAT-device upon receiving a trigger signal. The
        source of the trigger signal is outside the scope of this document. In
        response, the DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device sends an
        accounting stop record reporting all bindings and notifies its DNCA
        Diameter peer about successful session termination using a Session
        Terminate Answer (STA) message with Result-Code set to
        DIAMETER_SUCCESS. <xref target="fig-session-terminate"></xref> shows

      <section title="Failure cases of the DNCA Diameter peers">
        <t>This document does not specify the behavior in case NAT-device and
        NAT-controller, or their respective DNCA Diameter peers are out of
        sync. This could happen for example if one of the entities restarts,
        in case of a (temporary) loss of network connectivity etc. The peering
        entities MUST have built-in redundancy support to recover state in
        case of failure.</t>

        <t>Example failure cases include the following:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>NAT-controller and the DNCA Diameter peer within the
            NAT-controller lose state (e.g. due to a restart). In this case,
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>the DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device may receive a
                NCR with NC-Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST that
                matches an existing session of the DNCA Diameter peer within
                the NAT-device. The DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device
                returns a Result-Code that contains Duplicate-Session-Id AVP
                to report the Session-ID of the existing session. The DNCA
                Diameter peer within the NAT-controller may send an explicit
                Session Terminate Request (STR) for the older session, which
                was lost.</t>

                <t>a DNCA Diameter peer may receive accounting records for a
                session that does not exist. The DNCA Diameter peer sends an
                accounting answer with Result-Code set to
                DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID in response. On receiving the
                response, the DNCA Diameter peer clears the session and
                removes the associated session state.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>NAT-device and the DNCA Diameter peer within NAT-device lose
            state. In such a case, the DNCA Diameter peer may receive a NCR
            with NC-Request-Type AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST for a non-existent
            session. The DNCA Diameter peer returns NCA with Result-Code set
            to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.</t>

            <t>The DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-controller is
            unreachable, for example detected by Diameter watchdog, or down
            and accounting requests from the DNCA Diameter peer fail to get a
            response. The mechanism to ensure that a DNCA Diameter peer within
            the NAT-controller no longer has associated state for a session
            which was cleared or removed by the DNCA Diameter peer within the
            NAT-device is beyond the scope of this document.</t>

            <t>The DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-device is unreachable or
            down and NCR requests fail to get a response. Handling of this
            case depends on the actual service offering of the service
            provider. The service provider could for example choose to stop
            offering connectivity service.</t>

    <section title="NAT Control Application Session State Machine">
      <t>This section contains a set of finite state machines, representing
      the life cycle of DNCA session, which MUST be observed by all
      implementations of the DNCA Diameter application. The DNCA Diameter
      peers are stateful and the state machine maintained is similar to the
      stateful Client and Server authorization state machine described in
      <xref target="RFC3588"></xref>. When a session is moved to the Idle
      state, any resources that were allocated for the particular session must
      be released. Any event not listed in the state machines MUST be
      considered as an error condition, and an answer, if applicable, MUST be
      returned to the originator of the message.</t>

      <t>In the state table, the event 'Failure to send NCR' means that the
      DNCA Diameter peer within the NAT-controller is unable to send the NCR
      command to the desired destination. This could be due to the peer being
      down, or due to the peer sending back the transient failure or temporary
      protocol error notification DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY or DIAMETER_LOOP_DETECTED
      in the Result-Code AVP of NCA.</t>

      <t>In the state table "FAILED NCA" means that the DNCA Diameter peer
      within the NAT-device was not able to honor the corresponding NCR. This
      can happen due to any transient and permanent error at the NAT-device or
      its associated DNCA Diameter peer within indicated by the following
      error Result-Code values: RESOURCE_FAILURE, UNKNOWN_BINDING_RULE_NAME,
      BINDING_FAILURE, MAXIMUM_BINDINGS_REACHED_FOR_ENDPOINT, SESSION_EXISTS,
      INSUFFICIENT_CLASSIFIERS.</t>

      <t>The following state machine is observed by a DNCA Diameter peer
      within a NAT-controller. The state machine description uses the term
      "access session" to describe the connectivity service offered to the
      endpoint or host. "Access session" should not be confused with the
      Diameter session ID.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes procedures for controlling NAT related
      attributes and parameters by an entity, which is non-local to the device
      performing NAT. This section discusses security considerations for DNCA
      interactions between the Diameter peers within a NAT-controller and a
      NAT-device. Security between NAT-controller and NAT-device has a number
      of components: authentication, authorization, integrity, and
      confidentiality.</t>

      <t>Authentication refers to confirming the identity of an originator for
      all datagrams received from the originator. Lack of authentication of
      Diameter messages between the Diameter peers can jeopardize the
      fundamental service of the peering network elements. A consequence of
      not authenticating the message sender by the recipient would be that an
      attacker could spoof the identity of a "legitimate" authorizing entity
      in order to change the behavior of the receiver. An attacker could for
      example launch a denial of service attack by setting the maximum number
      of bindings for a session on the NAT-device to zero; provision bindings
      on a NAT-device which include IP-addresses already in use in other parts
      of the network; or request session termination of the Diameter session
      and hamper a user's connectivity. Lack of authentication of a NAT-device
      to a NAT-controller could lead to situations where the NAT-device could
      provide a wrong view of the resources (i.e. NAT-bindings). In addition,
      templates on the NAT-device specifying pre-defined binding rules could
      be configured differently than expected by the NAT-controller. Failing
      of any of the two DNCA Diameter peers to provide the required
      credentials should be subject to logging.</t>

      <t>Authorization refers to whether a particular authorizing entity is
      authorized to signal a network element requests for one or more
      applications, adhering to a certain policy profile. Failing the
      authorization process might indicate a resource theft attempt or failure
      due to administrative and/or credential deficiencies. In either case,
      the network element should take the proper measures to log such
      attempts.</t>

      <t>Integrity is required to ensure that a Diameter message exchanged
      between the Diameter peers has not been maliciously altered by
      intermediate devices. The result of a lack of data integrity enforcement
      in an untrusted environment could be that an impostor will alter the
      messages exchanged between the peers. This could cause a change of
      behavior of the peers, including the potential of a denial of
      service.</t>

      <t>Confidentiality protection of Diameter messages ensures that the
      signaling data is accessible only to the authorized entities. When
      signaling messages between the DNCA Diameter peers traverse untrusted
      networks, lack of confidentiality will allow eavesdropping and traffic
      analysis.</t>

      <t>Diameter offers security mechanisms to deal with the functionality
      demanded above. DNCA makes use of the capabilities offered by Diameter
      and the underlying transport protocols to deliver these requirements
      (see <xref target="sec-diameter-messages"></xref> ). If the DNCA
      communication traverses untrusted networks, it is assumed that messages
      between DNCA Diameter peers are secured using either IPsec or TLS.
      Please refer to <xref target="RFC3588"></xref>, section 13 for details.
      DNCA Diameter peers MAY perform bilateral authentication, authorization
      as well as procedures to ensure integrity and confidentiality of the
      information exchange.</t>

      <t>It is assumed that the DNCA Diameter peers are typically in the same
      domain and have a mutual trust set up. This document does not specify a
      mechanisms for authorization between the DNCA Diameter peers. It is
      assumed that the DNCA Diameter peers are provided with sufficient
      information to make an authorization decision. The information can come
      from various sources, for example the peering devices could store local
      authentication policy, listing the identities of authorized peers.</t>
