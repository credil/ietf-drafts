Abstract

   The Network File System, version 4 (NFSv4) uses a representation of
   identity that allows the use of users and groups from multiple,
   distinct administrative domains, and NFSv4 allows the use of security
   mechanisms that authenticate principals from multiple, distinct
   administrative domains.  This document describes methods by which
   NFSv4 clients and servers can handle principals, users, groups from
   multiple administrative domains.

2.  Introduction

   The NFS Version 4 [RFC3530] protocol enables the construction of a
   distributed file system which can join NFSv4.0 or NFSv4.1
   [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1] servers from multiple administrative
   domains, each potentially using separate name resolution services and
   separate security services, into a common multi-domain name space.

   NFSv4 deals with two kinds of identities: authentication identities
   (referred to here as "principals") and authorization identities
   ("users" and "groups" of users).  NFSv4 supports multiple
   authentication methods, each authenticating an "initiator principal"
   (typically representing a user) to an "acceptor principals" (always
   corresponding to the server).  NFSv4 does not prescribe how to
   represent authorization identities on file systems.  All file access
   decisions constitute "authorization" and are made by servers using
   information about client principals (such as username, group
   memberships, and so on) and file metadata related to authorization,
   such as a file's access control list (ACL).

   Authentication in NFSv4 occurs at the the RPCSEC_GSS [RFC2203] layer
   where GSS-API mechanisms [RFC2743] are used to authenticate users on
   NFSv4 clients to NFSv4 servers, and to provide security services such
   as confidentiality and integrity protection for the protocol's
   messages.  The NFSv4 protocol specifies no particular representation
   for authentication identities as these are entirely GSS-API
   mechanism-specific.

   Authorization for file object access is done at the NFSv4 protocol
   layer (i.e., above the RPCSEC_GSS layer), on the server side, based
   on an authenticated client principal's authorization context and the
   authorization meta-data of the file system objects that the client
   wishes to access.  File authorization meta-data is set and retrieved
   in the NFSv4 RPC [RFC1831] layer, specifically via the object's
   owner, owner_group and acl, dacl and sacl attributes (the last three
   being ACLs).  ACLs are lists of ACL entries (ACEs).  Each ACE has a
   "who" field identifying a subject to whom some permission is granted
   or denied.  The owner and owner_group attributes and the who ACE
   field, all reference users and groups.  On the wire, the protocol
   represents users and groups as strings of characters with this form:
   name@domain, where <name> is a user or group name, and <domain> is a
   the name of an administrative domain, more specifically a DNS
   [RFC1034] domainname.

   NFSv4 server implementations usually do not, and really ought not,
   store authorization identities on disk in the same form as is used on
   the wire.  The reason is that users' and groups' names change all too
   often, while searching for and updating file authorization meta-data

   after a user/group name change is not trivial, particularly in a
   global namespace spanning multiple administrative domains.

   NFSv4 servers therefore must perform two kinds of mappings: a)
   authentication identity to authorization context (a principal's user
   ID, group memberships, etcetera), and on-the-wire authorization
   identity representation to on-disk authorization identity
   representation.  Many aspects of these mappings are entirely
   implementation-specific, but some require name resolution services,
   and in order to interoperate servers must use such services in
   compatible ways.  Many implementations are limited to being able to
   represent users and groups from a single domain.

   In this document we address both of those kind of mappings,
   describing possible implementation strategies, and specifying a name
   service for interoperation in a global namespace
   [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-federated-fs-reqts].

3.  Background

   NFSv4 uses a syntax of the form "name@domain" to represent, on the
   wire, the NFSv4 ACL name for users and groups.  This design provides
   a level of indirection that allows a client and server with different
   internal representations of authorization identity to interoperate
   even when referring to authorization identities from different
   administrative domains.

   Multi-domain capable sites need to meet certain requirements in order
   to ensure that clients and servers can map name@domain to internal
   representations reliably:

   o  name@domain MUST be unique within the DNS domain.

   o  Every local representation of a user and of a group MUST have a
      canonical name@domain, and it must be possible to return the
      canonical name@domain for any identity stored on disk, at least
      when required infrastructure servers (such as name services) are
      online.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1] section 2.2.1.1 "RPC
   Security Flavors":

           NFSv4.1 clients and servers MUST implement RPCSEC_GSS.  (This
           requirement to implement is not a requirement to use.)  Other
           flavors, such as AUTH_NONE, and AUTH_SYS, MAY be implemented
           as well.

   The AUTH_NONE security flavor can be useful to the multi-domain NFSv4
   or federated name space to grant universal access to public data
   without any credentials.

   The AUTH_SYS security flavor uses a host-based authentication model
   where the [weakly-authenticated] client asserts the user's
   authorization identities using small integers as user and group
   identity representations.  Because of the small integer authorization
   ID representation, AUTH_SYS can only be used in a name space where
   all clients and servers share a uidNumber and gidNumber translation
   service.  A shared translation service is required because uidNumbers
   and gidNumbers are passed in the RPC credential; there is no
   negotiation of namespace in AUTH_SYS.  Collisions can occur if
   multiple translation services are used.  These and other issues are
   addressed in [I-D.williams-rpcsecgssv3] which describes a new version
   of RPCSEC_GSS that includes a modernized replacement for AUTH_SYS.

4.  Terminology

      Identity: a way to refer to a user or group.

      Principal: an entity that is authenticated by RPCSEC_GSS (usually,
      but not always, a user; rarely, if ever, a group; sometimes a
      host).

      Authorization context: the set of user and group IDs, privileges,
      labels, and other items relevant to authorization, corresponding
      to a subject (user or principal).

      Domain-local ID: Most installations assign numeric, local
      identifiers to users and groups, using a namespace local to their
      domain.  We call this a domain-local ID.

      Local representation of identity: an item such as a POSIX user
      IDentifier (UID) or group ID (GID), or a Windows Security
      IDentifier (SID), or other such local representation of a user or
      a group of users.

      Global representation of identity: a tuple consisting of a domain
      identifier (possibly the domain's name itself) and a domain-local
      user/group ID.  We do not propose a standard global representation
      of identity, but the concept is useful.

      Group: a security entity representing zero, one or more users and,
      possibly, other groups.  Can appear as the subject of an ACE.

      Domain: a set of users, groups and computers administered by a
      single entity, and identified by a DNS domain name.

      POSIX IDs: small non-negative integers (typically 0..2^31 or
      0..2^32) identifiers.  The namespace of user IDs (UIDs) is
      distinct from the namespace of group IDs (GIDs).

      Windows SIDs: an identifier of security entities, including users
      and groups.  The form of a SID is: S-1-
      <authority><RID_0><RID_1><RID_n> By convention some authority
      numbers denote security entities, identified by RID_n, local to a
      domain identified by RIDs 0..n-1.  Domain RIDs are usually
      generated randomly within a "forest" of domains.

      Name resolution: mapping from {domain, name} to {domain, ID}, and
      vice-versa via lookups.  Can be applied to local or remote
      domains.

5.  Local Representations of Global Identity

   Multi-domain support starts at the fileserver where local ID forms
   need to be able to represent global identities from both, local and
   remote domains.  Local representation of global identity also applies
   to clients, particularly clients with local filesystems.  There's a
   range of local solutions to this multi-domain ID representation
   problem.  In this section we describe several approaches to
   representing a <name>@<local or remote domain> on disk.  None of
   these approaches are REQUIRED; all are INFORMATIVE.  However,
   conventions relating to the use of name services are NORMATIVE.

5.1.  Storing Name@Domainname

   One simple approach to the multiple domain problem is the identity
   function applied to name@domain, with the resultant ID stored on
   disk.

   This approach imposes a severe constraint on the administrators of
   these domains: user and group names must never be reused, as there is
   also no realistic way to keep the name@domain on disk representation
   up to date with user, group or domain renames and removals.  Consider
   a remote domain's NFSv4 servers where real-time employee join/leave
   data may be (typically is!) considered privileged, and remote servers
   may not be sufficiently privileged to access it [elaborate...].

5.2.  Storing Remote-ID@Domainname

   Most installations assign numeric, local identifiers to users and
   groups, using a namespace local to their domain.  We call this a
   domain-local ID.  We can then construct a global identity form
   consisting of a domain ID and a domain-local user/group ID.

   The user or group renaming issue can be addressed by using a global
   identity form where domain-local IDs are required.  I.e., use name
   resolution to lookup name@domain to find the ID local to the domain,
   and join the ID with the result of the identity function applied to
   the domain.  This function still has a renaming problem with respect
   to DNS domain renames, but that is a more realistically manageable
   problem than the user/group renaming problem.

5.2.1.  Storing Remote-ID@Domain-ID

   The DNS domain renaming issue in the previous section can be
   addressed by assigning and publishing a unique ID to each DNS domain.
   I.e., use name resolution to lookup name@domain to find some ID local
   to the domain, lookup the domain ID and store <remote-ID,domain-ID>.

Internet-Draft          NFSv4 Multi-Domain Access         September 2010


5.3.  ID Mapping

   Many file systems exported by NFS only store 32-bit user and group
   IDs which limit their ability to utilize the on disk representation
   described in Section 5.2.  Such systems may need to use an additional
   service to map between <remote user ID, local user IDs> and <remote
   group IDs, local group IDs>.  We call this an "ID mapping service".

   The use of an ID mapping service is not strictly necessary if the
   system operates on IDs large enough and in a known format such that
   <user/group ID, domain ID> can be parsed and encoded into a native
   ID.  However, a large class of operating systems, those which are
   Unix or Unix-like operating systems, such as Solaris and Linux, use
   32-bit UIDs and GIDs in many interfaces and therefore need mapping
   for backwards compatibility reasons.

   One example of such a service is to keep a local or distributed
   database for dynamically assigning a local 32 bit ID to every <ID>@
   <domain-ID>, or one could do that only for remote domains, reserving
   only a small part of the local 32-bit ID namespace for remote
   domains' users/groups.

   The remote ID and remote domain are then used as inputs to a name
   resolution service which contacts the remote domain name service to
   resolve the remote name.

5.4.  Use of Name Services

   File systems often use a distributed directory service for resolving
   domain local 32 bit IDs to users and groups.  The Network Information
   Service [NIS] and the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4511]
   are the two broadly deployed distributed directory service protocols
   used for this purpose.  LDAP is used instead of NIS in environments
   where scalabilty, security and/or extensibility are desired.
   Section 7 expands the LDAP protocol to include mappings between
   principals and local user and group IDs.

   Support for LDAP [RFC4511] with the RFC2307 schema [RFC2307] is
   REQUIRED.

5.4.1.  Using LDAP with RFC2307 Schema

   Name resolution consists of searches with scope 'sub', a base DN
   corresponding to a domain (more on this below) and a filter of either
   of these forms, with matching on objectClass being optional:






Adamson, et al.           Expires April 3, 2011                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          NFSv4 Multi-Domain Access         September 2010


   o  ((objectClass=posixAccount)(uid="<username>))

   o  ((objectClass=posixGroup)(cn="<groupname>))

   o  ((objectClass=posixAccount)(uidNumber="<UID>))

   o  ((objectClass=posixGroup)(gidNumber="<GID>))

   The base DN SHOULD be formatted from a domain's DNS domainname as
   follows.  First format the domainname as a string, then strip the
   trailing dot ('.'), if any, then replace all dots ('.') with ",DC=",
   then prepend "DC=" to the resulting string.  For example,
   foo.bar.example becomes "DC=foo,DC=bar,DC=example".  This convention
   is REQUIRED to be implemented.  Domains with base DNs that do not
   match this convention MAY be used, but their domainname-to-base-DN
   mappings must be published where NFSv4 clients and servers may find
   them; we provide no conventions for publishing such mappings.  We
   RECOMMEND that LDAP referrals be used to publish such mappings (e.g.,
   the client does an LDAP search using "DC=foo,DC=example" as the base
   DN and gets a referral that includes the correct non-standard base DN
   for "foo.example").

   Client and server implementations MUST support the use of LDAP
   referrals to find LDAP servers authoritative for any given base DN.

   For example, to resolve a user named joe@foo.bar.example to a remote
   ID a system would do an LDAP search with DC=foo,DC=bar,DC=example as
   the base DN, scope='sub' and with a filter of
   ((objectClass=posixAccount)(uid="<username>)) looking for the
   uidNumber attribute.

5.4.2.  Using Active Directory LDAP

   [Add text describing searches by which to resolve name@domain to SIDs
   and vice versa.]

5.4.3.  Resolving Domain Names to Domain IDs

   [Add text on mapping domainnames to domain IDs.]

6.  GSS-API Principal-to-Authorization Context

   In order to authorize user access to files, the NFS server must map
   the RPCSEC_GSS client principal name or the underlying GSS-API
   security context to local security information including a local ID,
   a set of local group IDs and other local user privileges.  This
   security information is contained in an "authorization context" (also
   called an "access token" in some systems).

   We define an RPCSEC_GSS authorization context as follows.  The
   authorization context contains domain-local user and group IDs that
   may need to be mapped to local IDs as described in Section 5.3 when
   presented to a remote domain.  The name@domain form is included to
   aid the NFSv4 server in remote domain name service queries.

   RPCSEC_GSS authorization contexts consist of:

   1.  UserID: This field contains the principal's global ID and/or
       local ID mapping thereof, and the name@domain form thereof.

   2.  PrimaryGroupID: This field contains the global ID and/or local ID
       mapping thereof for the principal's primary group, and the
       name@domain form thereof.

   3.  Groups: This field contains an array of group IDs for the groups
       that the user is a member of, in global ID form and/or local ID
       mappings thereof, as well as in name@domain forms.

   4.  As yet unspecified field(s) for privileges and authorizations
       granted to the principal, if any.

   5.  As yet unspecified field(s) for other privilege information such
       as the multi-level security label range/set of the principal.

   6.  Implementation-specific items relevant to authorization.

   The RPCSEC_GSS client principal authorization context determination
   may be mechanism-specific, and even operating system-specific, but
   from the NFS server's point of view, it is a generic facility.

   The RPCSEC_GSS authorization context SHOULD be obtained via a GSS-API
   name attribute [I-D.ietf-kitten-gssapi-naming-exts] or via discrete
   GSS-API name attributes corresponding to the above authorization
   context elements.  URLs for those attributes are TBD.  If the named
   attribute interface is not available, or the attributes are not
   available, other means of determining a principal's authorization
   context SHOULD be used, such as those described in Section 6.1 and
   Section 6.2.

6.1.  Using Credential Authorization Data

   Authorization context information can sometimes be obtained from the
   credentials authenticating a principal; the GSS-API represents such
   information as attributes of the initiator prinicpal's name.  For
   example: Kerberos 5 [RFC4120] has a method for conveying
   "authorization data", both client-asserted as well as KDC-
   authenticated authorization data, and one KDC implementation uses
   this feature to convey a "privilege attribute certificate" (PAC)
   listing the principal's user and group "security identifiers" (SIDs).
   PKIX [RFC5280] certificates allow for extensions that could be used
   similarly.

6.1.1.  Using a PAC

   The Windows operating system uses an authorization context called a
   "PAC" [PAC], which contains a user Security IDentifier (SID) and a
   list of group SIDs.  Some Kerberos Key Distribution Centers (KDCs),
   notably Windows KDCs, issue Kerberos Tickets with PACs as Kerberos
   authorization data.  When a client principal is authenticated using
   such a ticket, the server SHOULD extract the PAC from the client's
   ticket and map, if need be, the SIDs in the PAC to local ID
   representations.

   The authorization context information in a PAC can be considered a
   single, authenticated, discrete GSS-API name attribute, in which case
   the server must parse it into its individual elements.

6.1.2.  RPCSEC_GSS Authorization Context Credential Data

   The RPCSEC_GSS authorization context MUST be authenticated in the
   sense that its contents must come from an authenticated, trusted
   source, such as a directory server or the issuer of the client
   principal's credential.  It makes sense to define a Kerberos
   authorization data payload for the RPCSEC_GSS authorization context.

   [Define an RPCSEC_GSS PAC]

   The authorization context information in an RPCSEC_GSS PAC can be
   considered a single, authenticated, discrete GSS-API name attribute,
   in which case the server must parse it into its individual elements.

6.2.  Mapping Principal Names to Usernames

   If suitable and sufficient authenticated name attributes for the
   client principal are not available, then the server may try to map
   the client principal name to a local notion of user account, and then
   lookup that user account's authorization context information through

   name service lookups.

   One simple method for Kerberos principal-to-username mapping is to
   first apply an algorithmic or table-based Kerberos client principal
   realm name to domain name mapping, then a client principal name to
   username mapping.  Finally, the server can look up the user's
   authorization context using the user's domain's name services.

   A trivial Kerberos realm-name-to-domainname mapping consists of case-
   folding the realm name to lower-case.  [Add notes about
   internationalization.]  Servers SHOULD implement this mapping as an
   option, possibly as a default option.

   A trivial Kerberos principal name to username mapping for 1-component
   principal names, is the identity function.  Servers MUST implement
   this mapping as an option, possibly as a default option.

6.2.1.  Using a Name Service to Map Principal Names to User Accounts

   Name services such as the Solaris gsscred database where the local
   identity is looked up in a database keyed by the GSS exported name
   token, or LDAP with the extension described in Section 7.1, can be
   used to map principal names to user accounts.

6.3.  User Group Membership Determination

   User group membership is easy to determine for users in a system's
   local domain: the operating system will already know how to do that.

   User group membership in remote domain's groups, or for remote users,
   may be determined using LDAP with the RFC2307 schema.  The RFC2307
   schema does not define the values of the 'memberUid' attribute, but
   in practice it seems that those are expected to be the names of users
   as found in the 'uid' attribute of 'posixAccount' entries.  There is
   work in progress to update RFC2307 [I-D.howard-rfc2307bis] to allow
   the use of DNs in the memberUid attribute, which also enables as
   group nesting.  Such use of memberUid should be backwards-compatible,
   since implementations that don't know about that use of memberUid
   should end up ignoring values which are not plain usernames.

   Assuming the ability to store DNs in the memberUid attribute, then,
   group membership determination can be done as follows.  Given a user
   ID whose DN has been determined:

   1.  Search the user's domain for groups that the user is a member of
       in the user's home domain.  Filter out groups that are not local
       to the user's home domain.

   2.  Search the server's domain for groups that the user is a member
       of in the server's home domain.

   3.  Search the server's domain for groups that the user's group
       memberships determined in steps 1 and 2 are members of.

   4.  Continue searching for nested group memberships given the list of
       groups from steps 2 and 3 while being careful to detect or
       prevent loops.

   However, the above procedure has the same user/group name renaming
   issue.  By skipping step 2 we can get down to just a group renaming
   issue.  To fully address the rename issue we need either a new
   attribute or value type for memberUid, storing user/group IDs in some
   global ID representation.

   [Add text defining such a new attribute/value type.]

7.  LDAP Schema Extensions for Multi-Domain NFSv4

7.1.  LDAP Attribute for Principal Name to Local ID Translation

   The gSSPrincipal objectclass allows for the use of the gSSAuthName
   attribute described in the following section.

                        objectclass ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.10.7
                        NAME 'gSSPrincipal'
                        DESC 'GSS Principal Name'
                        SUP  posixAccount
                        MAY ( gSSAuthName ) )

   The gSSAuthName attribute provides a method for the translations
   between a uidNumber and (multiple) GSS-API security principals, used
   as described in Section 6.2.

   The gSSAuthName attribute stores a user's GSS-API principal name in
   exported name token form (see [RFC2743]).

                        attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.10.6
                        NAME ( 'gSSAuthName')
                        DESC 'GSS-API exported principal name
                        exported token'
                        EQUALITY bitStringMatch
                        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.6)

7.2.  LDAP Attributes for ID Mapping

   The remote-domain ID is used as a more stable identifier of a remote
   user than the remote name, which can change with renames.

   The remoteID attribute paired with the uidNumber attribute implements
   the optional ID mapping (Section 5.3) for the small domain-remote ID
   to small domain-local ID case.


                        attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.250.10.8
                        NAME ( 'remoteID')
                        DESC 'An integer uniquely identifying a
                        user in a remote administrative domain'
                        EQUALITY integerMatch
                        SYNTAX 'INTEGER' SINGLE-VALUE)

8.  Name Resolution and LDAP Caching

   As noted in Section 5.2, most local representations require a name
   service to perform ID to name translations.  Implementations are
   REQUIRED to support the use of LDAP as a name service, relying on
   LDAP referrals for federated namespace construction.

   Note that in a topographically widely separated set of domains the
   need to do name service lookups in various domains' name services may
   prove brittle, resulting in non-deterministic server behavior (e.g.,
   sometimes a user can access share, sometimes they cannot; sometimes
   they appear to be members of some group, sometimes they do not).  To
   avoid this, site administrators may wish to maintain local caches of
   remote domains' name services such that LDAP searches for users/
   groups in remote domains can be satisfied locally for some set of key
   attributes (such as naming and ID attributes), with referrals used in
   all other cases.

   Domains in a federated namespace may provide each other with LDAP
   LDIF delta feeds by which to maintain cached LDAP contents up to
   date.The LDAP DN hierarchy described in Section 5.4.1 has the
   advantage of aiding delta feeds from remote domains where each
   domains' information is in it's own DN subtree.

9.  Security Considerations

   Caching of remote domains' LDAP search results persents some security
   considerations.  For example, some attributes' values may not be
   visible unless a user's credentials are used.  Some attributes'
   values may not be intended to be visible to users, but to hosts.
   Caching servers MUST be capable of issuing referrals as needed for
   attributes whose values they may not read.  Some domain federations
   will want to have their domains trust each others' caching servers.

   More considerations to come
