A Usage of Resource Location and Discovery (RELOAD) for Public Switched
                 Telephone Network (PSTN) Verification
                draft-petithuguenin-vipr-reload-usage-01

Abstract

   Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR) is a technique for
   inter-domain SIP federation.  VIPR makes use of the RELOAD protocol
   to store unverified mappings from phone numbers to RELOAD nodes, with
   whom a validation process can be run.  This document defines the
   usage of RELOAD for this purpose.

Internet-Draft              VIPR Reload Usage                  June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document relies heavily on the concepts and terminology defined
   in [VIPR-OVERVIEW] and will not make sense if you have not read that
   document first.  As it defines a usage for RELOAD [P2PSIP-BASE], it
   assumes the reader is also familiar with that specification.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Registering an E.164 number

   To register an E.164 number a VIPR server stores a ViprRegistration
   structure using the fully qualified E.164 based number without any
   non-digit characters but the '+' character as Resource Name.  For
   redundancy purpose, the VIPR server MUST store the same
   ViprRegistration structure two more times by using the same Resource
   Name prepended with the "COPY1" and "COPY2" character string
   respectively.

   The contents of the ViprRegistration structure are as follow:

   enum { reserved(0), node_id(8200), (65535) } ViprRegistrationType;

   struct {
       select (ViprRegistrationType) {
         case node_id:
           NodeId            pvp_provider;

         /* This type can be extended */
       } ViprRegistrationData;

   struct {
       ViprRegistrationType  type;
       uint16                length;
       ViprRegistrationData  data;
   } ViprRegistration;


   The ViprRegistration structure contains the following values:

Internet-Draft              VIPR Reload Usage                  June 2011


   type
      The type of the registration

   length
      The length of the data structure, i.e. not counting the type and
      length fields

   pvp_provider
      The Node-ID of the peer to which an AppAttach request should be
      sent to initiate the PVP protocol


   The Node-ID used in the pvp_provider field and in the key MUST be
   ready to process AppAttach requests for Application-ID TBD at the
   time the registration is done.

   VIPR supports multiple registrations for a single E.164 number by
   using a Dictionary Data Model.  The dictionary key is the
   concatenation of the Node-ID and the VServiceId, resulting in a 24
   bytes long value.  Using the Node-ID of the node performing the store
   segments the keyspace of the dictionary so that no two peers ever
   store using the same key.  Using the VService allows for a single
   VIPR server to service multiple clusters, and to ensure that numbers
   published by one cluster (using one VServiceID) do not clobber or
   step on numbers published by another cluster (using a different
   VServiceID).

   The Store operations are paced into the overlay at a fixed rate.  The
   VIPR server maintains a queue that is filled with store requests.
   The VIPR server services that queue at a fixed, provisioned rate,
   which in stored in a kind configuration variable named <store-rate-
   limit>.


4.  Fetching a registration

   A VIPR server wishing to validate a E.164 number will start 3 Fetch
   transactions using respectivelly the fully qualified E.164 based
   number without any non-digit characters but the '+' character as
   Resource Name, the same Resource Name prepended with the "COPY1"
   character string and finally the same Resource Name prepended with
   the "COPY2" character string.

   The VIPR server will then inspects the elements in the 3 dictionary
   returned and will keep only the registrations that have the same key
   in at least 2 of the 3 dictionary returned.  For each registration
   kept, the VIPR server will fetch the certificates associated with the
   Node-ID in the key using the CERTIFICATE_BY_NODE usage and will

Internet-Draft              VIPR Reload Usage                  June 2011


   verify that the signature of the registration is valid.

   The VIPR server can then send an AppAttach to the Node-ID found in
   the key and registration, using the Application-ID TBD.  After the
   connection is established, the VIPR server can start PVP as specified
   in [VIPR-PVP].


5.  VIPR-REGISTRATION Kind Definition

   Name  VIPR-REGISTRATION

   Kind Ids  The Resource Name for the VIPR-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is a
      fully qualified E.164 based number without any non-digit
      characters but the '+' character, prepended by either an empty
      character string, the "COPY1" character string or the "COPY2"
      character string.  The data stored is a ViprRegistration, which
      contains the Node-ID of the peer to which an AppAttach request
      should be sent to initiate the PVP protocol.

   Data Model  The data model for the VIPR Kind-ID is dictionary.  The
      dictionary key is the concatenation of the Node-ID and the
      VServiceId, resulting in a 24 bytes long value.  Using the Node-ID
      of the node performing the store segments the keyspace of the
      dictionary so that no two peers ever store using the same key and
      using the VService allows for a single VIPR server to service
      multiple clusters, and to ensure that numbers published by one
      cluster (using one VServiceID) do not clobber or step on numbers
      published by another cluster (using a different VServiceID).

   Access Control  The VIPR-MATCH policy can only be used with a VIPR-
      REGISTRATION Kind-ID.  In this policy, a given value MUST be
      written (or overwritten) if and only if the Node-ID in the
      pvp_provider field of the ViprRegistration structure is equal to
      the first 16 bytes of the dictionary key and if the same Node-ID
      is the one indicated in the SignerIdentity of the value.

   Quota  This kind MUST use the proportional quota algorithm described
      in [RELOAD-QUOTA] by adding the <max-count-per> element with a
      value of "PEER" to the configuration file.  The <max-count> value,
      which measures the amount of E.164 numbers a particular node can
      store, MUST be adjusted to account for the application-layer
      copies (COPY1 and COPY2).  A VIPR server MUST provide enough Node-
      IDs to store all the E.164 numbers it is responsible for by
      dividing this count by the <max-count> value, itself adjusted by
      an additional 3x factor to make sure that the probability is low
      that a rejection occurs due to imperfect distribution of Resource-
      IDs across the ring.

   [[Open Issue:  need to adjust the multiplier - basically birthday
   problem!]]

   The method for merging data after a partition follows the normal
   RELOAD rules around temporal ordering.


6.  Overlay Configuration Document Extension

   This document extends the overlay configuration document by defining
   a new element in the "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:vipr" namespace.

   The <store-rate-limit> defines the maximum rate in seconds that a
   VIPR server must use to execute Store requests.

   The Compact Relax NG Grammar for this element is:

   namespace vipr = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:vipr"

   kind-parameter &= element vipr:store-rate-limit { xsd:unsignedInt }

   The VIPR-MATCH access control can be implemented with the following
   code (Using the notation in [ACCESS-CONTROL]):


   var equals = function(a, b) {
     if (a.length !== b.length) return false;
     for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
       if (a[i] !== b[i]) return false;

Appendix B.  Release notes

   This section must be removed before publication as an RFC.

B.1.  Modifications between vipr-01 and vipr-00

   o  Moved most of the quota algorithm to a separate I-D named
      draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-proportional-quota.
   o  Removed the text saying that the same DHT can also be used for a
      RELOAD SIP usage, as it contradicts text in overview.  Also the
      quota algorithm does not work with clients, but SIP registration
      uses clients.
   o  Added Terminology section
   o  Converted the TLV value stored to a structure using the syntax
      described in p2psip-base to not be dependent on VAP.  The new
      structure is bit compatible with the old definition.
   o  Changed the dictionary key to be binary based instead of text
      based.
   o  Copied text from VAP explaining that the Store operations are
      queued and that the rate is limited.
   o  Added voting algorithm when fetch returns different results for
      the 3 copies.
   o  Added explanation on how to verify the signatures.
   o  Added text on how to form the PVP connection
   o  Rewrote some of the text so it looks more like a regular RELOAD
      usage.
   o  Removed section 3 "PeerID Shim" now that support for multiple
      Node-ID in certificates in fully integrated in RELOAD base.
   o  Filled IANA section
   o  Added examples of conversion from E.164 number to Resource-ID
   o  Added example code for the VIPR access control

B.2.  Modifications between vipr-00 and dispatch-03

   o  Moved to new Working Group.

B.3.  Modifications between dispatch-03 and dispatch-02

   o  Nits.
   o  Shorter I-Ds references.
   o  Fixed the peerID and VServiceID to be hexadecimal.
   o  Fixed the description of the dictionary entry
   o  Fixed the description of the TLV.
