      <t>
		Remote triggered black hole filtering describes a method of mitigating
        against denial-of-service attacks by selectively discarding traffic
        based on source or destination address. This document explains why a
        unique IPv6 prefix should be formally assigned by IANA for the purpose
        of facilitating IPv6 remote triggered black hole filtering.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	    Remote triggered black hole (RTBH) filtering describes a class of
        methods of blocking IP traffic to or from a specific destination on a
        network. These methods operate by setting the next-hop address of an
        IP packet with a specified source or destination address to be a
        unicast prefix which is wired locally or remotely to a router's
        discard or null interface. Typically, this information is propagated
        throughout an autonomous system using a dynamic routing protocol. By
        deploying RTBH systems across a network, traffic to or from specific
        destinations may be selectively black-holed in a manner which is
        efficient, scalable and straightforward to implement. For IPv4, some
        networks configure RTBH installations using <xref target="RFC1918"/>
        address space or the address blocks reserved for documentation in
        <xref target="RFC5737"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        However RTBH configurations are not documentation, but operationally
        important features of many public-facing production networks.
        Furthermore, <xref target="RFC3849" /> specifies that the IPv6
        documentation prefix should be filtered in both local and public
        contexts. On this basis, it is suggested that both private network
        address blocks and documentation prefixes described in <xref
        target="RFC5737"/> are inappropriate for the purpose of RTBH
        configurations.
      </t>
      <t>
        While it could be argued that there are other addresses and address
        prefixes which could be used for this purpose (e.g. ::/128), or that
        an operator could assign an address block from their own address space
        for this purposes, there is currently no operational clarity on what
        address block would be appropriate or inappropriate to use for this
        purpose. By creating an assigned discard prefix for IPv6, the IETF
        will introduce operational clarity and good practice for
        implementation of IPv6 RTBH configurations.

    </section>

    <section title="A Discard Prefix for IPv6">
      <t>
	    For the purposes of implementing an IPv6 remote triggered black hole
        filter, a unicast address block is required. There are currently no
        IPv6 unicast address blocks which are specifically nominated for the
        purposes of implementing RTBH filters.
	  </t>
      <t>
	    As <xref target="RFC5635" /> describes situations where more than one
        discard address may be used for implementing multiple remote triggered
        black holes, a single assigned prefix is not sufficient to cover all
        likely RTBH filtering situations. Consequently, an address block is
        required.
	  </t>
      <t>
	    The prefix allocated by IANA for the purpose of implementing IPv6
        remote triggered black holes is xxx::/32.
	  </t>
	
    </section>

    <section title="Operational Implications">
      <t>
	    This assignment MAY be carried in a dynamic routing protocol within
        an autonomous system. The assignment SHOULD NOT be announced to third
        party autonomous systems and IPv6 traffic with an destination address
        within this prefix SHOULD NOT be forwarded to third party autonomous
        systems.
	  </t>
      <t>
	    On networks which implement IPv6 remote triggered black holes, some or
        all of this network block MAY be configured with a destination of a
        discard or null interface on any or all IPv6 routers within the
        autonomous system.
	  </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	    IANA is requested to assign a unique /32 unicast address prefix in the
        IPv6 address registry for the purpose of facilitating remote triggered
        black hole configurations.
	  </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
		infrastructure security.
