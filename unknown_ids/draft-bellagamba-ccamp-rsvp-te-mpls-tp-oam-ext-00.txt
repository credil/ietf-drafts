1.  Introduction

   This document defines a method for the configuration of the
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) OAM mechanism through GMPLS
   Control Plane.

   The procedures described are experimental and are intended to be
   possibly updated with other proposed OAM tools and BFD future
   extensions.

   The document intent is both disseminating experimental results
   carried out within Ericsson Research and provide an initial input for
   further Control Plane extension in CCAMP IETF group.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Tremblay, Andras Kern, Attila Takacs and David Jocha.

1.3.  Background

   MPLSTransport Profile (MPLS-TP), describes a profile of MPLS that
   enables operational models typical in transport networks, while
   providing additional OAM, survivability and other maintenance
   functions not currently supported by MPLS.

   [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ] defines the requirements by which the OAM
   functionality of MPLS-TP should abide.  The requirements listed may
   be met by one or more OAM Protocols.

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, as described in [BFD], defines a
   protocol that provides low-overhead, short-duration detection of
   failures in the path between two forwarding engines, including the
   interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible the forwarding
   engines themselves.  BFD can be used to track the liveliness of
   MPLS-TP point-to-point and p2mp connections and detect data plane
   failures.  This version of the draft is focused on unidirectional and
   bidirectional p2p connection.

   There are no OAM mechanisms designated to operate in conjunction with
   MPLS-TP yet.  BFD meets several of the requirements listed so far in
   [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ] and can be a good candidate for Continuity Check in

   MPLS-TP.

   Other proposed OAM tools and BFD future extensions will be possibly
   taken into account in this document during the next releases.

   RSVP-TE control plane [RFC3471] has been chosen to support the
   establishment of MPLS-TP LSPs.


2.  Overview of BFD OAM operation

   BFD is a simple hello protocol that in many respects is similar to
   the detection components of well-known routing protocols.  A pair of
   systems transmit BFD packets periodically over each path between the
   two systems, and if a system stops receiving BFD packets for long
   enough, some component in that particular bidirectional path to the
   neighboring system is assumed to have failed.  Systems may also
   negotiate to not send periodic BFD packets in order to reduce
   overhead.

   A path is only declared to be operational when two-way communication
   has been established between systems, though this does not preclude
   the use of unidirectional links.

   Section 3 in [BFD] states that a separate BFD session is created for
   each communications path and data protocol in use between two
   systems.

   Each system estimates how quickly it can send and receive BFD packets
   in order to come to an agreement with its neighbor about how rapidly
   detection of failure will take place.  These estimates can be
   modified in real time in order to adapt to unusual situations.  This
   design also allows for fast systems on a shared medium with a slow
   system to be able to more rapidly detect failures between the fast
   systems while allowing the slow system to participate to the best of
   its ability.

   The ability of each system to control the BFD packet transmission
   rate in both directions provides a mechanism for congestion control,
   particularly when BFD is used across multiple network hops.


3.  RSVP-TE Extensions

3.1.  Operation overview

   A BFD session may be established for a FEC associated with a MPLS
   LSP.  In case of:



Bellagamba, et al.       Expires January 3, 2010                [Page 4]

   o  PHP

   o  when the egress LSR distributes an explicit null label to the
      penultimate hop router

   o  next-hop label allocation

   the BFD control packet received by the egress LSR does not contain
   sufficient information to associate it with a BFD session.  Hence the
   demultiplexing MUST be done using the remote discriminator field in
   the received BFD control packet.

   The exchange of BFD discriminators for this purpose can be achieved
   with LSP Ping as described in [LSP Ping].  However, LSP Ping presents
   some drawbacks such as high computational complexity and the
   dependency to the IP protocol, as described in [MPLS-TP OAM
   Analysis].  Such dependency should be avoided in a MPLS-TP context,
   since MPLS-TP can not count on IP as forwarding mechanism in the data
   plane.

   Below, we define some simple additions that can be done in GMPLS
   RSVP-TE in order to carry out a BFD session setup at the same time as
   the setup of the LSP related to the BFD session.

   With the terms "ingress LSR" and "egress LSR" we will not refer to
   any direction in the forwarding plane, but only to the LSR triggering
   the LSP setup (ingress LSR) and the one triggering the response to it
   (egress LSR).

   During the LSP signaling, the Control Plane instance in the ingress
   and the egress LSR announces the BFD OAM Configuration TLV (inside
   the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object carried by the Path and Resv message
   respectively), which includes the "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV.
   During the BFD session the ingress LSR will use as "MyDiscriminator"
   the value announced in the "Local Discriminator"(Path message) and as
   "YourDiscriminator" the value received in the "Local Discriminator"
   (Resv message).

   Moreover, in the BFD protocol, the time values used to determine BFD
   packet transmission intervals and the session Detection Time are
   continuously negotiated by the BFD protocol itself, and thus may be
   changed at any time.  The negotiation and time values are independent
   in each direction for each session, as described in [BFD] section
   6.8.2.

   It is introduced the possibility of advertising the initial time
   values, together with the Discriminator values, during the control
   plane session setup.  The Control Plane instance in the ingress LSR

   will advertise its timing requirements in the Path messages.  It will
   be signaled a single value for both directions in asynchronous and
   echo mode.  The egress LSR will acknowledge them or reply with an
   error message.

3.2.  OAM Configuration TLV

   This TLV is specified in [OAM-CONF-FWK] and is used to select which
   OAM technology/method should be used for the LSP.  In this document a
   new OAM Type: BFD OAM is defined.

                        +----------+--------------+
                        | OAM Type | Description  |
                        +----------+--------------+
                        | 0        | Reserved     |
                        | 1        | Ethernet OAM |
                        | 2        | BFD          |
                        | 2-256    | Reserved     |
                        +----------+--------------+

   The receiving node when the BFD OAM Type is requested should look for
     the corresponding technology specific BFD OAM configuration TLV.

3.3.  BFD OAM Configuration TLV

   The BFD OAM Configuration TLV (depicted below) is defined for BFD OAM
   specific configuration parameters.  The BFD OAM Configuration TLV is
   carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object both in Path and Resv messages.
   This new TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries
   sub-TLVs.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type: indicates a new type, the BFD OAM Configuration TLV (4) (IANA
   to define).

   Length: indicates the total length including sub-TLVs.

   Version: identifies the BFD protocol version.  If a node does not
   support a specific BFD version an error must be generated: "OAM
   Problem/Unsupported OAM Version "

   R Flag: Role Flag.  If set, the receiving node is required to act
   with an Active Role as described in [BFD], section 6.1.  When the BFD
   OAM Configuration TLV is carried in the Resv message, the flag it not
   taken into consideration by the receiving node.

3.4.  Local Discriminator Sub-TLV

   The Local Discriminator sub-TLV is depicted below.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type: indicates a new type, the Local Discriminator sub TLV (1) (IANA
   to define).

   Length: indicates the total length of the TLV including padding.

   Local Discriminator: A unique, nonzero discriminator value generated
   by the transmitting system and referring to itself, used to
   demultiplex multiple BFD sessions between the same pair of systems.
   This Discriminator will be signaled both by the ingress LSR and the
   egress LSR in the Path and Resv message respectively.

3.5.  Required TX interval

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type: indicates a new type, the Required TX interval sub TLV (3)
   (IANA to define).

   Length: indicates the total length of the TLV including padding.

   Required Asynchronous TX interval: the interval, in microseconds,
   that the local system would like to have when both transmitting and
   receiving BFD Control packets, less any jitter applied.  The value
   zero is reserved.  If the receiving system can not support this value
   it will return an error.

   Required Echo TX Interval: the minimum interval, in microseconds,
   between received BFD Echo packets that this system is capable of
   supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender as described in
   [BFD], section 6.8.9.  This value is also an indication for the
   receiving system of the minimum interval between transmitted BFD Echo
   packets.  If this value is zero, the transmitting system does not
   support the receipt of BFD Echo packets.  If the receiving system can
   not support this value it will return an error.

   Detect Mult: detection time multiplier.  The transmit interval,
   multiplied by this value, provides the Detection Time for the
   transmitting and receiving system in Asynchronous mode.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies a new BFD OAM Configuration TLV to be carried
   in the OAM Configuration TLV in LSP_ATTRIBUTES and
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects in Path messages.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.
