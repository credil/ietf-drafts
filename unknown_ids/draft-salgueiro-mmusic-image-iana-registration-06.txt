              IANA Registration of the 'image' Media Type
               for the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
           draft-salgueiro-mmusic-image-iana-registration-06

Abstract

   This document describes the usage of the 'image' media type and
   registers it with IANA as a top-level media type for the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP).  This media type is primarily used by SDP
   to negotiate and establish T.38 media streams.

1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   In an earlier version of the SDP specification [RFC2327] packetized
   media types, such as those used with the Real-Time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) [RFC3550], share the namespace with Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions (MIME) media types registry [RFC2048] (i.e.  "MIME
   types").  This is in contrast to the latest version of the SDP
   specification [RFC4566] which requested that an SDP-specific media
   type registry be created and maintained by IANA.  The top-level SDP
   media content types registered by RFC 4566 [RFC4566] are "audio",
   "video", "text", "application", and "message".  A glaring omission
   from this list is the "image" media type.

   The 'image' media type is an existing top-level MIME type and is
   widely used in SDP implementations for setting up T.38 Real-Time
   Facsimile [T38] media streams.  This media type is extensively
   referenced by examples in ITU-T T.38 [T38] and IETF standards like
   RFC 4145 [RFC4145].  The following example shows the media
   description of a T.38 media stream as commonly found in a Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] INVITE; it contains an SDP offer
   for T.38 over both UDPTL and TCP.  For the sake of brevity, only the
   SDP body of the SIP INVITE is displayed in this example.

Internet-Draft       'image' Media Type Registration            May 2011


   The purpose of this document is to register with IANA the 'image'
   media type as a top-level SDP media type.  This ensures seamless
   continuity with documentation that uses the 'image' MIME type and
   also simplifies the usage of previously registered MIME sub-types
   like 'image/t38' [RFC3362] that are used as SDP media descriptors for
   T.38 [T38].

   This document complies with the request of section 8.2.1 of RFC 4566
   [RFC4566] that indicates:

      "The same rules should apply for media names as for top-level
      media content types, and where possible the same name should be
      registered for SDP as for MIME.  For media other than existing
      top-level media content types, a Standards Track RFC MUST be
      produced for a new top-level content type to be registered, and
      the registration MUST provide good justification why no existing
      media name is appropriate."


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers with IANA the 'image' media type in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters registry.  This
   registration contains the REQUIRED information elements outlined in
   the SDP registration procedure defined in Section 8.2.8 of RFC 4566
   [RFC4566].

   (1)  Contact Information:

           Name: Gonzalo Salgueiro
           Email: gsalguei@cisco.com
           Telephone Number: (919) 392-3266

   (2)  Name being registered (as it will appear in SDP): image

   (3)  Long-form name in English: image

   (4)  Type of name ('media', 'proto', 'fmt', 'bwtype', 'nettype', or
        'addrtype'): media

   (5)  Purpose of the registered name:

           The 'image' media type for the Session Description Protocol
           is used to describes a media stream that represents a still
           image.  The media subtype further describes the specific
           format of the image.  Currently, the 'image' media type for
           SDP is used ubiquitously by the SIP control protocol to
           establish T.38 media streams.

   (6)  Specification for the registered name: RFC XXXX [This document]


4.  Security Considerations

   The 'image' media type registered by this document in the SDP
   parameters registry maintained by IANA [SDP-IANA] is primarily for
   use by the offer/answer model of the Session Description Protocol
   [RFC3264] for the negotiation and establishment of T.38 [T38] media
   streams using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  This
   additional SDP media type does not introduce any security
   considerations beyond those detailed in Section 7 of RFC 4566
   [RFC4566].  The security vulnerabilities in T.38 [T38] and its
   associated transport protocols (TCP [RFC0793], UDP [RFC0768], and RTP
   [RFC3550]) are well documented in each of their respective
   specifications.


5.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks go to the chairs of the IETF Multiparty Multimedia Session
   Control (MMUSIC) working group (Miguel A. Garcia and Flemming
   Andreasen) for their guidance, encouragement, and the creation of the
   media type registry.  Special thanks to Miguel A. Garcia for his
   thorough and insightful review of the many revisions of the draft.

   This document has benefited from the discussion and review of the
   MMUSIC working group, especially the detailed and thoughtful comments
   and corrections of Keith Drage, Yasubumi Chimura, and Kevin P.
   Fleming.

   The author would also like to acknowledge the considerable efforts of
   Kevin P. Fleming and the members of the FoIP TG in the SIP Forum that
   contributed to the new revision of the ITU-T T.38 Recommendation that
   prompted the need to register the 'image' media type for SDP.
