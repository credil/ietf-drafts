Internet-Draft    Requirements for BGP Path Validation      January 2011


1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based Origin Validation ([I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate]) provides
   a measure of resilience to accidental mis-origination of prefixes.
   But it provides neither cryptographic assurance (announcements are
   not signed), nor assurance of the AS Path of the announcement.

   This document describes requirements to be placed on a future BGP
   security protocol, herein termed BGPsec, intended to satisfy these
   gaps.

   The threat model assumed here is documented in [RFC4593] and
   [I-D.kent-bgpsec-threats].

   The output of a router applying BGPsec to a received signed
   announcement is either Valid or Unverified.  There are no shades of
   grey.


2.  Recommended Reading

   This document assumes knowledge of the RPKI see [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch],
   the RPKI Repository Structure, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct].

   This document assumes ongoing incremental deployment of ROAs, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format], the RPKI to Router Protocol, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr], and RPKI-based Prefix Validation, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].


3.  General Requirements

   The following are general requirements for a BGPsec protocol:

   3.1   A BGPsec design MUST be able to be incrementally deployed on
         today's Internet.

   3.2   A BGPsec design proposal MUST provide analysis of the
         operational considerations for deployment and particularly of
         incremental deployment, e.g, contiguous islands, non-contiguous
         islands, universal deployment, etc..

   3.3   As cryptographic payloads and loading on routers are likely to
         seriously increase, a BGPsec design may require use of new
         hardware.  It must be possible to build routers that do BGPsec
         with within acceptable (to operators) bounds of cost and
         performance.

   3.4   A BGPsec design need not prevent attacks on data plane traffic.
         It need not assure that the data plane even follows the control
         plane.

   3.5   A BGPsec design MUST resist attacks by an enemy who has access
         to the link layer, per Section 3.1.1.2 of [RFC4593].  In
         particular, such a design must provide mechanisms for
         authentication of all data, including protecting against
         message insertion, deletion, modification, or replay.
         Mechanisms that suffice include TCP sessions authenticated with
         IPsec [RFC4301] or TLS [RFC5246].

   3.6   A BGPsec design MAY make use of a security infrastructure
         (e.g., a PKI) to distribute authenticated data used as input to
         routing decisions.  Such data include information about
         holdings of address space and ASNs, and assertions about
         binding of address space to ASNs.

   3.7   If message signing increases message size, the 4096 byte limit
         on BGP PDU size MAY be removed.

   3.8   It is entirely OPTIONAL to secure AS SETs and prefix
         aggregation.  The long range solution to this is the
         deprecation of AS-SETs, see [I-D.wkumari-deprecate-as-sets].

   3.9   If a BGPsec design uses signed NLRIs, it need NOT handle
         multiple NLRIs in a single UPDATE, given the impossibility of
         splitting a signed message while preserving the signature.

   3.10  A BGPsec design MUST enable each BGPsec speaker to configure
         use of the security mechanism on a per-peer basis.

   3.11  A BGPsec design MUST provide backward compatibility in the
         message formatting, transmission, and processing of routing
         information carried through a mixed security environment.
         Message formatting in a fully secured environment MAY be
         handled in a non-backward compatible manner.

   3.12  A BGPsec design MUST allow local policy to determine the trust
         level for a specific route so that routing preference and
         policy can be applied to its inclusion in the RIB.  Such
         mechanisms MUST conform with [I-D.ietf-sidr-ltamgmt].

   3.13  If a BGPsec design makes use of a security infrastructure, that
         infrastructure SHOULD enable each network operator to select
         the entities it will trust when authenticating data in the
         security infrastructure.  See, for example,
         [I-D.ietf-sidr-ltamgmt].

   3.14  A BGPsec design MUST NOT require operators to reveal
         proprietary data.  This includes peering, customer, and
         provider relationships, an ISP's internal infrastructure, etc.
         Though it is understood that some data are revealed to the
         savvy seeker by BGP, traceroute, etc. today.

   3.15  A BGPsec design document SHOULD note security events that are
         significant enough that they should be logged.  The specific
         data to be logged are an implementation matter.


4.  BGP UPDATE Security Requirements

   The following requirements must be met in the processing of BGP
   UPDATE messages:

   4.1  A BGPsec design MUST enable each recipient of an UPDATE to
        formally validate that the origin AS in the message is
        authorized to originate a route to the prefix(es) in the UPDATE.

   4.2  A BGPsec design MUST enable the recipient of an UPDATE to
        formally determine that the UPDATE has traversed the AS path
        indicated in the UPADTE.  Note that this is more stringent than
        showing that the path is merely not impossible.

   4.3  Replay of BGP UPDATE messages need not be completely prevented,
        but a BGPsec design MUST provide a mechanism to control the
        window of exposure to replay attacks.

   4.4  Contents of the UPDATE message SHOULD be able to be
        authenticated in real-time as the message is processed.

   4.5  The routing information base MAY also be re-authenticated
        periodically or in an event-driven manner, especially in
        response to events such as, for example.  PKI updates.

   4.6  Normal sanity checks of received announcements MUST be done,
        e.g. verification that the first element of the AS_PATH list
        corresponds to the locally configured AS of the peer from which
        an UPDATE was received.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document asks nothing of the IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   The data plane may not follow the control plane.

   Security for subscriber traffic is outside the scope of this
   document, and of BGP security in general.  IETF standards for payload
   data security should be employed.  While adoption of BGP security
   measures may ameliorate some classes of attacks on traffic, these
   measures are not a substitute for use of subscriber-based security.
