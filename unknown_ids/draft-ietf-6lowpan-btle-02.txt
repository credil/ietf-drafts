                       draft-ietf-6lowpan-btle-02

Abstract

   Bluetooth Low Energy is a low power air interface technology defined
   by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (BT SIG).  The standard
   Bluetooth radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile
   phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and many other devices.
   The low power version of Bluetooth is a new specification and enables
   the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors, smart
   meters, appliances, etc.  The low power variant of Bluetooth is
   commonly specified in revision 4.0 of the Bluetooth specifications
   and commonly refered to as Bluetooth 4.0.  This document describes
   how IPv6 is transported over Bluetooth Low Energy using 6LoWPAN
   techniques.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over BT-LE                 August 2011


1.  Introduction

   Bluetooth Low Energy (BT-LE) is a radio technology targeted for
   devices that operate with coin cell batteries or minimalistic power
   sources, which means that low power consumption is essential.  BT-LE
   is an especially attractive technology for the Internet of Things
   applications, such as health monitors, environmental sensing,
   proximity applications and many others.

   Considering the expected explosion in the number of sensors and
   Internet connected devices and things, IPv6 is an ideal protocol due
   to the large address space it provides.  In addition, IPv6 provides
   tools for autoconfiguration,which is particularly suitable for sensor
   network applications and nodes which have very limited processing
   power or a full-fledged operating system.

   [RFC4944] specifies the transmission of IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4.  The
   Bluetooth Low Energy link in many respects has similar
   characteristics to that of IEEE 802.15.4.  Many of the mechanisms
   defined in [RFC4944] can be applied to the transmission of IPv6 on
   Bluetooth Low Energy links.  This document specifies the details of
   IPv6 transmission over Bluetooth Low Energy links.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Bluetooth Low Energy

      Bluetooth Low Energy is a low power air interface technology
      specified by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).  BT-LE is
      specified in Revision 4.0 of the Bluetooth specifications (BT
      4.0).

2.  Bluetooth Low Energy

   BT-LE is designed for transferring small amounts of data (in most
   cases less than 10 bytes) infrequently (e.g. every 500 ms) at modest
   data rates (e.g. 300 kbps) at a very low cost per bit.

   BT-LE is an integral part of the BT 4.0 specification.  Devices such
   as mobile phones, notebooks, tablets and other handheld computing
   devices which will include BT 4.0 chipsets in the near future will
   have the low-energy functionality of Bluetooth.  BT-LE will also be
   included in many different types of accessories that collaborate with
   mobile devices such as phones, tablets and notebook computers.  An
   example of a use case for a BT-LE accessory is a heart rate monitor
   that sends data via the mobile phone to a server on the Internet.

2.1.  Protocol stack

   The lower layer of the BT-LE stack consists of the Physical (PHY) and
   the Link Layer (LL).  The Physical Layer transmits and receives the
   actual packets.  The Link Layer is responsible for providing medium
   access, connection establishment, error control and flow control.
   The upper layer consists of the Logical Link Control and Adaptation
   Protocol (L2CAP), Generic Attribute protocol (GATT) and Generic
   Access Profile (GAP) as shown in Figure 1.  GATT and BT-LE profiles
   together enable the creation of applications in a standardized way
   without using IP.  L2CAP provides multiplexing capability by
   multiplexing the data channels from the above layers.  L2CAP also
   provides fragmentation and reassembly for large data packets.

2.2.  Link layer roles and topology

   BT-LE defines two Link Layer roles: the Master Role and the Slave
   Role.  A device in the Master Role, which is called master, can
   manage multiple simultaneous connections with a number of devices in
   the Slave Role, called slaves.  A slave can only be connected to a
   single master.  Hence, a BT-LE network (i.e. a BT-LE piconet) follows
   a star topology.


                 [BTLE-Slave]-----\                /-----[BTLE-Slave]
                                   \              /
                  [BTLE-Slave]-----/[BTLE-Master]/-----[BTLE-Slave]
                                   /              \
                 [BTLE-Slave]-----/                \-----[BTLE-Slave]



                       Figure 2: BT-LE Star Topology

   A master is assumed to be less constrained than a slave.  Hence,
   master and slave can correspond with 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) and
   host, respectively.

   In BT-LE, communication only takes place between a master and a
   slave.  Hence, in a BT-LE network using IP, a radio hop is equivalent
   to an IP link and vice versa.

2.3.  LE device addressing

   Every LE device is identified by a unique 48 bit Bluetooth Device
   Address (BD_ADDR).  An LE-only device such as a sensor may use a
   public (obtained from IEEE Registration Authority) or a random device
   address (generated internally).  When LE devices are in a connection
   they are addressed by an Access Address, a 32 bit address generated
   at the time of the connection set up.  The access address identifies
   a connection between a slave and a master.

2.4.  LE packets sizes and MTU

   Maximum size of the payload in an LE packet at the baseband is 31
   bytes which means that at the L2CAP layer this equals to 23 octets
   MTU.  For power efficient communication between a sensor and a client
   the sensor data and its header should fit in 23 octet payload.  MTU
   longer than 23 octets can be supported by the LE specification.

3.  Specification of IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy

   BT-LE technology sets strict requirements for low power consumption
   and thus limits the allowed protocol overhead. 6LoWPAN standard
   [RFC4944], [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] and [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc] provides
   useful generic functionality like header compression, link-local IPv6
   addresses, Neighbor Discovery and stateless IP-address
   autoconfiguration for reducing the overhead in 802.15.4 networks.
   This functionality can be partly applied to BT-LE.

   A significant difference between IEEE 802.15.4 and BT-LE is that the
   former supports the mesh topology (and requires a routing protocol),
   whereas BT-LE does not currently support the formation of multihop
   networks.  In consequence, the mesh header defined in [RFC4944] for
   mesh under routing MUST NOT be used in BT-LE networks.  On the other
   hand, a BT-LE device MUST NOT play the role of a 6LoWPAN Router
   (6LR).

   When BT-LE is applied in sensors, generated data may fit into one
   Link Layer packet (23 bytes, maximum L2CAP payload size) that is
   transferred to the collector device periodically.  However, IP data
   packets may be much larger and hence MTU size should be the size of
   the IP data packet.  Segmentation and reassembly (SAR) functionality
   is an inherent function of the BT-LE link layer.  Larger L2CAP
   packets can be transferred with the assistance of the SAR
   functionality provided by the link layer.  This specification
   requires that SAR functionality MUST be provided in the link layer up
   to the IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.  Since SAR functionality in
   BT-LE is a function of the link layer, fragmentation functionality as
   defined in [RFC4944] SHOULD NOT be used in BT-LE neworks.

3.1.  Protocol stack

   In order to enable transmission of IPv6 packets over BT-LE, a new
   fixed L2CAP channel ID MUST be reserved for IPv6 traffic by the BT-
   SIG.  A request for allocation of a new fixed channel ID for IPv6
   traffic by the BT-SIG should be submitted through the liaison process
   or formal communique from the 6lowpan chairs and respective area
   directors.  This specification defines the use of channel ID 0x07 for
   this purpose.  Figure 3 illustrates IPv6 over BT-LE stack.

3.2.  Link model

   The concept of IP link (layer 3) and the physical link (combination
   of PHY and MAC) needs to be clear and the relation well understood in
   order to specify the addressing scheme for transmitting IPv6 packets
   over the BT-LE link.  [RFC4861] defines a link as "a communication
   facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at the link
   layer, i.e., the layer immediately below IP."

   In the case of BT-LE, L2CAP is an adaptation layer that supports the
   transmission of IPv6 packets.  L2CAP also provides multiplexing
   capability in addition to SAR functionality.

   The BT-LE link between two communicating nodes can be considered to
   be a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint link.  When one of the
   communicating nodes is in the role of a master, then the link can be
   viewed as a point-to-multipoint link.

   When a host connects to another BT-LE device the link is up and IP
   address configuration and transmission can occur.

3.2.1.  IPv6 Address configuration

   The Interface Identifier (IID) for a BT-LE interface MUST be formed
   from the 48-bit public device Bluetooth address as per the "IPv6 over
   Ethernet" specification [RFC2464].  An IPv6 prefix used for stateless
   autoconfiguration [RFC4862] of a BT-LE interface MUST have a length
   of 64 bits.

   The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for a BT-LE interface is formed
   by appending the IID, as defined above, to the prefix FE80::/64, as
   depicted in Figure 4.

3.2.2.  Header compression

   This document assumes [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc], which specifies the
   compression format for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE 802.15.4, as the
   basis for IPv6 header compression on top of BT-LE.  However, whereas
   IEEE 802.15.4 frames contain source and destination MAC layer
   addresses, BT-LE data channel PDUs contain the Access Address, which
   identifies the connection between a master and a slave.  The
   following text describes the principles of IPv6 address compression
   on top of BT-LE.

   In a link-local communication, both the IPv6 source and destination
   addresses can be elided.  In fact, the node that receives a data
   channel PDU through a Link Layer connection MAY infer that the IPv6
   destination address of the packet is its own IPv6 address.  If a node
   knows the IID of the other endpoint of the Link Layer connection, the
   IPv6 source address MAY also be elided.  A device MAY learn the IID
   of the other endpoint of a Link Layer connection e.g. from the RS/RA/
   NS/NA Neighbor Discovery (ND) message exchange.  The device MAY
   maintain a Neighbor Cache, in which the entries include both the IID
   of the neighbor and the Access Address that identifies the Link Layer
   connection with the neighbor.  A device MAY also derive the IID of
   the other endpoint of a Link Layer connection from the Link Layer
   connection establishment messages.  The device MAY maintain a
   Neighbor Cache, in which the entries include both the IID of the
   neighbor and the Access Address that identifies the Link Layer
   connection with the neighbor.

   When a BT-LE slave transmits an IPv6 packet to a remote destination
   using global IPv6 addresses, the slave MAY elide the IPv6 source
   address.  This is possible since 1) the master/6LBR has previously
   assigned the prefix to the slaves; and 2) the master/6LBR maintains a
   Neighbor Cache that relates the Access Address of each Link Layer
   connection and the IID of the corresponding slave.  The slave MAY
   also elide the prefix of the destination IPv6 address if a context is
   defined for the IPv6 destination address.

   When a master/6LBR receives an IPv6 packet sent by a remote node
   outside the BT-LE network, and the destination of the packet is a

   slave, the master/6LBR MAY elide the IID of the IPv6 destination
   address by exploiting the information contained in the table
   mentioned above.  The prefixes of the IPv6 destination and source
   addresses MAY also be elided if a context is defined for them.

3.2.3.  Unicast and Multicast address mapping

   In BT-LE, address resolution should be used for finding the Access
   Address of the Link Layer connection with the target node.  The BT-LE
   link layer does not support multicast.  Hence traffic is always
   unicast between two BT-LE devices.  Even in the case where a master
   is attached to multiple slave BT-LE devices, the master device cannot
   do a multicast to all the connected slave devices.  If the master
   device needs to send a multicast packet to all its slave devices, it
   has to replicate the packet and unicast it on each link.  However,
   this may not be energy-efficient and particular care must be taken if
   the master is battery-powered.  In the opposite direction, a slave
   can only transmit data to a single destination (i.e. the master).
   Hence, if a slave transmits an IPv6 multicast packet, the slave can
   unicast the corresponding BT-LE packet to the master.  There should
   be a table for mapping different types of multicast addresses to the
   access address in the master.

3.3.  Internet connectivity scenarios

   In a typical scenario, BT-LE network is connected to the Internet.


                        h           ____________
                         \         /            \
                   h ---- 6LBR --- |  Internet  |
                         /         \____________/
                        h
                                           h:      host
                 <-- BT-LE -->             6LBR:   6LoWPAN Border Router


             Figure 5: BT-LE network connected to the Internet

   In some scenarios, the BT-LE network may transiently or permanently
   be an isolated network.


                        h       h           h:     host
                         \     /            6LBR:  6LoWPAN Border Router
                    h --- 6LBR -- h
                         /    \
                        h      h

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over BT-LE                 August 2011


                     Figure 6: Isolated BT-LE network


4.  IANA Considerations

   While there are no actions for IANA, we do expect BT SIG to allocate
   an L2CAP channel ID.


5.  Security Considerations

   The transmission of IPv6 over BT-LE links has similar requirements
   and concerns for security as for IEEE 802.15.4.  IPv6 over BT-LE
   SHOULD be protected by using BT-LE Link Layer security.

   BT-LE Link Layer supports encryption and authentication by using the
   Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mechanism [RFC3610] and a 128-bit AES
   block cipher.  Upper layer security mechanisms may exploit this
   functionality when it is available.  (Note: CCM does not consume
   bytes from the maximum per-packet L2CAP data size, since the link
   layer data unit has a specific field for them when they are used.)

   Key management in BT-LE is provided by the Security Manager Protocol
   (SMP).
