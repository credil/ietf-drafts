Internet-Draft        X.509v3 Certificates for SSH         November 2009


1.  Introduction

   There are two Secure Shell (SSH) protocols that use public key
   cryptography for authentication.  The Transport Layer Protocol,
   described in [RFC4253], requires that a digital signature algorithm
   (called the "public key algorithm") MUST be used to authenticate the
   server to the client.  Additionally, the User Authentication Protocol
   described in [RFC4252] allows for the use of a digital signature to
   authenticate the client to the server ("publickey" authentication).

   In both cases, the validity of the authentication depends upon the
   strength of the linkage between the public signing key and the
   identity of the signer.  Digital certificates, such as those in X.509
   version 3 (X.509v3) format, use a chain of signatures by a trusted
   root certification authority and its designated intermediate
   certificate authorites to bind a given public signing key to a given
   digital identity.

   The following public key authentication algorithms are presently
   available for use in SSH:

                 +--------------+-----------------------+
                 |   Algorithm  |       Reference       |
                 +--------------+-----------------------+
                 |    ssh-dss   |       [RFC4253]       |
                 |              |                       |
                 |    ssh-rsa   |       [RFC4253]       |
                 |              |                       |
                 | pgp-sign-dss |       [RFC4253]       |
                 |              |                       |
                 | pgp-sign-rsa |       [RFC4253]       |
                 |              |                       |
                 | ecdsa-sha2-* | [I-D.green-secsh-ecc] |
                 |              |                       |
                 |  ecmqv-sha2  | [I-D.green-secsh-ecc] |
                 +--------------+-----------------------+

   Since PGP has its own method for binding a public key to a digital
   identity, this document focuses solely upon the non-PGP methods.  In
   particular, this document defines the following public key algorithms
   which differ from the above solely in their use of X.509v3
   certificates to convey the signer's public key.

   Implementation of this specification requires familiarity with the
   Secure Shell protocol [RFC4251] [RFC4253] and X.509v3 certificates
   [RFC5280].

   This document is concerned with SSH implementation details;
   specification of the underlying cryptographic algorithms and the
   handling and structore of X.509v3 certificates is left to other
   standards documents.

2.  X.509 Version 3 Certificates

   The reader is referred to [RFC5280] for a general description of
   X.509 version 3 certificates.  For the purposes of this document, it
   suffices to know that in X.509 a chain of certificates (possibly of
   length one) allows a Root Certificate Authority and its designated
   Intermediate Certificate Authorities to cryptographically bind a
   given public key to a given digital identity using public key
   signatures.  A chain of certificates can then be unambiguously
   encoded as a string of octets using the DER encoding of Abstract
   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [ASN1].

   The contents of the string containing the certificates is the DER
   encoding of an ASN.1 SEQUENCE of certificates, subject to the
   following constraints.

   o  The sender's certificate MUST come first in the chain.

   o  Each following certificate MUST certify the one proceeding it.

   o  The self-signed certificate specifying the root authority MAY be
      omitted.

   o  The individual certificates in the certificate chain MAY be signed
      using any approved Secure Shell public key signature algorithm.
      The choice of signature algorithm used by any given certificate is
      independent of the signature algorithms chosen by other
      certificates in the chain.

   Issues associated with the use of certificates (such as expiration of
   certificates and revocation of compromised certificates) are
   addressed in [RFC5280] and are outside the scope of this document.

   [I-D.solinas-suiteb-cert-profile] gives specific guidance on the
   structure of X.509v3 certificates to be used with Suite B ECDSA
   public keys.  [RFC5280] provides guidance on certificates for RSA and
   DSA.

3.  Server Authentication (public key algorithm) Using X.509v3
    Certificates

   The server's public host key is conveyed from the server to the
   client in the SSH_MSG_KEX*_REPLY_MSG, where * is either DH, RSA, ECDH
   or ECMQV.  All four key exchange protocols place the public host key
   in a string (K_S).  When a x509v3-* public key algorithm is used, the
   string K_S MUST contain a DER-encoded chain of certificates as
   described in Section 2.

4.  User Authentication (publickey authentication) Using X.509v3
    Certificates

   The client initiates user authentication by sending an
   SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message to the server.  One of the options
   available to the client is to specify that a public key
   authentication method is to be used.  The list of user authentication
   public key algorithms defined for use in Secure Shell is precisely
   the same as the list of server authentication algorithms (public key
   algorithms) defined for use in Secure Shell.  Note that the choice of
   a user authentication public key algorithm is independent of the
   choice of a server authentication algorithm.

   The client's public key is conveyed in a string called the "public
   key blob".  The x509v3-* family of authentication algorithms REQUIRE
   this string to contain a DER-encoded chain of X.509v3 certificates as
   described in Section 2.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides new public key algorithms and new key
   agreement methods for the Secure Shell protocol.  For the most part,
   the security considerations involved in using the Secure Shell
   protocol apply.  Additionally, implementers should be aware of
   security considerations specific to the use of X.509v3 certificates
   in a public key infrastructure, including considerations related to
   expired certificates and certificate revocation lists.  The reader is
   directed to the security considerations sections of [RFC4251] and
   [RFC5280].

6.  IANA Considerations

   Consistent with Section 8 of [RFC4251] and Section 4.6 of [RFC4250],
   this document makes the following registrations:

   In the Public Key Algorithm Names registry: The family of SSH public
   key algorithm names beginning with "x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-" and not
   containing the at-sign ('@').

   In the Key Exchange Method Names registry: The SSH key exchange
   method names "x509v3-ssh-dss", "x509v3-ssh-rsa", and "x509v3-ecmqv-
   sha2".

   This document creates no new registries.
