			<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
      provide a reference to the alternative ringback tone (RBT) for caller,
      or ring tone (RT) for callee using the Alert-Info header. However, the
      reference addresses only the network resources with specific rendering
      properties. There is currently no support for predefined standard
      identifiers for ringback tones or semantic indications without tied
      rendering. To overcome this limitations and support new applications a
      family of the URNs is defined in this specification.</t>
		</abstract>
		<note title="Requirements Language">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>
      allows for user agent servers (UAS) and proxies to provide the specific
      ringback or ring tone to the user agent (UA). In RFC 3261 this is done
      by including a URI reference in the Alert-Info header field, that points
      to the tone. The URI reference is most commonly the HTTP URI to the
      audio file. On the receipt of the Alert-Info header the user agent may
      fetch the referenced ringback or ring tone and play it to the user.
      Current solution is sufficient for human users that share the same
      understanding of the tones. However if caller and callee are from the
      different countries the understanding of the tones may vary
      significantly. Hearing impaired users may not sense the specific tone if
      it is provided as an audio file. The tone per se is also not useful for
      automata. Another limitation of the current solution is that the
      referenced tones are tied to particular rendering. It is not possible to
      provide a semantic indication that signals the intent and allows the
      recipient to decide how to render the received information in an
      appropriate way.</t>
			<t>To solve the described issues and support new applications this
      specification defines the new URN namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info
      header that can be understood by an automaton, would allow for
      programmatic handling, including user interface adaptation, or
      conversion to equivalent protocol parameters in the Public Switched
      Telephone Network (PSTN) when the client is a gateway.</t>
			<t>Using 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different
      application spaces:<list style="symbols">
					<t>Names for common ring-tones generated by PBX phone for cases such
          as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback after a
          transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.</t>
					<t>Names for services such as call waiting or automatic callback,
          not tied to any particular rendering.</t>
					<t>Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
          audio. They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.</t>
				</list></t>
			<t>Some advantages of a URN rather than a URI reference to a
      downloadable resource:</t>
			<t><list style="symbols">
					<t>Do not need to download it or deal with security issues
          associated with dereferencing.</t>
					<t>No formatting or compatibility issues.</t>
					<t>No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
          undesirable.</t>
					<t>The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at whatever
          quality level is appropriate.</t>
				</list>The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the
      URN then it will only be able to render a default ringback or ring-tone.
      To provide the general awareness about the Alert-Info URNs this document
      provides IANA template for registering the URNs and defines several
      typical identifiers.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Registration template">
			<t>Below is the registration template for the 'alert' URN scheme
      according to the <xref target="RFC3406">RFC 3406</xref></t>

					<t hangText="Declaration of syntactic structure:"/>
					<t>Namespace Specific String (NSS) in the for the "alert" URNs is
          called alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure. The
          left-most label is called "alert-category" and is separated from
          right-side of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a
          semicolon. In this specification, two categories of
          alert-identifiers are described: the "tone" alert-identifiers and
          the "service" alert-identifiers.</t>
					<t>The "tone" alert-identifier has the general form:</t>
					<list>
						<t>urn:alert:tone:{tone-indication}</t>
					</list>
					<t>where the tone-indication identifies the semantic of a tone.</t>
					<t/>
					<t style="hanging">The "service" alert-identifier has the general
          form:</t>
					<list>
						<t>urn:alert:service:{service-indication}</t>
					</list>
					<t>where the service-indication is a unique identifier for a service
          as call-waiting or transfer-recall.</t>
					<t>The tone-indication and service-indication are hierarchical
          identifiers, consisting of one label or a sequence of labels
          separated by periods. The left-most label is the most significant
          one and is called 'top-level indication' , while names to the right
          are called 'sub-indication'. The set of allowable characters is the
          same as that for domain names <xref target="RFC1123"/>. Labels are
          case-insensitive, but MUST be specified in all lower-case.</t>
					<t>Labels can be removed right-to-left excepting the left-most
          label; the resulting tone-indication or service-indication is still
          valid, referring to a more generic tone-indication or
          service-indication. In other words, if a tone 'x.y.z' exists, the
          tone 'x' and 'x.y' are also valid tone. Each alert indication
          identifier SHALL explicitly define it's validity respective the
          sub-indications.</t>

          alert URNs is shown below:</t>

					<t hangText="Relevant ancillary documentation:">None</t>
					<t hangText="Community considerations:">The alert URN is believed to
          be relevant to a large cross-section of Internet users, including
          both technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and
          with a variety of perception capabilities. The 'alert' URN will
          allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them to
          better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get better
          feedback on the progress of a call they have made. User interfaces
          for the perception impaired users can better render the ringback
          indication based on the 'alert' URN. The assignment of identifiers
          is described in the IANA Considerations (<xref target="IANA"/>).
          The 'alert' URN does not prescribe a particular resolution
          mechanism, but it is assumed that a number of different entities
          could operate and offer such mechanisms.</t>
					<t hangText="Namespace considerations:">There do not appear to be

          identifies a logical service or tone, specified in the 'alert'
          indication registration (see IANA Considerations (<xref target="IANA"/>)). Resolution of the registered URN will return a
          particular instance of the alert identifier. Alert identifier URNs
          MUST be unique for each unique indication; this is guaranteed
          through the registration of each alert indication within this
          namespace, described in (<xref target="IANA"/>).</t>
					<t hangText="Identifier persistence considerations:">The 'alert' URN

          is registered with IANA.</t>

		</section>
		<section title="Top Level Alert URN Indication Definitions">
			<t>This section describes the use cases that are supported by the
      'alert' URNs.</t>
			<section title="PBX Tones">
				<t>This section defines some commonly encountered ring-tones on PBX or
        business phones. They are as follows:</t>
				<section title="normal">
					<t>This tone indicates that the default or normal ring-tone should
          be rendered. This is most useful when Alert-Info header field
          parameters are being used. For example, in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances"/>, an
          Alert-Info header field needs to be present containing the "appearance" parameter, but no special ringtone need be specified. If no special alerting is to be used, urn:alert:tone:normal
          should be used.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="external">
					<t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
          enterprise or PBX system. This could be a call from the PSTN or from
          a SIP trunk. For this case, urn:alert:tone:external should be
          used.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="internal">
					<t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
          enterprise or PBX system. The call could have been originated from
          another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the enterprise.
          For this case, the urn:alert:tone:internal should be used.</t>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section title="Service Tones">
				<t>These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and telephony
        services. </t>
				<section title="call-waiting">
					<t>The call waiting Service <xref target="TS24.615"></xref> permits
          a callee to be notified of an incoming call whilst the media
          resources are not available for the incoming call and the callee is
          engaged in an active or held call. Subsequently, the callee can
          either accept, reject, or ignore the incoming call. There is an
          interest on the caller side to be informed about the call waiting
          situation on the callee side. Having this information the caller can
          decide whether to continue waiting for callee to pickup or better to
          call some time later when it is estimated that the callee could have
          finished the ongoing conversation. To provide this information, the
          callee's UAS or proxy aware of the call waiting condition can add
          the call-waiting indication URN to the Alert-Info header. As
          call-waiting information may be subject to the callee's privacy
          concerns, the exposure of this information SHALL be done only if
          explicitly required by the user. The urn:alert:service:call-waiting
          should be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="forward">
					<t>This feature is used in a 180 response when a call forwarding feature has been initiated on an INVITE.  Many PBX system implement a forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate this. The urn:alert:service:forward should be used for this case.  Note that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="transfer-recall">
					<t>This feature is used when a blind transfer <xref target="RFC5589"/> has been
          performed by a server on behalf of the transferor and fails. Instead
          of failing the call, the server calls back the transferor, giving
          them another chance to transfer or otherwise deal with the call.
          This service tone is used to distinguish this INVITE from any other
          normal incoming call. The urn:alert:service:transfer-recall should
          be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="auto-callback">
					<t>This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to
          implement an automatic callback service. When the user is available,
          the server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
          distinguish this from any other normal incoming call. The
          urn:alert:service:auto-callback should be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="hold-recall">
					<t>This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer on
          behalf of an endpoint. After a certain period of time of being on
          hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
          retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call. This service
          tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call. The urn:alert:service:hold-recall should be used for this
          case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="crisis">
					<t>This feature is used for emergency announcements sent over PBX
          systems such as building evacuations, alarms, etc. This service tone
          is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call. The urn:alert:service:crisis should be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Alert Level URN Sub-Indications Definitions">
			<t>These sub-indications can be applied to any of the Top Level Alert
      Indications defined in the previous sections.</t>
			<section title="priority">
				<t>This sub-level is used to indicate that a priority level alert
        should be applied for the type of alerting specified. For example,
        urn:alert:tone:internal.priority would be used to generate alerting
        for a priority internal PBX call.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="short">
				<t>This sub-level is used to indicate that the alert type specified
        should be rendered shorter than normal. In contact centers, this is
        sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone". For
        example, urn:alert:tone:normal.short would generate a shorter than
        normal ring-tone.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="delayed">
				<t>This sub-level is used to indicate that the alerting type specified
        show be rendered after a short delay. In some bridged line/shared line
        appearance implementations, this is used so that the bridged line does
        not ring at exactly the same time as the main line, but is delayed a
        few seconds. For example, urn:alert:tone:external.delayed would
        generate an external ring-tone, delayed by a few seconds.</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="User Agent Behavior">
			<t>Upon receiving a SIP request or a SIP 180 Ringing response with an
      Alert-Info header that contains a single or multiple 'alert' URNs, the
      User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received URNs with the known
      indications. If no match is found, the User Agent (UA) ignores the
      received 'alert' URNs and proceeds with the normal operation. If the one
      or multiple URNs matches a known indication, the User Agent (UA) renders
      the indication(s) to the user according to the tone or
      service identifier in the received alert URN. The User Agent (UA) is
      responsible for the non disturbing rendering if multiple indications and
      network resources are to be rendered simultaneously.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Proxy Behavior">
			<t></t>
			<t>A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
      in a SIP request or a 180 Ringing provisional response when it needs to
      provide additional information about the call or about the provided
      service. A SIP Proxy SHOULD NOT add a mixture of the 'alert' URNs and
      URIs to the Alert-Info header that may cause disturbing rendering
      interference at the recepient's User Agent (UA).</t>
			<t>Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
      the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service
      transported by the Alert-Info header in a 180 Ringing provisional
      response.</t>

			<t>This section registers a new URN scheme with the registration
      template provided in section Registration Template.</t>
			<t>Below, the section 7.1 details how to register new alert-identifiers.
      Descriptions of alert-indications for the first two alert-identifiers
      described in this document , service and tone, are given in Section 7.2
      and Section 7.3, respectively. Finally, Section 7.4 contains the initial
      registration table.</t>
			<section title="New alert-identifiers">
				<t>Alert URNs identifiers and alert-indications are identified by
        labels managed by IANA, according to the processes outlined in <xref target="RFC2434"></xref> in a new registry called "Alert URN Labels".
        Thus, creating a new alert-identifier requires IANA action. The policy
        for adding a new alert-identifier category is 'Standards Action'.
        (This document defines the alert-identifier categories 'service' and
        'tone'.) The policy for assigning labels to alert-indications may

				<t>This section defines the alert-identifier registration within the
        IANA registry defined in Section 7.1, using the alert-category labels
        'service' and 'tone'.</t>
				<t>The 'tone' alert-category label provides information about ringing
        tones generated by a UAS and rendered to the callee in response to an
        INVITE.</t>
				<t>The 'service' alert-category label describes tones that should be
        generated by the UAC or UAS and rendered to the caller or calee upon
        receipt of a 180 response or a request. The normal rendering is audio,
        however there can be other renderings applicable if needed by the user
        interface specifics.</t>

			<t>The alert-identifier labels are protocol elements <xref target="RFC3536"></xref> and are not normally seen by users. Thus, the
      character set for these elements is restricted, as described in Section
      6.</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
      particular security issues. The indications described by the 'alert' URN
      are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do not apply to
      the URN.</t>
			<t>Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
      privacy issues. Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised by
      the callee.</t>
