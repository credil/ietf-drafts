                Deployment of DNSSEC opens up the possibility of new mechanisms for assuring
                application keys. This document extends the use of the DNS CERT resource
                record and defines X.509v3 extensuions to support key assurance mechanisms
                for use with TLS and other X.509 protocols and provides a comprehensive assessment
                of the security thus achieved.

                        The assertion made by means of the DPKIX certificate type is 
                        only as secure as the trust chain that authenticates it.
                        Trust chain processing rules are specified in Section XXX below.

                        performed as is the case when the DPKIX certificate type

                The X.509v3 certificate extension 'DNS-CERT' MAY be included in
                an X.509v3 certificate to notify relying parties that a DNS key

                <t>
                If the DNS-CERT extension is present and the critical flag bit
                is not set, it serves as a notice to a relying party applications 
                that they MAY attempt to use the key assurance mechanism specified

                <t>
                    If the DNS-CERT extension critical flag bit is set, a relying party application
                    MUST support the key assurance mechanism specified
                    in this document and MUST NOT consider the certificate valid 
                    unless the outcome of the verification procedure is 'verified'.

                <t>
                    Since applications MUST NOT make use of X.509v3 critical extensions
                    that are not understood, use of the critical flag bit value 'set'
                    is strongly discouraged.
                    Certificate issuers SHOULD NOT set the critical flag bit on a
                    DNS-CERT unless this is the derisred behavior

                <t>
                We have considered possible protocol attacks by identifying 
                protocol assets, the abstract risks to which such assets may be
                exposed and how such risks may be manifest in concrete threats.
                </t>
                <t>
                The assets considered are the DNSSEC private keys held by the 
                domain name holder, DNS zone in which the resorce records are 
                presented and the application public key pair. 
                </t>
                <t>
                The DNS is a large infrastructure and management of a specific 
                DNS zone is never within the unique control of one party.
                In addition to considering means of preventing compromise we
                consider the steps required to recover from a compromise.

                    A signed CERT record only demonstrates that the party in control
                    of the authoritative DNS zerver for the specified zone has authorized
                    the use of a particular public key for authenticating communication
                    with the server.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        A signed CERT record  does not and cannot express any assertion
                        concerning the existence, trustworthiness or accountability of
                        either the key holder or the domain name holder.

                    <t>
                        for the purposes of establishing a secure connection, an end 
                        entity certificate assured by means of a signed CERT 
                        record MUST meet all the requirements that any other end entity 
                        certificate is required to meed for use with that protocol.

                    <t>
                    If protection against a protocol substitution attack is required,
                    the signer of the end entity certificate SHOULD ensure that the 
                    appropriate X.509 Key Usage, Extended Key Usage and/or extensions
                    are appropriately configured.

                    <t>
                    The CERT record only provides notice that a public key is associated 
                    with a DNS domain name. The mere presence of a CERT record at a 
                    DNS node does not imply that its use is supported in conjunction 
                    with a specific protocol.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                    Accordingly, use of CERT records does not and cannot provide 
                    protection against protocol downgrade attacks.

                    Relying party applciations MAY notify the user that a cryptographic 
                    security protocol is in use to protect the confidentiality and 
                    integrity of communication with the domain name holder.

                <t>
                    Key assurance by means of the CERT mechanism only extends to the
                    properties of the key itself and the security of the connection
                    established to the Internet service provided by the key holder.
                    Key Assurance by means of the CERT mechanism does not and cannot
                    support any assertion regarding the trustworthiness of either the 
                    key holder or the domain name holder.

                <t>
                A secure connection to an endpoint identified by a domain name alone 
                does not imply a secure transaction. If provided, a
                user notification MUST NOT imply that a user is 'safe' on the basis of
                CERT key assurance alone.
