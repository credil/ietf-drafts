                      draft-krishnan-conex-ipv6-01

Abstract

   Conex is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the
   congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
   document describes the requirements for conex markings in IPv6
   datagrams and describes the various options for performing conex
   markings in IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   Conex is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the
   congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.  This
   document describes the requirements for conex markings in IPv6
   datagrams and describes the various options for performing conex
   markings in IPv6.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements for marking IPv6 packets

   R-1: The marking mechanism needs to be visible to all conex-capable
   nodes on the path.

   R-2: The mechanism needs to be able to traverse nodes that do not
   understand the markings.  This is required to ensure that conex can
   be incrementally deployed over the Internet.

   R-3: The presence of the marking mechanism should not significantly
   alter the processing of the packet.  This is required to ensure that
   conex marked packets do not face any undue delays or drops due to a
   badly chosen mechanism.

   R-4: The markings should be immutable once set by the sender.  At the
   very least, any tampering should be detectable.


4.  Possible Solutions

4.1.  Hop-by-hop options

   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines hop-by-hop options.  These
   options are processed by every node on the path.  Hence they meet
   R-1.  The options have variable semantics based on the 3 MSB of the
   option code.  The state of these bits controls the behavior of nodes
   to either ignore unknown options or drop packets containing them.  It
   also defines the ICMPv6 error message sending behavior and the
   mutability of the options en-route.  This means that it is possible
   for hop-by-hop options to satisfy R-2 and R-4.  In most commercial
   router implementations the mere presence of hop-by-hopoptions rResult
   in the packet being punted to the Slow path instead of being accorded

   regular forwarding behavior (Fast Path).  This means that R-3 is not
   satisifed.

4.2.  Destination options

   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines the destination options.
   These options are processed only by the ultimate receiver of the
   packet (as specified in the Destination Address field) and not by
   nodes on the path.  Hence they do not meet R-1.  The options have the
   same variable semantics based on the 3 MSBs as the hop-by-hop option
   which means that they can satisfy R-2 and R-4.  As intermediate nodes
   currently do not process destination options R-3 is easily satisifed.

4.3.  Header bits

   The IPv6 header has no free bits.  The only bits in the IPv6 header
   that are not widely used are the flow label bits [RFC3697].  There
   are some initiatives to redefine the use of the flow label for other
   purposes (e.g.  Load balancing, nonce).  It may be possible (but
   highly unlikeley) to save a few bits from the flow label for
   alternate purposes to end up with a shorter flow label.  The use of
   IPv6 header bits can satisfy all the requirements for conex markings
   but using valuable header bits for experimental purposes (such as
   conex) may not be acceptable.

4.4.  Extension Headers

   The base IPv6 standard [RFC2460] defines extension headers as an
   expansion mechanism to carry optional internet layer information.
   Extension headers, with the exception of the hop-by-hop options
   header, are not usually processed on intermediate nodes.  This means
   that R-1 cannot be met.  Unknown extension headers cause the packet
   to be dropped and hence such mechanism is not incrementally
   deployable.  Hence R-3 is not met either.


5.  ConEx Encoding

   The decision about where to code the ConEx inform might also
   influence the decision on how to code congestion information itself.
   Of course, a ConEx capable transport has to inform the network that
   it is actually ConEx enabled.  Thus, as a minimum, every packet has
   to carry the information that the sender is ConEx enabled and, also
   whether it is ConEx marked.  Moreover, the abstract conex mechanism
   [draft-mathis-conex-abstract-mech-00] requires that that a
   distinction between loss or ECN marks as congestion signal is needed
   in addition to the so-called 'congestion credits'.  This implies that
   a minimum of 4 bits is needed if bit-wise encoding is used , and a

   minimum of 3 bits is needed if codepoints are used.  Further ideas on
   additional ConEx information are currently discussed on the mailing
   list.  Moreover, the ConEx information could be represented in a more
   sophisticated manner than a binary signal (Yes/No), if additional
   bits are available for use.
