Internet Draft      Default Port for IRC via TLS/SSL  September 28, 2010


Abstract

   This document describes the established best industry practice of
   listening on TCP port 6697 for incoming IRC connections encrypted via
   TLS/SSL.

   This document does not try to limit the use of lesser-used ports like
   7000 and 9999.

Internet Draft      Default Port for IRC via TLS/SSL  September 28, 2010


1. Rationale

   Although system port assignments for both plain text (TCP port 194)
   and TLS/SSL encrypted (TCP port 994) IRC traffic exist [RFC1700],
   [IANALIST], it is common practice amongst IRC networks not to use
   them for reasons of convenience and general availability on systems
   where no root access is granted or desired.

   IRC networks have defaulted to listening on TCP port 6667 for plain
   text connections for considerable time, now.  This is covered by the
   IRCU assignment of TCP/UDP ports 6665-6669.

   Similar consensus has been reached within the IRC community about
   listening on TCP port 6697 for incoming IRC connections encrypted via
   TLS/SSL.

2. Security Considerations

   This document does not directly discuss security issues, however the
   lack of a common, well established listening port for IRC via TLS/SSL
   could lead to end users being unaware of their IRC network of choice
   supporting TLS/SSL.

3. IANA Considerations

   An assignment of TCP port 6697 for IRC via TLS/SSL will be requested.

4. APPENDIX A: Supporting data

   As of September 2010, out of the top twenty IRC networks
   [TOP100],[MAVERICK], ten support TLS/SSL.  Only one of those networks
   does not support TLS/SSL via port 6697 and has no plans to support
   it.  All others supported it already or are in the process of sup-
   porting it since being contacted by the author.  A detailed analysis
   is available but does not fit within the scope of this document.
