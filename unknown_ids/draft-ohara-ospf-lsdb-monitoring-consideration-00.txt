                 Consideration on OSPF LSDB Monitoring
           draft-ohara-ospf-lsdb-monitoring-consideration-00

Abstract

   Many people believe that any LSA once flooded throughout the OSPF
   area can be monitored on all OSPF routers in the area.  This is not
   always true, and a malicious OSPF router that pretends to be legal
   may want to, and be able to, hide malicious LSAs.  This document
   proposes the modifications to OSPF specification to prevent hiding
   the malicious LSAs, and to make LSDB monitoring more successful
   (hence, secure).

Internet-Draft               OSPF LSDB Mon.                     Jun 2011


1.  Introduction

   All systems should (if not must) be monitored to confirm that it is
   not executing any undesirable activities.  OSPF, a core protocol for
   IP network, is also such a system.

   In OSPF, it is believed that one can monitor the whole area by
   monitoring LSDB change in any router in the area.  This is due to the
   OSPF's link state principle; all information is flooded to all
   routers in the area, so that all routers can compute their routes
   autonomously and independently (distributed computation).  If a
   network operator is watching LSA changes in the area at one point, it
   is almost equivalent to monitoring OSPF activities at all routers in
   the area, due to the nature of the link state protocol.

   However, the LSDB monitoring technique (watching LSDB exchanges of a
   router at one point in the area) has a few problems.

   1.  The origin of an LSA can easily be spoofed.  There is no way to
       make it sure where an LSA is originated, other than to monitor
       OSPF traffic of all the link in the OSPF area.  (Monitoring OSPF
       traffic of all the link is very expensive in terms of operational
       cost, and usually very difficult if not impossible.)  Moreover,
       an LSA can be easily overridden or removed by another router when
       the source origin ID of the LSA (i.e., Advertising Router) is
       spoofed.

   2.  Monitoring all the contents of many LSAs and detecting incorrect
       contents (either erroneous or malicious) are sometimes tough
       task.  The large number of types of LSAs and their data fields
       are making it hard to detect an unusual information, unless the
       LSDB monitor parses all LSA formats and their contents (usually
       not done).  An example of this consequence is the problem of
       Covert Channel using OSPF, where malicious communication channel
       using OSPF is open, while the existence of the channel is not
       obvious.

   3.  It is possible that some of the OSPF activities in the area
       cannot be monitored by monitoring at one point in the area.  In a
       very rare case depending on the timing of the LSA flooding and
       the topology, some LSA instances may not reach to all OSPF
       routers in the area, and hence not to the monitoring point.  An
       detailed example is described in Section 2.  The Insecure LSDB
       Monitoring: a failure to capture the malicious LSA.

   This document focuses on the last bullet 3, because if all OSPF
   activities are guaranteed to be monitored, bullets 1 and 2 (the
   problems of finding the true LSA origin and unusual LSA contents)

   both may become easier to solve.

   Many OSPF operators tend to think that "all OSPF router in the area
   see all the LSAs flooded in the area".  This is wrong, to be precise.
   The fact that "an OSPF LSA might not entirely be flooded throughout
   the OSPF area" and "Some contents in the LSAs might not be captured
   by some of the other OSPF routers in the area" are not so commonly
   understood.

   Let us denote that the LSDB monitoring at one point in the area be
   "insecure" because it may fail to capture all LSAs.  The goal of this
   document is to provide a way to achieve "secure" LSDB monitoring
   without excessive operational burden, where LSDB monitoring always
   capture all LSA instances.  The secure LSDB monitoring surely
   contributes to the problem of finding the unusual LSA contents such
   as malicious activities.

   This document proposes the modifications to the OSPF specification,
   to guarantee that "every LSA content flooded in the area is always
   delivered to all OSPF routers" (i.e. the achievement of the secure
   LSDB monitoring).  Specifically, this document proposes to add a
   check on reception of a premature-aging (MaxAged) LSA.  The check is
   to see if the contents is the same between the local LSA copy being
   removed and the received LSA being removing.  This additional check
   prevents all LSA contents from being removed without being flooded in
   the area at least once.  Next, this document proposes to add two
   additional conditions on updating LSA instances.  Those are to
   guarantee that all LSA contents are flooded in the area before being
   overridden with newer contents.  With these modifications, all LSA
   contents are guaranteed to be flooded throughout the area.  Hence,
   the secure LSDB monitoring works on any router as expected.  Details
   of the proposal is explained in Section 3.  The Secure LSDB
   Monitoring.

2.  The Insecure LSDB Monitoring: a failure to capture the malicious LSA

   The malicious OSPF routers might try to withdraw the malicious LSA
   (say, immediately after the malicious contents accomplished its
   purpose), trying best to hide its malicious activity, from all other
   routers in the area.  As a consequence of the withdraw, some of OSPF
   routers in the OSPF area may not see the malicious LSA, depending on
   the timing of LSA flooding and the topology.  An example is explained
   in this section.

   Suppose that the two malicious OSPF routers (the router A and C in
   Figure 1) are trying to communicate with each other.  The router C
   floods a malicious LSA to convey a malicious contents to be received
   by the router A. Suppose that when the malicious LSA reached to the
   router A, the malicious LSA is held in the LSDBs of the routers
   marked with "x" (Figure 2).

   When the router A receives the malicious LSA, it immediately execute
   the procedure of premature aging for the malicious LSA, trying to
   hide the malicious LSA from all other routers.  In doing so, the
   router A advertises the Max-Aged, empty contents, instance of the
   malicious LSA, spoofing the Advertising Router field.  Let us
   illustrate the Max-Aged LSA "p".  The LSA "p" is flooded from the
   router A, while the original malicious LSA instance "x" is also kept
   flooding (to the router E from F).  The status becomes now as in
   Figure 3.

                   /-----------+Bp+-----------\

                        ++-+

                      LSDB Monitor

                         Figure 3: Premature Aging

   Note that the LSDB Monitoring router G does not receive the malicious
   LSA "x", because "p" is recognized more recent than "x" and the LSA
   "x" is rejected in the router D. Hence, the LSDB monitor fails to
   capture the malicious contents of "x" because the only LSA flooded to
   the router G, "p", does not contain the malicious contents.

3.  The Secure LSDB Monitoring

   The source of the problem in Section 2 lies in the acceptance check
   in premature aging procedure.  The current OSPF specification allows
   to receive the Max-Aged instance of the previous LSA, with the
   different contents (possibly empty).  We propose to modify the OSPF
   specification to mandate additional identity check of the contents in
   premature aging procedure.  By doing so, the malicious LSA (the
   router A in Section 2) cannot hide the malicious contents from the
   LSDB monitor (the router G) using premature aging procedure.

   However, the router A still be able to hide the malicious contents,
   using ordinal LSA update procedure.  Suppose if the router A
   overrides the LSA "x" with the newer LSA with contents that seems to
   be valid.  This case does not fall into the premature aging
   procedure, so the above change does not take effect.

   To prevent hiding with ordinal LSA update, we propose to modify OSPF
   specification further, to mandate that every LSAs are updated only
   when all the retrans-lists do not contain the LSA instance and the
   newer LSA is advanced just one LS Sequence Number.  This modification
   mandates that all the LSA instance is flooded throughout the area,
   and restricts that the reject of the stale update does not happen.

   When the router A tries to override the LSA "x" with the same LS
   Sequence Number, no routers will receive the LSA because it is
   recognized that the LSA is the same instance with "x", and that
   receiving it again is not needed.  Hence, the attempt to hide by
   overriding the LSA does not succeed.

   The most important disadvantages of this modification is that the LSA
   update is totally sequentialized among the entire network.  The LSA
   update goes as LS SeqNum 1, 2, 3, and so on, with advance of just 1.
   This may make the efficacy and the speed of LSA flooding to degrade.
   This is the cost of achieving the secure LSDB monitoring.

4.  Suggested Modifications to the OSPF Specification

   We propose the following modifications to the OSPF specification.

   1.  The premature aging can happen only when the LSA contents are
       identical between old and new (i.e., removed and removing) LSAs.

   2.  All LSA are updated only when 1) none of its instance is on any
       retrans-list, and 2) the LS Sequence Number is incremented by 1.
