Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                    July 2009


Abstract

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP).

   The user of DTLS over SCTP can take advantage of all features
   provided by SCTP and its extensions, especially support of

   o  multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.

   o  multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking.

   o  unordered delivery.

   o  dynamic reconfiguration of streams.

   o  partially reliable data transfer.

Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                    July 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol, as defined in [RFC4347], over the Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [RFC4960].

   TLS is designed to run on top of a byte-stream oriented transport
   protocol providing a reliable, in-sequence delivery.  Thus, TLS is
   currently mainly being used on top of the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP), as defined in [RFC0793].

   TLS over SCTP as described in [RFC3436] has some serious limitations:

   o  It does not support the unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   o  It does not support partial reliability as defined in [RFC3758].

   o  It only supports the usage of the same number of streams in both
      directions.

   o  It uses a TLS connection for every bidirectional stream, which
      requires a substantial amount of resources and message exchanges
      if a large number of streams is used.

   DTLS over SCTP as described in this document overcomes these
   limitations of TLS over SCTP.  The user of DTLS over SCTP can use all
   services provided by SCTP and its partial reliability extension.  The
   dynamic modification of the IP-addresses used by the SCTP end-points
   is also supported.

   The method described in this document requires that the SCTP
   implementation supports the optional feature of fragmentation of SCTP
   user messages and the SCTP authentication extension defined in
   [RFC4895].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Association:  An SCTP association.

   Connection:  A TLS connection.

   Session:  A TLS session.

   Stream:  A unidirectional stream of an SCTP association.  It is
      uniquely identified by a stream identifier.

1.3.  Abbreviations

   DTLS:  Datagram Transport Layer Security.

   MTU:  Maximum Transmission Unit.

   PPID:  Payload Protocol Identifier.

   SCTP:  Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

   TCP:  Transmission Control Protocol.

   TLS:  Transport Layer Security.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  DTLS Considerations

3.1.  Message Sizes

   DTLS limits the DTLS user message size to the current Path MTU minus
   the header sizes.  This limit SHOULD be increased to 2^14 Bytes for
   DTLS over SCTP.

3.2.  Message Fragmentation

   The DTLS layer MUST NOT perform message fragmentation.  The SCTP
   layer will perform this task.  Thus the supported maximum length of
   SCTP user messages MUST be at least 2^14 + 2048 + 5 = 18437 bytes.
   Every DTLS message MUST be handled as one SCTP user message.

3.3.  Replay Detection

   Replay detection of DTLS MUST NOT be used.

3.4.  Path MTU Discovery

   Path MTU discovery of DTLS MUST NOT be used.

3.5.  Retransmission of Messages

   DTLS procedures for retransmissions MUST NOT be used.


4.  SCTP Considerations

4.1.  Payload Protocol Identifier Usage

   Application protocols running over DTLS over SCTP SHOULD register and
   use a separate payload protocol identifier (PPID) and SHOULD NOT
   reuse the PPID which they registered for running directly over SCTP.

   This means in particular that there is no specific PPID for DTLS.

4.2.  Stream Usage

   All DTLS messages of the ChangeCipherSpec, Alert, or Handshake
   protocol MUST be transported on stream 0 with unlimited reliability
   and with the ordered delivery feature.

   All DTLS messages of the ApplicationData protocol MAY be transported
   over stream 0 but users SHOULD use other streams for better
   performance.

4.3.  Chunk Handling

   The DATA, SACK and FORWARD-TSN chunks of SCTP MUST be sent in an
   authenticated way as described in [RFC4895].  Other chunks MAY be
   sent in an authenticated way.

   This makes sure that an attacker can not modify the stream a message
   is sent in or affect the ordered/unordered delivery of the message.
   It is also not possible for an attacker to drop messages and use
   forged FORWARD-TSN and SACK chunks to hide this dropping.

4.4.  Handshake

   To prevent DTLS from discarding DTLS user messages while
   renegotiating, before sending a ChangeCipherSpec message all
   outstanding SCTP user messages MUST have been acknowledged by the
   SCTP peer and MUST NOT be revoked anymore by the SCTP peer.

   Prior to processing a received ChangeCipherSpec all other received

Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                    July 2009


   SCTP user messages which are buffered in the SCTP layer MUST be read
   and processed by DTLS.

   User messages arriving between ChangeCipherSpec and Finished using
   the new epoch have probably passed the Finished and MUST be buffered
   by DTLS until the Finished is read.

4.5.  Handling of Endpoint-pair Shared Secrets

   The endpoint-pair shared secret for Shared Key Identifier 0 is empty.
   Whenever the master key changes, a 64 byte shared secret is derived
   from every master secret and provided as a new end-point pair shared
   secret by using the algorithm described in [I-D.ietf-tls-extractor].

   The Shared Key Identifier MUST be incremented by 1.  If it is 65535,
   the next value MUST be 1.

   Before sending the Finished message the active SCTP-AUTH key MUST be
   switched to the new one.

   Once the corresponding Finished message from the peer has been
   received the old key SHOULD be removed.

4.6.  Shutdown

   To prevent DTLS from discarding DTLS user messages while shutting
   down, before sending a CloseNotify message all outstanding SCTP user
   messages MUST have been acknowledged by the SCTP peer and MUST NOT be
   revoked anymore by the SCTP peer.

   Prior to processing a received CloseNotify all other received SCTP
   user messages which are buffered in the SCTP layer MUST be read and
   processed by DTLS.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to add a value to the TLS Exporter Label registry as
   described in [I-D.ietf-tls-extractor].  The label suggested is
   EXTRACTOR_DTLS_OVER_SCTP.  The reference should refer to this
   document.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any additional security considerations in
   addition to the ones given in [RFC4347] and [RFC4895].
