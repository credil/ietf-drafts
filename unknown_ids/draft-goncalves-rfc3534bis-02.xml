			<t>This document describes the registration of media types for the <xref target="RFC3533">Ogg</xref> container format and conformance requirements for implementations of these types.</t>
		</abstract>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>This memo describes media types for Ogg, a data encapsulation format defined by the Xiph.Org Foundation.  Refer to "Introduction" in <xref target="RFC3533"/> and "Overview" in <xref target="Ogg"/> for background information on this container format.</t>
			<t>Binary data contained in Ogg, such as Vorbis and Theora, has historically been interchanged using the application/ogg media type as defined by <xref target="RFC3534"/>.  This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC3534"/> and defines three media types for different types of content in Ogg to reflect this usage in the IANA media type registry, to foster interoperability by defining underspecified aspects, and to provide general security considerations.</t>
			<t>The Ogg container format is known to contain <xref target="Theora"/> or <xref target="Dirac"/> video, <xref target="Speex"/> (narrow-band and wide-band speech), <xref target="Vorbis"/> or <xref target="FLAC"/> audio, and <xref target="CMML"/> timed text/metadata.  As Ogg encapsulates binary data, it is possible to include any other type of video, audio, image, text or, generally speaking, any time-continuously sampled data.</t>
			<t>While raw packets from these data sources may be used directly by transport mechanisms that provide their own framing and packet-separation mechanisms (such as UDP datagrams or RTP), Ogg is a solution for stream based storage (such as files) and transport (such as TCP streams or pipes).  The media types defined in this document are needed to correctly identify such content when it is served over HTTP, included in multi-part documents, or used in other places where <xref target="RFC2045">media types</xref> are used.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Conformance and Document Conventions">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/> and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.  Requirements apply to all implementations unless otherwise stated.</t>
			<t>An implementation is a software module that supports one of the media types defined in this document.  Software modules may support multiple media types, but conformance is considered individually for each type.</t>
			<t>Implementations that fail to satisfy one or more "MUST" requirements are considered non-compliant.  Implementations that satisfy all "MUST" requirements, but fail to satisfy one or more "SHOULD" requirements, are said to be "conditionally compliant".  All other implementations are "unconditionally compliant".</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Deployed Media Types and Compatibility">
			<t>The application/ogg media type has been used in an ad-hoc fashion to label and exchange multimedia content in Ogg containers.</t>
			<t>Use of the "application" top-level type for this kind of content is known to be problematic, in particular since it obfuscates video and audio content.  This document thus defines the media types,</t>
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>video/ogg</t>
				<t>audio/ogg</t>
			</list>
			<t>which are intended for common use and SHOULD be used when dealing with video or audio content respectively.  This document also obsoletes the <xref target="RFC3534"/> definition of application/ogg and marks it for complex data (e.g. multitrack visual, audio, textual and other time-continuously sampled data), which is not clearly video or audio data and thus not suited for either the video/ogg or audio/ogg types.  Refer to the following section for more details.</t>
			<t>An Ogg bitstream generally consists of one or more logical bitstreams that each consist of a series of header and data pages packetising time-continuous binary data <xref target="RFC3533"/>.  The content types of the logical bitstreams may be identified without decoding the header pages of the logical bitstreams through use of a <xref target="Skeleton"/> bitstream.  Using Ogg Skeleton is REQUIRED for content served under the application/ogg type and RECOMMENDED for video/ogg and audio/ogg, as it is a type of identifier space used to describe the different encapsulated data.</t>
			<t>Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations that identify a logical bitstream which they cannot decode SHOULD ignore it, while continuing to decode the ones they can.  Such precaution ensures backward and forward compatibility with existing and future data.</t>
			<t>Ongoing work related to this registration may introduce optional parameters in future revisions of this document.  One example area of effort may introduce a parameter that would allow for data in use within the media type to be asserted and determined without examination of the bitstream.  Implementations MUST consider the impact of such an update.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Relation Between the Media Types">
			<t>As stated in the previous section, this document describes three media types which are targeted at different data encapsulated in Ogg.  Since Ogg is capable of encapsulate any kind of data, the multiple usage scenarios have revealed interoperability issues between implementations when dealing with content served solely under the application/ogg type.</t>
			<t>While this document does redefine the earlier definition of application/ogg, this media type will continue to embrace the widest net possible of content with the video/ogg and audio/ogg types being smaller subsets of it.  However, the video/ogg and audio/ogg types take precedence in a subset of the usages, specifically when serving multimedia content that is not complex enough to warrant the use of application/ogg.  Following this line of thought, the audio/ogg type is an even smaller subset within video/ogg, as it is not intended to refer to visual content.</t>
			<t>As such, the application/ogg type is the recommended choice to serve content aimed at scientific and other applications that require various multiplexed signals or streams of continuous data.  For bitstreams containing visual, timed text, or any other type of material that requires a visual interface, but which is not complex enough to warrant serving under application/ogg, the video/ogg type is recommended.  In situations where the Ogg bitstream predominantly contains audio data, it is recommended to use the audio/ogg type.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Encoding Considerations">
			<t>Binary: The content consists of an unrestricted sequence of octets.</t>
			<t>Note:</t>
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>Ogg encapsulated content is binary data and should be transmitted in a suitable encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping, etc.; <xref target="RFC4648">base64</xref> is generally preferred for binary-to-text encoding.</t>
				<t>Media types described in this document are used for stream based storage (such as files) and transport (such as TCP streams or pipes); separate types are used for real-time transfer, such as for the RTP payload formats of <xref target="ThRTP">Theora</xref> video, and <xref target="VoRTP">Vorbis</xref> or <xref target="SpRTP">Speex</xref> audio, as well as for identification of the encapsulated data within Ogg.</t>
			</list>
		</section>
		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<t>Refer to <xref target="RFC3552"/> for a discussion of terminology used in this section.</t>
			<t>The Ogg encapsulation format is a container and only a carrier of content (such as audio, video, and displayable text data) with a very rigid definition.  This format in itself is not more vulnerable than any other content framing mechanism.</t>
			<t>Ogg does not provide for any generic encryption or signing of itself or its contained bitstreams.  However, it encapsulates any kind of binary content and is thus able to contain encrypted and signed content data.  It is also possible to add an external security mechanism that encrypts or signs an Ogg bitstream and thus provides content confidentiality and authenticity.</t>
			<t>As Ogg encapsulates binary data, it is possible to include executable content in an Ogg bitstream.  Implementations SHOULD NOT execute such content without prior validation of its origin by the end-user.  This may be an issue with applications that use Ogg for streaming or file transfer in a networking scenario.  An implementation decoding Ogg and its encapsulated data streams has to ensure correct handling of manipulated bitstreams, of buffer overflows, and similar issues.</t>
			<t>It is also possible to author malicious Ogg bitstreams, which attempt to call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate audio, etc.  Implementations SHOULD protect themselves against this kind of attack.</t>
			<t>Ogg has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically possible that metadata fields or media formats might be defined in the future which might be used to induce particular actions on the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional security risks.  However, this type of capability is currently not supported in the referenced specification.</t>
			<t>Implementations may fail to implement a specific security model or other means to prevent possibly dangerous operations.  Such failure might possibly be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information; such failure constitutes an unknown factor and is thus considered out of the scope of this document.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Interoperability Considerations">
			<t>The Ogg container format is device-, platform- and vendor-neutral and has proved to be widely implementable across different computing platforms through a wide range of encoders and decoders. A broadly portable <xref target="libogg">reference implementation</xref> is available under the revised (3-clause) BSD license, which is a Free Software license.</t>
			<t>The Xiph.Org Foundation has defined the specification, interoperability, and conformance, and conducts regular interoperability testing.</t>
