     A Solution Approach for AS Relationships-aware Overlay Routing
                   draft-asai-cross-domain-overlay-01

Abstract

   This document provides an idea of cross-domain traffic control in
   overlay routing such as peer-to-peer content delivery networks to
   reduce transit traffic that costs more for Internet service
   providers.  The simulation results in this document show the
   advantage of AS relationships-aware overlay routing and cross-domain
   cooperation.  This document also proposes a solution approach to take
   into account AS relationships for overlay routing, with hiding
   confidential information as much as possible.

1.  Introduction

   Peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies have been introduced into many
   systems such as content delivery networks (CDNs) and video streaming
   systems.  These P2P technologies have enabled to avoid excessive
   server load and to achieve effective and high-quality communication
   (e.g., high throughput, fault tolerance).  Today, the traffic
   generated by P2P applications become a significant amount of the
   Internet traffic [RFC5693].  Since P2P applications construct their
   own network topologies over the Internet without taking into account
   the network layer topology (i.e., layer 3 topology), these P2P
   applications frequently utilize a larger amount of network resources
   than network providers expect.  Since cross-domain links, especially
   transit links, are generally expensive than intra-domain links, this
   document focuses on cross-domain traffic.

   This document provides an idea of cross-domain traffic control in
   overlay routing to reduce transit traffic that costs more for network
   providers such as Internet service providers (ISPs).  Our simulation
   results show that P2P CDNs that are unaware of commercial
   relationships between autonomous systems (ASes) [RFC1930] utilize
   transit links more, and consequently, it is required to take into
   account commercial relationships between ASes.  This document also
   provides a solution approach to take into account commercial
   relationships between ASes, with hiding confidential information as
   much as possible.

1.1.  Terminology

   We use the following terms in this document.

1.1.1.  AS

   Autonomous System

1.1.2.  AS Relationships

   AS relationships represent commercial relationships between
   interconnected ASes.  AS relationships are categorized into two major
   types: transit and peering.

1.1.3.  Transit

   Transit is a type of AS relationships.  Transit relationships are
   also called provider-customer relationships.  A customer AS purchases
   Internet access from its transit providers over transit links by
   paying some amount of money according to the actual bandwidth usage.

Internet-Draft   AS Relationships-aware Overlay Routing    December 2010


1.1.4.  Peering

   Peering is a type of AS relationships, and the relationships between
   two peering ASes are equal relationships.  Traffic exchanged over
   peering links is free of charge.

1.1.5.  Overlay Network

   Overlay networks are constructed by application-layer nodes such as
   P2P application nodes over the Internet (i.e., IP network) that is
   operated by network providers.  The topology and routing of overlay
   networks are controlled by applications that construct overlay
   networks but not by network providers.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Problem Statement

   The Internet consists of thousands of ASes operated by distinct
   network providers such as commercial ISPs, companies and
   universities.  Each AS generally connects with multiple ASes, and
   there are distinct charging policies for each inter-AS link.  These
   charging policies are roughly categorized into two major types of
   relationships; transit (with charge) and peering (without any
   charge).  From the economical viewpoint, network providers want to
   reduce the traffic volume exchanged with transit providers as much as
   possible, and consequently, they manage the routing policies as
   explained in [Wang03].

   However, overlay networks sometimes break these routing policies and
   cause problems with cross-domain traffic.  We summarize the problems
   with overlay networks as follows.

   o  The cross-domain traffic generated by applications are neither
      controlled nor optimized on overlay networks.

   o  ASes hardly cooperate with each other in computing and fairly
      balancing cost when ASes provide some cost information to
      applications as a traffic optimization metric because charging
      policies are complicated and each AS operates its network
      autonomously.

   o  Neither AS relationships nor charging policies for transit traffic
      can be disclosed.

2.1.  Cross-Domain Traffic of Overlay Networks

   Network providers cannot control nor optimize the cross-domain
   traffic generated by applications on overlay networks.  This is
   because the traffic is controlled by a set of application-specific
   algorithms that determines overlay network topologies and traffic
   delivery paths such as peer/neighbor/path selection algorithms.

                    +------+         +------+  +------+

   AS 2 purchases Internet access from AS 1 via a transit link.  On the
    contrary, the link between AS 2 and AS 3 is peering, which is lower
          cost link from the viewpoint of AS 2 network operators.

      Figure 1: An example of AS-level topology with AS relationships

   We show an example of the problem with cross-domain traffic of
   overlay networks.  An example of interconnections of ASes and their
   relationships is shown in Figure 1.  Suppose server nodes, nodes that
   provide a certain content file, exist in both AS 3 and AS 4 and a
   client node, a node that downloads the file, in AS 2 is to retrieve
   the file from one of these server nodes, the client node should
   select a server node in AS 3 to reduce transit charge for both the
   client-node-side and server-node-side ASes, but today's client nodes
   that are unaware of AS relationships often select other server nodes.

   Moreover, on overlay networks, the connectivity of end-point nodes
   (i.e., peers) is provided by residential ISPs and most of them are
   not transit providers but transit customers.  Therefore, it is
   significantly important to control the transit traffic not to
   increase their charge to their providers though these kinds of
   application-layer traffic are hardly controlled by ISPs.

   [RFC5693] also claims this problem with cross-domain traffic in terms
   of transit cost as well as congestion in intra-domain networks.

                    Each number represents egress cost.

                Figure 2: An example of unfair cost setting

   The ALTO Working Group has worked on application-layer traffic
   optimization, and it has proposed a protocol to provide end-to-end
   cost between peers [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].  Cost computation of
   this protocol is based on P4P [Xie08] that is an oracle-based
   approach of application-layer traffic optimization.  The P4P approach
   has achieved fair utilization of network resources by setting up
   priorities automatically computed from the configuration (e.g.,
   `cost' in OSPF) in routers to links.

   However, there is a problem with these oracle-based approaches when
   they are applied to the Internet (i.e., multi-domain system).
   Charging policies for inter-AS links and exchanged traffic volume are
   so complicated that different ASes hardly cooperate with each other
   in computing and fairly balancing cost.  This is because each AS aims
   to maximize its income and minimize its expense.  This problem is
   similar to so-called hot-potato problems.  For example, suppose
   egress cost of each inter-AS link is configured autonomously (i.e.,
   each AS sets cost according to its own policies) as shown in
   Figure 2, then the accumulated cost of the path from AS 4 to AS 2
   becomes larger than that of the path from AS 3 to AS 2 though the
   path from AS 3 to AS 2 seems to be better than the other.  On the
   other hand, when we consider ingress cost setting, cost on the source
   is ignored.  Thus, oracle-based approaches hardly achieve fair
   traffic optimization among multiple autonomous domains because the
   Internet is autonomously operated by each AS.

2.3.  Non-disclosure AS Relationships

   To enable AS relationships-aware overlay routing, applications should
   take into account AS relationships or charging policies among ASes.
   So, cross-domain cost is required to be unveiled or estimated, and
   provided.  The ALTO protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] provides end-
   to-end cost based on P4P [Xie08], but it does not mention how to
   cooperate with each AS.

Internet-Draft   AS Relationships-aware Overlay Routing    December 2010


   Interconnections between ASes are established by commercial
   contracts, and consequently, most ISPs cannot disclose their
   commercial relationships.  Hence, there is a difficulty in applying
   the approach of cross-domain cost computation in P4P to the real
   Internet because issues on disclosing topology information such as
   confidential commercial contracts lie upon it.  Even though ASes can
   exchange the cost of cross-domain links, the problem with cross-
   domain cooperation described in Section 2.2 still exists.

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

                 Table 1: Problems with the ALTO approach

   The ALTO approach mainly defines intra-domain traffic optimization,
   and consequently, it does not focus on the cross-domain cooperation.
   We summarize problems with the ALTO approach in Table 1.

3.  Simulation Results: Oracle-based Naive Approach

   To point out the problems with cross-domain traffic and cooperation,
   we evaluate cross-domain traffic of a P2P CDN with a trace-driven
   simulation.

   We had collected a list of peers from a tracker
   (http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/announce) every minute from 23/10/
   2009 to 19/12/2009 for the content: Debian Linux DVD image; debian-
   503-i386-DVD-1.iso (4.4GB).  The collected list contains sets of
   peer's IP address and port number.  We generated a trace for the
   trace-driven simulation according to the method described in
   [Asai10-1].  By using a trace-driven simulator [Asai10-1] with this
   trace, we compute exchanged cross-domain traffic volume of ASes
   providing the Internet connectivity to peers.  Note that the piece
   size is set to 1 in this simulation and other parameters follow
   [Asai10-1].

   We evaluate five oracle-based peer selection algorithms in the P2P
   CDN; 1) Random, 2) AS hops, 3) Selfish, 4) Gentle, and 5)
   Cooperative. ``Random'' and ``AS hops'' are algorithms to randomly
   select a peer and to select a peer minimizing AS hops between source
   and destination, respectively. ``Selfish'' is an algorithm to select
   a peer minimizing expense of ASes accommodating download peers (based
   on a download-side policy); i.e., ``intra-domain'' is the highest
   priority, followed by ``from customer'', ``from peer'' and ``from
   provider''. ``Gentle'' is an algorithm to select a peer maximizing
   profit of ASes accommodating upload peers (based on an upload-side
   policy); i.e., ``intra-domain'' is the highest priority, followed by
   ``to customer'', ``to peer'' and ``to provider''. ``Cooperative'' is
   the intermediate between ``Selfish'' and ``Gentle''; i.e., to select
   a peer minimizing the summation of cost of both download- and upload-
   sides where the cost values of intra-domain, from/to provider,
   from/to peer, and from/to customer are 0, 3, 2, 1, respectively.

     Table 3: Simulation Results: Breakdown of total exchanged cross-
     domain traffic volume of ASes accommodating peers by types of AS
                      relationships (Upload traffic)

   We show the breakdown of total exchanged cross-domain traffic volume
   of ASes accommodating peers by types of AS relationships in Table 2
   and Table 3.  These results show that even the algorithm Selfish did
   not achieve to reduce transit traffic from providers much, and
   consequently, it is difficult to reduce much download transit
   traffic.  On the other hand, for upload traffic, algorithms Gentle
   and Cooperative significantly reduced transit traffic to providers.
   These results also indicate that the algorithm Cooperative worked
   quite well for both download and upload traffic though algorithms
   Selfish and Gentle were not good for either download or upload
   traffic.  Therefore, traffic control with cooperation between
   download- and upload-sides is required for transit traffic reduction.

4.  Solution Approach

   This section describes an approach to solve the problems which have
   been figured out in Section 2 and Section 3, and the requirements.
   In this approach, the cost computation for AS paths between any two
   ASes consists of three services, as follows.

   1.  AS path provision service: This service provides AS paths between
       two arbitrary nodes (IP addresses) to applications, and it is
       provided by each AS.

   2.  AS relationships estimation service: This service provides AS
       relationships (i.e., cross-domain cost) of any specified inter-AS
       links to applications.  This service is provided by its service
       providers which may not be ISPs but some other volunteer service
       providers.

   3.  Cost computation service: This service computes cost for an AS
       path according to an algorithm, and it is installed into each
       application.  The computed cost for the AS path would be used for
       traffic optimization.

   It is true that AS paths can be resolved from IP address-based paths,
   which can be retrieved by network management tools (e.g.,
   traceroute).  Hence, ASes do not have to provide AS paths because
   applications can resolve AS paths without support of ASes.  However,
   it is an ongoing work to assign appropriate AS numbers to
   routers [Huffaker10].  Moreover, some ISPs block ICMP packets
   including ICMP time exceed messages, and consequently, IP address-
   based paths are not always resolved.  Therefore, provision of AS
   paths by ASes is enough helpful to resolve AS paths and use them for
   AS relationships-aware application-layer traffic optimization.  Thus,
   it is recommended for each AS to be implemented.  A method for
   providing AS path to applications is described in Section 4.1.

   This approach aims to hide information on AS relationships as much as
   possible; i.e., not to disclose AS relationships.  So, it uses AS
   relationships estimated from publicly available information instead
   of AS relationships which are to be disclosed by ASes.  This document
   provide one possible estimation method and the detailed description
   follows in Section 4.2.

   Cost for a path which would be used for the traffic optimization is
   computed from the estimated AS relationships by a certain algorithm.
   This document does not define any specific algorithms but provides an
   example as an idea in Section 4.3.

   services are REQUIRED ones for taking into account AS relationships.
   AS path provision service is not mandatory but recommended one
   because this function can be alternated by other mechanisms.

   from BGP routing tables at ASes' BGP routers.  The overview of the AS
   path provision system is shown in Figure 3.  The requirements of AS
   path provision are listed below.

   o  AS path provision service discovery: A mechanism which enables
      applications to discover AS path provision servers is required.
      (This document does not define this service discovery protocol.)

   o  AS path provision service: A mechanism which enables applications
      to resolve AS path from an IP address belonging to the AS which
      provides the AS path provision service to another IP address
      belonging to an arbitrary AS via a certain protocol is required.
      Here, note that the source IP address of the request must belong
      to the AS providing the service because AS paths are retrieved
      from routing tables in BGP routers and a routing table has a
      spanning tree from the AS as root (i.e., the source AS).  (This
      document does not define the protocol.)

   o  Filter: AS path provision services can deny some requests by a
      filter to hide their information.

4.2.  AS Relationships Estimation Service

   Several AS relationships inference or estimation algorithms have been
   proposed in the research field.  There are two types of these
   algorithms; one is based on paths analysis [Gao01] and the other is
   based on differences in AS' network size [Asai10-2].

   The algorithms based on paths analysis have a difficulty in applying
   the inferred AS relationships to the cost computation because there
   are lots of missing links, which have not been inferred.  The
   algorithms based on differences in AS' network size first quantify
   the network size, then estimate the relationships.  Therefore, the
   relationships can be estimated for almost all links because one BGP
   routing table contains almost all ASes though there exist lots of
   missing links, which are not contained in the routing table but would
   be possibly observed at other points.  Thus, this document uses the
   algorithms based on differences in AS' network size.

   Here, we provide a possible estimation method.  Degree, the number of
   neighboring ASes, has been commonly used as an indicator which
   represents AS' network size.  Degree for each AS is approximately
   counted from publicly available datasets such as public BGP routing
   tables (e.g., Route Views Project [RouteViews]) and Internet routing
   registries.  If the degree of AS X is larger than that of AS Y, AS X
   is considered to be transit provider of AS Y.  If the degree of AS X
   is nearly equal to that of AS Y, the link between AS X and AS Y is
   considered to be peering.  Thus, the relationships (i.e., cost) are

   estimated from publicly available information.  Note that [Asai10-2]
   has improved the accuracy of this estimation.

            +-------------------------------------+

     Figure 4: System overview of AS relationships estimation service

   Figure 4 shows the system overview of AS relationships estimation
   service.  In this figure, the AS relationships estimation service
   calculates degree from AS adjacency datasets, which can be
   approximated from public BGP routing tables etc., and then it
   provides the estimated AS relationships from degree.  Note that
   degree can be replaced by the magnitude defined in [Asai10-2].

4.3.  Cost Computation Service

   Cost for a path is computed from the estimated AS relationships by a
   certain cost computation algorithm.  Cost computation services on
   applications compute the cost.

             +------+   +------+           +------+   +------+
             | AS S |-->| AS X |--> ... -->| AS Y |-->| AS T |
             +------+   +------+           +------+   +------+

      Suppose AS S and AS T are the source AS and the destination AS,
   respectively, on this AS path.  The cost computation algorithm takes
   into account only edge relationships, i.e., the relationships between
                     AS S and AS X, and AS Y and AS T.

            Figure 5: AS path and a cost computation algorithm

   This document provides an example of cost computation algorithms with
   a paper in research field.  There is a research on application-layer
   traffic optimization in content delivery networks for reducing
   transit traffic by taking into account the AS relationships with
   degree [Asai10-1].  In [Asai10-1], only the relationships between
   edge (i.e., source and destination) AS and their neighbors are
   considered for the cost computation.  The cost for the AS path shown
   in Figure 5 can be computed in the following equation: cost =
   {log(degree-of(S)) - log(degree-of(X))} + {log(degree-of(T)) -
   log(degree-of(Y))}.  Here, function ``degree-of(X)'' returns the
   degree of AS X, and AS relationships (i.e., cross-domain cost) for
   each inter-AS link (e.g., {log(degree-of(S)) - log(degree-of(X))} and
   {log(degree-of(T)) - log(degree-of(Y))} in Figure 5) are resolved via
   AS relationships estimation services described in Section 4.2.

   [Asai10-1] has shown from a simulation that their method has reduced
   the percentage of high-cost transit traffic (i.e., traffic from/to
   provider) in inter-domain traffic on residential ASes by 8.46
   percentage point compared to minimum AS hop selection though the
   total amount of inter-domain traffic has not been changed.

   Cost computation services run on not any servers but applications, so
   the algorithms can be modified by applications.  Note that
   application service providers can provide the cost computation
   service if they need to control the computation algorithm.

5.  Discussion

   This section discusses the cooperation with the ALTO approach.  The
   proposed solution approach in this document is applicable only for
   cross-domain cost estimation.  In another word, The proposed solution
   approach does not mention the intra-domain traffic optimization.
   This document figured out the problem with the ALTO approach for
   cross-domain cost estimation in Section 2.  Hence, the proposed
   solution approach can be used as a complementary element of the ALTO
   approach to compute cross-domain cost.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document requests that all residential ISPs should provide AS
   paths in their routing tables.  Some ISPs do not want to reveal the
   information on the AS paths because they consider that it can cause
   security problems.  On the other hand, AS paths are probably resolved
   by network management tools such as ``traceroute'' though they
   sometimes fail.  Therefore, AS path provision service can be
   OPTIONAL.

   The requirement level of AS path provision should be discussed in
   greater detail by considering the trade-off between security and
   accuracy.
