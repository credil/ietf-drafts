Abstract

   OSPFv3 includes a mechanism for supporting multiple instances on the
   same interface.  OSPFv2 could benefit from such a mechanism in order
   to support multiple routing domains on the same subnet.  The OSPFv2
   instance ID is reserved for support of separate OSPFv2 protocol
   instances.  This is different from OSPFv3 where it could be used for
   other purposes such as putting the same interface in multiple areas.
   OSPFv2 supports this capability using a separate subnet or the OSPF
   multi-area adjacency capability.

1.  Introduction

   OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] includes a mechanism for supporting multiple
   instances on the same interface.  OSPFv2 [OSPFV2] could benefit from
   such a mechanism in order to support multiple routing domains on the
   same subnet.  The OSPFv2 Interface Instance ID is reserved for
   support of separate OSPFv2 protocol instances.  This is different
   from OSPFv3 where it could be used for other purposes such as putting
   the same interface in multiple areas.  OSPFv2 supports this
   capability using a separate subnet or the OSPF multi-area adjacency
   capability [MULTI-AREA].

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPFv2 Instance Packet Encoding

   OSPFv2 currently doesn't offer a mechanism to differentiate packets
   for different instances sent and received on the same interface.  In
   support of this capability, this document introduces a modified
   packet header format with the Authentication Type field is split into
   an Instance ID and AuType.

                         The OSPFv2 Packet Header


   Version #
      The OSPF version number - 2

   Type
      The OSPF packet type as specified [OSPFV2].

   Packet length
      The length of the OSPF protocol packet in bytes.  This length
      includes the standard OSPF header.

   Router ID
      The Router ID of the packet's source.

   Area ID
      A 32-bit number identifying the area corresponding the packet as
      specified in [OSPFV2].

   Checksum
      OSPF standard checksum calculation as specified in specified in
      [OSPFV2].

   Instance ID
      Enables multiple instances of OSPF to be used on a single
      interface.  Each protocol instance would be assigned a separate
      Instance ID; the Instance ID has local subnet significance only.
      Received packets with an Instance ID not equal to one of the
      Instance IDs corresponding to one of the configured OSPF Instances
      for the receiving interface MUST be discarded.

   AuType
      OSPF authentication type as specified in specified in [OSPFV2].

   Authentication
      A 64-bit field for authentication data (dependent on the
      Authentication Type as specified in the AuType field).

3.  OSPF Interface Instance ID

   OSPF [OSPFV2] describes the conceptual interface data structure in
   section 9.  The OSPF Interface Instance ID will be added to this
   structure.  The OSPF Interface Instance ID will default to 0.  Its
   setting to a non-zero value may be accomplished through configuration
   or implied by some usage beyond the scope of this document.

3.1.  Sending and Receiving OSPF packets

   When sending OSPF packets, if the OSPF Interface Instance ID has a
   non-zero value, it will be set in the OSPF packet header.  When
   receiving OSPF packets, the OSPF Header Instance ID will be used to
   aid in demultiplexing the packet and routing it to the correct OSPF
   instance.  Received packets with an Instance ID not equal to one of
   the configured OSPF Instance IDs on the receiving interface MUST be
   discarded.

4.  State Sharing Optimizations between OSPF instances

   This is beyond the scope of this draft and is an area for further
   study.

5.  OSPFv2 Authentication Impacts

   Now that the AuType OSPFv2 header field has been reduced from 2
   octets to 1 octet, OSPF routers not supporting this specification
   will fail packet authentication for any instance other than the
   default (i.e., the Base IPv4 Unicast Instance).  This is solely due
   to the difference in field definition as opposed to any explicit
   change to OSPFv2 authentication as described Appendix D, [OSPFV2] or
   [RFC5709].  However, this is exactly what is desired since OSPF
   routers not supporting this specification should only support the
   default instance (Refer to Section 6).

6.  Backward Compatibility and Deployment Considerations

   When there are OSPF routers that support OSPF Multi-Instance
   extensions on the same broadcast capable interface as OSPF routers
   that do not, packets with non-zero OSPF header Instance IDs will be
   received by those legacy OSPF routers.  Since the non-zero Instance
   ID will be included in the AuType by these legacy OSPF routers, it
   will be misinterpreted as a mismatched authentication type and the
   packet will be dropped.  This is exactly what is expected and
   desired.

   Previously, there was concern that certain implementations would log
   every single authentication type mismatch.  Additionally, if
   ospfIfAuthFailure SNMP generation is enabled as specified in
   [OSPF-MIB], a separate trap would be generated for each received OSPF
   packet with a non-zero Instance ID.  However, discussions with
   implementers have led us to the conclusion that this is not as severe
   a problem as we'd first thought and it will be even less of a problem
   by the time the mechanism in this draft is standardized, implemented,
   and deployed.  Most implementations will dampen both the logging of
   errors and the generation of identical SNMP traps.  Hence, the more
   drastic mechanisms to avoid legacy OSPF routers from receiving
   multicast OSPF packets with non-zero Instance IDs have been removed.

7.  Security Considerations

   The enhancement described herein doesn't add any additional security
   considerations to OSPFv2.  Security considerations for OSPFv2 are
   described in [OSPFV2].

   Given that only three OSPFv2 authentication types have been
   standardized, it seems reasonable to reduce the OSPF packet header
   field to 8 bits.

8.  IANA Considerations

   A new registry will be added for OSPF Instance IDs.  The allocation
   of OSPF Instance IDs is described below.
