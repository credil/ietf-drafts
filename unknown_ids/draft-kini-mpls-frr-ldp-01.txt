Abstract          

   LDP is widely deployed in MPLS networks to signal LSPs. Since LDP
   establishes LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is
   gated by IGP's re-convergence. Mechanisms such as IPFRR and RSVP-TE
   based FRR have been used to provide faster re-route for LDP LSPs.
   However these techniques have significant complexity and/or may not
   have full coverage. In this document we describe a method to perform
   fast re-route of LDP LSPs. The goal is to have recovery
   characteristics similar to the methods in [RSVP-TE-FRR] without
   depending on additional protocols but at the same time provide full
   coverage.

1. Introduction

   LDP is a widely deployed signaling protocol in MPLS networks. It
   signals LSPs along IGP routed paths. In case of a failure in the
   network, the recovery of traffic on LDP LSPs is gated by re-
   convergence of IGPs. IGPs have relatively slower convergence since it
   is affected by factors such as link-state database flooding, re-
   computation etc. Approaches such as [IPFRR-LFA] can provide an
   alternate route that may be used by LDP. However this method does not
   provide full coverage. Other IPFRR methods such as [NOT-VIA] involve
   significant complexity. Another approach to protect LDP LSPs is to
   use RSVP-TE LSPs to the next-hop or next-next-hop and protect the LDP
   traffic by using the techniques specified in [RSVP-TE-FRR]. This has
   the complexity of deploying an additional protocol [RSVP-TE] in order
   to protect LDP LSPs.

   In this document we describe a local-repair mechanism that can
   provide fast-reroute for LDP LSPs without requiring additional
   mechanisms from other protocols. This mechanism is henceforth
   referred to as FRR-LDP. It aims to provide traffic recovery times
   similar to that provided by [RSVP-TE-FRR]. This mechanism works for a
   link-state IGP such as [OSPF] and [ISIS].

   When a failure occurs in an IGP network, traffic along a shortest-
   path LSP that is upstream from the failure gets affected. Traffic
   along the shortest-path LSP that is not upstream of the failure does
   not get affected. A backup shortest-path LSP (BSP LSP) is setup from
   the PLR to an LSR that can label-switch the traffic back along the
   shortest-path LSP that is not upstream from the failure. Such an LSR
   is referred to as the BSP Merge Point or BSP-MP. LDP is used to setup
   the BSP LSPs. The BSP LSP becomes a single hop LSP when a Loop Free
   Alternate (LFA) is present. In such cases the mechanism in [IPFRR-
   LFA] are used. The mechanisms in this draft should be used when an
   LFA is not available.

   The BSP LSPs to be setup in a network depends on the network
   topology, the failures that need to be protected and the method used
   by the PLR to protect the traffic. Link, node and SRLG failures can
   be protected by applying FRR-LDP. The different ways of applying FRR-
   LDP are described below. In all these methods none of the LSRs along
   the BSP LSP other than the PLR have to perform any special operation
   at the instant of failure in order to protect the traffic. The PLR
   pre-computes the label-operation actions to be performed on the
   failure trigger. This is due to FRR-LDP being a local protection
   mechanism.

4.1.  Per-prefix protection

   In this method BSP LSPs must be setup per prefix for every failure
   that needs to be protected. The BSP LSP can be along the shortest
   path to the prefix from the PLR, computed in the topology with the
   failure entity removed (Exclude-SPT). The BSP LSP terminates at the
   BSP MP which is the LSR along that path that is not upstream from the
   failure (at the PLR) and hence can label-switch the traffic from the
   BSP LSP to the shortest-path LSP of that prefix in the current
   network topology. All the LSRs along the BSP LSP, except the PLR,
   allocate a label for the BSP LSP. The PLR installs a label-swap
   operation on a local failure to switch the traffic from the shortest-
   path LSP of the protected prefix to the label allocated by the
   nexthop along the BSP LSP. 

   This method is illustrated through an example in Fig 1. Say all the
   links are of equal cost. Let L:X-y denote the label allocated by LSR
   X for prefix y for the shortest-path LSP. Let L:X-y-F denote the
   label allocated by LSR X for the prefix y for the failure F. These
   labels are for the BSP LSP. Consider a prefix e at LSR E. Say this
   prefix has to be protected against failure of link BE. In this case
   L:C-e-BE is a label allocated by C for the BSP LSP for the prefix p
   for the failure of link BE. Though D is the LSR that will merge the
   traffic back to the shortest-path LSP, it does not need to advertise
   a separate label since the shortest-path LSP label L:D-e can be re-

   used. A label-swap action of L:C-e-BE to L:D-e is installed by LSR C
   in its ILM. Similarly, a label L:C-e-DE is allocated by LSR C. In
   this topology two extra labels are adequate to protect against any
   failure for a prefix terminating at E.

   The label on the packet as it goes from C to E along the path C-B-E
   before the failure would be L:B-e -> L:E-e. When PLR B receives a
   trigger of link BE failure it installs a swap operation from L:B-e to
   L:C-e-BE. Thus the labels on the packet as it goes from C to E would
   be L:B-e -> L:C-e-BE -> L:D-e -> L:E-e.

4.1.1  Sharing BSP LSPs using label stacking

   The number of BSP LSPs can be greatly reduced by using label
   stacking. When the path of BSP LSPs is the same for multiple prefixes
   and/or failures, the same BSP LSP can be used using label stacking.
   The BSP MP advertises a label for the prefix to the PLR. The protocol
   mechanisms to advertise this are described later. In cases where the
   BSP MP has multiple equal-cost paths to the destination and some of
   them can go through the failure point, this label must be different
   than the shortest-path LSP label that it has allocated for that
   prefix. The label-swap operations for that label have to be set such
   that the paths taken do not go through the failure point. During a
   protection switch the PLR does a label swap of the protected LSP to
   the label advertised by the BSP MP and then pushes the label of the
   shortest-path LSP to the BSP MP.

   As a failure trigger action the PLR swaps the protected LSPs label
   with that advertised by the BSP MP for that prefix. It then pushes
   the BSP LSP label and forwards the packet.

4.1.2.  Shortest-path LSPs as BSP LSPs

   A shortest-path LSP in the current network topology from the PLR can
   also be used as a BSP LSP by applying label stacking at the PLR. This
   can be done only if such a shortest-path LSP exists and it does not

   fate-share with the failure that is being protected against. The BSP
   MP advertises a label for that prefix to the PLR. The protocol
   mechanisms to advertise this are described later. In cases where the
   BSP MP has multiple equal-cost paths to the destination and some of
   them can go through the failure point, this label must be different
   than the shortest-path LSP label that it has allocated for that
   prefix. The label-swap operations for that label have to be set such
   that the paths taken do not go through the failure point. During a
   protection switch the PLR does a label swap of the protected LSP to
   the label advertised by the BSP MP and then pushes the label of the
   shortest-path LSP to the BSP MP. Such a shortest-path LSP may be used
   to as a BSP LSP for many prefixes by first swapping with label
   specific to the prefix before pushing the label of the shortest-path
   LSP.

   In the example in Fig 1, LSR B uses the shortest-path LSP to D as the
   BSP LSP for protecting the LSP to prefix e from failure of the link
   BE. The PLR B pre-installs a failure action for link BE that it
   should first swap the label L:B-e to L:D-e and then push the label
   for the shortest-path LSP to D. In this example, there are no
   additional labels allocated for protection than the shortest-path LSP
   labels. Also multiple prefixes terminating at E can be protected
   using the same BSP LSP.

4.1.3.  Hybrid BSP using shortest-paths

   When the BSP LSP cannot use a shortest-path LSP then all the LSRs
   along the BSP LSP except the PLR must allocate labels. It is possible
   to reduce the number of labels required for the BSP LSP by
   encapsulating into shortest-path LSPs along the path of the BSP LSP.
   This further reduces the additional info needed for FRR-LDP. Details
   of this will be provided in future versions of the doc.

4.2.  Per nexthop protection

   In this method only the next-hop is protected using FRR-LDP. In this
   case label stacking must be used at the PLR before sending the packet
   to the next downstream LSR (for link protection) or the next-to-next
   downstream LSR (for node protection). For SRLG protection, it may be
   necessary to learn a label allocated by a node further downstream.
   Protocol extensions similar to record label would need to be defined
   for this.

   The BSP LSP can be along the shortest path from the PLR to the next
   downstream LSR(or next-next-hop), computed in the topology with the
   failure entity removed. The BSP MP is the LSR that label-switches
   traffic to a shortest-path LSP to that nexthop in the current network
   topology.

Internet Draft                  FRR LDP                    July 11, 2011


   The advantage of this method compared to per-prefix protection is
   that lesser number of BSP LSPs are needed. This is due to all LSPs
   that go through that nexthop being protected using a single BSP LSP.
   However the packet may take a less optimal path till the shortest-
   path re-computation is done.

   If a shortest-path LSP from the PLR to the BSP MP exists that can be
   used as the BSP-LSP, an additional level of label-stacking must be
   used. This can further reduce the number of additional labels
   required for BSP LSPs.

5. Protocol extensions

   The BSP LSP is signaled using extensions to LDP. When a BSP LSP is
   used to protect multiple prefixes (by label stacking) the label
   mapping of each of the protected prefixes needs to be advertised to
   the PLR. A targeted LDP session can be used for this. This can have
   scalability issues and hence an option to advertise it without
   targeted LDP is defined.

   The Tunneled FEC TLV indicates to the PLR the label advertised by the

5.3.  Protocol procedures

   An LSR computes the failures and prefixes for which it can act as a
   BSP MP and advertises a label mapping for the BSP LSP by including
   the Failure Element TLV and the Backup Path Vector TLV. The
   intermediate LSRs of a BSP LSP allocate labels for the BSP LSP and
   also advertise it upstream using the Backup Path Vector TLV. If label
   stacking is used BSP MP also advertises label mappings for the
   tunneled prefixes by including the Tunneled Prefix TLV in addition to
   the Failure Element TLV and the Backup Path Vector TLV. The
   intermediate LSRs do not allocate labels for this since the label is
   tunneled in a BSP LSP. They forward the label mapping using the
   Backup Path Vector TLV. The PLR installs actions for a failure
   trigger using the labels.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security
   considerations beyond those in [LDP].

7.  IANA Considerations

   New TLV types are needed for Failure Element TLV, Backup Path Vector
   TLV and Tunneled Prefix TLV.
