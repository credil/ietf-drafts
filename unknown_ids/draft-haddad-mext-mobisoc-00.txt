Internet-Draft         MIPv6 RO Mode Optimization              July 2009


1.  Introduction

   We suggest an enhancement to Mobile IPv6 protocol ([MIPv6]) based on
   introducing a social dimension within the home network.
   Consequently, our mechansim is currently limited to mobile nodes
   using the same HA (or cluster).

   The proposed enhancement enables two mobile nodes which know each
   other "fairly well" to "switch on" the RO mode without the need for
   any mobility signaling messages.

3.  Motivation and Goal

   We start by highlighting first that the stunning rapid growth of
   social networks is by itself a great motivation to investigate how to
   adapt such highly successful "trend" on current protocols which will
   sooner or later impact social networking technologies. m

   It is also well known that the RO mode enables a more efficient data
   packets exchange than the bidirectional tunneling and thus, should be
   used whenever possible unless the mobile node is not interested in
   disclosing its topological location, i.e., care-of address, for the
   CN (e.g., for privacy reasons).  However, MIPv6 RO mode requires
   exchanging a significant amount of signaling messages in order to
   establish, and periodically refresh a bidirectional security
   association (BSA) between the mobile node and the correspondent node
   (CN).  While the mobility signaling exchange severely impacts the
   handoff latency, the BSA is needed to authenticate one particular
   message only, namely the binding update (it can be argued that two
   messages are authenticated with the BSA but we note that sending a
   binding acknowledgement is not mandatory).  Last but not least, note
   that the amount of mobility signaling messages gets a boost when both
   endpoints are mobile.

   Our goal is to enable the RO mode between two mobile endpoints at
   minimum or no cost.  This means that two mobile nodes should be able
   -if they both explicitly ask for it- to switch from BT mode to RO
   mode without any signaling message exchange (i.e., in which case,
   there won't be any need for establishing a BSA).  Our optimization
   results in a much lower handoff latency when switching to the RO
   mode, the absence of BSA and all accompanying security concerns!

   While such goal may not be attainable in all situation, we limit our
   scope in this version to the case of two mobile nodes sharing the
   same HA or cluster of HAs.

4.  Protocol Description

   Our proposal enables two mobile nodes which have established mutual
   social bonds, e.g., two "buddies", to translate such relationship
   into a bidirectional 'symbiotic' relationship on a network and
   cryptographic levels.  At some particular point, the two "buddies"
   will confidentially disclose their 'symbiotic' relationship to their
   home agent, in order to request implementing a "zero signaling
   message" RO mode.

   To clarify our ideas, we consider in the following a pair of mobile
   nodes, MN1 and MN2, which fulfills our requirement, then follow their
   movements outside their shared home network.  We consider that MN1
   and MN2 have established a session and MN1 is the first to step
   outside the home network.  It follows that our proposal requires both
   mobile nodes to use the "cryptographically generated addresses"
   technique, defined in [CGA], in order to compute and auto-configure
   their IPv6 home addresses.  Establishing their mutual symbiotic
   relationship can be achieved using for example, the "Secure Neighbor
   Discovery" protocol (described in [SeND]).

   The required mutual, i.e.. bidirectional, relationship between the
   two mobile nodes is of cryptographic nature (please refer to
   [SYMBIO]) and is supposed to be established as a consequence of a
   mutual social relationship.  When MN2 establishes a unidirectional
   'symbiotic' relationship with MN1, it generates a 128-bit modifier
   from hashing MN1's public key together with a 128-bit random number
   (RAN):

   Modifier = First [128, SHA-2(PK(MN1) | RAN) ]

   MN2 confidentially notifies MN1 about the RAN used to generate its
   CGA address and MN1 stores the RAN together with MN2's CGA address.
   As mentioned earlier, such unidirectional crypto-relationship can be
   seen as the translation of the social relationship into a network and
   security layer parameters.  This means that when using its CGA
   feature with other "stranger" nodes, MN2 does not need to disclose
   the roots of the modifier used to configure its CGA address.

   It becomes clear that in order to make use of a 'symbiotic'
   relationship, the same crypto relationship should be established in
   the opposite direction, i.e., from MN1 to MN2.  Since the crypto
   relationship is secure and unidirectional, each mobile node can
   confidentially share its own part of the bidirectional relationship
   with its HA whenever needed.  For this purpose, the IPsec tunnel
   established between the MN and its HA in order to encrypt the BU
   messages is used and the "proof of relationship" is inserted in the
   first BU message sent by MN1 to its HA.  After validation, the HA

Internet-Draft         MIPv6 RO Mode Optimization              July 2009


   stores the crypto-relationship in the binding cache entry (BCE)
   created for MN1.  No further action is taken until the other part of
   the crypto-relationship is also disclosed to the HA (i.e., recall
   that a 'symbiotic' relationship is unidirectional which means that a
   mutual one requires both parties to disclose each other's RAN and
   their signatures).

   At some point in time, MN2 decides also to move outside the home
   network and sends its first BU message to update its HA with its new
   CoA.  Since MN2 is still exchanging data packets with MN1, it inserts
   in the BU message the crypto-relationship it has established earlier
   with MN1.  When validating the BU message sent by MN2, the HA checks
   if the claimed crypto-relationship with MN1 is reciprocal, i.e., if
   the one between MN1 and MN2 is already stored in MN1's corresponding
   BCE, before sending a BA message to MN2.  In case a bidirectional
   relationship is confirmed, then, and only then, can the HA send in
   parallel a BA message to MN2 in which, it includes MN1's CoA and
   another new message to MN1 (called "Neighbor Binding Update (NBU)")
   which carries MN2's freshly stored CoA.

   It follows immediately that the NBU message enjoys the same security
   level than a classic BU message sent by a MN to its HA.  This means
   that the same IPsec tunnel established between the MN and its HA can
   be used to secure the NBU message transmission as well as the
   acknowledgement message called "Neighbor Binding Acknowledgement
   (NBA)".  Note that the HA SHOULD set a new bit (called "Buddy" (B)
   bit) in the BA message sent to MN2, in order to notify it about a
   parallel update of MN1.

   The inclusion of MN1's CoA in the BA message together with sending an
   NBU message to MN1 allow both mobile nodes to quickly learn each
   other's current topological location from a "trusted" source, and to
   create the necessary binding in order to redirect their data packets
   on the optimized path.

   Note that in order to increase the overall performance, the HA can
   send multiple consecutive copies of the NBU messages until it
   receives the NBA message.

   Subsequent BU messages sent to the HA and carrying new CoAs are
   processed in the same way as the first one.  This means that the HA
   should always update the other mobile node and acknowledge the BU
   message at the same time.

   The suggested proposal can be extended to include multiple mobile
   nodes in which case the update would consist of sending one or
   multiple NBU message to the ones located outside the home network.

6.  Future Work

   Future work includes widening the scope of the suggested mechanism to
   enable mobile "buddies" attached to different home networks to
   benefit from the suggested mechanism and avoid exchanging any extra
   mobility signaling messages prior to switching to the RO mode.

7.  Security Considerations

   This proposal aims to enhance the RO mode efficiency by removing the
   need for the return routability procedure.  Consequently, RO mode
   related mobility signaling messages exchange between the mobile node
   and the correspondent node are no more required.  Removing the RR and
   its justification, i.e., the BU/BA exchange, quickly eliminates
   related threats and thus, contributes to further improving the
   overall security.  However, it should be noted again that this
   proposal is limited in its applicability to mobile nodes using the
   same home agent (or cluster of home agents).

   Our suggested mechanism introduces two new signaling messages which
   are exchanged between the MN and its HA.  These two messages do not
   introduce any new threats nor amplify existing ones as they are
   exchanged within the IPsec ESP tunnel established between the MN and
   its HA.  In addition to the tunnel encryption and integrity
   protection between the MN and the HA, there is also a mutual trust
   between the two nodes which provide enough insurance about the
   validity of the message content.  This in turn, positively impacts
   the overall security of the procedure.  However, it should be
   highlighted that the mutual trust between the MN and the HA does not
   propagate among mobile nodes sharing the same HA.

   In fact, it can be argued that a simpler way to implement our
   protocol would be to let the mobile node update its HA with the list
   of IPv6 addresses which are used by his/her buddies.  In this case,
   the HA would consider an IPv6 address as a "proof of friendship" if
   it is sent by the first MN and also by the owner of the address.  We
   argue that such approach is flawed as it can disturb the mutual trust
   between the HA and MN by allowing the latter to claim fake
   relationship with the list of selected targets' IPv6 addresses
   without any additional proof.  Opening such hole would immediately
   raise doubts about why the HA and the MN should trust each other in
   the first place!  Furthermore, having multiple mobile nodes playing
   the same trick with the HA would increase the chances of assembling a
   fake bidirectional relationship between two mobile nodes which are
   only curious about each other's current location and would lead at
   least one of them to disclose its location to the other.
