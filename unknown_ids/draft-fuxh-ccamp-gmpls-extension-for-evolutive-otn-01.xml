			<t>This document describes the extensions of GMPLS signaling to control Optical Transport Networks (OTN) including ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2, ODU4 and ODUflex. It also covers the interworking of control plane between pre-G.709 controlling and G.709 Amendment3 controlling. The control of ODUflex resizing is for further study.</t>
			<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
   			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

		<section title="GMPLS Extension for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43-Overview">
			<t>The concept of Lower Order (LO) ODUk and High Order (HO) ODUk in the G.709 Amendment3 multiplex hierarchy is introduced as same information structures but with different client signals. LO-ODUk can be considered as the service layer and the HO-ODUk can be considered as the Tunnel Layer. LO-ODUk can be multiplexed into the HO-ODUk or can be mapped directly to OTUk layer.</t>
	    <t>The LO-ODUk into HO-ODUk multiplexing and OCh into OMSn multiplexing provide a two stage multiplexing capability. ODU0 are to be transported over ODUk (k=1,2,3,4) and ODU2e are to be transported over ODUk ( k=3,3e1,3e2,4).</t>
	    <t>The ability to accommodate any client bit rate into a variable bit rate LO-ODU and map into any number of Tributary Slots of HO-ODU i.e. being agnostic to the service bit rate and provide flexibility to the mapping process creates a future proof multi service OTN evolution. ODUflex is a LO-ODU that enhances bit transparent transport over OTN. It can be of any rate of ODU0 rate or higher and has a generic capacity.</t>
	    <t>GMPLS signaling extensions for pre-G.709 has been described in [RFC4328]. It extended the Generalized Label Request, the Generalized Label and Traffic Parameter. This document give more extension for the G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43. It covers the Generalized Label, Traffic Parameters. It also give some consideration about the interworking of control plane between pre-G.709 controlling and G.709 Amendment3 controlling.</t>
	    <t>To support the application of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODU4, the extensions based on [RFC4328] are needed.  The first extension defines signal Type of these ODUk in G.709 Traffic Parameters. The second extension provides the compatible definition of ODUk Label.</t>
	    <t>ODUflex should be more further study in the future (e.g., Control of ODUflex resizing).</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Generalized Label Request">
		<t>[RFC4328] extends the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type, and G-PID (Generalized-PID) values to accommodate G.709 Recommendation [ITUT-G.709].  Signaling of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2e, ODU4, ODUflex, ODU3e1 and ODU3e2 LSP must comply with these extensions. Additional LSP Encoding Type code-point for the OTN Digital Path layer must be used for these new ODUk types LSP and their switching types belong to the TDM class.</t>
		<t>G.709 Amendment3 clarifies that the layer stack of the OTN contains a Lover Order ODU layer in which each LO-ODU signal carries a customer service instance, and a Higher Order ODU layer in which each HO-ODU signal carries a multiplex of LO-ODU signals. But the Encoding Types of LO and HO layer are aslo G.709 ODUk (Digital Path) which is defined in [RFC4328].</t>
	  <t>When the client payload is transported over the Optical Channel layer, [RFC4328] defines the Generalized-PID with respect to the LSP Encoding Type for G.709 OTUk at 2.5, 10, 40 Gbps. This G-PID type should be extended to support the transport of Digital Section at 100G Gbps.</t>
 		<section title="Traffic Parameters">
			<t>G.709 traffic parameters has been defined in [RFC4328]. The backwards compatibility must be considered. Backwards compatibility considerations for each feature will be covered in this document. The definition of Number of Virtual Components (NVC) and Multiplier (MT) is same as [RFC4328]</t>
		<section title="Signal Type (ST)">
		  <t>Pre-G.709 defines the OPU2 and OPU3 with 2.5G tributary slots multiplex structure. G.709 Amendment3 defines the OPU1, OPU2, OPU3, OPU4 with 1.25G tributary slots multiplex structure. G.sup43 defines the OPU3e1 with 2.5G tributary slots multiplex structure and OPU3e2 with 1.25G tributary slots multiplex structure.</t>
			<t>Following is the Signal Type extended for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43. Values from 0  to 8 are defined in [RFC4328]. The size of OPU2 and OPU3 tributary slots which are define in [RFC4328] is 2.5G. Other new Signal Types are extended for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43.</t>

		<section title="Backward Compatibility Considerations">		
			<t>Equipment supporting a 1.25G TS structure for OPU2 or OPU3 must be backward compatible with equipment which supports only the 2.5G TS structure. Also, the extension defined in this document is backward compatible with [RFC4328] for ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3. So the extension defined in this document is a supplement and extension of [RFC4328].</t>
			<t>In terms of G.709 Amendment3, a one-byte payload type signal is defined in the PSI[0] byte of the payload structure identifier to indicate the composition of the OPUk signal. The code points can differentiate whether the ODU multiplex structure supports 2.5G tributary slots or 1.25G tributary slots. Also, in order to be backward compatible with [RFC4328] for ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3, it needs the Signal Type charactering the ODU multiplex structure to differentiate the size of tributary slots and the Generalized Label format.</t>
			<t>When a downstream (upstream)node receive Path (Resv) message in which Signal Type (i.e., ODU1, ODU2 or ODU3) characters ODU multiplex structure supporting 2.5G tributary slots, it must identifies the Generalized Label format based on [RFC4328].</t>
			<t>When a downstream (upstream) node receive Path (Resv) message in which Signal Type (i.e., ODU1, ODU2 or ODU3) characters ODU multiplex structure supporting 1.25G tributary slots, it must identifies the Generalized Label format based on this document.</t>		
			<t>Following is a example of backward compatibility for ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3. For instance, we need to setup a ODU1 (2.5G bandwidth) LSP between node 1 and nodes 3. Node 2 must identify the Generalized Label format based on [RFC4328] after receiving the Path message. Node 2 must identify the Generalized Label format based on this document after receiving the Resv message. In other hand, node 3 must identify the Generalized Label format based on this document.</t>

	    <t>Control plane designed for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43 should have the ability to synchronously process the different Generalized Label format of ODU2 and ODU3 defined in [RFC4328] and this document. The Generalized Label format is identified by the Signal Type in Traffic Parameters.</t>

				<t>G.709 Amendment3 has been added many different client payload bit rates which are mainly based on Gigabit Ethernet. An Optical Data Unit (ODU) frame has been defined for each of these bit rates.  ODUk refers to the frame at bit rate k, where k = 0 (for 1.2G Gbps which is sepecially introduced for GE client signal), 1 (for 2.5 Gbps CBR), 2 (for 10 Gbps including CBR and GE LAN), 2e (also for 10 Gbps which is sepecially introduced for FC1200 and GE LAN client signal), 3 (for 40 Gbps including CBR and GE) or 4 (for 100 Gbps which is sepecially introduced for GE client signal). ODU0 can be mapped into ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, ODU4. ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 can be mapped into ODU4. ODU2e can be mapped into ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODU4. ODU1 can be is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU2 and OPU3. ODU2 can be is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU3.</t>
				<t>The ODUflex can be used for CBR clients and for packet clients. The existing G.709 mappings for CBR clients into ODU0, 1, 2, 3 will continue to be used. New ODUflex mappings will not be defined for these clients. The CBR ODUflex rate should be 239/238*client bit rate. The Packet ODUflex bit rate is based on an incremental number of tributary slots of the ODUk (k=2, 3, 4) expected to carry the ODUflex. The Packet ODUflex rate should be n*1.24416 Gbps+/-20ppm (1&lt;=n&lt;=80). CBR ODUflex and Packet ODUflex are transported by mapping into an integer number of TS of an OPUk (of a High Order ODUk) for k&gt;1. There is no OTUflex.</t>
				<t>Most Lower Order ODUk signals have the same number of tributary slots in all High Order ODUk(i.e. HO OPUk signals). There are however a few exceptions; the most well known is LO ODU2e (i.e. LO ODU 10.399G). ODU2e fits into 5*2.5G tributary slots of OPU3, 9*1.25G tributary slots of OPU3, or 8*1.25G tributary slots of OPU4. </t>

			<t>It was noted that VCAT is only defined currently for ODU1, ODU2, and ODU3. The draft revision of G.709 Amendment3 will not define VCAT for ODU1, ODU2e and ODU4. So there is no any necessary extension for the new ODUk signal. The label distribution rules must be same as [RFC4328].</t>

			<section title="Calculation of Label Number for ODUflex">
				<t>For an ODUflex that is based on transport of a particular physical layer client (e.g., ODU2e) the size of the ODUflex depends on that client. In general, it is a bit-synchronous mapping of the client with the ODUflex bit-rate being 239/238 times the bit-rate of the client. for this type of ODUflex, the number of tributary slots is chosen to fit. 
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				For example, ODU2e fits into 5*2.5G tributary slots of OPU3 (i.e., Five labels need to be allocated for one ODUflex connection when ODUflex is mapped into 2.5G tributary slots of ODU3), 9*1.25G tributary slots of OPU3 (i.e., Nine labels need to be allocated for one ODUflex connection when ODUflex is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU3), or 8*1.25G tributary slots of OPU4 (i.e., Eight labels need to be allocated for one ODUflex connection when ODUflex is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU4).</t>
				<t>For an ODUflex to provide flexibly sized trunks for packet transport, the granularity is selected to provide a reasonably efficient mapping into tributary slots of high order OPU2, OPU3, and OPU4. A good choice here seems to be to allow these trunks to be provisioned in sizes of n*1.24416G+/-20ppm (1&lt;=n&lt;=80). The number of labels is from 1 to 80.</t>

      <t>Interworking can probably be accomplished by requiring the new equipment to support the pre-G.709 payload mappings onto link that are attached to another equipment. One approach that may satisfy this is to represent the capacity of a link in terms of the number of timeslots and the time slot bandwidth. This can be reflected in the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor. In the this scenario, node DXC2, DXC4 and DXC5 should have the interworking capability.</t>
      <t>With the introduction of many new Lower Order ODU bit rates, TE links should be represented by means of either their bandwidth or their number of tributary slots, the bandwidth per tributary slot and the set of client ODU signals supported.

      <t>The end-to-end connection also can be setuped with multiple segment session (i.e., ODU1 LSP1, ODU1 LSP2, ODU1 LSP3, ODU1 LSP4).

      Druing setup of each segment lsp, tributary slot size should be known to control plane. One approach that may satisfy this is based on the Signal Type in Traffic Parameters. Signal Type and NMC in each segment LSP don't need to be changed any more. Following is the value of Signal Type for different segment LSP.

      editor note: If the segment LSP can be created and prepaired for stitching by signaling, the end-to-end connection is stitched to several segment LSPs (i.e., ODU1 LSP1, ODU1 LSP2, ODU1 LSP3, ODU1 LSP4). The traffic parameters of this end-to-end session is TBD.</t>
