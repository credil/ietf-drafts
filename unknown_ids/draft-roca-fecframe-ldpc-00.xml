		<abstract>
<t>
This document describes two fully-specified FEC schemes for LDPC-Staircase codes
that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.
It inherits from RFC5170 the specifications of LDPC-Staircase codes.
More specifically, these codes belong to the well-known class of "Low Density Parity Check"
codes.
They are large block FEC codes, in the sense of RFC3453, since they can efficiently deal with
a large number of source symbols. 
They are also systematic codes, since the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols.
Finally, they can perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases, since decoding is often
possible after receiving a small number of encoding symbols in addition to the strict minimum,
while keeping very high encoding and decoding throughputs with a software codec.
</t>

<t>
LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution for the protection of high bitrate
ADU flows, or when several mid-bitrate flows are protected together by a single FECFRAME
instance.
They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder or
decoder must be kept to a minimum.
</t>

<t>
The first scheme describes the use of LDPC-Staircase codes in a FECFRAME instance
in order to protect arbitrary ADU flows.
The second scheme is similar to the first scheme, with the exception that it is for
a single sequenced ADU flow.

		<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
		<!-- =========================================== -->

<t>The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes is a classic solution to improve the reliability
of unicast, multicast and broadcast Content Delivery Protocols (CDP) and applications
<xref target="RFC3453"/>.
The <xref target="FECFRAME-FRAMEWORK"/> document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
with media delivery applications, and for instance with real-time streaming media applications based
on the RTP real-time protocol.
Similarly the <xref target="RFC5052"/> document describes a generic framework to use FEC schemes
with with objects (e.g., files) delivery applications based on the ALC  <xref target="RMT-PI-ALC"/>
and NORM <xref target="RMT-PI-NORM"/> reliable multicast transport protocols.
</t>

<t>More specifically, the <xref target="RFC5053"/> (Raptor) and <xref target="RFC5170"/> (LDPC-Staircase
and LDPC-Triangle) FEC schemes introduce erasure codes based on sparse parity check matrices for object
delivery protocols like ALC and NORM.
Similarly, the <xref target="RFC5510"/> document introduces Reed-Solomon codes based on Vandermonde
matrices for the same object delivery protocols.
All these codes are systematic codes, meaning that the k source symbols are part of the n encoding symbols.
Additionally, the Reed-Solomon FEC codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes that
are optimal in terms of erasure recovery capabilities.
It means that a receiver can recover the k source symbols from any set of exactly k encoding symbols out of n.
This is not the case with either Raptor or LDPC-Staircase codes, and these codes require a certain
number of encoding symbols in excess to k.
However, this number is small in practice when an appropriate decoding scheme is used at the
receiver <xref target="SPSC08"/>.
Another key difference is the high encoding/decoding complexity of Reed-Solomon codecs compared to
Raptor or LDPC-Staircase codes.
A difference of an order of magnitude or more in terms of decoding speed is often noticed between
Reed-Solomon and LDPC-Staircase software decoders <xref target="SPSC08"/>.
<!-- <xref target="LDPC-in-pratice"/> -->
</t>

<t>
The present document focuses on LDPC-Staircase codes.
Because of their key features, these codes are a good solution for the protection of high bitrate source
flows, for instance when several mid-rate ADU flows are globally protected by a single FECFRAME instance.
They are also a good solution whenever processing requirements at a software encoder or decoder must be
kept to a minimum, no matter the ADU flow(s) bitrate.
</t>

<t>
This documents inherits from <xref target="RFC5170"/> the specifications of the core LDPC-Staircase codes.
Therefore this document specifies only the information specific to the FECFRAME context and
refers to <xref target="RFC5170"/> for the core specifications of the codes.
To that purpose, the present document introduces two schemes:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> The first scheme describes the use of LDPC-Staircase codes in a FECFRAME instance
	in order to protect arbitrary ADU flows. </t>
	<t> The second scheme is similar to the first scheme, with the exception that it is for
	a single sequenced ADU flow. </t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Finally, a publicly available reference implementation of these codes is available and distributed
under a GNU/LGPL (Lesser General Public License) <xref target="LDPC-codec"/>.

<section anchor="CommonProcedures" title="Common Procedures Related to the ADU Block and
Source Block Creation">
<!-- ================ -->
<t>
This section introduces the procedures that are used during the ADU block and the related
Source Block creation, for the various FEC schemes considered.
</t>

	<section anchor="CommonProc_problem" title="Problem Statement and Related Constraints">
	<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
Several aspects must be considered, that impact the ADU Block and Source Block creations:
<list style="symbols">
<t> the distribution of ADU sizes for the ADU flow(s) protected by the FECFRAME instance;</t>
<t> the maximum source block size (max_k parameter);</t>
<t> the potential real-time constraints, that impact the maximum ADU block size,
	since the larger the block size, the larger the decoding delay;</t>
</list>
We now detail each of these aspects.
</t>

<t>
In its most general form the FECFRAME framework and the LDPC-Staircase FEC schemes
are meant to protect a set of independent flows.
Since the flows have no relationship to one another, the ADU size of each
flow will potentially vary significantly.
Even in the special case of a single flow, the ADU sizes may largely
vary (e.g., the various frames of a "Group of Pictures (GOP) of an H.264 flow can have
different sizes).
This diversity must be addressed by the source block creation procedure since
the LDPC-Staircase FEC schemes require a constant encoding symbol size (E parameter).
</t>

<t>
The maximum source block length in symbols, max_k, depends on several parameters:
the code rate (CR), the Encoding Symbol ID (ESI) field length in the Explicit
Source/Repair FEC Payload ID (16 bits), as well as possible internal codec limitations.

More specifically, max_k cannot be larger than the following values, derived
from the ESI field size limitation, for a given code rate:
      <list style="empty">
        <t>max1_k = 2^^(16 - ceil(Log2(1/CR)))</t>
      </list> 
Some common max1_k values are:
<list style="symbols">
        <t>CR == 1 (no repair symbol): max1_k = 2^^16 = 65536 symbols</t>
        <t>1/2 &le; CR &lt; 1: max1_k = 2^^15 = 32,768 symbols</t>
        <t>1/4 &le; CR &lt; 1/2: max1_k = 2^^14 = 16,384 symbols</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Additionally, a codec MAY impose other limitations on the maximum
block size, for instance, because of a limited working memory size.
This decision MUST be clarified at implementation time, when the target
use-case is known. This results in a max2_k limitation.</t>

<t> 
Then, max_k is given by: 
      <list style="empty">
        <t>max_k = min(max1_k, max2_k)</t>
      </list>
Note that this calculation is only required at the coder, since the
actual k parameter (k &le; max_k) is communicated to the decoder through 
the Repair FEC Payload ID.
</t>

<t>
The source ADU flows usually have real-time constraints. 
It means that the maximum number of ADUs of an ADU block must not exceed a certain
threshold since it directly impacts the decoding delay.
It is the role of the developer, who knows the ADU Flow(s) real-time features, to define an
appropriate upper bound to the ADU Block size, max_B.
</t>

	</section>


	<section anchor="CommonProc_src_block_creation"
		title="Source Block Creation">
	<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
During Source Block creation, the ADU block is always encoded as
a single source block.
The creation of the ADU Block MUST take into account the constraints
mentioned in <xref target="CommonProc_problem"/>.
More specifically, the sender first defines an appropriate E value,
valid for the whole session duration and transmitted in the FSSI.
Then the sender accumulates ADUs until either (1) B equals max_B, or
(2) the corresponding k equals max_k.
As a consequence, there are a total of B &le; max_B ADUs in this ADU Block.
</t>

<t>
Then, for the ADU i, with 0 &le; i &le; B-1, 3 bytes are prepended
(<xref target="fig_src_block_creation_global_enc"/>):
<list style="symbols">
	<t>The first byte, FID[i] (Flow ID), contains the integer identifier
		associated to the source ADU flow to which this ADU
		belongs to.
		It is assumed that a single byte is sufficient, or said
		differently, that no more than 256 flows will be protected by
		a single instance of the FECFRAME framework.
	</t>
	<t>The following two bytes, L[i] (Length), contain the length of this
		ADU, in network byte order (i.e., big endian).
		This length is for the ADU itself and does not include the 
		FID[i], L[i], or Pad[i] fields.
	</t>
</list>
Zero padding is also added if needed, in field Pad[i], for alignment purposes
on source symbol boundaries. This can happen at most once per ADU.
The data unit resulting from the ADU and the F[], L[] and Pad[] fields, is called
ADU Information (or ADUI).
</t>

<t>
Thanks to the padding, a source symbol will never straddle several ADUIs.
As a direct consequence, a source symbol will never straddle several FEC Source Packets.

<t>
Note that neither the initial 3 bytes nor the optional padding
are sent over the network.
However, they are considered during FEC encoding.
It means that a receiver who lost a certain FEC Source Packet (e.g., the
UDP datagram containing this FEC source packet) will be able to recover the ADUI
if FEC decoding succeeds.
Thanks to the initial 3 bytes, this receiver will get rid of the padding (if any)
and identify the corresponding ADU flow.

<t>
The number of Repair Symbols for a given FEC Repair Packet, G, is defined as follows.
A sender can choose a G &gt; 1 in order to limit the transmission overhead due to
the various protocol headers. However G MUST be such that the corresponding IP
datagram size does not exceed the maximum Path Maximum Transmission Unit (or PMTU).
The G value is not communicated as such to the receiver(s). However a receiver
can easily calculate G by dividing the FEC Repair Packet size (minus the Repair
FEC Payload ID size) by the E parameter.
</t>
<t>
Another aspect is to define which Repair Symbols are contained in a given
FEC Repair Packet.
In any case, the Repair FEC Payload ID of a packet always refers to the first
Repair Symbol.
At a sender, the remaining Repair Symbols can be deduced from the ESI of the first
Repair Symbol by using the sender_find_ESIs_of_group() function, as specified in
<xref target="RFC5170"/>.
At a receiver, the other Repair Symbols can be deduced from the ESI of the first
Repair Symbol by using the receiver_find_ESIs_of_group() function, as specified in
<xref target="RFC5170"/>.
By using these functions, the Repair Symbols considered for a given FEC Repair Packet
are not in sequence.
The motivation is to avoid loosing several, in sequence, Repair Symbols, since this
situation is known to negatively impact erasure recover capabilities.

<section anchor="SecurityConsiderations" title="Security Considerations">
<!-- ==================================== -->


  <section title="Problem Statement">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
A content delivery system is potentially subject to many attacks.
Some of them target the network (e.g., to compromise the routing infrastructure,
by compromising the congestion control component), others target
the Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) (e.g., to compromise its normal behavior),
and finally some attacks target the content itself.
Since this document focuses on various FEC schemes, this
section only discusses the additional threats that their use within the
FECFRAME framework can create to an arbitrary CDP.
</t>

<t>
More specifically, these attacks may have several goals:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> those that are meant to give access to a confidential content (e.g., in
	  case of a non-free content),</t>
	<t> those that try to corrupt the ADU Flows being transmitted (e.g., to
	  prevent a receiver from using it),</t>
	<t> and those that try to compromise the receiver's behavior (e.g., by
	  making the decoding of an object computationally expensive).</t>
</list>
These attacks can be launched either against the data flow itself (e.g.
by sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets) or against the FEC parameters that are
sent either in-band (e.g., in the Repair FEC Payload ID) or out-of-band (e.g., in
a session description).
</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Attacks Against the Data Flow">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
First of all, let us consider the attacks against the data flow.
</t>


	<section title="Access to Confidential Objects">
	<!-- ================ -->

<t>
Access control to the ADU Flow being transmitted is typically provided by means
of encryption.
This encryption can be done within the content provider itself, by the
application (for instance by using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
<xref target="RFC3711"/>), or at the Network Layer, on a packet per packet basis
when IPSec/ESP is used <xref target="RFC4303"/>.
If access control is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED that one of these solutions be used.
Even if we mention these attacks here, they are not related nor facilitated by
the use of FEC.
</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Content Corruption">
	<!-- ================ -->

<t>
Protection against corruptions (e.g., after sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets)
is achieved by means of a content integrity verification/sender authentication scheme.
This service is usually provided at the packet level. In this case, after 
removing all forged packets, the ADU Flow may be sometimes recovered.
Several techniques can provide this source authentication/content integrity
service:
<list style="symbols">
<!--
<t> at the packet level, each packet can be digitally signed. A major limitation is
  the high computational and transmission overheads that this solution requires (unless
  perhaps if Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used).
  To avoid this problem, the signature may span a set of symbols (instead of a
  single one) in order to amortize the signature calculation.
  But if a single symbol is missing, the integrity of the whole set cannot be checked;</t>

<t> at the packet level, a Group Message Authentication Code (MAC) <xref target="RFC2104"/>
  scheme can be used, for instance by using HMAC-SHA-1 with a secret key shared by all
  the group members, senders and receivers.
  This technique creates a cryptographically secured (thanks to the secret key)
  digest of a packet that is sent along with the packet.
  The Group MAC scheme  does not create prohibitive processing load nor transmission
  overhead, but it has a major limitation: it only provides a group authentication/integrity
  service since all group members share the same secret group key, which means that each
  member can send a forged packet. It is therefore restricted to situations where
  group members are fully trusted (or in association with another technique as a
  pre-check);</t>

<t> at the packet level, Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA)
  <xref target="RFC4082"/> is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides
  a true authentication/integrity service, and does not create any prohibitive processing
  load or transmission overhead.
  Yet, checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after its reception.
  For instance, <xref target="RFC4383"/> details the use of TESLA within SRTP.XXXXXXXX</t>

-->
<t>	at the application level, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
	<xref target="RFC3711"/> provides several solutions to verify the authenticate and
	check the integrity of RTP and RTCP messages, among other services.
	For instance, associated to the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA)
	<xref target="RFC4383"/>, SRTP is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides
	a true authentication/integrity service, and does not create any prohibitive processing
	load or transmission overhead.
	Yet, checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after its reception with
	TESLA.
	Other building blocks can be used within SRTP to provide authentication/content
	integrity services.
</t>
<t>	at the Network Layer, IPSec/AH offers an integrity verification mechanism that
	can be used to provide authentication/content integrity services.
</t>
</list>
</t>


<t>
Techniques relying on public key cryptography (digital signatures and TESLA during
the bootstrap process, when used) require that public keys be securely associated
to the entities. This can be achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or by a
PGP Web of Trust, or by pre-distributing the public keys of each group member.
</t>

<t>
Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography (group MAC) require that a
secret key be shared by all group members. This can be achieved by means of a
group key management protocol, or simply by pre-distributing the secret key
(but this manual solution has many limitations).
</t>

<t>
It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security requirements and
features of the target application area, to define which solution is the most appropriate.
Nonetheless, in case there is any concern of the threat of object corruption, it is
RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques be used.
</t>
	</section>

  </section>

  <section title="Attacks Against the FEC Parameters">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
Let us now consider attacks against the FEC parameters included in the FFCI that
are usually sent out-of-band (e.g., in a session description).
Attacks on these FEC parameters can prevent the decoding of the associated object.
For instance modifying the PRNG seed or N1m3 fields will lead a receiver to consider a different
parity check matrix, i.e., a different code.
Modifying the E parameter will lead a receiver to consider bad Repair Symbols for
a received FEC Repair Packet.
</t>

<t>
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to guarantee the
FFCI integrity.
When the FFCI is sent out-of-band in a session description,
this latter SHOULD be protected, for instance by digitally signing it.
</t>

<t>
The same considerations concerning the key management aspects apply here also.
