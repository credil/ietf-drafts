      <t>
	IANA maintains the IS-IS TLV Codepoint Registry.  This registry
	documents which TLVs can appear in different types of IS-IS PDUs,
	but does not document which TLVs can be found in zero Remaining
	Lifetime LSP (a.k.a., purges).  This document extends the existing
	registry to record the set of TLVs that are permissible in purges.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The IS-IS <xref target='ISO 10589'/> routing protocol maintains a
	link state database of the topology of its routing domain by
	flooding a set of Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs).  When the
	protocol no longer needs the information stored in an LSP, it uses
	the purge mechanism to cause the Intermediate Systems (ISes) in its
	domain to discard the information contained in the LSP.  The
	process for generating purges can be found in Section 7.3.16.4 of
	<xref target='ISO 10589'/>.  This process retains only the LSP
	header, discarding any TLVs that had been carried within the LSP.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	Subsequent enhancements to IS-IS, such as <xref target='RFC5304'/>,
	amend the process of generating a purge and allow the inclusion of
	certain TLVs in purges. 
      </t>

      <t>
	This document extends the current IS-IS TLV Codepoint Registry,
	defined in <xref target='RFC3563'/>, to record the set of TLVs that
	can be found in purges.  This will serve as an aid to subsequent
	documents, which can then refer to the registry as the definitive
	list of the TLVs allowed in purges.  This will also act as an aid
	to implementors, providing them with an easily accessible
	compendium of allowable TLVs.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	This document requests that IANA modify the IS-IS 'TLV Codepoints
	Registry' by adding a column in the registry for 'Purge'.  A 'y' in
	this column indicates that the TLV for this row can be found in a
	purge.  A 'n' in this column indicates that the TLV for this row
	cannot be found in a purge.
      </t>

      <t>
	The 'Purge' column should initially contain a 'y' for TLV type 10
	(Authentication).  All other entries in this column should have an
	'n'.
      </t>
