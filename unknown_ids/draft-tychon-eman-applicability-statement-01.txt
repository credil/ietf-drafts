     1. Introduction  

        The EMAN framework describes how energy information can be 
        retrieved, controlled and monitored from IP-enabled consumers with 
        traditional methods such as Simple Network Management Protocol 
        (SNMP). In essence, the framework defines Management Information 
        Base (MIBs) for SNMP. 

        In this document, we describe typical applications of the EMAN 
        framework; we will show opportunities and limitations of the 
        framework. Furthermore, we describe other standards that are similar 
        to EMAN but addresses different domains or users.  

        EMAN will enable heterogeneous energy consumers to report their own 
        consumption, and to a lesser extent, external system to control 
        them. There are multiple scenarios where this is desirable, 
        particularly today considering the increased importance of limiting 
        consumption of finite energy resources and reducing operational 
        expenses. 

     1.1. EMAN Documents Overview 

        The EMAN working group is actively working on a series of documents.  
        (TODO: list existing documents) 
      
      
     <Tychon, et Al.>      Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 3] 
         












     Internet-Draft       EMAN Applicability Statement            March 2011 
         

         

     1.2. Energy Measurement 

        More and more devices today are able to measure and report their own 
        energy consumption. Smart power strips and some current generation 
        Power-over-Ethernet switches are already able to meter consumption 
        of the connected devices.  However, when managed and reported 
        through proprietary means, this information is not really useful at 
        the enterprise level. 

        The primary goal of EMAN is to enable reporting and management 
        within a standard framework that is applicable to the wide variety 
        of today's end devices, meters and proxies. 

        Being able to know who's consuming what, when and how at any time by 
        leveraging existing networks, and across various equipment is one 
        pillar of the EMAN framework.   

     1.3. Energy Control 

        There are many cases where reducing energy consumption is desirable, 
        such as when the demand is already high, when there's no one using 
        the resource, and so on.  

        In some cases, you can't simply turn it off without considering the 
        context. For instance you cannot turn off all phones, because some 
        still need to be available in case of emergency. You can't turn 
        office cooling off totally during non-work hours, but you can reduce 
        the comfort level, and so on. 

        In other cases, there are intermediate power levels between off and 
        on, such as standby, sleep or soft-off modes [DQERM].  

        The EMAN framework will provide a control mechanism that is 
        generalized for all devices, power states, and allows for fine-
        grained priority control, and emergency function.   

        Power control requires flexibility and support for different polices 
        and mechanisms; including centralized management with a network 
        management station, autonomous management by individual devices, and 
        alignment with dynamic demand-response mechanisms.

     Internet-Draft       EMAN Applicability Statement            March 2011 
         

     1.4. Examples  

     1.4.1. Corporate Networks 

        Corporate networks connect computers, printers, phones, network 
        equipment and other devices over local and wide area networks.  
        These networks are typically centrally managed and operate 24x7.  

        Today, no standard MIB exists for monitoring and control of energy 
        in enterprise network using SNMP. 

     1.4.2. Building Networks 

        Buildings are big energy consumers, and companies are looking into 
        ways to reduce their energy consumption, as well as to react 
        positively in case of an emergency, such as a brownout risk day. 

        While building networks may be IP enabled, most use older network 
        technologies including serial RS-485 and token ring technologies.  
        Within these networks, gateways may connect the building system 
        protocol to IP networks for management and control. 

        Air conditioning, lighting and so on can all be metered and 
        controlled using the EMAN framework. EMAN can, for instance, act as 
        a communication protocol between a presence system to deactivate the 
        cooling and phones when there's no one on the floor.  

     1.4.3. Home Energy Gateways 

        Home Energy Gateways (HEG) are devices with remote metering 
        capabilities, and will let service providers and utility companies 
        respond to demand by varying pricing according to time of usage. 

        The HEG itself may use specific protocols, but using the EMAN 
        framework, it will be able to report usage, pricing or other 
        indicators to the user using SNMP. Using a simple application on its 
        home network, the consumer is now empowered to see and decide how to 
        use energy. 

     1.4.4. Datacenters 

        Datacenters too are big energy consumers. All that equipment 
        generates heat, and heat needs to be evacuated though a HVAC 
        (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning) system. Controlling the 
        datacenter consumption means slowing down or turning off equipment 
        and cooling.

     Internet-Draft       EMAN Applicability Statement            March 2011 
         

        The EMAN framework will enable a new level of control by providing a 
        unified means of communication between heterogeneous devices over a 
        network.  

     1.4.5. Intelligent Power Strips 

        Intelligent Power Strips are power distribution units with IP 
        communication capability to remotely enable / disable a particular 
        outlet, and often have the ability to measure power consumption for 
        each outlet. 

        These devices are currently supporting either their own proprietary 
        protocol or a proprietary SNMP MIB, but EMAN will provide a uniform 
        framework designed for power control and monitoring for all vendors. 

     2. Relation of EMAN to Other Frameworks and Technologies 

        EMAN as a framework is tied with other standards and efforts in the 
        area. We will try to re-use existing standards as much as possible, 
        as well as providing control to adjacent technologies such as Smart 
        Grid. 

        We have listed most of them with a brief description of their 
        objectives and the current state. 

     2.1. IEC  

        The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed a 
        broad set of standards for power management.  Among these, the most 
        applicable to our purposes is IEC 61850, a standard for the design 
        of electric utility automation.  The abstract data model defined in 
        61850 is built upon and extends the Common Information Model (CIM). 
        The complete 61850 CIM model includes over a hundred object classes 
        and is widely used by utilities in the US and worldwide  

        This set of standards was originally conceived to automate control 
        of a substation. An electrical substation is a subsidiary station of 
        an electricity generation, transmission and distribution system 
        where voltage is transformed from high to low or the reverse using 
        transformers. While the original domain of 61850 is substation 
        automation, the extensive model that resulted has been widely used 
        in other areas, including Energy Management Systems (EMS) and forms 
        the core of many Smart Grid standards. 

        IEC TC57 WG19 is an ongoing working group to harmonize the CIM data 
        model and 61850 standards.

     Internet-Draft       EMAN Applicability Statement            March 2011 
         

        With its broad installed base and foundational data model for recent 
        smart grid efforts, it's highly advisable that the EMON model reuse 
        as much as possible from the IEC standards.  

     2.2. ISO  

        The ISO is developing an energy management standard called ISO 
        50001.  The intent of the framework is to facilitate the creation of 
        energy management programs for industrial, commercial and other 
        entities.  The standard defines a process for energy management at 
        an organization level.  It is not expected to define the way in 
        which devices report energy and consume energy. The IETF effort 
        would be complementary.   

        ISO 50001 is based on the common elements found in all of ISO's 
        management system standards, assuring a high level of compatibility 
        with ISO 9001 (quality management) and ISO 14001 (environmental 
        management). ISO 50001 benefits will include  

       - Integrating energy efficiency into management practices and 
          throughout the supply chain. 
       - Energy management best practices and good energy management 
          behaviors 
       - benchmarking, measuring, documenting, and reporting energy 
          intensity improvements and their projected impact on reductions in 
          greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
       - Evaluating and prioritizing the implementation of new energy-
          efficient technologies 

       ISO 50001 is being developed by ISO project committee ISO/PC 242, 
       Energy management and is expected to be published as an International 
       Standard by 2011.  

        http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1337 

     2.3. ANSI C12 

        The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has defined a 
        collection of power meter standards under ANSI C12.  The primary 
        standards include communication protocols (C12.18, 21 and 22), data 
        and schema definitions (C12.19), and measurement accuracy (C12.20). 
        European equivalent standards are provided by the IEC.

     Internet-Draft       EMAN Applicability Statement            March 2011 
         

        ANSI C12.20 defines accuracy classes for watt-hour meters.  Typical 
        accuracy classes are class 0.5, class 1, and class 3; which 
        correspond to +/- 0.5%, +/- 1% and +/- 3% accuracy thresholds.   

        All of these standards are oriented toward the meter itself, and are 
        therefore very specific and used by electricity distributors and 
        producers. 

        The EMON standard should be compatible with existing ANSI C.12 
        standards. 

     2.4. EnergyStar 

        The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and US Department of 
        Energy (DOE) jointly sponsor the Energy Star program.  The program 
        promotes the development of energy efficient products and practices.   

        To earn Energy Star approval, appliances in the home or business 
        must meet specific energy efficiency targets.  The Energy Star 
        program also provides planning tools and technical documentation to 
        help homeowners design more energy efficient homes. Energy Star is a 
        program; it's not a protocol or standard.  

        For businesses and data centers, Energy Star offers technical 
        support to help companies establish energy conservation practices.  
        Energy Star provides best practices for measuring current energy 
        performance, goal setting, and tracking improvement.  The Energy 
        Star tools offered include a rating system for building performance 
        and comparative benchmarks.

     2.5. DMTF  

        The DMTF has standardized management solutions for power-state 
        configuration and management of elements in a heterogeneous 
        environment.  These specifications provide physical, logical and 
        virtual system management requirements for power-state control. 

        Through various Working Group efforts these specifications continue 
        to evolve and advance in features and functionalities.  The full 
        specifications can be found at the DMTF web site:

     2.5.1. Common Information Model Profiles 

        The DMTF uses CIM-based (Common Information Model) 'Profiles' to 
        represent and manage power utilization and configuration of a 
        managed element.  The key profiles are 'Power Supply' (DSP 1015), 
        'Power State' (DSP 1027) and 'Power Utilization Management' (DSP 
        1085). 

        These profiles define monitoring and configuration of a Power 
        Managed Element's static and dynamic power saving modes, power 
        allocation limits and power states, among other features.   

        Power saving modes can be established as static or dynamic.  Static 
        modes are fixed policies that limit power to a utilization or 
        wattage limit.  Dynamic power saving modes rely upon internal 
        feedback to control power consumption. 

        Power states are eight named operational and non operational levels.  
        These are On, Sleep-Light, Sleep-Deep, Hibernate, Off-Soft, and Off-
        Hard.  Power change capabilities provide immediate, timed interval, 
        and graceful transitions between on, off, and reset power states.  
        Table 3 of the Power State Profile defines the correspondence 
        between the ACPI and DMTF power state models, although it is not 
        necessary for a managed element to support ACPI. Optionally, a 
        TransitingToPowerState property can represent power state 
        transitions in progress.

        DMTF DASH (DSP0232) has addressed the challenges of managing 
        heterogeneous desktop and mobile systems (including power) via in-
        band and out-of-band environments.  Utilizing the DMTF's WS-
        Management web services and the CIM data model, DASH provides 
        management and control of managed elements like power, CPU etc. 

        Both in service and out-of-service systems can be managed with the 
        DASH specification in a fully secured remote environment.  Full 
        power lifecycle management is possible using out-of-band management. 

     2.6. SmartGrid  

        The Smart Grid standards efforts underway in the United States are 
        overseen by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology 
        [NIST].  NIST was given the charter to oversee the development of 
        smart grid related standards by the Energy Independence and Security 
        Act of 2007.  NIST is responsible for coordinating a public-private

        partnership with key energy and consumer stakeholders in order to 
        facilitate the development of smart grid standards. 

        The smart grid standards activity (sponsored and hosted by NIST) is 
        monitored and facilitated by the SGIP (Smart Grid Interoperability 
        Panel).  This group has several sub groups called working groups.  
        These teams examine smaller parts of the smart grid.  They include 
        B2G, I2G, and H2G and others (Building to Grid; Industrial to Grid 
        and Home to Grid). 

        http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-
        sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/SGIPWorkingGroupsAndCommittees 

        When a working group detects a standard or technology gap, the team 
        seeks approval from the SGIP for the creation of a Priority Action 
        Plan (PAP).  The PAP is a private-public partnership with a charter 
        to close a specific gap.  There are currently 17 Priority Action 
        Plans (PAP).   

        PAP 10 Addresses "Standard Energy Usage Information".   

        Smart Grid standards will provide distributed intelligence in the 
        network and allow enhanced load shedding.  For example, pricing 
        signals will enable selective shutdown of non critical activities 
        during  peak-load pricing periods.  These actions can be effected 
        through both centralized and distributed management controls.   
        Similarly, brown-outs, air quality alerts, and peak demand limits 
        can be managed through the smart grid data models, based upon IEC 
        61850. 

     2.7. NAESB, ASHRAE and NEMA  

        As an output of the PAP10's work on the standard information model, 
        multiple stakeholders agreed to work on a utility centric model in 
        NAESB (North American Electric Standards Board) and the building 
        side information model in a joint effort by American Society of 
        Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and 
        National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). 

        The NAESB effort is a NAESB REQ/WEQ.  
        http://www.naesb.org/smart_grid_PAP10.asp 

        The ASHRAE effort is SPC201.   http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-
        sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/PAP17Information 

        The output of both ANSI approved SDO's is an information model.  It 
        is not a device level monitoring protocol.

     Internet-Draft       EMAN Applicability Statement            March 2011 
         

        After the ASHRAE SPC201 group formed as a result of initial work 
        done by the PAP 10, the SGIP added PAP17 in order to focus 
        specifically on in-building standards for energy using devices. 

        PAP 17 "will lead to development of a data model standard to enable 
        energy consuming devices and control systems in the customer 
        premises to manage electrical loads and generation sources in 
        response to communication with the Smart Grid. It will be possible 
        to communicate information about those electrical loads to 
        utilities, other electrical service providers, and market operators.   

        The term "Facility Smart Grid Information" is intended to convey the 
        nature of critical information originating from the customer 
        operated "facility" which deals with the representation and dynamics 
        of loads including prediction, measurement and shedding. It also 
        helps to distinguish between this PAP and that of PAP10 which deals 
        exclusively with the representation of energy usage.  

        This data model standard will complement the flow, aggregation, 
        summary, and forecasting of energy usage information being 
        standardized by NAESB in PAP10 through the definition of additional 
        distinct model components. While the NAESB standard is focusing on 
        "a single limited-scope information model" that "will not cover all 
        interactions associated with energy in the home or commercial space" 
        including, for example, load management ("Report to the SGIP 
        Governing Board: PAP10 plan," June 15, 2010), these new components 
        will address load modeling and behavior necessary to manage on-site 
        generation, demand response, electrical storage, peak demand 
        management, load shedding capability estimation, and responsive 
        energy load control."

     2.8. ZigBee  

        The "Zigbee Smart Energy 2.0 effort" currently focuses on wireless 
        communication to smart home appliances.  It is intended to enable 
        home energy management and direct load control by utilities.   

        ZigBee protocols are intended for use in embedded applications 
        requiring low data rates and low power consumption. ZigBee's current 
        focus is to define a general-purpose, inexpensive, self-organizing 
        mesh network that can be used for industrial control, embedded

        sensing, medical data collection, smoke and intruder warning, 
        building automation, home automation, etc.  

        It is not known if the Zigbee Alliance plans to extend support to 
        business class devices.  There also does not appear to be a plan for 
        context aware marking.   

        Zigbee is currently not an ANSI recognized SDO -- but they are 
        working toward formal recognition.  

     3. Limitations 

        EMAN will address the needs of the network operators in term of 
        measurement and, to a lesser extend, control over IP networks. 

        It is not the purpose of EMAN to create a new protocol stack for 
        energy-aware endpoints, but rather to create a data model to measure 
        and report energy and other metrics over SNMP. 

        Other legacy protocols may already exists (ModBus), but are not 
        designed initially to work on IP, even if in some cases it is 
        possible to transport them over IP with some limitations. 

        The EMAN framework does not aim to address questions regarding 
        Smartgrid, Electricity producers, distributors even if there is 
        obvious link between them. 

     4. Security Considerations 

        EMAN uses the SNMP protocol and is subject to its own security. More 
        specifically, SNMPv3 [RFC3411] provides important security features 
        such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. 

     4.1. SmartGrid 

        Even if discussing SmartGrid security is not the scope of this 
        document, NIST has found at least five standards that are directly 
        related to smart grid security. That includes standards from NERC, 
        IEEE, AMI System Security Requirements, UtilityAMI Home Area Network 
        System Requirements and IEC standards. 

        The SmartGrid security issue is more difficult being actually an 
        open network, spawning entire territories and devices from smart 
        meters, secondary and primary sub stations, etc.
