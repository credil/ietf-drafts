Abstract

   Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like
   operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional
   unicast DNS server.  Extended mDNS (xmDNS) extends the specification
   of mDNS to site-local scope in order to support multi-hop LANs that
   forward multicast packets but do not provide a unicast DNS service.

   Like mDNS, xmDNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to apply
   to the site-local network and specifies rules for its use.

Internet-Draft           Extended Multicast DNS               March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like
   operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional
   unicast DNS server.  Extended mDNS (xmDNS) extends the specification
   of mDNS to site-local scope in order to support multi-hop LANs that
   forward multicast packets but do not provide a unicast DNS service.

   Like mDNS, xmDNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to apply
   to the site-local network and specifies rules for its use.


2.  Conventions and Terminology Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   When this document uses the term "Multicast DNS", it should be taken
   to mean: "Clients performing DNS-like queries for DNS-like resource
   records by sending DNS-like UDP query and response packets on the
   local link over IP Multicast to UDP port 5353."

   This document uses the term "Extended Multicast DNS" to indicate the
   distribution of mDNS queries and responses to all links that comprise
   the site-local area network.  Exceptions to normal mDNS operation are
   specified in subsequent sections.

   This document uses the term "host name" in the strict sense to mean a
   fully-qualified domain name that has an IPv4 or IPv6 address record.
   It does not use the term "host name" in the commonly used but
   incorrect sense to mean just the first DNS label of a host's fully
   qualified domain name.

   A DNS (or mDNS) packet contains an IP TTL in the IP header, which is
   effectively a hop-count limit for the packet, to guard against
   routing loops.  Each Resource Record also contains a TTL, which is
   the number of seconds for which the Resource Record may be cached.
   This document uses the term "IP TTL" to refer to the IP header TTL
   (hop limit), and the term "RR TTL" or just "TTL" to refer to the
   Resource Record TTL (cache lifetime).


3.  Extended Multicast DNS Names

   Extended Multicast DNS specifies that the DNS top-level domain
   ".site." is a special domain with special semantics, namely that any

Internet-Draft           Extended Multicast DNS               March 2011


   fully-qualified domain name ending in ".site." is site-local, and
   names within this domain are meaningful only on the site-local area
   network where they originate.  This is analogous to Unique Local IPv6
   Unicast Address [RFC4291] prefixes, which are site-local and
   meaningful only on the site where they are defined.

   Any DNS query for a name ending with ".site."  MUST be sent to the
   xmDNS multicast address (224.0.0.TBD or its IPv6 equivalent
   FF05::FB).  Future versions of this document may specify a method for
   creating zones under the ".site." top-level domain and mapping these
   to alternate IPv6 multicast addresses but this is currently out of
   scope.

   Note that the ".site." and ".local." domains are functionally
   disjoint.


4.  Reverse Address Mapping

   [RFC4193] recommends that queries for D.F.IPV6.ARPA be handled
   locally.  [I-D.ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones] extends the
   recommendation to cover other well known IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA
   zones for which queries should not appear on the public Internet.

   In the absence of a unicast DNS server in the LAN, any DNS query for
   a name within the reverse mapping domain ("d.f.ip6.arpa.") for Unique
   Local IPv6 Unicast addresses [RFC4193] SHOULD be sent to the IPv6
   xmDNS link-local multicast address FF05::FB or the IPv4 xmDNS
   multicast address 224.0.0.TBD.

   [Other prefixes TBD]


5.  Querying

   All Extended Multicast DNS queries MUST be sent with a Unique Local
   IPv6 Unicast [RFC4193] source address.


6.  Responding

   All Extended Multicast DNS responses (including responses sent via
   unicast) SHOULD be sent with IP TTL set to 255.


7.  Traffic Reduction

   [TBD]

20.  IPv6 Considerations

   An IPv4-only host and an IPv6-only host behave as "ships that pass in
   the night".  Even if they are on the same Ethernet, neither is aware
   of the other's traffic.  For this reason, each physical link may have
   *two* unrelated ".site." zones, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.  Since
   for practical purposes, a group of IPv4-only hosts and a group of
   IPv6-only hosts on the same Ethernet act as if they were on two
   entirely separate Ethernet segments, it is unsurprising that their
   use of the ".site." zone should occur exactly as it would if they
   really were on two entirely separate Ethernet segments.

   A dual-stack (v4/v6) host can participate in both ".site." zones, and
   should register its name(s) and perform its lookups both using IPv4
   and IPv6.  This enables it to reach, and be reached by, both IPv4-
   only and IPv6-only hosts.  In effect this acts like a multi- homed
   host, with one connection to the logical "IPv4 Ethernet segment", and
   a connection to the logical "IPv6 Ethernet segment".  When such a
   host generates NSEC records, if it is using the same host name for
   its IPv4 addresses and its IPv6 addresses on that network interface,
   its NSEC records should indicate that the host name has both A and
   AAAA records.


21.  Security Considerations

   [TBD]


22.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated the IPv6 multicast address set FF0X::FB for
   Multicast DNS [mcast6].  The use of FF02::FB (Link-Local Scope) is



Lynn & Sturek           Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Extended Multicast DNS               March 2011


   described in [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns] and the use of
   address FF05::FB (Site-Local Scope) is defined in this document.

   When this document is published, IANA should designate a list of
   domains which are deemed to have only site-local significance, as
   described in Section 12 of this document ("Special Characteristics of
   Extended Multicast DNS Domains") [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-special-names].

   Specifically, the designated site-local domains are:

      site.
      d.f.ip6.arpa.


23.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations

   The two domains listed in Section 22 above and any names falling
   within those domains (e.g. "MyServer.site.", "b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.
   0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.d.f.ip6.arpa.",
   "www._http._tcp.site.") are special DNS names
   [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-special-names] in the following ways:

   1.  Users may use these names as they would other DNS names, entering
       them anywhere that they would otherwise enter a conventional DNS
       name, or a dotted decimal IPv4 address, or a literal IPv6
       address.

       Since there is no central authority responsible for assigning
       dot-site names, and all devices on the site-local network are
       equally entitled to claim any dot-site name, users SHOULD be
       aware of this and SHOULD exercise appropriate caution.  In an
       untrusted or unfamiliar network environment, users SHOULD be
       aware that using a name like "www.site" may not actually connect
       them to the web site they expected, and could easily connect them
       to a different web page, or even a fake or spoof of their
       intended web site, designed to trick them into revealing
       confidential information.  As always with networking, end-to-end
       cryptographic security can be a useful tool.  For example, when
       connecting with ssh, the ssh host key verification process will
       inform the user if it detects that the identity of the entity
       they are communicating with has changed since the last time they
       connected to that name.

   2.  Application software may use these names as they would other
       similar DNS names, and is not required to recognize the names and
       treat them specially.  Due to the relative ease of spoofing dot-
       site names, end-to-end cryptographic security remains important
       when communicating across a local network, just as it is when



Lynn & Sturek           Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Extended Multicast DNS               March 2011


       communicating across the global Internet.

   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD recognize these names
       as special and SHOULD NOT send queries for these names to their
       configured (unicast) caching DNS server(s).  This is to avoid
       unnecessary load on the root name servers and other name servers,
       caused by queries for which those name servers do not have useful
       non-negative answers to give, and will not ever have useful
       nonnegative answers to give.

   4.  Caching DNS servers SHOULD recognize these names as special and
       SHOULD NOT attempt to look up NS records for them, or otherwise
       query authoritative DNS servers in an attempt to resolve these
       names.  Instead, caching DNS servers SHOULD generate immediate
       NXDOMAIN responses for all such queries they may receive (from
       misbehaving name resolver libraries).  This is to avoid
       unnecessary load on the root name servers and other name servers.

   5.  Authoritative DNS servers SHOULD NOT by default be configurable
       tp answer queries for these names, and, like caching DNS servers,
       SHOULD generate immediate NXDOMAIN responses for all such queries
       they may receive.  DNS server software MAY provide a
       configuration option to override this default, for testing
       purposes or other specialized uses.

   6.  DNS server operators SHOULD NOT attempt to configure
       authoritative DNS servers to act as authoritative for any of
       these names.  Configuring an authoritative DNS server to act as
       authoritative for any of these names may not, in many cases,
       yield the expected result, since name resolver libraries and
       caching DNS servers SHOULD NOT send queries for those names (see
       3 and 4 above), so such queries SHOULD be suppressed before they
       even reach the authoritative DNS server in question, and
       consequently it will not even get an opportunity to answer them.

   7.  DNS Registrars MUST NOT allow any of these names to be registered
       in the normal way to any person or entity.  These names are
       reserved protocol identifiers with special meaning and fall
       outside the set of names available for allocation by registrars.
       Attempting to allocate one of these names as if it were a normal
       DNS domain name will probably not work as desired, for reasons 3,
       4, and 6 above.
