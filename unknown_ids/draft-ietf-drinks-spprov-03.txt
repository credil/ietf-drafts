                 Session Peering Provisioning Protocol
                      draft-ietf-drinks-spprov-03

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol for provisioning session
   establishment data into Session Data Registries and SIP Service
   Provider data stores.  The provisioned data is typically used by
   various network elements for session peering.

   This document describes the Session Peering Provisioning Protocol
   used by clients to provision registries.  The document provides a set
   of guiding principles for the design of this protocol including
   extensibility and independent transport definitions, a basic data
   model and an XML Schema Document.

1.  Introduction

   Service providers and enterprises use registries to make call or
   session routing decisions for Voice over IP, SMS and MMS traffic
   exchanges.  This document is narrowly focused on the provisioning
   protocol for these registries.  This protocol prescribes a way for an
   entity to provision session-related data into a registry.  The data
   being provisioned can be optionally shared with other participating
   peering entities.  The requirements and use cases driving this
   protocol have been documented in
   [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements].  The reader is expected to
   be familiar with the terminology defined in the previously mentioned
   document.

   Three types of provisioning flows have been described in the use case
   document: client to registry provisioning, registry to local data
   repository and registry-to-registry.  This document addresses a
   subset (client-to-registry provisioning) by defining a Session
   Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) for provisioning Session
   Establishment Data (SED) into a Registry (arrow "1" in the figure
   below).  While the other "provisioning flows" are shown below as
   separate message flows, no determination has been made for whether
   one common baseline protocol could be used for all three, or whether
   distinct protocols are required.

                     Three Registry Provisioning Flows

                                 Figure 1

   The data provisioned for session establishment is typically used by
   various downstream SIP signaling systems to route a call to the next
   hop associated with the called domain.  These systems typically use a
   local data store ("Local Data Repository") as their source of session
   routing information.  More specifically, the SED data is the set of
   parameters that the outgoing signaling path border elements (SBEs)
   need to initiate the session.  See [RFC5486] for more details.

   A "terminating" SIP Service Provider (SSP) provisions SED into the
   registry to be selectively shared with other peer SSPs.
   Subsequently, a Registry may distribute the provisioned data into
   local Data Repositories used for look-up queries (identifier -> URI)
   or for lookup and location resolution (identifier -> URI -> ingress
   SBE of terminating SSP).  In some cases, the Registry may
   additionally offer a central query resolution service (not shown in
   the above figure).

   A key requirement for the SPPP protocol is to be able to accommodate
   two basic deployment scenarios:

   1.  A Local Data Repository serves a Look-Up Function (LUF) to
       determine the target domain to assist in call routing (as
       described in [RFC5486]).  In this case, the querying entity may

       use other means to perform the Location Routing Function (LRF)
       which in turn helps determine the actual location of the
       Signaling Function in that domain.

   2.  A Local Data Repository serves both a Look-Up function (LUF) and
       Location Routing Function (LRF) to locate the SED data fully.

   In terms of protocol design, SPPP protocol is agnostic to the
   transport.  This document includes the description of the data model
   and the means to enable protocol operations within a request and
   response structure.  To encourage interoperability, the protocol
   supports extensibility aspects.

   Transport requirements are provided in this document to help with the
   selection of the optimum transport mechanism.
   ([I-D.ietf-drinks-sppp-over-soap]) identifies a SOAP transport
   mechanism for SPPP.

   This document is organized as follows:

   o    Section 2 provides the terminology;

   o    Section 3 provides an overview of the SPPP protocol, including
        the layering approach, functional entities and data model;

   o    Section 4 specifies requirements for SPPP transport protocols;

   o    Section 5 describes the base protocol data structures including
        the request and response elements (Section 5.1), the response
        codes and messages (Section 5.2) and the basic object type most
        first class objects extend from;

   o    Section 6 and Section 7 describe the main protocol commands and
        examples;

   o    Section 8 defines XML considerations that XML parsers must meet
        to conform to this specification;

   o    Section 11 normatively defines the SPPP protocol using its XML
        Schema Definition.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terms from [RFC3261], [RFC5486], use cases and
   requirements documented in [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]
   and the ENUM Validation Architecture [RFC4725].

   In addition, this document specifies the following additional terms:


   SPPP:   Session Peering Provisioning Protocol, the protocol used to
      provision data into a Registry (see arrow labeled "1." in Figure 1
      of [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]).  It is the primary
      scope of this document.


   SPDP:   Session Peering Distribution Protocol, the protocol used to
      distribute data to Local Data Repository (see arrow labeled "2."
      in Figure 1 of [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]).


   Client:   An application that supports an SPPP Client; it is
      sometimes referred to as a "Registry Client".


   Registry:   The Registry operates a master database of Session
      Establishment Data for one or more Registrants.

      A Registry acts as an SPPP Server.


   Registrant:   In this document, we extend the definition of a
      Registrant based on [RFC4725].  The Registrant is the end-user,
      the person or organization who is the "holder" of the Session
      Establishment Data being provisioned into the Registry.  For
      example, in [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements], a Registrant
      is pictured as a SIP Service Provider in Figure 2.

      A Registrant is identified by its name and an identifier in the
      data model.

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov              October 2010


   Registrar:   In this document, we also extend the definition of a
      Registrar from [RFC4725].  A Registrar performs provisioning
      operations on behalf of a Registrant by interacting with the
      Registry, in our case via the SPPP protocol defined in this
      document.

      A Registrar is identified by its name and an identifier in the
      data model.

3.  Protocol High Level Design

   This section introduces the structure of the data model and provides
   the information framework for the SPPP protocol.  An overview of the
   protocol operations is first provided with a typical deployment
   scenario.  The data model is then defined along with all the objects
   manipulated by the protocol and their relationships.

3.1.  Protocol Layering

   SPPP is a simple request/reply protocol that allows a client
   application to submit provisioning data and query requests to a
   server.  The SPPP data structures are designed to be protocol
   agnostic.  Concerns regarding encryption, non-repudiation, and
   authentication are beyond the scope of this document.  For more
   details, please refer to the Transport Protocol Requirements section.

   SPPP can be viewed as a set of layers that collectively define the
   structure of an SPPP request and response.  Layers 1 and 2, as
   detailed below, are left to separate specifications to allow for
   potentially multiple SPPP transport, envelope, and authentication
   technologies.  This document defines layers 3, 4, and 5 below.

   1.  The transport protocol layer provides a communication mechanism
       between the client and server.  SPPP can be layered over any
       transport protocol that provides a set of basic requirements
       defined in the Transport Protocol Requirements section.

   2.  The message envelope layer is optional, but can provide features
       that are above the transport technology layer but below the
       application messaging layer.  Technologies such as HTTP and SOAP
       are examples of messaging envelope technologies.

   3.  The message layer provides a simple, envelope-independent and
       transport-independent, SPPP wrapper for SPPP request and response
       messages.

   4.  The operation layer defines the set of base SPPP actions that can
       be invoked for a given object data type using an SPPP message.
       Operations are encoded using XML encoded actions and objects.

   5.  The data object layer defines the base set of SPPP data objects
       that can be included in update operations or returned in
       operation responses.

3.2.  Protocol Data Model

   The data model illustrated and described in Figure 3 defines the
   logical objects and the relationships between these objects that the
   SPPP protocol supports.  SPPP defines the protocol operations through
   which an SPPP Client populates a Registry with these logical objects.
   Various clients belonging to different Registrars may use the
   protocol for populating the Registry's data.

   The logical structure presented below is consistent with the
   terminology and requirements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements].

                              SPPP Data Model

                                 Figure 3

   The objects and attributes that comprise the data model can be
   described as follows (objects listed from the bottom up):

   o  Public Identifier:
      A public identifier is a well known attribute that is used as the
      key to perform lookup functions.  For the purposes of this
      document, a Public Identifier can be a telephone number, a range
      of telephone numbers, a PSTN Routing Number (RN), or perhaps
      another type of lookup key.

      A Public Identifier is associated with a Destination Group to
      create a logical grouping of Public Identifiers that share a
      common set of Routes.

      A TN Public Identifier may optionally be associated with zero or
      more individual Route Records.  This ability for a Public
      Identifier to be directly associated with a set of Route Records
      (e.g. target URI), as opposed to being associated with a
      Destination Group, supports the use cases where the target URI
      contains data specifically tailored to an individual TN Public
      Identifier.

   o  Telephone Number Range:
      A public identifier may represent an inclusive range of telephone
      numbers.  The TN range is defined by the first and last telephone
      number of the inclusive range.  For example, a TN range defined by
      tn=12125550000 and endTn=12125560000 means all the TNs from
      12125550000 to 12125560000 inclusive are included.

   o  Destination Group:
      A name collection of zero or more Public Identifiers that can be
      associated with one or more Route Groups for the purpose of
      facilitating the management of thier common routing information.

   o  Route Group:
      A Route Group contains a set of references to Route Records, a set
      of Destination Group references, and a set of peering organization
      identifiers.  This is used to establishe a three part
      relationships between a set of Public Identifiers and their common
      routing information (SED), and the list of peering organizations
      whose query responses may include that routing information in
      their query responses.  To support the use cases defined in
      [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements], this document defines the
      following types of Route Records: NAPTRType, NSType, and URIType.

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov              October 2010


      The sourceIdent element within a Route Group, in concert with the
      set of peering organization identifiers enables fine grained
      source based routing.  Further details about the Route Group and
      source based routing refer to the definitions and descriptions of
      the Route Group operations found later in this document.

   o  Route Record:
      A Route Record contains the data that a resolution system returns
      in response to a successful query for a Public Identifier.  Route
      Recoords are associated with a Route Group for SED that is not
      specific to a Public Identifier.
      To support the use cases defined in
      [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements], SPPP protocol defines
      three type of Route Records: URIType, NAPTRType, and NSType.
      These Route Records extend the abstract type RteRecType and
      inherit the common attribute 'priority' that is meant for setting
      precedence across the route records defined within a Route Group
      in a protocol agnostic fashion.

   o  Organization:
      An Organization is an entity that may fulfill any combination of
      three roles: Registrant, Registrar, and Peering Organization.  All
      SPPP objects are associated with two organization identifiers to
      identify each object's registrant and the registrar.  A Route
      Group object is also associated with a set of zero or more
      organization identifiers that identify the peering organizations
      whose query responses may include the routing information (SED)
      defined in the Route Records within that Route Group.

4.  Transport Protocol Requirements

   This section provides requirements for transport protocols suitable
   for SPPP.  More specifically, this section specifies the services,
   features, and assumptions that SPPP delegates to the chosen transport
   and envelope technologies.

   Two different groups of use cases are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements].  One group of use cases
   describes the provisioning of data by a client into a Registry
   (Section 3.1 of the above referenced document), while the other group
   describes the distribution of data into local data repositories
   (Section 3.2).  The current version of this document focuses on the
   first set of use cases (client to registry provisioning).

   These use cases may involve the provisioning of very small data sets
   like the modification or update of a single public identifier.  Other
   provisioning operations may deal with huge datasets like the
   "download" of a whole local number portability database to a
   Registry.

   As a result, a transport protocol for SPPP must be very flexible and
   accommodate various sizes of data set sizes.

   For the reasons outlined above, it is conceivable that provisioning
   and distributing may use different transport protocols.  This
   document focuses on the provisioning protocol.

   A few topics remain open for discussion:

   o  The ability to establish multiple connections between a client and
      server may be desirable.  If so, we may want to specify the
      relation of transactions between the various connections.

   o  Pipelining of requests is required at the SPPP protocol layer.  It
      may have impacts at the transport level that need to be outlined.

   o  Scope: the current scope of this effort is based upon having a
      connection oriented transport.  Is there any need to support a
      transport protocol with asynchronous operation?

   o  If it is required that responses arrive in the order of the
      requests, this must be specified clearly.

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov              October 2010


4.1.  Connection Oriented

   The SPPP protocol follows a model where a Client establishes a
   connection to a Server in order to further exchange provisioning
   transactions over such point-to-point connection.  A transport
   protocol for SPPP MUST therefore be connection oriented.

   Note that the role of the "Client" and the "Server" only applies to
   the connection, and those roles are not related in any way to the
   type of entity that participates in a protocol exchange.  For
   example, a Registry might also include a "Client" when such a
   Registry initiates a connection (for example, for data distribution
   to SSP).

4.2.  Request and Response Model

   Provisioning operations in SPPP follow the request - response model,
   where a transaction is initiated by a Client using a Request command,
   and the Server responds to the Client by means of a Response.

   Multiple subsequent request-response exchanges MAY be performed over
   a single connection.

   Therefore, a transport protocol for SPPP MUST follow the request-
   response model by allowing a response to be sent to the request
   initiator.

4.3.  Connection Lifetime

   Some use cases involve provisioning a single request to a network
   element - connections supporting such provisioning requests might be
   short-lived, and only established on demand.

   Other use cases involve either provisioning a huge set of data, or a
   constant stream of small updates, which would require long-lived
   connections.

   Therefore, a protocol suitable for SPPP SHOULD support short lived as
   well as long lived connections.

4.4.  Authentication

   Many use cases require the Server to authenticate the Client, and
   potentially also the Client to authenticate the Server.  While
   authentication of the Server by the Client is expected to be used
   only to prevent impersonation of the Server, authentication of the
   Client by the Server is expected to be used to identify and further
   authorize the Client to certain resources on the Server.



Mule, et al.             Expires April 25, 2011                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov              October 2010


   Therefore, an SPPP transport protocol MUST provide means for a Server
   to authenticate and authorize a Client, and MAY provide means for
   Clients to authenticate a Server.

   However, SPPP transport SHOULD also allow for unauthenticated
   connections.

4.5.  Confidentiality and Integrity

   Data that is transported over the protocol is deemed confidential.
   Therefore, a transport protocol suitable for SPPP MUST ensure
   confidentiality and integrity protection by providing encryption
   capabilities.

   Additionally, a DRINKS protocol MUST NOT use an unreliable lower-
   layer transport protocol that does not provide confidentiality and
   integrity protection.

4.6.  Near Real Time

   Many use cases require near real-time responses from the Server.
   Therefore, a DRINKS transport protocol MUST support near-real-time
   response to requests submitted by the Client.

4.7.  Request and Response Sizes

   SPPP covers a range of use cases - from cases where provisioning a
   single public identifier will create very small request and response
   sizes to cases where millions of data records are submitted or
   retrieved in one transaction.  Therefore, a transport protocol
   suitable for SPPP MUST support a great variety of request and
   response sizes.

   A transport protocol MAY allow splitting large chunks of data into
   several smaller chunks.

4.8.  Request and Response Correlation

   A transport protocol suitable for SPPP MUST allow responses to be
   correlated with requests.

4.9.  Request Acknowledgement

   Data transported in the SPPP protocol is likely crucial for the
   operation of the communication network that is being provisioned.

   Failed transactions can lead to situations where a subset of public
   identifiers (or even SSPs) might not be reachable, or situations

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov              October 2010


   where the provisioning state of the network is inconsistent.

   Therefore, a transport protocol for SPPP MUST provide a Response for
   each Request, so that a Client can identify whether a Request
   succeeded or failed.

4.10.  Mandatory Transport

   As of this writing of this revision, one transport protocol proposal
   has been provided in [I-D.ietf-drinks-sppp-over-soap].

   This section will define a mandatory transport protocol to be
   compliant with this RFC.

5.  Base Protocol Data Structures

   SPPP uses a common model and a common set of data structures for most
   of the supported operations and object types.  This section describes
   these common data structures.

5.1.  Request and Response Structures

   An SPPP client interacts with an SPPP server by using one of the
   supported transport mechanisms to send one or more requests to the
   server and receive corresponding replies from the server.  There are
   two generalized types of operations that an SPPP client can submit to
   an SPPP server, updates and queries.  The following two sub-sections
   describe the generalized data structures that are used for each of
   these two types of operations.

5.1.1.  Update Request and Response Structures

   An SPPP update request is wrapped within the <spppUpdateRequest>
   element while an SPPP update response is wrapped within an
   <spppUpdateResponse> element.  The following two sub-sections
   describe these two elements.

5.1.1.1.  Update Request

   An SPPP update request object is contained within the generic
   <spppUpdateRequest> element.




     <element name="spppUpdateRequest">
       <complexType>
         <sequence>
           <element name="clientTransId" type="spppb:TransIdType"
                    minOccurs="0"/>
           <element name="minorVer" type="spppb:MinorVerType"
                    minOccurs="0"/>
           <element name="rqst" type="spppb:BasicRqstType"
                    maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
         </sequence>
       </complexType>
     </element>

     <simpleType name="TransIdType">
       <restriction base="string"/>
     </simpleType>

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov              October 2010


     <simpleType name="MinorVerType">
       <restriction base="unsignedLong"/>
     </simpleType>



   The data elements within the <spppUpdateRequest> element are
   described as follows:

   o    clientTransId: Zero or one client generated transaction ID that,
        within the context of the SPPP client, identifies this request.
        This value can be used at the discretion of the SPPP client to
        track, log or correlate requests and their responses.  This
        value is also echoed back to the client in the SPPP update
        response.  An SPPP server will not check this value for
        uniqueness.

   o    minorVer: Zero or one minor version identifier, indicating the
        minor version of the SPPP API that the client is attempting to
        use.  This is used in conjunction with the major version
        identifier in the XML namespace to identify the version of SPPP
        that the client is using.  If the element is not present, the
        server assumes that the client is using the latest minor version
        supported by the SPPP server for the given major version.  The
        versions supported by a given SPPP server can be retrieved by
        the client using the SPPP server menu operation described later
        in the document.

   o    rqst: One or more BasicRqstType objects.  These are the actions
        that the client is requesting the SPPP server perform.  They are
        processed by the SPPP server in the order in which they are
        included in the request.  And with respect to handling error
        conditions, it is a matter of policy whether the objects are
        processed in a "stop and rollback" fashion or in a "stop and
        commit" fashion.  In the "stop and rollback" scenario, the SPPP
        server would stop processing BasicRqstType object instances in
        the request at the first error and roll back any BasicRqstType
        object instances that had already been processed for that update
        request.  In the "stop and commit" scenario the SPPP server
        would stop processing BasicRqstType object instances in the
        request at the first error but commit any BasicRqstType object
        instances that had already been processed for that update
        request.

   All update request objects extend the base type BasicRqstType.  This
   base type is defined as follows:

   An <spppUpdateResponse> contains the elements necessary for the SPPP
   client to precisely determine the overal result of the request, and
   if an error occurred, it provides information about the specific
   object, data element, or condition caused the error.

   The data elements within the SPPP update response are described as
   follows:

   o    clientTransId: Zero or one client transaction ID.  This value is
        simply an echo of the client transaction ID that SPPP client
        passed into the SPPP update request.

   o    serverTransId: Exactly one server transaction ID that identifies
        this request for tracking purposes.  This value is guaranteed to
        be unique for a given SPPP server.

   o    overallResult: Exactly one response code and message pair that
        explicitly identifies the result of the request.  See the
        Response Code section for further details.

   o    rqstObjResult: An optional response code, response message, and
        BasicRqstObject triplet.  This element will be present only if
        an object level error condition occurs, and indicates exactly
        which error condition occurred and exactly which request object
        that was passed in caused the error condition.  The contained
        BasicRqstObject is simply an echo of the request object instance
        that caused the error, while the response code and message
        indicate the error condition for this object.  See the Response
        Code section for further details.

   o    ext: This is the standard extension element for this object.
        Refer to the Extensibility section for more details.

5.1.2.  Query Request and Response Structures

   An SPPP query request is wrapped within the <spppQueryRequest>
   element while an SPPP query response is wrapped within an
   <spppQueryResponse> element.  The following two sub-sections describe
   these two element structures.

5.1.2.1.  Query Request

   An SPPP query request object is contained within the generic
   <spppQueryRequest> element.



     <element name="spppQueryRequest">
       <complexType>
         <sequence>
           <element name="minorVer" type="spppb:MinorVerType"
               minOccurs="0"/>
           <element name="rqst" type="spppb:BasicQueryRqstType"/>
         </sequence>
       </complexType>
     </element>


   The data elements within the <spppQueryRequest> element are described
   as follows:

   o    minorVer: Zero or one minor version identifier, indicating the
        minor version of the SPPP API that the client is attempting to
        use.  This is used in conjunction with the major version
        identifier in the XML namespace to identify the version of SPPP
        that the client is using.  If the element is not present, the
        server assumes that the client is using the latest minor version
        supported by the SPPP server for the given major version.  The
        versions supported by a given SPPP server can be retrieved by
        the client using the SPPP server menu operation described later
        in the document.

   o    rqst: One BasicQueryRqstType objects.  This is the query that
        the client is requesting the SPPP server perform.

   All query request objects extend the base type BasicQueryRqstType.
   This base type is defined as follows:



     <complexType name="BasicQueryRqstType" abstract="true">
       <sequence>
         <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>
     </complexType>

   type, and its only data element is described as follows:

   o    ext: This is the standard extension element for this object.
        Refer to the Extensibility section of this document for more
        details.

5.1.2.2.  Query Response

   An SPPP query response object is contained within the generic
   <spppQueryResponse> element.



     <element name="spppQueryResponse">
       <complexType>
         <sequence>
           <element name="overallResult" type="spppb:ResultCodeType"/>
           <element name="resultSet" type="spppb:BasicObjType"
              minOccurs="0" maxOccurs=" unbounded"/>
         </sequence>
       </complexType>
     </element>


   An <spppQueryResponse> contains the elements necessary for the SPPP
   client to precisely determine the overal result of the query, and if
   an error occurred, exactly what condition caused the error.

   The data elements within the SPPP query response are described as
   follows:

   o    overallResult: Exactly one response code and message pair that
        explicitly identifies the result of the request.  See the
        Response Code section for further details.

   o    resultSet: The set of zero or more objects that matched the
        query criteria.  If no objects matched the query criteria then
        this result set MUST be empty and the overallResult value MUST
        indicate success (if no matches are found for the query
        criteria, the response is considered a success).

5.2.  Response Codes and Messages

   This section contains the listing of response codes and their
   corresponding human-readable text.

   The response code numbering scheme generally adheres to the theory
   formalized in section 4.2.1 of [RFC5321]:



Mule, et al.             Expires April 25, 2011                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov              October 2010


   o    The first digit of the response code can only be 1 or 2: 1 = a
        positive result, 2 = a negative result.

   o    The second digit of the response code indicates the category: 0
        = Protocol Syntax, 1 = Implementation Specific Business Rule, 2
        = Security, 3 = Server System.

   o    The third and fourth digits of the response code indicate the
        individual message event within the category defines by the
        first two digits.

   The response codes are also categorized as to whether they are
   overall response codes that may only be returned in the
   "overallResult" data element in SPPP responses, of object level
   response codes that may only be returned in the "rqstObjResult"
   element of the SPPP responses.

           Table 1: Response Codes Numbering Scheme and Messages

   Each of the object level response messages are "parameterized" with
   the following parameters: "AttributeName" and "AttributeValue".

   The use of these parameters MUST adhere to the following rules:

   o    All parameters within a response message are mandatory and MUST
        be present.

   o    Any value provided for the "AttributeName" parameter MUST be an
        exact XSD element name of the protocol data element that the
        response message is referring to.  For example, valid values for
        "attribute name" are "dgName", "rteGrpName", "rteRec", etc.

   o    The value for "AttributeValue" MUST be the value of the data
        element to which the preceding "AttributeName" refers.

   o    Result code 2104 SHOULD be used whenever an element value does
        not adhere to data validation rules.

   o    Result codes 2104 and 2105 MUST NOT be used interchangeably.
        Response code 2105 SHOULD be returned by an update operation
        when the data element(s) used to uniquely identify a pre-
        existing object do not exist.  If the data elements used to
        uniquely identify an object are malformed, then response code
        2104 SHOULD be returned.

5.3.  Basic Object Type and Organization Identifiers

   This section introduces the basic object type that most first class
   objects derive from.

   All first class objects extend the basic object type BasicObjType
   which contains the identifier of the registrant organization that
   owns this object, the identifier of the registrar organization that
   provisioned this object, the date and time that the object was
   created by the server, and the date and time that the object was last
   modified.

   The identifiers used for registrants (rantId), registrars (rarId) and
   peering organizations (peeringOrg) are instances of OrgIdType.  The
   OrgIdType is defined as a string and all OrgIdType instances SHOULD
   follow the textual convention: "namespace:value" (for example "iana-
   en:32473").  See the IANA Consideration section for more details.

6.  Protocol Commands

   This section provides a description of each supported protocol
   command.

6.1.  Add Route Group Operation

   As described in the introductory sections, a Route Group represents a
   combined grouping of Route Records that define route information,
   Destination Groups that contain a set of Public Identifiers with
   common routing information, and the list of peer organizations that
   have access to these public identifiers using this route information.
   It is this indirect linking of public identifiers to their route
   information that significantly improves the scalability and
   manageability of the peering data.  Additions and changes to routing
   information are reduced to a single operation on a Route Group or
   Route Record , rather than millions of data updates to individual
   public identifier records that individually contain their peering
   data.

   The AddRteGrpRqstType operation creates or overwrites a Route Group
   object.  If a Route Group with the given name and registrant ID
   (which together comprise the unique key or a Route Group) does not
   exist, then the server MUST create the Route Group.  If a Route Group
   with the given name and registrant ID does exist, then the server
   MUST replace the current properties of the Route Group with the
   properties passed into the AddRteGrpRqstType operation.  The XSD
   declarations of the AddRteGrpRqstType operation request object are as
   follows:



     <complexType name="AddRteGrpRqstType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:BasicRqstType">
           <sequence>
             <element name="rteGrp" type="spppb:RteGrpType"/>
           </sequence>
         </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   The element passed into the spppUpdateRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of AddRteGrpRqstType, which extends
   BasicRqstType and contains one RteGrpType object.  The RteGrpType
   object structure is defined as follows:

        <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType" minOccurs="0"/>
      </sequence>
    </complexType>


   The RteGrpType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType which contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        ID of the registrar organization that provisioned this object,
        the date and time that the object was created by the server, and
        the date and time that the object was last modified.  If the
        client passes in either the created date or the modification
        date, the server will ignore them.  The server sets these two
        date/time values.

   o    rteGrpName: The character string that contains the name of the
        Route Group.  It uniquely identifies this object within the
        context of the registrant ID (a child element of the base
        element as described above).

   o    rteRecRef: Set of zero or more objects of type RteRecRefType
        that house the unique keys of the Route Records that the the

        RteGrpType object refers to and their relative priority within
        the context of a given route group.  The associated Route
        Records contain the routing information, sometimes called SED,
        associated with this Roue Group.

   o    dgName: Set of zero or more names of DestGrpType object
        instances.  Each dgName name, in association with this Route
        Group's registrant ID, uniquely identifies a DestGrpType object
        instance whose public identifiers are reachable using the
        routing information housed in this Route Group.  An intended
        side affect of this is that a Route Group cannot provide routing
        information for a Destination Group belonging to another
        registrant.

   o    peeringOrg: Set of zero or more peering organization IDs that
        have accepted an offer to receive this Route Group's
        information.  The set of peering organizations in this list is
        not directly settable or modifiable using the addRteGrpsRqst
        operation.  This set is instead controlled using the route offer
        and accept operations.

   o    sourceIdent: Set of zero or more SourceIdentType object
        instances.  These objects, described further below, house the
        source identification schemes and identifiers that are applied
        at resolution time as part of source based routing algorithms
        for the Route Group.

   o    isInSvc: A boolean element that defines whether this Route Group
        is in service.  The routing information contained in a Route
        Group that is in service is a candidate for inclusion in
        resolution responses for public identities residing in the
        Destination Group associated with this Route Group.  The routing
        information contained in a Route Group that is not in service is
        not a candidate for inclusion in resolution responses.

   o    priority: Zero or one priority value that can be used to provide
        a relative value weighting of one Route Group over another.  The
        manner in which this value is used, perhaps in conjunction with
        other factors, is a matter of policy.

   As described above, the Route Group contains a set of references to
   route record objects.  A route record object is based on an abstract
   type: RteRecType.  The concrete types that use RteRecType as an
   extension base are NAPTRType, NSType, and URIType.  The definitions
   of these types are included the Route Record section of this

   document.

   The RteGrpType object provides support for source-based routing via
   the peeringOrg data element and more granular source base routing via
   the source identity element.  The source identity element provides
   the ability to specify zero or more of the following in association
   with a given Route Group: a regular expression that is matched
   against the resolution client IP address, a regular expression that
   is matched against the root domain name(s), and/or a regular
   expression that is matched against the calling party URI(s).  The
   result will be that, after identifying the visible Route Groups whose
   associated Destination Group(s) contain the lookup key being queried
   and whose peeringOrg list contains the querying organizations
   organization ID, the resolution server will evaluate the
   characteristics of the Source URI, and Source IP address, and root
   domain of the lookup key being queried.  The resolution server then
   compares these criteria against the source identity criteria
   associated with the Route Groups.  The routing information contained
   in Route Groups that have source based routing criteria will only be
   included in the resolution response if one or more of the criteria
   matches the source criteria from the resolution request.  The Source
   Identity data element is of type SourceIdentType, whose structure is
   defined as follows:



     <complexType name="SourceIdentType">
       <sequence>
         <element name="sourceIdentLabel" type="string"/>

   o    sourceIdentScheme: The source identification scheme that this
        source identification criteria applies to and that the
        associated sourceIdentRegex should be matched against.

   o    sourceIdentRegex: The regular expression that should be used to
        test for a match against the portion of the resolution request

   spppUpdateResponse data structure described in an earlier sections of
   this document.  For a detailed description of the spppUpdateResponse
   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.2.  Get Route Groups Operation

   The getRteGrpsRqst operation allows a client to get the properties of
   Route Group objects that a registrar organization is authorized to
   view.  The server will attempt to find a Route Group object that has
   the registrant ID and route group name pair contained in each
   ObjKeyType object instance.  If the set of ObjKeyType objects is
   empty then the server will return the list of Route Group objects
   that the querying client has the authority to view.  If there are no
   matching Route Groups found then an empty result set will be
   returned.

   The element passed into the spppQueryRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of type GetRteGrpsRqstType, which extends
   BasicRqstType and contains zero or more ObjKeyType objects.  Any
   limitation on the maximum number of objects that may be passed into
   or returned by this operation is a policy decision and not limited by
   the protocol.  The XSD declaration of the operation is as follows:



     <complexType name="GetRteGrpsRqstType">

   As described in an earlier section of this document, the result of
   any spppQueryRequest operation is an spppQueryResponse element that
   contains the overall response code and the query result set, if any.
   Refer to that section of the document for a detailed description of
   the spppQueryResponse element.

6.3.  Add Destination Group Operation

   As described in the introductory sections, a Destination Group
   represents a set of Public Identifiers with common routing
   information.

   The AddDestGrpRqstType operation creates or overwrites a Destination
   Group object.  If a Destination Group with the given name and
   registrant ID (which together comprise the unique key for a
   Destination Group) does not exist, then the server MUST create the
   Destination Group.  If a Destination Group with the given name and
   registrant ID does exist, then the server MUST replace the current
   properties of the Destination Group with the properties passed into
   the AddDestGrpsRqstType operation.  The XSD declarations of the
   operation request object are as follows:



     <complexType name="AddDestGrpRqstType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:BasicRqstType">

     </complexType>


   The element passed into the spppUpdateRequest element for this
   operation is an element of type AddDestGrpRqsttype, which extends
   BasicRqstType and contains a DestGrpType object.  The DestGrpType
   object structure is defined as follows:

        </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   The DestGrpType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType which contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        ID of the registrar organization that provisioned this object,
        the date and time that the object was created by the server, and
        the date and time that the object was last modified.  If the
        client passed in either the created date or the modification
        date, the server will ignore them.  The server sets these two
        date/time values.

   o    dgName: The character string that contains the name of the
        Destination Group.  This uniquely identifies this object within
        the context of the registrant ID (a child element of the base
        element as described above).

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   As with the responses to all update operations, the result of the
   AddDestGrpRqstType operation is contained in the generic
   spppUpdateResponse data structure described in an earlier sections of
   this document.  For a detailed description of the spppUpdateResponse
   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.4.  Get Destination Groups Operation

   The getDestGrpsRqst operation allows a client to get the properties
   of Destination Group objects that a registrar organization is
   authorized to view.  The server will attempt to find a Destination
   Group object that has the registrant ID and destination group name
   pair contained in each ObjKeyType object instance.  If there are no
   matching Destination Groups found then an empty result set will be
   returned.  If the set of ObjKeyType objects passed in is empty then
   the server will return the list of Destination Group objects that the
   querying registrar has the authority to view.

   As described in an earlier section of this document, the result of
   any spppQueryRequest operation is an spppQueryResponse element that
   contains the overall response code and the query result set, if any.
   Refer to that section of the document for a detailed description of
   the spppQueryResponse element.

6.5.  Add Route Group Offer Operation

   The list of peer organizations whose resolution responses can include
   the routing information contained in a given Route Group is
   controlled by the organization to which a Route Group object belongs
   (its registrant), and the peer organization that submits resolution
   requests (a data recipient, also know as a peering organization).
   The registrant offers access to a Route Group by submitting a Route
   Group Offer.  The data recipient can then accept or reject that
   offer.  Not until access to a Route Group has been offered and
   accepted will the data recipient's organization ID be included in the
   peeringOrg list in a Route Group object, and that Route Group's
   peering information become a candidate for inclusion in the responses
   to the resolution requests submitted by that data recipient.  The
   AddRteGrpOffersRqstType operation creates or overwrites one or more
   Route Group Offer objects.  If a Route Group Offer for the given
   Route Group object key and the offeredToOrg ID does not exist, then
   the server creates the Route Group Offer object.  If a such a Route
   Group Offer does exist, then the server replaces the current object
   with the new object.  The XSD declarations of the operation request
   object are as follows:

   The RteGrpOfferType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType which contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        ID of the registrar organization that provisioned this object,
        the date and time that the object was created by the server, and
        the date and time that the object was last modified.  If the
        client passed in either the created date or the modification
        date, the will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time
        values.

   o    rteGrpOfferKey: The object that identifies the route that is or
        has been offered and the organization that it is or has been
        offered to.  The combination of these three data elements
        uniquely identify a Route Group Offer.

   o    status: The status of the offer, offered or accepted.  This
        status is controlled by the server.  It is automatically set to
        "offered" when ever a new Route Group Offer is added, and is
        automatically set to "accepted" if and when that offer is
        accepted.  The value of the element is ignored when passed in by
        the client.

   o    offerDateTime: Date and time in GMT when the Route Group Offer
        was added.

   o    acceptDateTime: Date and time in GMT when the Route Group Offer
        was accepted.

   As with the responses to all update operations, the result of the
   AddRteGrpOfferRqstType operation is contained in the generic

   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.6.  Accept Route Group Offer Operation

   Not until access to a Route Group has been offered and accepted will
   the data recipient's organization ID will it be included in the
   peeringOrg list in that Route Group object, and that Route Group's
   peering information become a candidate for inclusion in the responses
   to the resolution requests submitted by that data recipient.  The
   AcceptRteGrpOffersRqstType operation is called by, or on behalf of,
   the data recipient to accept a Route Group Offer that is pending in
   the "offered" status for the data recipient's organization ID.  If a
   Route Group Offer for the given Route Group Offer key (route name,
   route registrant ID, data recipient's organization ID) exists, then
   the server moves the Route Group Offer to the "accepted" status and

   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.7.  Reject Route Group Offer Operation

   The data recipient to which a Route Group has been offered has the
   option of rejecting a Route Group Offer.  Furthermore, that offer may
   be rejected, regardless of whether or not it has been previously
   accepted.  The RejectRteGrpOffersRqstType operation is used for these
   purposes and is called by, or on behalf of, the data recipient to
   accept a Route Group Offer that is pending in the "offered" status or
   is in the "accepted" status for the data recipient's organization ID.
   If a Route Group Offer for the given Route Group Offer key (route
   name, route registrant ID, data recipient's organization ID) exists
   in either the offered or accepted status, then the server deletes
   that Route Group Offer object, and, if appropriate, removes the data
   recipients organization ID from the list of peeringOrg IDs for that
   Route Group.  If the Route Group Offer does not exist, then the
   server returns the appropriate error code, 2105.  The XSD
   declarations for the operation request object are as follows:

6.8.  Get Route Group Offers Operation

   The getRteGrpOffersRqst operation allows a client to get the
   properties of zero or more Route Group Offer objects that registrar
   is authorized to view.  The server will attempt to find Route Group
   Offer objects that have all the properties specified in the criteria
   passed into the operation.  If no criteria is passed in then the
   server will return the list of Route Group Offer objects that the
   querying client has the authority to view.  If there are no matching
   Route Group Offers found then an empty result set will be returned.

        query criteria in the request.

   o    offeredToPeers: Zero or one boolean value that, if true,
        indicates that only offers that are offered to peering
        organizations by the querying registrant should be included in
        the result set.  If this value is false, the offers to peering
        organizations by the querying registrant should not be included
        in the result set.  The result set is also subject to other
        query criteria in the request.

   o    status: The status of the offer, offered or accepted.  Only
        offers in the specified status should be included in the result
        set.  If this element is not present then the status of the
        offer should not be considered in the query.  The result set is
        also subject to other query criteria in the request.

   o    peeringOrg: Zero or more organization IDs.  Only offers that are
        offered to or offered by the organization IDs in this list
        should be included in the result set.  The result set is also

   the spppQueryResponse element.

6.9.  Public Identifier Operations

   Public Identifier is the search key used for locating the session
   establishment data (SED).  In many cases, a Public Identifier is
   attributed to the end user who has a retail relationship with the
   service provider or registrant organization.  In SPPP, SED can be
   provisioned by the registrant, or by the registrar on behalf of the
   registrant.  Also, SPPP supports the notion of the carrier-of-record
   as defined in RFC 5067.  Therefore, the entity adding the Public
   Identity in the Registry can optionally claim to be a carrier-of-
   record.

   SPPP identifies three types of Public Identifiers: telephone number
   (TN), email address, and the routing number (RN).  SPPP provides
   structures to manage a single TN, a contiguous range of TNs, and a TN
   prefix.

   The XML schema type definition PubIDType is the generalization of the
   Public Identifier.  PubIDType is an abstract type.  In agreement with
   the data model, PubIDType member 'dgName' represents the name of the
   destination group that a given Public Identifier is associated to.
   The PubIDType object structure is defined as follows:

   BasicRqstType called AddPubIdRqstType.  To complete the add request,
   AddPubIdRqstType XML instance is added to <spppUpdateRequest> root
   element.  If there is a conflict and a Public Identifier already
   exists in the Registry, the old entry will be replaced with the newly
   provisioned entry.  For the add or update operation, the destination
   group name is a mandatory parameter.  Not including a valid
   destination group name in the update request will cause the Registry
   to return an appropriate error.

   Telephone number is identified by TNType, an extension of PubIDType.
   TNType is composed of the following attributes:

   o    tn: Telephone number to be added to the Registry.

   o    rteRecRef: Optional reference to the route record that is
        directly associated with the TN Public Identifier.  Following
        the SPPP data model, the route record could be a protocol
        agnostic URIType or another type.

   o    corInfo: corInfo is an optional parameter of type CORInfoType
        that allows the registrant organization to set forth a claim to
        be the carrier-of-record [see RFC 5067].  This is done by
        setting the value of <corClaim> element of the CORInfoType
        object structure to "true".  The other two parameters of the
        CORInfoType, <cor> and <corDateTime> are set by the Registry to
        describe the outcome of the carrier-of-record claim by the
        registrant.  In general, inclusion of <corInfo> parameter is
        useful if the Registry has the authority information, such as,
        the number portability data, etc., in order to qualify whether
        the registrant claim can be satisfied.  If the carrier-of-record
        claim disagrees with the authority data in the Registry, whether
        the TN add operation fails or not is a matter of policy and it
        is beyond the scope of this document.  In the response message
        <spppUpdateResponse>, the SPPP Server must include the <cor>
        parameter of the <corInfo> element to let the registrant know
        the outcome of the claim.

   TNType object definition is as follows:

   Routing number is identified by RNType.  SSPs that possess the number
   portability data may be able to leverage the RN search key to
   discover the ingress routes for session establishment.  Therefore,
   the registrant organization can add the RN and associate it with the
   appropriate destination group to share the route information.

   expand the number range that qualifies for Open Number Plan, the
   Registry must have the required data related to the national
   significant number length for the TNs in the TN range object.
   Further, <spppUpdateRequest> is transactional in nature, therefore,
   if the Registry encounters an error in adding even a single TN of a
   TNRType object, the whole request will be deemed a failure.  In other
   words, the partial success case is not supported.

6.10.  Egress Route Operations

   The egress route add operation allows a call originating SSP to
   define a preferred egress route in an attempt to reach the ingress
   SBE of the target SSP.  The need arises when there is a choice of
   egress SBE and an SSP wants to exercise greater control in deciding
   how to route the outbound session establishment request.

   As a first step, it is assumed that the target SSP has offered to
   share the route group that consists of the ingress route information
   to the SBE(s) and the originating SSP has accepted the offer.  Next,
   the originating SSP can add the egress route in the Registry, with
   appropriate regular expression, to rewrite ingress route information
   from the target SSP and include the egress SBE information.  In high-
   availability configurations, the originating SSP will likely add a
   secondary egress route object re-writing the same ingress route from
   the target SSP with a secondary choice of egress SBE as a backup.  In
   this case, the backup egress route definition will carry the higher
   integer value for the "pref" parameter to indicate a lower priority.

   An egress route is identified by type EgrRteType and its object
   structure is shown below:

        ID of the registrar organization that provisioned this object,
        the date and time that the object was created by the server, and
        the date and time that the object was last modified.  If the
        client passes in either the created date or the modification
        date, the server will ignore them.  The server sets these two
        date/time values.

   o    egrRteName: The name of the egress route.

   o    pref: The preference of this egress route relative to other
        egress routes that may get selected when responding to a
        resolution request.

   o    regxRewriteRule: The regular expression re-write rule that
        should be applied to the regular expression of the ingress
        NAPTR(s) that belong to the ingress route.

   o    ingrRteRec: The ingress route records that the egress route
        should be used for.

6.11.  Add Route Record Operation

   As described in the introductory sections, a Route Group represents a
   combined grouping of Route Records that define route information.
   However, Route Records need not be created to just server a single
   Route Group.  Route Records can be created and managed to serve
   multiple Route Groups.  As a result, a change to the properties of a
   network node, for example, that is used for multiple routes, would
   necessitate just a single update operation to change the properties
   of that node.  The change would then be reflected in all the Route
   Groups whose route record set contains a reference to that node.

   The AddRteRecRqstType operation creates or overwrites a Route Record
   object.  If a Route Record with the given name and registrant ID
   (which together comprise the unique key or a Route Record) does not
   exist, then the server MUST create the Route Record.  If a Route
   Record with the given name and registrant ID does exist, then the
   server MUST replace the current properties of the Route Record with
   the properties passed into the AddRteRecRqstType operation.  The XSD
   declarations of the AddRteRecRqstType operation request object are as
   follows:

   The element passed into the spppUpdateRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of AddRteRecRqstType, which extends

        the date and time that the object was last modified.  If the
        client passes in either the created date or the modification
        date, the server will ignore them.  The server sets these two
        date/time values.

   o    rrName: The character string that contains the name of the Route
        Record.  It uniquely identifies this object within the context
        of the registrant ID (a child element of the base element as
        described above).

   o    priority: Zero or one priority value that can be used to provide
        a relative value weighting of one Route Record over another.
        The manner in which this value is used, perhaps in conjunction
        with other factors, is a matter of policy.

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   As described above, route records are based on an abstract type:
   RteRecType.  The concrete types that use RteRecType as an extension
   base are NAPTRType, NSType, and URIType.  The definitions of these
   types are included below.  The NAPTRType object is comprised of the
   data elements necessary for a NAPTR that contains routing information
   for a Route Group.  The NSType object is comprised of the data
   elements necessary for a Name Server that points to another DNS
   server that contains the desired routing information.  The URIType
   object is comprised of the data elements necessary to house a URI.

   The data provisioned in a Registry can be leveraged for many purposes
   and queried using various protocols including SIP, ENUM and others.
   It is for this reason that a route record type offers a choice of URI
   and DNS resource record types.  URIType fulfills the need for both
   SIP and ENUM protocols.  When a given URIType is associated to a
   destination group, the user part of the replacement string <uri> that
   may require the Public Identifier cannot be preset.  As a SIP
   Redirect, the resolution server will apply <ere> pattern on the input
   Public Identifier in the query and process the replacement string by
   substituting any back reference(s) in the <uri> to arrive at the
   final URI that is returned in the SIP Contact header.  For an ENUM
   query, the resolution server will simply return the value of the
   <ere> and <uri> members of the URIType in the NAPTR REGEX parameter.

   o    ipAddr: Zero or more objects of type IpAddrType.  Each object
        holds an IP Address and the IP Address type, IPv4 or IP v6.

   o    ttl: Number of seconds that an addressing server may cache this
        Name Server.

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   The URIType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    ere: The POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ere) as defined in
        [RFC3986].

   o    uri: the URI as defined in [RFC3986].  In some cases, this will
        serve as the replacement string and it will be left to the
        resolution server to arrive at the final usable URI.

   As with the responses to all update operations, the result of the
   AddRteRecRqstType operation is contained in the generic
   spppUpdateResponse data structure described in an earlier sections of
   this document.  For a detailed description of the spppUpdateResponse
   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.12.  Get Route Records Operation

   The getRteRecsRqst operation allows a client to get the properties of
   Route Record objects that a registrar organization is authorized to
   view.  The server will attempt to find a Route Record object that has
   the registrant ID and route record name pair contained in each
   ObjKeyType object instance.  If the set of ObjKeyType objects is
   empty then the server will return the list of Route Record objects
   that the querying client has the authority to view.  If there are no
   matching Route Record found then an empty result set will be
   returned.

   The element passed into the spppQueryRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of type GetRteRecsRqstType, which extends
   BasicRqstType and contains zero or more ObjKeyType objects.  Any
   limitation on the maximum number of objects that may be passed into
   or returned by this operation is a policy decision and not limited by
   the protocol.  The XSD declaration of the operation is as follows:



     <complexType name="GetRteRecsRqstType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:BasicQueryRqstType">
           <sequence>
             <element name="objKey" type="spppb:ObjKeyType"
               minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
           </sequence>
         </extension>
       </complexContent>

     </complexType>


   As described in an earlier section of this document, the result of
   any spppQueryRequest operation is an spppQueryResponse element that
   contains the overall response code and the query result set, if any.
   Refer to that section of the document for a detailed description of
   the spppQueryResponse element.

6.13.  Delete Operation

   In order to remove an object from the Registry, an authorized entity
   can send the <spppUpdateRequest> to the Registry with a corresponding
   delete BasicRqstType object.  If the entity that issued the command
   is not authorized to perform this operation or if the public
   identifier doesn't exist, an appropriate error code will be returned
   in the <spppUpdateRespnonse> message.

   As an example, DelPubIdRqstType aids in identifying the Public
   Identifier that is used to delete a Public Identifier from the
   Registry.  DelPubIdsRqstType object definition is shown below:



     <complexType name="DelPubIdRqstType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:BasicRqstType">
           <sequence>
             <element name="pi" type="spppb:PubIdType"/>
           </sequence>
         </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   Similarly, each 'Add' operation in the SP protocol has a
   corresponding 'Del' operation used to delete the respective object
   type from the Registry.

7.  SPPP Examples

   This section shows XML message exchange between two SIP Service
   Providers (SSP) and a Registry.  For the sake of simplicity, the
   transport wrapper for the SPPP protocol is left out.  The SPPP
   protocol messages in this section are valid XML instances that
   conform to the SPPP schema version within this document.

   In this sample use case scenario, SSP1 and SSP2 provision resource
   data in the registry and use SPPP constructs to selectively share the
   route groups.  In the figure below, SSP2 has two ingress SBE
   instances that are associated with the public identities that SSP2
   has the retail relationship with.  Also, the two SBE instances for
   SSP1 are used to show how to use SPPP protocol to associate route
   preferences for the destination ingress routes and exercise greater
   control on outbound traffic to the peer's ingress SBEs.

7.1.  Add Destination Group

   SSP2 adds a destination group to the Registry for use later.  The
   SSP2 SPPP client sets a unique transaction identifier 'tx_7777' for
   tracking purposes.  The name of the destination group is set to
   DEST_GRP_SSP2_1

7.6.  Add LRN

   If another entity that SSP2 shares the routes with has access to
   Number Portability data, it may choose to perform route lookups by
   routing number.  Therefore, SSP2 associates a routing number to a
   destination group in order to facilitate ingress route discovery.

7.7.  Add TN Range

   Next, SSP2 activates a block of ten thousand TNs and associate it to
   a destination group.  Since the 'prefix' public identity attribute is
   not set to 'true', this means that the TNs belong to a closed number
   plan.

7.8.  Add TN Range with Open Number Plan support

   In this case, open number plan refers to TN length variance.
   Inclusion of "prefix" attribute of TNRType with its value set to true
   indicates that the start TN range identified by the <tn> element is
   not necessarily a subscriber number and the Registry will have to
   consult the number plan data for the respective country to know how
   to expand the number range. <endTn> attribute marks the end of the TN
   range.

7.10.  Enable Peering -- Route Group Offer

   In order for SSP1 to complete session establishment for a destination
   TN where the target subscriber has a retail relationship with SSP2,
   it first requires an asynchronous bi-directional handshake to show
   mutual consent.  To start the process, SSP2 initiates the peering
   handshake by offering SSP1 access to its route group.

8.  XML Considerations

   XML serves as the encoding format for SPPP, allowing complex
   hierarchical data to be expressed in a text format that can be read,
   saved, and manipulated with both traditional text tools and tools
   specific to XML.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

   This section discusses a small number of XML-related considerations
   pertaining to SPPP.

8.1.  Namespaces

   All SPPP protocol elements are defined in the namespaces in te IANA
   Considerations section and in the Formal Protocol Specification
   section of this document.

8.2.  Versioning and Character Encoding

   All XML instances SHOULD begin with an <?xml?> declaration to
   identify the version of XML that is being used, optionally identify
   use of the character encoding used, and optionally provide a hint to
   an XML parser that an external schema file is needed to validate the
   XML instance.

   Conformant XML parsers recognize both UTF-8 (defined in [RFC3629])
   and UTF-16 (defined in [RFC2781]); per [RFC2277] UTF-8 is the
   RECOMMENDED character encoding for use with SPPP.

   Character encodings other than UTF-8 and UTF-16 are allowed by XML.
   UTF-8 is the default encoding assumed by XML in the absence of an
   "encoding" attribute or a byte order mark (BOM); thus, the "encoding"
   attribute in the XML declaration is OPTIONAL if UTF-8 encoding is
   used.  SPPP clients and servers MUST accept a UTF-8 BOM if present,
   though emitting a UTF-8 BOM is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Example XML declarations:

   <?xml?> version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

9.  Security Considerations

   The transport protocol section contains some security properties that
   the transport protocol must provide so that authenticated endpoints
   can exchange data confidentially and with integrity protection.

   More details will be provided in a future revision of this document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Two URI assignments are requested.

   Registration request for the SPPP XML namespace:
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:sppp:base:1
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the XML schema:
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:sppp:1
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: See the "Formal Specification" section of this document
   (Section 11).

   IANA is requested to create a new SPPP registry for Organization
   Identifiers that will indicate valid strings to be used for well-
   known enterprise namespaces.
   This document makes the following assignments for the OrgIdType
   namespaces:



         Namespace                    OrgIdType namespace string
         ----                         ----------------------------
