Abstract

   The SigComp static dictionary for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   signalling was done by first version RFC3485.  SIP protocol related
   extensions were completed and published in a series IETF documents.
   Those SIP protocol extensions had been used in 3GPP IMS and IMS based
   applications.  The new extensions to SIP protocol weaken the
   intention of static dictionary for SIP signalling compressing which
   is to reduce overload risks in radio access network and core network
   involving wireless network

Internet-Draft  Signaling Compression dictionary for SIP       June 2009


1.  Introduction

   SIP RFC3261 [1] and SDP RFC4566 [2] are text-based protocols that use
   the UTF-8 charset (RFC3629 [3]).  SIP and SDP were designed for rich
   bandwidth links.  However, when SIP/SDP is run over narrow bandwidth
   links, such as radio interfaces.  Session setup time using this kind
   of bandwidth-limited link is a critical indication to satisfy users'
   expectations.

   The session setup time can be decreased obviously if the SIP
   signalling with SDP body is compressed.  In addition, the signalling
   compress with very high compressing ratio is expected to help radio
   access layer save radio resouces which are critical to operators.
   The signaling compression mechanisms specified in SigComp RFC3320 [4]
   provide a multiple compression/decompression algorithm framework to
   compress and decompress text-based protocols such as SIP and SDP.

   SIP UAC and UAS behaviors supporting SigComp mechanism to compress
   SIP signalling are specified in RFC3486 [7].  The static dictionary
   are SIP and SDP are introduced by RFC3485 [6] which defined static
   SIP/SDP dictionary as a SigComp state that can be referenced in the
   first SIP message.

   At this moment, the SIP protocol related extensions are likely to
   publish by IETF.  This submitted IETF draft intents to summarize the
   other SIP protocol extensions which are also expected to be included
   in static dictionary.  In the period of processing this IETF draft,
   the most of SIP protocol related method, header field, Option-tag and
   parameters can be finalized to include based on author's
   understanding.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].


3.  Discussions

   This section is to introduce the background of selecting strings,
   constructive questions and thinking for further considerations.  The
   intention of the author is to delete those discussion unrelated to
   the core purpose of this draft if this draft is recognized as helpful
   input for further development in working group.

3.1.  How these extra strings selected

   The strings to be added in static dictionary are widely and directly
   selected in published extensions to SIP protocol involving SIP WG and
   SIPPING WG.  These selected strings should be already registered in
   IANA.  Some working group drafting are possibly in review process or
   queuing process have not been added yet, but are highly expected to
   present this dictionary.  The SDP parameters which are defined in
   MMUSIC working group are also necessary extension to be added in
   dictionary.

   Some strings are connected to already defined string (e.g.
   application/****), the rest part of strings (****) are picked up and
   added in dictionary

   If it is correct, the author expected these seeing strings registered
   in IANA would be included in static dictionary for SIP signalling
   compression during discussion of this draft.  Therefore, the most of
   registered strings would be covered by this new static dictionary.

3.2.  How many extensions need to be added

   The first version RFC3485 [8] of static dictionary of Signaling
   Compression for SIP finalized the basic strings which include SIP
   protocol and SDP parameters.

   Recently IMS and IMS based applications still growth in 3GPP and OMA
   which lead the usage of SIP protocol in telecommunication level.
   SigComp with static dictionary helps operator improve user's
   experiences served by operator's applications.  Those IMS core specs
   and applications (Conferencing, PoC, Sample IM, Presence etc.) are
   still expanded continuously by some quite important extensions like
   GRUU, conference state event, early media precondition, resource-list
   MIME body and resource priority etc.

   At the same time, MMUSIC WG is refining SDP parameters for some other
   business models.

   As an example, I have some experiences in OMA (Open Mobile Alliance)
   PoC specifications.  OMA PoC version v2.1 control plane contains a
   typical SIP signalling like following.

   This example contains some recent extension to SIP and SDP strings.
   The author of this document estimated about up to 10 percentage
   strings of a SIP signaling which have been registered but not defiend
   in static dictionary.  It was understood that the extension to static
   dictionary would bring some extra implementation to existing protocol
   stack.  Considering the basic element leads the compressing ratio to
   not satisfy the needs, the ideal static dictionary for SIP signaling
   compression is still possibly necessary.

3.3.  How the developer think about new static dictionary

   The opinions on how to implement the new static dictionary based on
   the existing system could be considered as two kind of concerns.  One
   of them is that the SigComp was launched some time ago and was quite
   complicated mechanism to SIP protocol based network entities.  The
   new static dicationary will result in more needs to extent existing
   implentation of SigComp.  The cost is obviously high.

   Another question needs to be considered is that the two static
   dictionaries were made out for SIP protocol.  The third static
   dictionary should evalute the possibily to coexit with dictionaries.


4.  Basic concept static dictionary expanding

   This document MUST follow the design principles and extent the static
   dictionary directly.

   The columns in the tables are described as follows:

   String: represents the UTF-8 string that is inserted into the
   dictionary.  Note that the quotes (") are not part of the string
   itself.  Note also that the notation [CRLF] represents a Carriage
   Return character (ASCII code 0x0D) followed by a Line Feed character
   (ASCII code 0x0A).

   Pr: indicates the priority of this string within the dictionary.
   Some compression algorithms, such as DEFLATE, offer an increased
   efficiency when the most commonly used strings are located at the
   bottom of the dictionary.  To facilitate generating a dictionary that
   has the most frequently occurring strings further down at the bottom,
   we have decided to allocate a priority to each string in the
   dictionary.  Priorities range from 1 until 5.  A low number in the
   priority column (e.g., 1) indicates that we believe in a high
   probability of finding the string in SIP or SDP messages.  A high
   number in the priority column (e.g., 5) indicates lower probability
   of finding the string in a SIP or SDP message.  This is typically the
   case for less frequent error codes or optional infrequent tags.

   Off: indicates the hexadecimal offset of the entry with respect to
   the first octet in the dictionary.  Note that several strings in the
   collections can share space in the dictionary if they exhibit
   suitable common substrings.

   Len: the length of the string (in octets, in hexadecimal).
