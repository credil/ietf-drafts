Internet-Draft         QoS Attributes for Diameter         February 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of Diameter Quality of Service (QoS)
   related AVPs that can be used in existing and future Diameter
   applications where permitted by the command ABNF.  The Extended-QoS-
   Filter-Rule AVP thereby replaces the QoSFilterRule, defined in RFC
   3588 [RFC3588], and the QoS-Filter-Rule, defined in RFC 4005
   [RFC4005].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Diameter QoS Defined AVPs

   The following table lists the Diameter AVPs used by this document,
   their AVP code values, types and possible flag values.

3.1.  QoS-Capability AVP

   The QoS-Capability AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and contains
   a list of supported Quality of Service profile templates (and
   therefore the support of the respective parameter AVPs).


   QoS-Capability ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                   1* { QoS-Profile-Template }

                    * [ AVP ]

3.2.  QoS-Profile-Template AVP

   The QoS-Profile-Template AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64 and
   contains a vendor and a specifier field.  The 64-bit value in the
   QoS-Profile-Template AVP is structured as shown below.


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                           Specifier                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Vendor Field:

      32 bits of IANA SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code.
      The Vendor-ID 0x00000000 is reserved for IANA registered QoS
      profiles.

   Specifier Field:

      32-bit unsigned integer, representing the defined profile value.

   An initial QoS profile template is defined with vendor field set to
   0x00000000 and the specifier field set to 0.  The initial QoS profile
   template is described in [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].  The
   registry for the QoS profile templates is created with the same
   document.

3.3.  QoS-Resources AVP

   The QoS-Resources AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and includes
   a description of the Quality of Service resources for policing
   traffic flows.


   QoS-Resources ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                   * [ Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule ]
                     [ QoS-Flow-State ]
                   * [ AVP ]

3.4.  Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP

   The Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped
   and defines one or more traffic flows together with a set of QoS
   parameters that should be applied to the flow(s) by the Resource
   Management Function.  This AVP re-uses the RADIUS NAS-Traffic-Rule
   AVP [I-D.ietf-radext-filter-rules] to describe traffic flows.  At
   least either one of the NAS-Traffic-Rule or the QoS-Flow-Direction
   AVPs SHOULD be included.


   Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                                { QoS-Semantics }
                                { QoS-Profile-Template }
                                [ QoS-Parameters ]
                                [ QoS-Rule-Precedence ]
                                [ NAS-Traffic-Rule ]
                                [ QoS-Flow-Direction ]
                              * [ AVP ]

3.5.  QoS-Semantics

   The QoS-Semantics AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and
   provides the semantics for the QoS-Profile-Template and QoS-
   Parameters AVPs in the Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP.

   This document defines the following values:

    (0): QoS-Desired
    (1): QoS-Available
    (2): QoS-Reserved
    (3): Minimum-QoS
    (4): QoS-Authorized

3.6.  QoS-Parameters AVP

   The QoS-Parameters AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains Quality of Service parameters.  These parameters are defined
   in a separate document, see [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].

3.7.  QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP

   The QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   specifies the execution order of the rules expressed in the QoS-
   Resources AVP.  Rules with equal precedence MAY be executed in
   parallel if supported by the Resource Management Function.  If the
   QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP is absent from the Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule
   AVP, the rules SHOULD be executed in the order in which they appear

   in the QoS-Resources AVP.

3.8.  QoS-Flow-Direction AVP

   The QoS-Flow-Direction AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated.  It
   gives an indication of the direction the provided QoS information
   should be applied to.  The QoS information can be applied to downlink
   flows or to uplink flows.  The QoS-Flow-Direction AVP may be used in
   conjunction with the NAS-Traffic-Rule AVP.  In a case conflicting
   definitions between the QoS-Flow-Direction and the NAS-Traffic-Rule,
   the QoS-Flow-Direction has precedence meaning the filter rules are
   applied only to the flows going to the direction indicated by the
   QoS-Flow-Direction AVP.  In the absence of the QoS-Flow-Direction the
   default treatment is to both directions.


     Value | Name and Semantic
     ------+------------------------------------------------------------
       0   | QOS_FLOW_DIRECTION_BOTH - The QoS information in applied to
           | both downlink and uplink flows. This is also the default.
       1   | QOS_FLOW_DIRECTION_DL - The QoS information in applied to
           | downlink flows only.
       2   | QOS_FLOW_DIRECTION_UL - The QoS information in applied to
           | uplink flows only.


4.  Semantics of QoS Parameters

   The QoS parameters carried in the QoS-Resources AVP may appear in
   different messages.  The semantic of the QoS parameters depend on the
   information provided in the QoS-Semantics AVP which currently defines
   5 values, namely QoS-Desired (0), QoS-Available (1), QoS-Reserved
   (2), Minimum-QoS (3), and QoS-Authorized (4).

   The semantics of the different values are as follows:

  Object Type    Direction   Semantic
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  QoS-Desired     C->S       Please authorize the indicated QoS
  QoS-Desired     C<-S       NA
  QoS-Available   C->S       Admission Control at router indicates
                             that this QoS is available. (note 1)
  QoS-Available   C<-S       Indicated QoS is available. (note 2)
  QoS-Reserved    C->S       Used for reporting during accounting.
  QoS-Reserved    C<-S       NA
  Minimum-QoS     C->S       Indicates that the client is not interested
                             interested in authorizing QoS that is
                             lower than Min. QoS
  Minimum-QoS     C<-S       The client must not provide QoS guarantees
                             lower than Min. QoS
  QoS-Authorized  C->S       NA
  QoS-Authorized  C<-S       Indicated QoS authorized

  Legend:

    C: Diameter client
    S: Diameter server
    NA: Not applicable to this document;
        no semantic defined in this specification

  Notes:

   (1) QoS-Available is only useful in relationship with QoS-Desired
       (and optionally with Minimum-QoS).
   (2) QoS-Available is only useful when the AAA server performs
       admission control and knows about the resources in the network.


5.  Examples

   This section shows a number of signaling flows where QoS negotiation
   and authorization is part of the conventional NASREQ, EAP or Credit
   Control applications message exchanges.  The signalling flows for the
   Diameter QoS Application are described in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos].

5.1.  Diameter EAP with QoS Information

   Figure 9 shows a simple signaling flow where a NAS (Diameter Client)
   announces its QoS awareness and capabilities included into the DER
   message and as part of the access authentication procedure.  Upon
   completion of the EAP exchange, the Diameter Server provides a pre-
   provisioned QoS profile with the QoS-Semantics in the Extended-QoS-
   Filter-Rule AVP set to "QoS-Authorized", to the NAS in the final DEA

   Figure 11 shows an example of authorization only QoS signaling as
   part of the NASREQ message exchange.  The NAS provides the Diameter
   server with the "QoS-Desired" QoS-Semantics AVP included in the QoS-
   Resources AVP.  The Diameter server then either authorizes the

   indicated QoS or rejects the request and informs the NAS about the
   result.  In this scenario the NAS does not need to include the QoS-
   Capability AVP in the AAR message as the QoS-Resources AVP implicitly
   does the same and also the NAS is authorizing a specific QoS profile,
   not a pre-provisioned one.

         Figure 11: Example of an Authorization-Only Message Flow

5.4.  Diameter Server Initiated Re-authorization of QoS

   Figure 12 shows a message exchange for a Diameter server initiated
   QoS re-authorization procedure.  The Diameter server sends the NAS a
   RAR message requesting re-authorization for an existing session and
   the NAS acknowledges it with a RAA message.  The NAS is aware of its
   existing QoS profile and information for the ongoing session that the
   Diameter server requested for re-authorization.  Thus, the NAS must
   initiate re-authorization of the existing QoS profile.  The re-
   authorization procedure is the same as in Figure 11.

   In this case the User is charged as soon as the Service Element (CC
   client) receives the service request.  In this case the client uses
   the "QoS-Desired" QoS-Semantics parameter in the QoS-Resources AVP
   that it sends to the Accounitng server.  The server responds with a

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests IANA to assignment of new AVPs from the
   AVP Code namespace defined in RFC 3588 [RFC3588].  Section 3 lists
   the newly defined AVPs.

   IANA is requested to allocate a registry for the QoS-Semantics.  The
   following values are allocated by this specification.

               (0): QoS-Desired
               (1): QoS-Available
               (2): QoS-Reserved
               (3): Minimum-QoS
               (4): QoS-Authorized

   A specification is required to add a new value to the registry.  A

   standards track document is required to depreciate, delete, or modify
   existing values.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the extension of Diameter for conveying
   Quality of Service information.  The security considerations of the
   Diameter protocol itself have been discussed in RFC 3588 [RFC3588].
   Use of the AVPs defined in this document MUST take into consideration
   the security issues and requirements of the Diameter Base protocol.
