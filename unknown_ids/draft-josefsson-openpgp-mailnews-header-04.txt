Internet-Draft   The OpenPGP mail and news header field       April 2008


1.  Preface

   This document is intended to define the "OpenPGP" message header
   field.  This field should be considered "informational" (and
   "optional"), and be suitable for both mail [RFC2822] and netnews
   [RFC1036] messages.  This field should be used to provide information
   about the sender's OpenPGP [RFC4880] key.  This field MAY be used in
   any message.

   This document should be interpreted within the context of RFC 2822.
   In the event of a discrepancy, refer to that document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Background and Motivation

   There are quite a few PGP and GnuPG users who add header fields with
   information about the sender's OpenPGP key.  Fields in current use
   include "X-PGP:", "X-PGP-Key:", "X-Request-PGP:", "X-PGP-KeyID:", and
   "X-PGP-Fingerprint:".  The fields are not standardized, so they
   cannot be reliably parsed automatically by applications, only parsed
   by humans.

   Since both PGP and GnuPG rely on the OpenPGP protocol, it appear
   preferable to use the term "OpenPGP" rather than "PGP", or "GPG", in
   the field name.  The latter forms appear as underhanded attempts to
   advocate specific applications, rather than the open standard they
   both share.  The field specified here is named "OpenPGP".

   The OpenPGP field is not a required part of successful use of OpenPGP
   in e-mail.  It is intended as a convenience, in those situations
   where the user experience may be enhanced by using the information in
   the field.  Consequently, the information in the field should not
   disrupt the normal OpenPGP key retrieval and web of trust mechanism.
   Neither the integrity nor the authenticity of the information in the
   field should be assumed to be correct or be trust-worthy.

   No specific scenario when the field should be used, nor how it should
   be used in that scenario, are suggested by this document.  It is
   acknowledged that the dominant use of the information in the field
   may be by humans and not applications.

   To promote good use of the field, care should be taken so that
   applications do not trigger error messages that may annoy the user,
   when an error condition arise during handling of the OpenPGP field.

   It is generally recommended that an implementation ignore the
   presence of the OpenPGP fields if an error condition occur.  Since
   the field is optional, this approach should not be difficult to
   implement.  The philosophy here is to enable an enhanced user
   experience.  Error messages rarely contribute to that goal.


3.  OpenPGP Header Field

   The OpenPGP header field is intended to present characteristics of
   the sender's OpenPGP key.  The field may contain the Key ID and the
   URL where the key can be retrieved.

   Because the header is typically not integrity protected, the
   information conveyed in the OpenPGP header field MUST NOT be trusted
   without additional verification.  Some of the information given in
   this field may also be given on the OpenPGP key itself.  When these
   two sources conflict, users SHOULD favor the information from the
   OpenPGP key, as that information can be cryptographically protected.

   The field is of a "structured" type (see section 2.2.2 of RFC 2822).
   In general, the structure consist of one or more parameters, each
   consisting of one attribute and one value.  The terminology and
   format of the field was inspired by MIME [RFC2045].  The various
   provisions of RFC 2045 apply.  In particular, the value part of
   parameters may be quoted; whitespace, folding and comments may occur
   in the middle of parameters.  The provisions of MIME [RFC2231] also
   apply; in particular it deals with handling parameters of excessive
   length.

   The OpenPGP header field is defined as below in the Augmented BNF
   [RFC5234] notation.  By itself, however, this grammar is incomplete.
   It refers by name to syntax rules that are defined in [RFC2822] and
   [RFC3986].  Rather than reproduce those definitions here, and risk
   unintentional differences between the two, this document refer the
   reader to the other documents for the definition of non-terminals.

   Unrecognized parameters MUST be ignored.  The grammar permit them to
   allow for future extensions.  A given parameter type (i.e., "id",
   "url" or "preference") MUST NOT occur more than once.  The OpenPGP:
   field itself SHOULD NOT appear more than once within a message.

   openpgp    = "OpenPGP:" SP *CFWS openpgp-params *CFWS CRLF
                ; CFWS is defined in RFC 2822.

   openpgp-params
              = (openpgp-parameter *(";" *CFWS openpgp-parameter))

   openpgp-parameter
              = ("id" "=" id) /
                ("url" "=" url) /
                ("preference" "=" preference) /
                parameter  ; See RFC 2045 for definition of parameter.

   id         = 8*HEXDIG ; Defined in RFC 5234.

   url        = absoluteURI  ; Defined in RFC 3986.

   preference = "sign" / "encrypt" / "signencrypt" / "unprotected"

3.1.  Primary Key ID field: id

   The "id" attribute=value pair, if present, MUST define the primary
   key ID.  The value MUST identify the key ID (in either short or long
   form) or the fingerprint, all using the hex [RFC4648] notation.

   The length of the field imply the kind of key id, i.e., short or long
   form, or a v3 or v4 key.

   Note that each of the following examples includes a comment, which is
   optional.

       id=12345678 (short key ID)
       id=1234567890ABCDEF (long key ID)
       id=1234567890abcdef01234567890ABCDEF0123456 (v4 fingerprint)
       id=1234567890ABCDEF01234567890ABCDE (v3 fingerprint, deprecated)

3.2.  Key URL field: url

   The "url" attribute=value pair, if present, MUST specify a URL where
   the public key can be found.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a common URL
   family, such as HTTP [RFC2616] or FTP [RFC0959].  The URL MUST be
   fully qualified, MUST explicitly specify a protocol and SHOULD be
   accessible on the public Internet.

   For example:

       url=http://example.org/pgp.txt

Internet-Draft   The OpenPGP mail and news header field       April 2008


3.3.  Protection Preference Field: preference

   The "preference" attribute=value pair, if present, specify the
   quality of protection preferred by the sender.  The available choices
   are "unprotected" which means that the sender prefer not to receive
   OpenPGP protected e-mails.  A "sign" token means that the sender
   prefer to receive digitally signed e-mails.  A "encrypt" token means
   that the sender prefer to receive digitally encrypted e-mails.  A
   "signencrypt" token means that the sender prefer to receive digitally
   encrypted and signed e-mails.  Note that there is no technical
   requirement on the receiver to follow the stated preference.

   For example:

       preference=sign
       preference="unprotected"
       preference=ENCRYPT


4.  Comments

   As discussed in section 3.2.3 of RFC 2822, comments may appear in
   header field bodies.  Comments are not intended to be interpreted by
   any application, but to provide additional information for humans.

   The following are examples of OpenPGP fields with comments:

     id=B565716F (key stored on non-networked laptop)
     id=12345678 (1024 bit RSA Key for Encrypt or Sign)
     id=ABCD0123 (created Sun Jan  2 02:25:15 CET 2005)


5.  Examples

   These are valid examples of how the field may be used.  This list is
   not meant to be exhaustive, but do reflect expected typical usages.

     OpenPGP: id=12345678
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt
     OpenPGP: preference=unprotected
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt; id=12345678
     OpenPGP: id=12345678; url=http://example.com/key.txt;
              preference=signencrypt
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt (down 2-3pm UTC);
              id=12345678 (this key is only used at the office);
              preference=sign (unsigned emails are filtered away)

   anyone we left out.


7.  Security Considerations

   The OpenPGP header field is intended to be a convenience in locating
   public keys.  They are neither secure nor intended to be.  Since the
   message header is easy to spoof, information contained in the header
   should not be trusted.  The information must be verified.

   Applications that interpret the field MUST NOT assume that the
   content is correct, and MUST NOT present the data to the user in any
   way that would cause the user to assume that it is correct.
   Applications that interpret the data within the field SHOULD alert
   the user that this information is not a substitute for personally
   verifying keys and being a part of the web of trust.

   If an application receives a signed message and uses the information
   in the field to retrieve a key, the application MAY ignore the
   retrieved key if it is not the same key used to sign the message.
   This SHOULD be done before the newly retrieved key is imported into
   the user's keyring.

   The use of HTTPS [RFC2818], DNSSEC [RFC4033], SMTP STARTTLS
   [RFC3207], IMAP/POP3 STARTTLS [RFC2595] and other secure protocols,
   may enhance the security of information conveyed through this field,
   but does not guarantee any level of security or authenticity.
   Developers and users must remain aware of this.

   Version 3 OpenPGP keys can be created with a chosen key id (aka "the
   0xDEADBEEF attack").  Verifying the Key ID of a retrieved key against
   the one provided in the field is thus not sufficient to protect
   against a man-in-the-middle attack.  Instead, the web-of-trust
   mechanism should be used.

   If an attacker wants to check the validity of Email addresses, he
   might send out junk email to arbitrary addresses and collect those
   that report back to the crafted OpenPGP URL.  To protect against
   this, implementations MUST inform the user of that potential privacy

   issue when retrieving keys from an URL provided by the field of an
   inbound email message: either when the feature is enabled or to be
   used for the first time or every time the MUA detects an unknown key.

   Given the flexibility of the syntax of the field, slightly varying
   the content between messages can be used as a covert channel.
