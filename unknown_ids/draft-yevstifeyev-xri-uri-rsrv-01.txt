                   draft-yevstifeyev-xri-uri-rsrv-01

Abstract

   This document is a formal record on 'xri' Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) scheme, which used to be used in URIs mapped from Extensible
   Resource Identifiers (XRIs).  Currently, use of this scheme is
   deprecated; this document registers it in the corresponding IANA
   registry as 'historical'.

1. Introduction

   The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
   Standards (OASIS) Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) Technical
   Committee (TC), referred to as XRI TC within this document, has
   developed the specification of Extensible Resource Identifies (XRIs),
   which are a protocol element that is a superset of Internalized
   Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987] and is designed to suit
   Requirements for Uniform Resource Names (URNs), laid out in RFC 1737
   [RFC1737], even though they are not URNs [RFC2141] themselves.

   Version 2.0 of XRI Syntax specification [XRISyntax2], Section 2.3.1,
   specified how to map XRIs to IRI references [RFC3987] and URI
   references [RFC3986].  It mentioned that the scheme name used in such
   IRIs or URIs is "xri".  Version 3.0 of XRI Syntax specification
   [XRISyntax3] deprecated use of 'xri' IRIs and URIs; this document
   registers the 'xri' URI scheme as 'historical' for community record.

1.1. Community Consensus

   The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
   Standards (OASIS) has the Technical Committee (TC), which is
   responsible for developing and maintaining XRI specifications, - XRI
   TC.  This document has been prepared for this TC and has received its
   excessive review, which revealed wide consensus of the TC's members.

   [IMPORTANT: Currently, this document is only a subject for the
   aforementioned review; the paragraph above actually does not
   represent TC consensus.]

2. Registration Template for 'xri' URI Scheme

   This section contains the registration template for 'xri' URI scheme,
   as required by [RFC4395].

     URI scheme name: xri

     Status: Historical

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2.2 and 2.3 of [XRISyntax2]

     URI scheme semantics: see [XRIResolution2]

     XRI scheme encoding considerations: see Section 2.1 of [XRISyntax2]

3. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for XRIs are discussed in Section 3 of
   [XRISyntax2] and Section 18 of [XRIResolution2].

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'xri' URI scheme using the template of
   Section 2.
