        <t>This document requests IANA registration of an Enumservice for 
	reflecting location information. The Enumservice uses the 'loc' Type

             of information, based on for example the identity of the client.

      <section anchor='examples' title='Examples'>
        <t>An example ENUM entry identifying the location of  a number using 
	a HELD resource could look like this:
	<artwork>
   $ORIGIN 6.9.4.0.6.9.4.5.1.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @  IN NAPTR  ( 
         100 10 "u" 
         "E2U+loc:helds" 
         "!^.*$!helds://nottinghamshire.example.com/sherwood/robin72!" .
      )
        </artwork>
        A client who retrieves that ENUM record would then try to dereference
        the resulting HELD resource, with the location server returning the 
        desired location information if the client is authorized to do so. 
        The location server could, for example, return only rough location for
        anonymous clients, while trusted clients receive full location 
        data.
	</t>
        <t>An example ENUM entry referring to a location of a number using
        a 'geo' URI could look like this:
        <artwork>
   $ORIGIN 6.9.4.0.6.9.4.5.1.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
   @  IN NAPTR  ( 
         100 10 "u" 
         "E2U+loc:geo" 
         "!^.*$!geo:53.204628,-1.072359!" .
      )
        </artwork>
        The client could use the geographical coordinates contained in the 
        URI to display a map of the current user's location. Note that the 
        location information is contained in the URI (and therefore in the
        ENUM record) itself, which makes it unnecessary to contact a 
        location server. However, it is therefore not be possible to return 
        different location information to different clients.

      <section anchor='security' title='Security & Privacy Considerations'>
        <t>General security considerations of the protocols on which
	this Enumservice registration is based   
	are addressed in Sections 3.1.3 and 6 of 
	RFC 3761 (ENUM). 
	</t>
        <t>Since ENUM uses DNS - a publicly available database - 
	any information contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains
	must be considered public as well. Even after revoking the DNS entry 
	and removing the refered resource, copies of the information could
	still be available. </t>
	<t>
	Information published in 
	ENUM records could reveal associations between E.164 numbers and 
	their owners - especially if IRIs/URIs contain personal identifiers 
	or domain names for which ownership information 
	can be obtained easily.</t>
	<t>However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself
	does not need to contain any personal information. It just points
	to a location where access to personal information could be granted.
	</t>
	<t>ENUM records pointing 
	to third party resources can easily be provisioned on purpose 
	by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption
	about the association between a number and an entity could 
	therefore be completely bogus unless some kind of identity
	verification is in place. This verification is out of scope for
	this memo.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor='iana' title='IANA Considerations'>
      <t>This memo requests IANA to add a new "loc" Enumservice to
      the 'Enumservice Registrations' registry, 
      according to the definitions in this document 
      and <xref target='RFC3761'>RFC 3761</xref>.</t>
      <t>The required templates are contained in <xref target='reg'/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor='dnscons' title='DNS Considerations'>
      <t>The proposed Enumservice does not require any special DNS 
      considerations. While 'geo' URIs can be dereferenced even without 
      subsequent DNS lookups, a 'helds' URI may require additional DNS 
      queries to resolve the server location. However, such queries can
      never end up in another ENUM query, hence the probability of endless 
      loops is zero.
