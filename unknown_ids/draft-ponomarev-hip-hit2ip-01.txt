Internet-Draft                  HIT-TO-IP                     March 2009


1.  Introduction

   One of the approaches to use legacy applications[RFC5338] with Host
   Identity Protocol[RFC4423] is to use HIT as IPv6 address.  The
   application may receive them from the nameserver, store internally
   and connect directly to a HIT.  The HIP software would receive packet
   with HIT as a destination IPv6 address without any additional
   information about the current locator and therefore some HIT
   resolution service is needed in this case.  This document suggests
   the DNS as a protocol to access such mapping databases in addition to
   a local list of Host Identities and Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)
   [I-D.ahrenholz-hiprg-dht].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[RFC2119].

2.  Domain names for HIT mappings

   Domain Name System is well-known to systems administrators and there
   is much experience with operations under high load.  It also allows
   dynamic modifications and has low overhead when compared to many
   other protocols.  It is used now, for example, to get IP address
   reputations from various blacklists.

2.1.  Preconfigured Domain

   The systems using this method MUST have the same domain pre-
   configured, for example hit-to-ip.example.net.  If there are multiple
   parallel services with their own domains, the systems MUST have at
   least one of them in common to interoperate.

   A HIT is represented as a sequence of nibbles separated by dots and
   followed by the suffix similarly to IPv6 addresses in
   ip6.arpa[RFC3596].  For example, the domain name corresponding to the
   HIT

   2001:10:1234:5678:9abc:def0:1234:5678

   would be

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                   hit-to-ip.example.net

2.2.  Listing IP Addresses of the System

   The A/AAAA resource record types MAY be used to specify the IP/IPv6
   addresses of the system.  There MAY be multiple locators listed for a
   HIT.

   For example, the system with IP address 192.0.2.1 and IPv6 address
   2001:DB8::1 would have the following records

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                 hit-to-ip.example.net.
     1     IN      A       192.0.2.1
   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                 hit-to-ip.example.net.
     1     IN      AAAA    2001:DB8::1

2.3.  Listing host names

   The PTR resource record types MAY be used to specify name of the host
   using the Host Identity.

                                                  hit-to-ip.example.net.
     86400 IN      PTR     alpha.example.com

2.4.  Link to another domain

   The CNAME resource record types MAY be used to specify another domain
   to lookup the locators of the system.

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                                  hit-to-ip.example.net.
     86400 IN      CNAME   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.
                       4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.hit-to-ip.domain.example.

2.5.  Managing the Records

   The system MAY send DNS UPDATE[RFC2136] to the server provided by SOA
   MNAME field of the domain.  The system MAY add or delete
   A,AAAA,PTR,CNAME records for its own HIT representation.  The update
   MUST then originate from the corresponding HIT.  If there are
   multiple identities they should be modified separately.

   The domain provided in SOA MNAME field of the preconfigured domain
   MUST have Host Identity of the server stored in DNS, the IP addresses
   MUST be listed in that domain using the suggested method and the
   server MUST accept DNS UPDATE messages, which add or delete
   A,AAAA,PTR,CNAME records for the HIT representation of the client
   after successful HIP base exchange.  The server MUST refuse to
   perform the changes if the update is not originating from the host
   identity whose data is being updated.

3.  Usage scenarios

   The DNS selected as an interface should help in the deployment.
   There is vast amount of resursive DNS resolvers available to the
   clients, they can cache mapping information, for example.  This
   section contains ideas about three different designs of the mapping
   service.

3.1.  Initial deployment

   Such mapping services can be started using the conventional DNS
   software with minor changes to authenticate DNS updates with HIP.
   There is hit-to-ip.net zone available for the experiments at the
   moment.  According to the experiments[ISC-TN-2008-1] BIND 9 is able
   to send 60,361 replies/second under update at 256 updates/sec over
   IXFR.  The performance of DDNS updates was only 93.46 updates/second
   as they are committed to nonvolatile storage before the response is
   returned.  The version of BIND compiled without the file-system
   commits performed 471.70 updates/second.  The performance of HIP
   implementations also limits the capacity, but about active 100,000
   users may be served assuming 1 hour average update interval, if the
   peak performance is 100 updates/second.  Number of mappings that fits
   into the memory of a modern server has to be studied.

   The TTL of the records is selected by the clients.  If a Host
   Identity is used by a server with static IP addresses, its mappings
   may have long TTLs as any changes are scheduled in advance.  This
   would allow the recursive resolvers to cache records of the
   frequently accessed static servers.

   Delegation of 1.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa would allow reverse resolution
   of HIT to a host name by any system without any changes.  The host
   name does not change often and such mapping may be updated only when
   needed.

   Although the service may be started with existing DNS software, it is
   not optimal for such a usage pattern and another database engine
   allowing higher update rate is needed.

3.2.  Parallel services

   Although it is not desirable, there may be multiple independent
   mapping services.  I.e. the host updates its IP addresses only in
   hit-to-ip.domain1.example, but has to look for IP addresses of an
   unknown host in hit-to-ip.domain1.example, hit-to-ip.domain2.example
   and hit-to-ip.domain3.example.  This causes extra traffic due to
   multiple lookups.

Internet-Draft                  HIT-TO-IP                     March 2009


   Another possibility is that the host updates its IP addresses in hit-
   to-ip.domain1.example, hit-to-ip.domain2.example and hit-to-
   ip.domain3.example, but chose only hit-to-ip.domain1.example to
   lookup unknown hosts.  This would cause growth of all three databases
   with every new user and extra traffic due to multiple updates, but
   provides redundancy

   The delegation of domain for reverse mapping is unlikely in this case
   and would probably be blackholed similar to reverse subdomains for
   private-use netblocks [I-D.ietf-dnsop-as112-ops]

3.3.  Two-level mapping

   The flat identifiers do not have administrative division as in usual
   domain names and a single organization should serve all the
   identifiers.  Therefore it is desirable to reduce its workload at the
   same time TTL of the records cannot be long to allow dynamic changes.
   Two-level design might help to solve this contradiction.

   The first level would contain only links (CNAME) to different second
   level mapping providers.  Such information does not change often and
   can have long TTL.  Furthermore in this case, it would be enough to
   store in memory only HIT and an index of the second level provider
   both in binary format.  The second level mapping would contain
   dynamic information about the current IP addresses.  For example,
   there may be the following records in the DNS:

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.
                                           hit-to-ip.arpa.
     86400 IN      CNAME   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.
                     4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.hit-to-ip.domain.example.

   8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.f.e.d.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.1.0.0.1.0.0.2.

4.  Security Considerations

   SHA1 is used now as a hash function to get HITs, but the complexity
   of an existing attack[SHA1-attack] is only 2**63.  Since only HIT,
   but not complete HI is used for lookups, SHA1 should be phased out,
   for example, in favor of the SHA-2 variants.

   The actions, when multiple hosts share the same identity and start to
   constantly update their mappings, should be discussed.
