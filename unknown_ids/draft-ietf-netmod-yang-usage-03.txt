Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with
   the NETCONF [RFC4741] protocol requires a modular set of data models,
   which can be reused and extended over time.

   This document defines a set of usage guidelines for standards track
   documents containing YANG [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang] data models.  It is
   similar to the MIB usage guidelines specification [RFC4181] in intent
   and structure.

   Many YANG constructs are defined as optional to use, such as the
   description clause.  However, in order to maximize interoperability
   of NETCONF implementations utilizing YANG data models, it is
   desirable to define a set of usage guidelines which may require a
   higher level of compliance than the minimum level defined in the YANG
   specification.




    The NETCONF stack can be conceptually partitioned into four layers.

         Layer                Example
        +-------------+   +--------------------+ +-------------------+
    (4) |   Content   |   | Configuration data | | Notification data |
        +-------------+   +--------------------+ +-------------------+
               |                    |                   |
        +-------------+   +-----------------+           |
    (3) | Operations  |   |  <edit-config>  |           |
        +-------------+   +-----------------+           |
               |                    |                   |
        +-------------+   +--------------------+  +----------------+
    (2) |  Messages   |   | <rpc>, <rpc-reply> |  | <notification> |
        +-------------+   +--------------------+  +----------------+
               |                    |                   |
        +-------------+   +-----------------------------------------+
    (1) |   Secure    |   | SSH, TLS, BEEP/TLS, SOAP/HTTP/TLS, ...  |
        | Transports  |   |                                         |
        +-------------+   +-----------------------------------------+



                                 Figure 1

   This document defines usage guidelines related to the NETCONF
   operations layer (3), and NETCONF content layer (4).

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   RFC 2119 language is used here to express the views of the NETMOD
   working group regarding YANG module content.  Yang modules complying
   with this document will treat the RFC 2119 terminology as if it were
   describing best current practices.

2.2.  NETCONF Terms

   The following terms are defined in [RFC4741] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  application

   o  capabilities

   o  client

   o  operation

   o  RPC

   o  server

2.3.  YANG Terms

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  data node

   o  module

   o  submodule

   o  namespace

   o  version

2.4.  Terms

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   o  module: Generic term for a YANG data model module or submodule.
      When describing properties which are specific to submodules, the
      term 'YANG submodule', or simply 'submodule' is used instead.

   o  Published Document: A stable release of a module, usually
      contained in an RFC.

   o  Unpublished Document: An unstable release of a module, usually
      contained in an Internet Draft.

3.  General Documentation Guidelines

   YANG data model modules under review are likely to be contained in
   Internet Drafts.  All guidelines for Internet Draft authors MUST be
   followed.  These guidelines are available online at:
   http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-editor/instructions2authors.txt

   The following sections MUST be present in an Internet Draft
   containing a module:

   o  YANG data model boilerplate section

   o  Narrative sections

   o  Definitions section

   o  Security Considerations section

   o  IANA Considerations section

   o  References section

3.1.  YANG Data Model Boilerplate Section

   This section MUST contain a verbatim copy of the latest approved
   Internet-Standard Management Framework boilerplate, which is
   available on-line, in section 4 of the Trust Legal Provisions (TLP)
   document, at: http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/

   Each YANG module contained within an Internet Draft or RPC MUST be
   identified as a 'Code Component'.  The strings '<CODE BEGINS>' and
   '<CODE ENDS>' SHOULD be used to identify each Code Component.

3.2.  Narrative Sections

   The narrative part MUST include an overview section that describes
   the scope and field of application of the module(s) defined by the
   specification and that specifies the relationship (if any) of these
   modules to other standards, particularly to standards containing
   other module modules.  The narrative part SHOULD include one or more
   sections to briefly describe the structure of the modules defined in
   the specification.

   If the module(s) defined by the specification import definitions from
   other modules (except for those defined in the YANG
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang] or YANG Types [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-types]
   documents) or are always implemented in conjunction with other
   modules, then those facts MUST be noted in the overview section, as

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


   MUST any special interpretations of objects in other modules.

3.3.  Definitions Section

   This section contains the module(s) defined by the specification.
   These modules MUST be written in YANG [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang].

   See Section 4 for guidelines on YANG usage.

3.4.  Security Considerations Section

   Each specification that defines one or more modules MUST contain a
   section that discusses security considerations relevant to those
   modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
   template (available at [ed: URL TBD]).

   In particular, writable module objects that could be especially
   disruptive if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the
   associated security risks MUST be spelled out; similarly, readable
   module objects that contain especially sensitive information or that
   raise significant privacy concerns MUST be explicitly listed by name
   and the reasons for the sensitivity/privacy concerns MUST be
   explained.

3.5.  IANA Considerations Section

   In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA.

3.5.1.  Documents that Create a New Name Space

   If an Internet-Draft defines a new name space that is to be
   administered by the IANA, then the document MUST include an IANA
   Considerations section, that specifies how the name space is to be
   administered.

   Specifically, if any YANG module namespace statement value contained
   in the document is not already registered with IANA, then a new YANG
   Namespace registry entry must be requested from the IANA.  The YANG
   specification includes the procedure for this purpose in its IANA
   Considerations section.

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


3.5.2.  Documents that Extend an Existing Name Space

   If an Internet-Draft defines any extensions to a YANG Namespace
   already administered by the IANA, then the document MUST include an
   IANA Considerations section, specifies how the name space extension
   is to be administered.

   Specifically, if any YANG submodule belongs-to value contained in the
   document is associated with a module that contains a namespace
   statement value equal to a YANG Namespace already administered by the
   IANA, then the existing YANG Namespace must be updated to include the
   new submodule.

3.6.  Reference Sections

   For every import or include statement which appears in a module
   contained in the specification, which identifies a module in a
   separate document, a corresponding normative reference to that
   document MUST appear in the Normative References section.  The
   reference MUST correspond to the specific module version actually
   used within the specification.

   For every reference statement which appears in a module contained in
   the specification, which identifies a separate document, a
   corresponding normative reference to that document SHOULD appear in
   the Normative References section.  The reference SHOULD correspond to
   the specific document version actually used within the specification.

3.7.  Copyright Notices

   The proper copyright notices MUST be present in the module
   description statement.  Refer to the IETF Trust Legal Provision for
   the exact legal text that needs to be included.

3.8.  Intellectual Property Section

   The proper IPR statements MUST be present in the document, according
   to the most current Internet Draft boilerplate.  Refer to the IETF
   Trust Legal Provision for the exact legal text that needs to be
   included.

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


4.  YANG Usage Guidelines

   In general, modules in IETF standards-track specifications MUST
   comply with all syntactic and semantic requirements of YANG.
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang].  The guidelines in this section are intended
   to supplement the YANG specification, which is intended to define a
   minimum set of conformance requirements.

   In order to promote interoperability and establish a set of practices
   based on previous experience, the following sections establish usage
   guidelines for specific YANG constructs.

   Only guidelines which clarify or restrict the minimum conformance
   requirements are included here.

4.1.  Module Naming Conventions

   Modules contained in standards track documents SHOULD be named with
   the prefix 'ietf-'.  Other types of modules MUST NOT use the 'ietf-'
   prefix string.

   A distinctive word or acronym (e.g., protocol name or working group
   acronym) SHOULD be used in the module name.  If new definitions are
   being defined to extend one or more existing modules, then the same
   word or acronym should be reused, instead of creating a new one.

   All published module names MUST be unique.

   Once a module name is published, it MUST not be reused, even if the
   RFC containing the module is reclassified to 'Historic' status.

4.2.  Identifiers

   Identifiers for modules, submodules, typedefs, groupings, data
   objects, rpcs, and notifications MUST be between 1 and 64 characters
   in length.

4.3.  Defaults

   In general, it is suggested that sub-statements containing default
   values SHOULD NOT be present.  For example, 'status current;',
   'config true;', 'mandatory false;', and 'max-elements unbounded;' are
   common defaults which would make the module difficult to read if used
   everywhere they are allowed.

   Instead, it is suggested that common statements SHOULD only be used
   when being set to a value other than the default value.

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


4.4.  Conditional Statements

   A module may be conceptually partitioned in several ways, using the
   'if-feature' and/or 'when' statements.  In addition, NETCONF
   capabilities are designed to identify optional functionality.

   Data model designers need to carefully consider all modularity
   aspects, including the use of YANG conditional statements.

   Objects SHOULD NOT directly reference NETCONF capabilities, in order
   to specify optional behavior.  Instead, a 'feature' statement SHOULD
   be defined to represent the NETCONF capability, and the 'if-feature'
   statement SHOULD be used within the object definition.

   If the condition associated with the desired semantics is not
   dependent on any particular instance value within the database, then
   an 'if-feature' statement SHOULD be used instead of a 'when'
   statement.

   All 'must' and 'when' statements MUST contain valid XPath.  If any
   name tests are present, they MUST contain valid module prefixes and
   data node names.  References to non-existent nodes are considered
   invalid in YANG, even though they are permitted in XPath.

   The 'attribute' and 'namespace' axis SHOULD NOT be used because the
   associated XML node types are not supported in YANG, and may not be
   supported consistently across NETCONF server implementations.

   The 'position' and 'last' functions SHOULD NOT be used.  Also, the
   'preceding', and 'following' axes SHOULD NOT be used.  These
   constructs rely on XML document order within a NETCONF server
   configuration database, which may not be supported consistently or
   produce reliable results across implementations.  Predicate
   expressions based on static node properties (e.g., name, value,
   ancestors, descendants) SHOULD be used instead.

   The 'preceding-sibling' and 'following-sibling' axes MAY be used,
   with caution.  A server is not required to maintain a persistent or
   deterministic XML document order, which will affect use of these
   axes.

   Implicit 'position' function calls within predicates SHOULD NOT be
   used. (e.g., //chapter[42]).

   Data nodes which use the 'int64' and 'uint64' built-in type SHOULD
   NOT be used within relational expressions.  There are boundary
   conditions in which the translation from the YANG 64-bit type to an
   XPath number can cause incorrect results.

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


   Data modelers need to be careful not to confuse the YANG value space
   and the XPath value space.  The data types are not the same in both,
   and conversion between YANG and XPath data types SHOULD be considered
   carefully.

   Explicit XPath data type conversions MAY be used (e.g., 'string',
   'boolean', or 'number' functions), instead of implicit XPath data
   type conversions.

4.5.  Lifecycle Management

   The status statement SHOULD NOT be present if its value is 'current'.
   It MUST be present if its value is 'deprecated' or 'obsolete'.

   The module or submodule name MUST NOT be changed, once the document
   containing the module or submodule is published.

   The module namespace URI value SHOULD NOT be changed, once the
   document containing the module is published.

   The revision-date sub-statement (within the imports statement) SHOULD
   be present if any groupings are used from the external module.

   The revision-date sub-statement (within the include statement) SHOULD
   be present if any groupings are used from the external sub-module.

4.6.  Header Contents

   For published modules, the namespace MUST be a globally unique URI,
   as defined in [RFC3986].  This value is usually assigned by the IANA.

   The organization statement MUST be present.  If the module is
   contained in a documented intended for standards-track status, then
   the organization SHOULD be the IETF working group chartered to write
   the document.

   The contact statement MUST be present.  If the module is contained in
   a documented intended for standards-track status, then the working
   group WEB and mailing information MUST be present, and the document
   author contact information SHOULD be present.  In addition, the Area
   Director and other contact information MAY be present.

   The description statement MUST be present.  If the module is
   contained in an unpublished document, then the file name of this
   document SHOULD be identified in the description statement.  This
   text MUST be removed when the document is published.

   Modules are often extracted from their original documents and it is

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


   useful for developers and operators to know how to find the original
   source document in a consistent manner.

   The reference statement MUST be present.  It MUST identify the
   published document which contains the module.

   If the module relies on information contained in other documents,
   which are not the same documents implied by the import statements
   present in the module, then these documents MUST be identified in the
   reference statement.

   A revision statement MUST be present for each published version of
   the module.

   Each new revision MUST include a revision date which is higher than
   any other revision date in the module.

   It is acceptable to reuse the same revision statement within
   unpublished versions (i.e., Internet Drafts), but the revision date
   MUST be updated to a higher value each time the Internet Draft is re-
   published.

4.7.  Temporary Namespace Assignments

   It is desirable to include only valid YANG modules in documents,
   whether they are published yet or not.

   o  allows the module to compile correctly instead of generating
      disruptive fatal errors.

   o  allows early implementors to use the modules without picking a
      random value for this field.

   o  allows early interoperability testing since independent
      implementations will use the same namespace value.

   Until a URI is assigned by the IANA, a temporary namespace URI MUST
   be provided for the namespace statement in a YANG module.  A value
   SHOULD be selected which is not likely to collide with other YANG
   namespaces.

   An unpublished module namespace statement value SHOULD include the
   field 'DRAFT-nn', where 'nn' is replaced by the current Internet
   Draft number.

   If the YANG module has been previously published, then the RPC being
   updated needs to be identified.  In this case, an unpublished module
   namespace statement value SHOULD include the field

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


   'DRAFT-XXXXBIS-nn', where 'XXXX' is replaced by the RFC number being
   updated, and 'nn' is replaced by the current Internet Draft number.

   A temporary namespace statement value SHOULD have the following form:
   <URN prefix string>:<module-name>:<draft-field>

   The suggested URN prefix string that SHOULD be used is shown below.
   This value will be defined by the IANA. urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:

   The following example URNs would be valid temporary namespace
   statement values:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-partial-lock:DRAFT-09

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-state:DRAFT-07

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf:DRAFT-4741BIS-01

4.8.  Top Level Database Objects

   There SHOULD only be one top-level data node defined in each YANG
   module.  However, there MAY be more than one if needed.

   The top-level data organization SHOULD be considered carefully, in
   advance.  Data model designers need to consider how the functionality
   for a given protocol or protocol family will grow over time.

   The names and data organization SHOULD reflect persistent
   information, such as the name of a protocol.  The name of the working
   group SHOULD NOT be used because this may change over time.

   A mandatory database object is defined as a node that a client must
   provide for the database to be valid.  The server will not provide a
   value under any conditions.

   Top-level database objects MUST NOT be mandatory.

   If a mandatory node appears at the top-level, it will immediately
   cause the database to be invalid.  This can occur when the server
   boots or when a module is loaded dynamically at runtime.

   Top level objects are declared in YANG as mandatory with the
   mandatory statement or the min-elements statement.  All nested non-
   presence containers are transparent, so a mandatory node nested
   within one or more non-presence containers causes the top-level
   container to be considered mandatory.

4.9.  Data Types

   Selection of an appropriate data type (i.e., built-in type, existing
   derived type, or new derived type) is very subjective and therefore
   few requirements can be specified on that subject.

   Data model designers SHOULD use the most appropriate built-in data
   type for the particular application.

   If extensibility of enumerated values is required, then the
   identityref data type SHOULD be used instead of an enumeration or
   other built-in type.

   For string data types, if a machine-readable pattern can be defined
   for the desired semantics, then one or more pattern statements SHOULD
   be present.

   For string data types, if the length of the string is not required to
   be unbounded in all implementations, then a length statement SHOULD
   be present.

   For numeric data types, if the values allowed by the intended
   semantics are different than those allowed by the unbounded intrinsic
   data type (e.g., int32), then a range statement SHOULD be present.

   The signed numeric data types (i.e., 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', and
   'int64') SHOULD NOT be used unless negative values are allowed for
   the desired semantics.

   For enumeration or bits data types, the semantics for each enum or
   bit SHOULD be documented.  A separate description statement (within
   each enum or bit statement) SHOULD be present.

4.10.  Reusable Type Definitions

   If an appropriate derived type exists in any standard module, such as
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-types], then it SHOULD be used instead of
   defining a new derived type.

   If an appropriate units identifier can be associated with the desired
   semantics, then a units statement SHOULD be present.

   If an appropriate default value can be associated with the desired
   semantics, then a default statement SHOULD be present.

   If a significant number of derived types are defined, and it is
   anticipated that these data types will be reused by multiple modules,
   then these derived types SHOULD be contained in a separate module or

   submodule, to allow easier reuse without unnecessary coupling.

   The description statement MUST be present.

   If the type definition semantics are defined in an external document,
   then the reference statement SHOULD be present.

4.11.  Object Definitions

   The description statement MUST be present in the following body
   statements:

   o  extension

   o  feature

   o  identity

   o  typedef

   o  grouping

   o  augment

   o  rpc

   o  notification

   The description statement MUST be present in the following data
   definition constructs:

   o  container

   o  leaf

   o  leaf-list

   o  list

   o  choice

   o  anyxml

   If the object semantics are defined in an external document, then a
   reference statement SHOULD be present.

   The 'anyxml' construct MUST NOT be used within configuration data.

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


   If there are referential integrity constraints associated with the
   desired semantics that can be represented with XPath, then one or
   more must statements SHOULD be present.

   For list and leaf-list objects, if the number of possible instances
   is not required to be unbounded for all implementations, then the
   max-elements statement SHOULD be present.

   If any must or when statements are used within the object definition,
   then the object description statement SHOULD describe the purpose of
   each one.

4.12.  RPC Definitions

   The description statement MUST be present.

   If the RPC method semantics are defined in an external document, then
   a reference statement SHOULD be present.

   If the RPC method impacts system behavior in some way, it SHOULD be
   mentioned in the description statement.

   If the RPC method is potentially harmful to system behavior in some
   way, it MUST be mentioned in the Security Considerations section of
   the document.

4.13.  Notification Definitions

   The description statement MUST be present.

   If the notification semantics are defined in an external document,
   then a reference statement SHOULD be present.

Appendix A.  Module Review Checklist

   This section is adapted from RFC 4181.

   The purpose of a YANG module review is to review the YANG module both
   for technical correctness and for adherence to IETF documentation
   requirements.  The following checklist may be helpful when reviewing
   a draft document:

   1.   I-D Boilerplate -- verify that the draft contains the required
        Internet-Draft boilerplate (see
        http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt), including the
        appropriate statement to permit publication as an RFC, and that
        I-D boilerplate does not contain references or section numbers.

   2.   Abstract -- verify that the abstract does not contain
        references, that it does not have a section number, and that its
        content follows the guidelines in
        http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt.

   3.   YANG Module Boilerplate -- verify that the draft contains the
        latest approved SNMP Network Management Framework boilerplate
        from the OPS area web site
        (http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html). [ed: real URL
        TBD]

   4.   Security Considerations Section -- verify that the draft uses
        the latest approved template from the OPS area web site
        (http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html) and that the
        guidelines therein have been followed.

   5.   IANA Considerations Section -- this section must always be
        present.  If the draft requires no action from the IANA, ensure
        that this is explicitly noted.  If the draft requires URI values
        to be assigned, ensure that the IANA Considerations section
        contains the information specified in [TBD] of these guidelines.
        If the draft contains the initial version of an IANA-maintained
        module, verify that the [TBD] invocation contains maintenance
        instructions that comply with the requirements in RFC 2434.  In
        the latter case, the IANA Considerations section that will
        appear in the RFC MUST contain a pointer to the actual IANA-
        maintained module.

   6.   References -- verify that the references are properly divided
        between normative and informative references, that RFC 2119 is
        included as a normative reference if the terminology defined
        therein is used in the document, that all references required by
        the boilerplate are present, that all YANG modules containing



Bierman                   Expires July 19, 2010                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft            YANG Usage Guidelines             January 2010


        imported items are cited as normative references, and that all
        citations point to the most current RFCs unless there is a valid
        reason to do otherwise (for example, it is OK to include an
        informative reference to a previous version of a specification
        to help explain a feature included for backward compatibility).

   7.   Copyright Notices -- verify that the draft contains an
        abbreviated copyright notice in the description statement of
        each YANG module or sub-module, and that it contains the full
        copyright notice and disclaimer specified in Sections 5.4 and
        5.5 of RFC 3978 at the end of the document.  Make sure that the
        correct year is used in all copyright dates.

   8.   IPR Notice -- if the draft does not contains a verbatim copy of
        the IPR notice specified in Section 5 of RFC 3979, recommend
        that the IPR notice be included.

   9.   Other Issues -- check for any issues mentioned in
        http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html that are not covered
        elsewhere.

   10.  Technical Content -- review the actual technical content for
        compliance with the guidelines in this document.  The use of a
        YANG module compiler is recommended when checking for syntax
        errors; see [YANG tool URL TBD] for more information.  Checking
        for correct syntax, however, is only part of the job.  It is
        just as important to actually read the YANG module document from
        the point of view of a potential implementor.  It is
        particularly important to check that description statements are
        sufficiently clear and unambiguous to allow interoperable
        implementations to be created.
