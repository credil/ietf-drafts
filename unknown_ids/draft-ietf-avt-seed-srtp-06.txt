Internet-Draft                SEED-SRTP             September 29, 2008 
    

1. Introduction 

   This document describes the use of the SEED [RFC4009] block cipher 
   algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] 
   for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol 
   (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the control traffic for RTP, the 
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550]. 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED is a Korean National Industrial Association standard [TTASSEED] 
   and is widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and 
   financial services that are operated on wired and wireless 
   communications. 

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed 
   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts 
   since 1998. The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the 
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has a 16-round Feistel structure.  

1.2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119]. 

2. Cipher Suite Definitions 

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics 
   and valuables, including mode, key size, weak keys, and block size. 
   The following sections contain description of the relevant 
   characteristics of SEED. 

   SEED does not have any restrictions for modes of operation that are 
   used with this block cipher. We define three modes of running SEED 
   and an implementation of this specification may choose to operate in 
   one of them. 

2.1. Counter 

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption, which 
   it refers to as AES-CM. SEED counter mode is defined in a similar 
   manner, and is denoted as SEED-CTR. The plaintext inputs to the block 
   cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and the block cipher outputs are 
   processed as in AES-CM. The only difference in the processing is that 
   SEED-CTR uses SEED as the underlying encryption primitive. 
   Implementations of this specification MUST use SEED-CTR in 
   conjunction with an authentication function. The pre-defined

Internet-Draft                SEED-SRTP             September 29, 2008 
    

   authentication transform for SRTP is HMAC-SHA1 [RFC 2104]. SEED-CTR 
   uses a 112-bit salt as an input, as does AES-CM. The default session 
   authentication key-length SHALL be 160 bits, the default 
   authentication tag length SHALL be 80 bits, and the 
   SRTP_PREFIX_LENGTH SHALL be zero for HMAC-SHA1. For SRTP, smaller 
   values are NOT RECOMMENDED, but MAY be used after careful 
   consideration of the issues in section 7.5 and 9.5 of [RFC3711].  

2.1.1. Key Derivation: SEED-CTR PRF 

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines the AES-128 counter mode key 
   derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF". The SEED-CTR 
   PRF is defined in a similar manner. 

   The currently defined PRF, keyed by the 128-bit master key, has an 
   input block size m = 128 and can produce n-bit outputs for n up to 
   2^23. PRF_n(k_master, x) SHALL be SEED in Counter Mode as described 
   in section 2.1, applied to key k_master, and IV equal to (x*2^16), 
   and with the output keystream truncated to the first (left-most) n 
   bits. 

2.2. Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode [RFC3610]. 
   In this specification, CCM used with the SEED block cipher is denoted 
   as SEED-CCM. 

   SEED-CCM first authenticates and then encrypts a message to construct 
   an SRTP packet. This does not comply with the SRTP packet processing 
   defined in section 3.3 of [RFC3711].  

   SEED-CCM has two parameters: 

     M   M indicates the size of the authentication tag. In SRTP, a full 
         80-bit authentication-tag SHOULD be used, but a shorter tag or 
         even a zero-length tag MAY be used under certain conditions to 
         support either of the following two application environments 
         described in section 7.5 of [RFC3711]. Implementations of this 
         specification MUST support M values of 10 octets, and MAY 
         support M values of less than 10 octets. 

     L   L indicates the size of the length field in octets. In SRTP, 
         the size of the length field is 16 bits, i.e., L is 2.

Internet-Draft                SEED-SRTP             September 29, 2008 
    

   SEED-CCM has four inputs: 

     Key 

         A single key is used to calculate the authentication tag using 
         CBC-MAC and to perform payload encryption using counter mode. 
         SEED only supports a key size of 128 bits. 

     Nonce 

         The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the 
         parameter L. With SRTP, L equals 2 and hence the nonce size 
         equals 13 octets. The SEED-CCM nonce is defined as the most 
         significant 104 bits of the initialization vector (IV) defined 
         in section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711]. 

     Payload 

         The payload of the RTP packet. 

     Additional Authentication Data (AAD) 

         The header of the RTP packet. 

   SEED-CCM generates one output: The final result c consists of the 
   encrypted RTP payload followed by the authentication tag. 

2.3. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) 

   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both 
   confidentiality and data origin authentication [GCM]. GCM used with 
   the SEED block cipher is denoted as SEED-GCM. 

   SEED-GCM has four inputs: a key, a payload, and additional 
   authenticated data (AAD) all described in section 2.1.2, and an 
   initialization vector (IV). 

   SEED-GCM makes use of an IV. The size of the IV is 12 octets. 
   Implementations of this specification MUST support this IV size. The 
   SEED-GCM IV is defined as the most significant 96 bits of the 
   initialization vector (IV) defined in section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711].

3. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only 
   an exhaustive search for the key. For further security considerations, 
   the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL]. 

   See [RFC3610] and [GCM] for security considerations regarding the CCM 
   and GCM Modes of Operation, respectively. In the context of SRTP, the 
   procedures in [RFC3711] ensure the critical property of non-reuse of 
   counter values.
