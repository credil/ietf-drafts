			Along with providing support for certain basic authentication, authorization and accounting functions,
			the Diameter protocol is designed to provide a framework for AAA applications.
			<vspace blankLines="1"/>  
		   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which

		<section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">
			<t>
			   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
			   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
			   RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.
			   <vspace blankLines="1"/>
			   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
			   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
			   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
			   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
			   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
			   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58
			   (<xref target="RFC2578"/>, <xref target="RFC2579"/>, <xref target="RFC2580"/>).
				In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
				base Diameter protocol <xref target="RFC3588"/>.  
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Requirements Language">
			<t>
				The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
				"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
				document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Overview">
			<t>
				This MIB defines objects supporting the management of the Diameter base
				protocol as defined in RFC 3588 <xref target="RFC3588"/>.
				Objects related to Diameter applications are defined in separate documents.
			</t>

		<section title="IANA Considerations">
			<t>
				The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
				OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
<figure suppress-title="true" align="center"><artwork>
      Descriptor                     OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      -----------------------        -----------------------

      diameterBaseProtocolMIB        { mib-2 XXX }
</artwork></figure>
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication)">
						The IANA is requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree
						and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  
						When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
						"XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
						remove this note.
					</t>
				</list>
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<t>
			   There are managed objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS
			   clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be considered 
			   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET 
			   operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can have 
			   a negative effect on network operations.
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
			   There are several of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
			   sensitive information. These are:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>diameterHostAddress</t>
					<t>diameterPeerServerAddress</t>
					<t>diameterPeerIpAddress</t>
				</list>
						These can be used to determine the address of the Diameter
						host, and/or peers with which the host is communicating.
						This information could be useful in impersonating the
						host or peer.
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				It is important to control GET access to these objects and
				possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
				over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
				for such a secure environment.
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
			   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
			   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
			   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read) the
			   objects in this MIB.
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
				features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
				of the User-based Security Model <xref target="RFC3414"/>
				and the View-based Access Control Model <xref target="RFC3415"/>
				is recommended.
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
				entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
				configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
				(users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
				(change/create/delete) them.
