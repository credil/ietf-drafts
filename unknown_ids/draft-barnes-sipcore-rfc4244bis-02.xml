    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a standard mechanism for capturing the history
      information associated with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request.
      This capability enables many enhanced services by providing the
      information as to how and why a call arrives at a specific application
      or user. This document defines an optional SIP header, History-Info, for
      capturing the history information in requests.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Many services that SIP is anticipated to support require the ability
      to determine why and how the call arrived at a specific application.
      Examples of such services include (but are not limited to) sessions
      initiated to call centers via "click to talk" SIP Uniform Resource
      Locators (URLs) on a web page, "call history/logging" style services
      within intelligent "call management" software for SIP User Agents (UAs),
      and calls to voicemail servers. Although SIP implicitly provides the
      redirect/retarget capabilities that enable calls to be routed to chosen
      applications, there is a need for a standard mechanism within SIP for
      communicating the retargeting history of such a request. This "request
      history" information allows the receiving application to determine hints
      about how and why the call arrived at the application/user.</t>

      <t>This document defines a SIP header, History-Info, to provide a
      standard mechanism for capturing the request history information to
      enable a wide variety of services for networks and end-users. The
      History-Info header provides a building block for development of new
      services.</t>

      <t>The requirements for this document are described in <xref
      target="requirements"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The term "retarget" is used in this document to refer both to the
      process of a Proxy Server/User Agent Client (UAC) changing a Uniform
      Resource Identifier (URI) in a request based on the rules for
      determining request targets as described in Section 16.5 of <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref> and the subsequent forwarding of that request
      as described in section 16.6 of <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The term "forward" is used consistent with the terminology in <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref>. Noting that <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>
      uses the term "forwarding" to describe a proxy's handling of requests
      for domains for which is not responsible, as well as to describe the
      basic "forwarding" of a request (in section 16.6) once a target has been
      determined. However, the context of the usage is sufficient to
      differentiate the slightly different meanings.</t>

      <t>The terms "location service" and "redirect" are used consistent with
      the terminology in <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview of Operations">
      <t>SIP implicitly provides retargeting capabilities that enable calls to
      be routed to specific applications as defined in <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref>. The motivation for capturing the request
      history is that in the process of retargeting a request, old routing
      information can be forever lost. This lost information may be important
      history that allows elements to which the call is retargeted to process
      the call in a locally defined, application-specific manner. This
      document defines a mechanism for transporting the request history.
      Application-specific behavior is outside the scope of this
      specification.</t>

      <t>Current network applications provide the ability for elements
      involved with the call to exchange additional information relating to
      how and why the call was routed to a particular destination. The
      following are examples of such applications:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Web "referral" applications, whereby an application residing
          within a web server determines that a visitor to a website has
          arrived at the site via an "associate" site that will receive some
          "referral" commission for generating this traffic</t>

          <t>Email forwarding whereby the forwarded-to user obtains a
          "history" of who sent the email to whom and at what time</t>

          <t>Traditional telephony services such as voicemail, call-center
          "automatic call distribution", and "follow-me" style services</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Several of the aforementioned applications currently define
      application-specific mechanisms through which it is possible to obtain
      the necessary history information.</t>

      <t>In addition, request history information could be used to enhance
      basic SIP functionality by providing the following: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Some diagnostic information for debugging SIP requests. (Note
          that the diagnostic utility of this mechanism is limited by the fact
          that its use by entities that retarget is optional.)</t>

          <t>Capturing aliases and Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs)
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-gruu"></xref>, which can be overwritten
          by a home proxy upon receipt of the initial request.</t>

          <t>Facilitating the use of limited use addresses (minted on demand)
          and sub-addressing.</t>

          <t>Preserving service specific URIs that can be overwritten by a
          downstream proxy, such as those defined in <xref
          target="RFC3087"></xref>, and control of network announcements and
          IVR with SIP URI <xref target="RFC4240"></xref>.</t>

          <t>A stronger security solution for SIP. A side effect is that each
          proxy that captures the "request history" information in a secure
          manner provides an additional means (without requiring signed keys)
          for the original requestor to be assured that the request was
          properly retargeted.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The fundamental functionality provided by the request history
      information is the ability to inform proxies and UAs involved in
      processing a request about the history or progress of that request
      (CAPABILITY-req, see <xref target="requirements"></xref>). The solution
      is to capture the Request-URIs as a request is retargeted, in a new
      header for SIP messages: History-Info (CONTENT-req, see <xref
      target="requirements"></xref>). This allows for the capturing of the
      history of a request that would be lost with the normal SIP processing
      involved in the subsequent retargeting of the request. This solution
      proposes no changes in the fundamental determination of request targets
      or in the request forwarding as defined in Sections 16.5 and 16.6 of the
      SIP protocol specification <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The History-Info header can appear in any request not associated with
      an established dialog (e.g., INVITE, REGISTER, MESSAGE, REFER and
      OPTIONS, PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE, etc.) (REQUEST-VALIDITY-req, see<xref
      target="requirements"></xref>) and any valid response to these requests
      (ISSUER-req, see<xref target="requirements"></xref>).</t>

      <t>This specification defines parameters (see <xref
      target="definition"></xref>) for carrying the following information in
      the History-Info header:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Targeted-to-URI: The targeted-to-URI entry captures the
          Request-URI for the specific Request as it is forwarded.</t>

          <t>Index: The index reflects the chronological order of the
          information, indexed to also reflect the forking and nesting of
          requests.</t>

          <t>Reason: Reason describes why an entry was retargeted.</t>

          <t>Privacy: Privacy is used to request that entries be
          anonymized.</t>

          <t>AOR indicator: The AOR indicator is to mark an URI entry as being
          an Address Of Record.</t>

          <t>Target: The target parameter indicates the mechanism by which the
          new target is determined, i.e., a "registered contact", an
          "implicitly contact obtained through means other than SIP
          registration", a "mapped URI", or just "normal routing."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The following is an illustrative example of usage of
      History-Info.</t>

      <t>In this example, Alice (sip:alice@atlanta.example.com) calls Bob
      (sip:bob@biloxi.example.com). Alice's home proxy
      (sip:atlanta.example.com) forwards the request to Bob's proxy
      (sip:biloxi.example.com). When the request arrives at
      sip:biloxi.example.com, it does a location service lookup for
      bob@biloxi.example.com and changes the target of the request to Bob's
      Contact URIs provided as part of normal SIP registration. In this
      example, Bob is simultaneously contacted on a PC client and on a phone,
      and Bob answers on the PC client.</t>

      <t>One important thing illustrated by this call flow is that without
      History-Info, Bob would "lose" the target information, including any
      parameters in the request URI. Bob can now recover that information by
      looking for the last hi-entry marked as "aor."</t>

      <t>The formatting in this scenario is for visual purposes; thus,
      backslash and CRLF are used between the fields for readability and the
      headers in the URI are not shown properly formatted for escaping. Refer
      to <xref target="example"></xref> for the proper formatting. Additional
      detailed scenarios are available in the <xref
      target="appendix"></xref>.</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Note: This example uses loose routing procedures.</t>

    <section anchor="ua" title="General User Agent Behavior">
      <t>This section describes the processing specific to UAs for the
      History-Info header.</t>

      <section anchor="uac" title="User Agent Client (UAC) Behavior">
        <t>The UAC SHOULD include the "histinfo" option tag in the Supported
        header in any request not associated with an established dialog for
        which the UAC would like the History-Info header in the response. In
        addition, the UAC MAY add a History-Info header, using the Request-URI
        of the request as the hi-target-to-uri, in which case the index MUST
        be set to a value of 1 in the hi-entry. As a result, intermediaries
        and the UAS will know at least the original Request-URI, and if the
        Request-URI was modified by a previous hop. Normally, UACs are not
        expected to include a History-Info header in an initial request as it
        is more of a Proxy function; the main reason it is allowed is for
        B2BUAs who are performing proxy-like functions like routing.</t>

        <t>A UAC that does not want an hi-entry added due to privacy
        considerations MUST include a Privacy header with a priv-value(s) of
        "header" or "history." A UAC that wants to ensure that privacy not be
        applied to its identity MUST include a Privacy header with a
        priv-value of "none."</t>

        <t>In the case where a UAC receives a 3xx response with a Contact
        header and sends a new request in response to it, the UAC MUST include
        in the outgoing request the previous hi-entry(s) received in the
        response. The UAC MUST evaluate the last hi-entry in the 3xx response
        and verify that they are the same (as per the procedures in section
        <xref target="redirect"></xref>); if the hi-entry is not the same as
        the value in contact, hi-entry MUST be added using the value of
        Contact.</t>

        <t>If the hi-entry for the redirection is not included in the 3xx
        response, then an hi-entry MUST be added to the outgoing request. In
        this case, the index MUST be created by reading and incrementing the
        value of the index from the previous hi-entry, thus following the same
        rules as those prescribed for a proxy in retargeting, described in
        <xref target="indexhi"></xref>. The reason MUST be added per <xref
        target="reasonhi"></xref>. The hi-target and hi-aor attributes MUST
        NOT be added to this hi-entry since there is no way to know the
        mechanism by which the redirecting entity determined the URI in the
        Contact header nor whether the previous hi-targeted-to-uri was an
        AOR.</t>

        <t>If no hi-entry for redirection were included at all in the 3xx
        response, and multiple redirection occurs, the UAC MAY attempt to
        synthetise the missing hi-entrie(s) before inserting the last one (as

        MESSAGE, REFER, OPTIONS, SUBSCRIBE, and PUBLISH and any valid

        <t>The History-Info header carries the following information, with the
        mandatory parameters required when the header is included in a request
        or response:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Targeted-to-URI (hi-targeted-to-uri): A mandatory parameter for
            capturing the Request-URI for the specific Request as it is
            forwarded.</t>

            <t>Index (hi-index): A mandatory parameter for History-Info
            reflecting the chronological order of the information, indexed to
            also reflect the forking and nesting of requests. The format for
            this parameter is a string of digits, separated by dots to
            indicate the number of forward hops and retargets. This results in
            a tree representation of the history of the request, with the
            lowest-level index reflecting a branch of the tree. By adding the
            new entries in order (i.e., following existing entries per the
            details in <xref target="addhi"></xref>), including the index and
            securing the header, the ordering of the History-Info headers in
            the request is assured (SEC-req-2, see <xref
            target="secreq"></xref>). In addition, applications may extract a
            variety of metrics (total number of retargets, total number of
            retargets from a specific branch, etc.) based upon the index
            values.</t>

            <t>Reason: An optional parameter for History-Info, reflected in
            the History-Info header by including the Reason Header <xref
            target="RFC3326"></xref> escaped in the hi-targeted-to-uri. A
            reason is included for the hi-targeted-to-uri that was retargeted
            as opposed to the hi-targeted-to-uri to which it was
            retargeted.</t>

            <t>Privacy: An optional parameter for History-Info, reflected in
            the History-Info header field values by including the Privacy
            Header <xref target="RFC3323"></xref> escaped in the hi-
            targeted-to-uri or by adding the Privacy header to the Request.
            The latter case indicates that the History-Info entries for the
            domain MUST be anonymized prior to forwarding, whereas the use of
            the Privacy header escaped in the hi-targeted-to-uri means that a
            specific hi-entry MUST be anonymized.</t>

            <t>AOR indicator (hi-aor): An optional parameter for the
            History-Info indicating that the hi-targeted-to-uri is an Address
            Of Record (as defined in section 6/<xref target="RFC3261"></xref>)
            . The hi-aor parameter is added by a proxy or redirect server to a
            hi-entry when it recognizes the URI in the last entry as a URI in
            its abstract location service (and then it can be routed
            accordingly). Therefore, the hi-aor parameter (i.e., "aor") is not
            added for a hi-entry when it is first added in a History-Info
            header field, but rather is added when the retargeting actually
            occurs - i.e., the parameter indicates that the specific
            hi-targeted-to-uri that was retargeted was an AOR and thus the
            previous information in the request-URI may be "lost". Upon
            receipt of a request or response containing the History-Info
            header, a UA can determine a "lost" target AOR for a request by
            traversing the HI entries in reverse order to find the first one
            tagged with a specific hi-aor parameter.</t>

            <t>Target (hi-target): A mandatory parameter for the History-Info
            indicating the mechanism by which the new target is determined,
            based on the procedures of 16.5 <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>.
            The hi-target is added for a hi-entry when it is first added in a
            History-Info header field, and only one value is permitted. Upon
            receipt of a request or response containing the History-Info
            header, a UA can determine the nature of the target. The following
            values are defined for this parameter:<list style="symbols">

      <section title="Procedures">
        <t>The following sections defines procedures for different parameters
        in the History-Info header. These procedures may be applicable to
        "processing entities" such as Proxies, Redirect Servers or User
        Agents.</t>

        <section anchor="privacyhi" title="Privacy in the History-Info Header">
          <t>The privacy requirements for this document are described in <xref
          target="privacyreq"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Since the History-Info header can inadvertently reveal
          information about the requestor as described in <xref
          target="RFC3323"></xref>, the Privacy header can be used to
          determine whether an intermediary can include the Request-URI in a
          Request that it receives (PRIV-req-2, see <xref
          target="privacyreq"></xref>) or that it retargets (PRIV-req-1, see
          <xref target="privacyreq"></xref>) as an entry in a History-Info
          header. Thus, the History- Info entry for that identity can be
          anonymized where the requestor has indicated a priv-value of
          Session- or Header-level privacy.</t>

          <t>Privacy is associated with a specific history information entry,
          and perhaps any entry that corresponds to that same user, and not
          the History-Info header itself. This allows for anonymizing some
          entries, but not others, as required. For example, if Alice sends a
          request to Bob without any privacy, and Bob redirects to Carol with
          privacy setup for himself, Carol should receive a request where
          Alice's history information is present, but Bob's has been
          anonymized.</t>

          <t>In addition, the History-Info header can reveal general routing
          information which may be viewed by a specific intermediary or
          network. Thus, a proxy can use local policy to determine whether the
          History-Info header entries for it's whole domain are private or not
          when exiting the domain through retargeting (PRIV-req-3). This is
          accomplished by adding a new priv-value, history, to the Privacy
          header <xref target="RFC3323"></xref> indicating that a specific
          History-Info header entry can not be forwarded outside the
          domain.</t>

          <t>It is recognized that satisfying the privacy requirements can
          impact the functionality of this solution by overriding the request
          to generate the information.</t>

          <t>If there is a Privacy header in the request with a priv-value of
          "session", "header", or "history", an hi-entry SHOULD be added if
          the request is being retargeted to a URI associated with a domain
          for which the processing entity is responsible. If there is no
          Privacy header, but the processing entity's local policies indicate
          that the hi-entry(s) cannot be forwarded beyond the domain for which
          this intermediary is responsible, then a Privacy header with a
          priv-value of "history" SHOULD be associated with each hi-entry
          added by the proxy as the request is forwarded within the
          domain.</t>

          <t>If a request is being retargeted to a URI associated with a
          domain for which the processing identity is not responsible and
          there is a Privacy header in the request with a priv-value of
          "session", "header", or "history", the processing entity MUST
          anonymize hi-entry(s) as per <xref target="RFC3323"></xref> prior to
          forwarding, unless the processing entity knows a priori that it can
          rely on a downstream processing entity within its domain to apply
          the requested privacy or local policy allows the forwarding.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="reasonhi" title="Reason in the History-Info Header">
          <t>For retargets that are the result of an explicit SIP response, a
          Reason MUST be associated with the hi-targeted-to-uri. If the SIP
          response does not include a Reason header (see <xref
          target="RFC3326"></xref>), the SIP Response Code that triggered the
          retargeting MUST be included as the Reason associated with the
          hi-targeted-to-uri that has been retargeted. If the response
          contains a Reason header for a protocol that is not SIP (e.g.,
          Q.850), it MUST be captured as an additional Reason associated with
          the hi-targeted-to- uri that has been retargeted, along with the SIP
          Response Code. If the Reason header is a SIP reason, then it MUST be
          used as the Reason associated with the hi-targeted-to-uri rather
          than the SIP response code.</t>

          <t>If a request has timed out (instead of being explicitly
          rejected), it SHOULD be treated as if a 487 "Request Terminated"
          error response code was received.</t>

        <section anchor="aorhi" title="AOR Marking in the History-Info Header">
          <t>If the processing entity (Redirect Server or Proxy) is
          responsible for the domain of the Request-URI of the incoming
          request, and will treat it as an AOR as per section 16.5 of <xref
          target="RFC3261"></xref>, the processing entity MUST set the hi-aor
          parameter for the hi-entry that represents the Request-URI of the
          incoming request to "aor."</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="indexhi" title="Indexing in the History-Info Header">
          <t>In order to maintain ordering and accurately reflect the nesting
          and retargeting of the request, an index MUST be included along with
          the Targeted-to-URI being captured. Per the syntax in <xref
          target="structure"></xref>, the index consists of a dot-delimited
          series of digits (e.g., 1.1.2). Each dot reflects a hop or level of
          nesting; thus, the number of hops is determined by the total number
          of dots. Within each level, the integer reflects the number of peer
          entities to which the request has been routed. Thus, the indexing
          results in a logical tree representation for the history of the
          Request. For each level of indexing, the index MUST start at 1. An
          increment of 1 MUST be used for advancing to a new branch. The first
          entry MUST be set to 1.</t>

          <t>The basic rules for adding the index are summarized as follows:
          <list style="numbers">
              <t>Basic Forwarding: In the case of a Request that is being
              forwarded, the index is determined by adding another sub-level
              of indexing since the depth/length of the branch is increasing.
              To accomplish this, the processing entity reads the value from
              the History-Info header in the received request, if available,
              and adds another level of indexing by appending the dot
              delimiter followed by an initial index for the new level of 1.
              For example, if the index in the last History-Info header field
              in the received request is 1.1, this proxy would initialize its
              index to 1.1.1 and forward the request.</t>

              <t>Retargeting within a processing entity - 1st instance: For
              the first instance of retargeting within a processing entity,
              the calculation of the index follows that prescribed for basic
              forwarding.</t>

              <t>Retargeting within a processing entity - subsequent instance:
              For each subsequent retargeting of a request by the same
              processing entity, another branch is added. With the index for
              each new branch calculated by incrementing the last/lowest digit
              at the current level, the index in the next request forwarded by
              this same processing entity, following the example above, would
              be 1.1.2.</t>

              <t>Retargeting based upon a Response: In the case of retargeting
              due to a specific response (e.g., 302), the index would be
              calculated per rule 3. That is, the lowest/last digit of the
              index is incremented (i.e., a new branch is created), with the
              increment of 1. For example, if the index in the History-Info
              header of the received request was 1.2, then the index in the
              History-Info header field for the new hi-targeted- to-URI would
              be 1.3.</t>

              <t>Forking requests: If the request forwarding is done in
              multiple forks (sequentially or in parallel), the index MUST be
              captured for each forked request per the rules above, with each
              new Request having a unique index. Each index are sequentially
              assigned. For example, if the index in the last History-Info
              header field in the received request is 1.1, this processing
              entity would initialize its index to 1.1.1 for the first fork,
              1.1.2 for the second, and so forth (see <xref
              target="basicFlow"></xref> for an example). Note that for each
              individual fork, only the entry corresponding that that fork is
              included (e.g., the entry for fork 1.1.1 is not included in the
              request sent to fork 1.1.2, and vice-versa).</t>

              <t>When a response is built and it represents the aggregate of
              multiple forks (e.g., multiple forks that fail), the processing
              entity builds the subsequent response using the aggregated
              information associated with each of those forks and including
              the header entries in the order indicated by the indexing. For
              example, if a procesing entity received failure responses for
              forks 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, it would forward both the 1.1.1 and 1.1.2
              entries to 1.1. See <xref target="fork"></xref> for an example.
              Responses are processed as described in Section 16.7 of <xref
              target="RFC3261"></xref> with the aggregated History-Info
              entries processed similar to Step 7 "Aggregate Authentication
              Header Field Values".</t>

    <section anchor="application" title="Application Considerations">
      <t>As seen by the example scenarios in the <xref
      target="appendix"></xref>, History-Info provides a very flexible
      building block that can be used by intermediaries and UAs for a variety
      of services. As such, any services making use of History-Info must be
      designed with the following considerations:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>History-Info is optional; thus, a service MUST define default
          behavior for requests and responses not containing History-Info
          headers.</t>

          <t>History-Info may be impacted by privacy considerations.
          Applications requiring History-Info need to be aware that if
          Header-, Session-, or History-level privacy is requested by a UA (or
          imposed by an intermediary) that History-Info may not be available
          in a request or response. This would be addressed by an application
          in the same manner as the previous consideration by ensuring there
          is reasonable default behavior should the information not be
          available.</t>

          <t>History-Info may be impacted by local policy. Each application
          making use of the History-Info header SHOULD address the impacts of
          the local policies on the specific application (e.g., what
          specification of local policy is optimally required for a specific
          application and any potential limitations imposed by local policy
          decisions). Note that this is related to the optionality and privacy
          considerations identified in 1 and 2 above, but goes beyond that.
          For example, due to the optionality and privacy considerations, an
          entity may receive only partial History-Info entries; will this
          suffice? Note that this would be a limitation for debugging
          purposes, but might be perfectly satisfactory for some models
          whereby only the information from a specific intermediary is
          required.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security requirements for this document are specified in <xref
      target="secreq"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document defines a header for SIP. The use of the Transport
      Layer Security (TLS) protocol <xref target="RFC5246"></xref> as a
      mechanism to ensure the overall confidentiality of the History-Info
      headers (SEC-req-4) is strongly RECOMMENDED. This results in
      History-Info having at least the same level of security as other headers
      in SIP that are inserted by intermediaries. With TLS, History-Info
      headers are no less, nor no more, secure than other SIP headers, which
      generally have even more impact on the subsequent processing of SIP
      sessions than the History-Info header.</t>

      <t>With the level of security provided by TLS (SEC-req-3), the
      information in the History-Info header can thus be evaluated to
      determine if information has been removed by evaluating the indices for
      gaps (SEC-req-1, SEC-req-2). It would be up to the application to define
      whether it can make use of the information in the case of missing
      entries.</t>

      <t>Note that while using the SIPS scheme (as per <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sip-sips"></xref>) protects History-Info from tampering
      by arbitrary parties outside the SIP message path, all the
      intermediaries on the path are trusted implicitly. A malicious
      intermediary could arbitrarily delete, rewrite, or modify History-Info.
      This specification does not attempt to prevent or detect attacks by
      malicious intermediaries.</t>

    <section title="Changes from RFC 4244">
      <t>This RFC replaces <xref target="RFC4244"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Deployment experience with <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> over the
      years has shown a number of issues, warranting an update:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>In order to make <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> work in "real
          life", one needs to make "assumptions" on how History-Info is used.
          For example, many implementations filter out many entries, and only
          leave specific entries corresponding, for example, to first and last
          redirection. Since vendors uses different rules, it causes
          significant interoperability isssues.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4244"></xref> is overly permissive and evasive
          about recording entries, causing interoperability issues.</t>

          <t>There is an error in the ABNF.</t>

          <t>The examples in the call flows had errors, and confusing because
          they often assume "loose routing."</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4244"></xref> has lots of repetitive and unclear
          text</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4244"></xref> gratuitly mandates the use of TLS
          on every hop. No existing implementation enforces this rule, and
          instead, the use of TLS or not is a general SIP issue, not an <xref
          target="RFC4244"></xref> issue per se.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4244"></xref> does not include clear procedures
          on how to deliver current target URI information to the UAS when the
          Request-URI is replaced with a contact.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4244"></xref> does not allow for marking
          History-Info entries for easy processing by User Agents.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This specification is backwards compatible with <xref
      target="RFC4244"></xref>. The following summarizes the functional
      changes:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Added a tag to indicate an AOR that is lost during retargeted:
          hi-aor.</t>

          <t>Added a tag to indicate the mechanism by which the target for an
          outgoing request is determined.</t>

          <t>Rather than recommending that entries be removed in the case of
          certain values of the privacy header, recommend that the entries are
          anonymized.</t>

          <t>Updated processing/handling for 3xx responses to ensure accuracy
          of the new tags - i.e., the redirecting entity must add the new
          entry since the proxy does not have access to the information as to
          how the Contact was determined.</t>

          <t>Updated the security section to be equivalent to the security
          recommendations for other SIP headers inserted by
          intermediaries.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The first 3 changes are intended to facilitate application usage of
      the History-Info header and eliminate the need to make assumptions based
      upon the order of the entries and ensure that the most complete set of
      information is available to the applications.</t>

      <t>In addition, an error in the ABNF was fixed, editorial changes were
      done to both condense and clarify the text and examples were simplified
      and updated to reflect the protocol changes.</t>

      <section title="Backwards compatibility">
        <t>Proxies conforming to this specification tag the hi-entry
        parameters with an hi-target parameter. The hi-target and hi-aor
        parameters did not exist in <xref target="RFC4244"></xref>; therefore,
        <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> implementations do not tag the hi-entry
        parameters. This tagging allows for distinguishing entries that were
        added by an <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> entity, versus one that was
        added by an entity conforming to this specification.</t>

    <section title="Changes since last Version">
      <t>NOTE TO THE RFC-Editor: Please remove this section prior to
      publication as an RFC.</t>

      <t>Changes from barnes-sipcore-4244bis-01 to 02:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Added hi-aor parameter that gets marked on the "incoming"
          hi-entry.</t>

          <t>Hi-target parameter defined to be either rc, oc, mp, rt, and now
          gets included when adding an entry.</t>

          <t>Added section on backwards compatibility, as well as added the
          recognition and handling of requests that do not support this
          specification in the appropriate sections.</t>

          <t>Updated redirect server/3xx handling to support the new
          parameters - i.e., the redirecting entity must add the new entry
          since the proxy does not have access to the information as to how
          the Contact was determined.</t>

          <t>Added section on normative differences between this document and
          RFC 4244.</t>

          <t>Restructuring of document to be more in line with current IETF
          practices.</t>

          <t>Moved Requirements section into an Appendix.</t>

          <t>Fixed ABNF to remove unintended ordering requirement on hi-index
          that was introduced in attempting to illustrate it was a mandatory
          parameter.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Changes from barnes-sipcore-4244bis-00 to 01 :<list style="numbers">
          <t>Clarified "retarget" definition.</t>

          <t>Removed privacy discussion from optionality section - just refer
          to privacy section.</t>

          <t>Removed extraneous text from target-parameter (leftover from
          sip-4244bis). Changed the terminology from the "reason" to the
          "mechanism" to avoid ambiguity with parameter.</t>

          <t>Various changes to clarify some of the text around privacy.</t>

          <t>Reverted proxy response handling text to previous form - just
          changing the privacy aspects to anonymize, rather than remove.</t>

          <t>Other editorial changes to condense and simplify.</t>

          <t>Moved Privacy examples to Appendix.</t>

          <t>Added forking to Basic call example.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Changes from barnes-sip-4244bis-00 to barnes-sipcore-4244bis-00:<list
          style="numbers">
          <t>Added tags for each type of retargeting including proxy hops,
          etc. - i.e., a tag is defined for each specific mechanism by which
          the new Request-URI is determined. Note, this is extremely helpful
          in terms of backwards compatibility.</t>

          <t>Fixed all the examples. Made sure loose routing was used in all
          of them.</t>

          <t>Removed example where a proxy using strict routing is using
          History-Info for avoiding trying same route twice.</t>

          <t>Remove redundant Redirect Server example.</t>

          <t>Index are now mandated to start at "1" instead of
          recommended.</t>

          <t>Clarified 3xx behavior as the entity sending the 3XX response
          MUST add the hi-target attribute to the previous hi-entry to ensure
          that it is appropriately tagged (i.e., it's the only one that knows
          how the contact in the 3xx was determined.)</t>

          <t>Removed lots of ambiguity by making many "MAYs" into "SHOULDs"
          and "some "SHOULDs" into "MUSTs".</t>

          <t>Privacy is now recommended to be done by anonymizing entries as
          per RFC 3323 instead of by removing or omitting hi-entry(s).</t>

          <t>Requirement for TLS is now same level as per RFC 3261.</t>

          <t>Clarified behavior for "Privacy" (i.e., that Privacy is for
          Hi-entries, not headers).</t>

          <t>Removed "OPTIONALITY" as specific requirements, since it's rather
          superflous.</t>

          <t>Other editorial changes to remove redundant text/sections.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Changes from RFC4244 to barnes-sip-4244bis-00:<list style="numbers">
          <t>Clarified that HI captures both retargeting as well as cases of
          just forwarding a request.</t>

          <t>Added descriptions of the usage of the terms "retarget",
          "forward" and "redirect" to the terminology section.</t>

          <t>Added additional examples for the functionality provided by HI
          for core SIP.</t>

          <t>Added hi-target parameter values to HI header to ABNF and
          protocol description, as well as defining proxy, UAC and UAS
          behavior for the parameter.</t>

          <t>Simplified example call flow in section 4.5. Moved previous call
          flow to appendix.</t>

          <t>Fixed ABNF per RFC4244 errata "dot" -&gt; "." and added new
          parameter.</t>

    <section anchor="requirements" title="Request History Requirements">
      <t>The following list constitutes a set of requirements for a "Request
      History" capability.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>CAPABILITY-req: The "Request History" capability provides a
          capability to inform proxies and UAs involved in processing a
          request about the history/progress of that request. Although this is
          inherently provided when the retarget is in response to a SIP
          redirect, it is deemed useful for non-redirect retargeting
          scenarios, as well.</t>

          <t>GENERATION-req: "Request History" information is generated when
          the request is retargeted. <list style="letters">
              <t>In some scenarios, it might be possible for more than one
              instance of retargeting to occur within the same Proxy. A proxy
              should also generate Request History information for the
              'internal retargeting'.</t>

              <t>An entity (UA or proxy) retargeting in response to a redirect
              or REFER should include any Request History information from the
              redirect/REFER in the new request.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>ISSUER-req: "Request History" information can be generated by a
          UA or proxy. It can be passed in both requests and responses.</t>

          <t>CONTENT-req: The "Request History" information for each
          occurrence of retargeting shall include the following:<list
              style="letters">
              <t>The new URI or address to which the request is in the process
              of being retargeted,</t>

              <t>The URI or address from which the request was retargeted, and
              wether the retarget URI was an AOR</t>

              <t>The mechanism by which the new URI or address was
              determined,</t>

              <t>The reason for the Request-URI or address modification,</t>

              <t>Chronological ordering of the Request History
              information.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>REQUEST-VALIDITY-req: Request History is applicable to requests
          not sent within an established dialog (e.g., INVITE, REGISTER,
          MESSAGE, and OPTIONS).</t>

          <t>BACKWARDS-req: Request History information may be passed from the
          generating entity backwards towards the UAC. This is needed to
          enable services that inform the calling party about the dialog
          establishment attempts.</t>

          <t>FORWARDS-req: Request History information may also be included by
          the generating entity in the request, if it is forwarded
          onwards.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section anchor="secreq" title="Security Requirements">
        <t>The Request History information is being inserted by a network
        element retargeting a Request, resulting in a slightly different
        problem than the basic SIP header problem, thus requiring specific
        consideration. It is recognized that these security requirements can
        be generalized to a basic requirement of being able to secure
        information that is inserted by proxies.</t>

        <t>The potential security problems include the following: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>A rogue application could insert a bogus Request History entry
            either by adding an additional entry as a result of retargeting or
            entering invalid information.</t>

            <t>A rogue application could re-arrange the Request History
            information to change the nature of the end application or to
            mislead the receiver of the information.</t>

            <t>A rogue application could delete some or all of the Request
            History information.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Thus, a security solution for "Request History" must meet the
        following requirements: <list style="numbers">
            <t>SEC-req-1: The entity receiving the Request History must be
            able to determine whether any of the previously added Request
            History content has been altered.</t>

            <t>SEC-req-2: The ordering of the Request History information must
            be preserved at each instance of retargeting.</t>

            <t>SEC-req-3: The entity receiving the information conveyed by the
            Request History must be able to authenticate the entity providing
            the request.</t>

            <t>SEC-req-4: To ensure the confidentiality of the Request History
            information, only entities that process the request should have
            visibility to the information.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>It should be noted that these security requirements apply to any
        entity making use of the Request History information.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="privacyreq" title="Privacy Requirements">
        <t>Since the Request-URI that is captured could inadvertently reveal
        information about the originator, there are general privacy
        requirements that MUST be met: <list style="numbers">
            <t>PRIV-req-1: The entity retargeting the Request must ensure that
            it maintains the network-provided privacy (as described in <xref
            target="RFC3323"></xref>) associated with the Request as it is
            retargeted.</t>

            <t>PRIV-req-2: The entity receiving the Request History must
            maintain the privacy associated with the information. In addition,
            local policy at a proxy may identify privacy requirements
            associated with the Request-URI being captured in the Request
            History information.</t>

            <t>PRIV-req-3: Request History information subject to privacy
            shall not be included in ougoing messages unless it is protected
            as described in <xref target="RFC3323"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="appendix" title="Detailed call flows">
      <t>The scenarios in this section provide sample use cases for the
      History-Info header for informational purposes only. They are not
      intended to be normative.</t>

      <section anchor="fork"
               title="Sequentially Forking (History-Info in Response)">
        <t>This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the
        response is useful to an application or user that originated the
        request.</t>

        <t>Alice sends a call to Bob via sip:example.com. The proxy
        sip:example.com sequentially tries Bob on a SIP UA that has bound a
        contact with the sip:bob@example.com AOR, and then several alternate
        addresses (Office and Home) unsuccessfully before sending a response
        to Alice. In this example, note that Office and Home are not the same
        AOR as sip:bob@example.com, but rather different AORs that have been
        configured as alternate addresses for Bob in the proxy. In other
        words, Office and Bob are not bound through SIP Registration with
        Bob's AOR. This type of arrangement is common for example when a
        "routing" rule to a PSTN number is manually configured in a Proxy.</t>

        <t>This scenario is provided to show that by providing the
        History-Info to Alice, the end-user or an application at Alice could
        make a decision on how best to attempt finding Bob. Without this
        mechanism, Alice might well attempt Office (and thus Home) and then
        re-attempt Home on a third manual attempt at reaching Bob. With this
        mechanism, either the end-user or application could know that Bob is
        not answering in the Office, and his busy on his home phone. If there
        were an alternative address for Bob known to this end-user or
        application, that hasn't been attempted, then either the application
        or the end- user could attempt that. The intent here is to highlight
        an example of the flexibility of this mechanism that enables
        applications well beyond SIP as it is certainly well beyond the scope
        of this document to prescribe detailed applications.</t>

        <t>This scenario highlights an example where the History-Info in the
        request is primarily of use by an edge service (e.g., voicemail
        server). It should be noted that this is not intended to be a complete
        specification for this specific edge service as it is quite likely
        that additional information is needed by the edge service.
        History-Info is just one building block that this service can use.</t>

        <t>Alice called Bob, which had been forwarded to Carol, which
        forwarded to VM (voicemail server). Based upon the retargeted URIs and
        Reasons (and other information) in the INVITE, the VM server makes a
        policy decision about what mailbox to use, which greeting to play,
        etc.</t>

      <section anchor="acd" title="Automatic Call Distribution">
        <t>This scenario highlights an example of an Automatic Call
        Distribution service, where the agents are divided into groups based
        upon the type of customers they handle. In this example, the Gold
        customers are given higher priority than Silver customers, so a Gold
        call would get serviced even if all the agents servicing the Gold
        group were busy, by retargeting the request to the Silver Group for
        delivery to an agent. Upon receipt of the call at the agent assigned
        to handle the incoming call, based upon the History-Info header in the
        message, the application at the agent can provide an indication that
        this is a Gold call, from how many groups it might have overflowed
        before reaching the agent, etc. and thus can be handled appropriately
        by the agent.</t>

        <t>For scenarios whereby calls might overflow from the Silver to the
        Gold, clearly the alternate group identification, internal routing, or
        actual agent that handles the call should not be sent to UA1. Thus,
        for this scenario, one would expect that the Proxy would not support
        the sending of the History-Info in the response, even if requested by
        Alice.</t>

        <t>As with the other examples, this is not prescriptive of how one
        would do this type of service but an example of a subset of processing
        that might be associated with such a service. In addition, this
        example is not addressing any aspects of Agent availability, which
        might also be done via a SIP interface.</t>
