Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements        March 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines Advanced IPv6 features for a residential or
   small office router referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically
   these routers also support IPv4.  The IPv6 End-user Network
   Architecture for such a router is described in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router].  This version of the document
   includes the requirements for Advanced features.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   End-user Network          one or more links attached to the IPv6 CE
                             router that connect IPv6 hosts.

   IPv6 Customer Edge router a node intended for home or small office
                             use which forwards IPv6 packets not
                             explicitly addressed to itself.  The IPv6
                             CE router connects the end-user network to
                             a service provider network.

   IPv6 host                 any device implementing an IPv6 stack
                             receiving IPv6 connectivity through the
                             IPv6 CE router

   LAN interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link in
                             the end-user network.  Examples are
                             Ethernets (simple or bridged), 802.11
                             wireless or other LAN technologies.  An
                             IPv6 CE router may have one or more network
                             layer LAN Interfaces.

   Service Provider          an entity that provides access to the
                             Internet.  In this document, a Service
                             Provider specifically offers Internet
                             access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4
                             Internet access.  The Service Provider can
                             provide such access over a variety of
                             different transport methods such as DSL,
                             cable, wireless, and others.

   WAN interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link
                             used to provide connectivity to the Service
                             Provider network; example link technologies
                             include Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP
                             links, Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well
                             as Internet-layer (or higher-layer)
                             "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or
                             IPv6 itself.


3.  Conceptual Configuration Variables

   The CE Router maintains such a list of conceptual optional
   configuration variables.

   1.  Enable an IGP on the LAN.


4.  Architecture

   This document extends the architecture described in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router] to cover a strictly larger set of
   operational scenarios.  In particular, QoS, multicast, DNS, routed
   network in the home, transition technologies, and conceptual
   configuration variables.  This document also extends the model
   described in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router] to a two router
   topology where the two routers are connected back-to-back (the LAN of
   one router is connected to the WAN of the other router).  This
   topology is depicted below:

   For DNS, the operational expectation is that the end-user would be
   able to access home hosts from the home using DNS names instead of
   more cumbersome IPv6 addresses.  Note that this is distinct from the
   requirement to access home hosts from outside the home.

   End-users are expected to be able to receive multicast video in the
   home without requiring the CE router to include the cost of
   supporting full multicast routing protocols.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements        March 2011


5.  Advanced Features and Feature Requirements

   The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  This document describes an IPv6 CE
   router that is not specific to any particular architecture or Service
   Provider, and supports all commonly used architectures.

5.1.  DNS

   D-1:  For local DNS queries for configuration, the CE Router MAY
         include a DNS server to handle local queries.  Non-local
         queries can be forwarded unchanged to a DNS server specified in
         the DNS server DHCPv6 option.  The CE Router MAY also include
         DNS64 functionality which is specified in
         [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64].

   D-2:  The local DNS server MAY also handle renumbering from the
         Service Provider provided prefix for local names used
         exclusively inside the home (the local AAAA and PTR records are
         updated).  This capability provides connectivity using local
         DNS names in the home after a Service Provider renumbering.  A
         CE Router MAY add local DNS entries based on dynamic requests
         from the LAN segment(s).  The protocol to carry such requests
         from hosts to the CE Router is yet to be described.

5.2.  Multicast Behavior

   This section is only applicable to a CE Router with at least one LAN
   interface.  A host in the home is expected to receive multicast
   video.  Note the CE Router resides at edge of the home and the
   Service Provider, and the CE Router has at least one WAN connection
   for multiple LAN connections.  In such a multiple LAN to a WAN
   toplogy at the CE Router edge, it is not necessary to run a multicast
   routing protocol and thus MLD Proxy as specified in [RFC4605] can be
   used.  The CE Router discovers the hosts via a MLDv2 Router
   implementation on a LAN interface.  A WAN interface of the CE Router
   interacts with the Service Provider router by sending MLD Reports and
   replying to MLD queries for multicast Group memberships for hosts in
   the home.

   The CE router SHOULD implement MLD Proxy as specified in [RFC4605].
   For the routed topology shown in Figure 1, each router implements a
   MLD Proxy.  If the CE router implements MLD Proxy, the requirements
   on the CE Router for MLD Proxy are listed below.

   WAN requirements, MLD Proxy:

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements        March 2011


   WMLD-1:  Consistent with [RFC4605], the CE router MUST NOT implement
            the router portion of MLDv2 for the WAN interface.

   LAN requirements, MLD Proxy:

   LMMLD-1:  The CPE Router MUST follow the model described for MLD
             Proxy in [RFC4605] to implement multicast.

   LMMLD-2:  Consistent with [RFC4605], the LAN interfaces on the CPE
             router MUST NOT implement an MLDv2 Multicast Listener.

   LAN requirements:

   LM-1:  If the CE Router has bridging configured between the LAN
          interfaces, then the LAN interfaces MUST support snooping of
          MLD [RFC3810] messages.

5.3.  ND Proxy

   LAN requirements:

   LNDP-1:  If the CE Router has only one /64 prefix to be used across
            multiple LAN interfaces and the CE Router supports any two
            LAN interfaces that cannot bridge data between them because
            the two interfaces have disparate MAC layers, then the CE
            Router MUST support Proxying Neighbor Advertisements as
            specified in Section 7.2.8 of [RFC4861].  If any two LAN
            interfaces support bridging between the interfaces, then
            Proxying Neighbor Advertisements is not necessary between
            the two interfaces.  Legacy 3GPP networks have the following
            requirements:

            1.  No DHCPv6 prefix is delegated to the CE Router.

            2.  Only one /64 is available on the WAN link.

            3.  The link types between the WAN interface and LAN
                interface(s) are disparate and, therefore, can't be
                bridged.

            4.  No NAT66 is to be used.

            5.  Each LAN interface needs global connectivity.

            6.  Uses SLAAC to configure LAN interface addresses.

            For these legacy 3GPP networks, the CPE Router MUST support
            ND Proxy between the WAN and LAN interface(s).  If a CE

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements        March 2011


            Router will never be deployed in an environment with these
            characteristics, then ND Proxy is not necessary.

5.4.  Routed network behavior

   CPE Router Behavior in a routed network:

   R-1:  One example of the CPE Router use in the home is shown below.
         The home has a broadband modem combined with a CPE Router, all
         in one device.  The LAN interface of the device is connected to
         another standalone CPE Router that supports a wireless access
         point.  To support such a network, this document recommends
         using prefix delegation of the prefix obtained either via IA_PD
         from WAN interface or a ULA from the LAN interface.  The
         network interface of the downstream router MAY obtain an IA_PD
         via stateful DHCPv6.  If the CPE router supports the routed
         network through a vendor specific automatic prefix delegation,
         the CPE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server or DHCPv6 relay
         agent.  Further, if an IA_PD is used, the Service Provider or
         user MUST allocate an IA_PD or ULA prefix short enough to be
         delegated and subsequently used for SLAAC.  Therefore, a prefix

5.5.  Transition Technologies Support

5.5.1.  Dual-Stack(DS)-Lite

   Even as users migrate from IPv4 to IPv6 addressing, a significant
   percentage of Internet resources and content will remain accessible
   only through IPv4.  Also, many end-user devices will only support
   IPv4.  As a consequence, Service Providers require mechanisms to
   allow customers to continue to access content and resources using
   IPv4 even after the last IPv4 allocations have been fully depleted.
   One technology that can be used for IPv4 address extension is DS-
   Lite.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements        March 2011


   DS-Lite enables a Service Provider to share IPv4 addresses among
   multiple customers by combining two well-known technologies: IP in IP
   (IPv4-in-IPv6) tunneling and Carrier Grade NAT.  More specifically,
   Dual-Stack-Lite encapsulates IPv4 traffic inside an IPv6 tunnel at
   the IPv6 CE Router and sends it to a Service Provider Address Family
   Translation Router (AFTR).  Configuration of the IPv6 CE Router to
   support IPv4 LAN traffic is outside the scope of this document.

   The IPv6 CE Router SHOULD implement DS-Lite functionality as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   WAN requirements:

   DLW-1:  To facilitate IPv4 extension over an IPv6 network, if the CE
           Router supports DS-Lite functionality, the CE Router WAN
           interface MUST implement a B4 Interface as specified in
           [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   DLW-2:  If the IPv6 CE Router implements DS-Lite functionality, the
           CE Router MUST support using a DS-Lite DHCPv6 option
           [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option] to configure the
           DS-Lite tunnel.  The IPv6 CE Router MAY use other mechanisms
           to configure DS-Lite parameters.  Such mechanisms are outside
           the scope of this document.

   DLW-3:  IPv6 CE Router MUST NOT perform IPv4 Network Address
           Translation (NAT) on IPv4 traffic encapsulated using DS-Lite.

   DLW-4:  If the IPv6 CE Router is configured with a public IPv4
           address on its WAN interface, where public IPv4 address is
           defined as any address which is not in the private IP address
           space specified in [RFC1918] and also not in the reserved IP
           address space specified in
           [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], then the IPv6 CE Router
           MUST disable the DS-Lite B4 element.

   DLW-5:  If DS-Lite is operational on the IPv6 CE Router, multicast
           data MUST NOT be sent on any DS-Lite tunnel.

5.5.2.  6rd

   The IPv6 CE Router can be used to offer IPv6 service to a LAN, even
   when the WAN access network only supports IPv4.  One technology that
   supports IPv6 service over an IPv4 network is IPv6 Rapid Deployment
   (6rd). 6rd encapsulates IPv6 traffic from the end user LAN inside
   IPv4 at the IPv6 CE Router and sends it to a Service Provider Border
   Relay (BR).  The IPv6 CE Router calculates a 6rd delegated IPv6
   prefix during 6rd configuration, and sub-delegates the 6rd delegated

   prefix to devices in the LAN.

   The IPv6 CE Router SHOULD implement 6rd functionality as specified in
   [RFC5969].

   6rd requirements:

   6RD-1:  If the IPv6 CE Router implements 6rd functionality, the CE
           Router WAN interface MUST support at least one 6rd Virtual
           Interface and 6rd CE functionality as specified in [RFC5969].

   6RD-2:  If the IPv6 CE Router implements 6rd CE functionality, it
           MUST support using the 6rd DHCPv4 Option (212) for 6rd
           configuration.  The IPv6 CE Router MAY use other mechanisms
           to configure 6rd parameters.  Such mechanisms are outside the
           scope of this document.

   6RD-3:  If 6rd is operational on the IPv6 CE Router, multicast data
           MUST NOT be sent on any 6rd tunnel.

5.5.3.  Transition Technologies Coexistence

   Run the following four in parallel to provision CPE router
   connectivity to the Service Provider:

   1.  Initiate IPv4 address acquisition.

   2.  Initiate IPv6 address acquisition as specified by
       [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router].

   3.  If 6rd is provisioned, initiate 6rd.

   4.  If DS-Lite is provisioned, initiate DS-Lite.

   The default route for IPv6 through the native physical interface
   should have preference over the 6rd tunnel interface.  The default
   route for IPv4 through the native physical interface should have
   preference over the DS-Lite tunnel interface.

5.6.  Quality Of Service

   Q-1:  The CPE router MAY support differentiated services [RFC2474].

5.7.  Unicast Data Forwarding

   The null route introduced by the WPD-6 requirement in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router] has lower precedence than other
   routes except for the default route.
