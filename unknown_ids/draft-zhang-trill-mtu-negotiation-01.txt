INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation             October 31, 2011


1. Introduction

   The base TRILL protocol includes the way how RBridges determine the
   minimum inter-RBridge link size for the whole campus (campus-wide
   Sz), for the proper operation of TRILL IS-IS. According to [RFC6325],
   RBridges need to know the campus-wide Sz before they do the link MTU
   size testing. The link MTU size testing therefore depends on the
   campus-wide Sz collection.

   [RFC6327] defines the diagram of state transitions of an adjacency.
   The "link MTU size is successfully tested (A6)" is an articulate
   transition between "2-way" state and "Report" state of an adjacency.
   It is not clear, in this draft, when an adjacency should start to
   synchronize LSP database.

   This document analyzes the possible issues caused by the definition
   that link MTU size testing depends on campus-wide Sz collection. A
   new link MTU size negotiation mechanism is provided to solve the
   above problems.

1.1. Content

   Section 2 analyzes the issues caused by the dependence on campus-wide
   Sz for link MTU size testing.

   Section 3 defines a new IS-IS MTU negotiation mechanism to update
   [RFC6325].

   Section 4 provides a method for link traffic MTU determination.

1.2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Issues of Link MTU Testing

   Link MTU size testing is defined in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC6325]. If
   the link MTU size is smaller than campus-wide value of Sz, which is
   the smallest value of Sz advertised by any RBridge in its LSP
   [RFC6325], the link is not included in the global topology. If the
   link MTU size X of an adjacency is successfully tested (X >= campus-
   wide Sz), its state will move from 2-way to Report, which is defined
   in [RFC6327]. The link MTU size testing depends on the value of
   campus-wide Sz, which can be problematic. The issues causes by this
   dependence are given in the following subsections.

                Figure 2.1: Adjacency global dependence 

   Take Figure 2.1 as an example, all the adjacencies are in report
   states. After RB4 leaves the campus, RB2 and RB3 find the campus-wide
   Sz grows. They test the MTU according to campus-wide Sz 1800. Since
   RB2 and RB3 is connected by a low-end bridge whose port MTU is 1700.
   The test will not be successful. This adjacency has to return to 2-
   way state. The state of an adjacency can be determined by another
   remote adjacency. The stability of the campus Sz can be terrible
   resulting in maintenance problems.

2.2. Concealing Wrong Configuration

   Take Figure 2.2 as an example, the Sz value of RB3 is falsely
   configured to be greater than its port MTU. The link MTU testing is
   successful because the campus-wide Sz 1600 is smaller than the two
   port MTUs of the adjacency between RB2 and RB3. The adjacency will be
   in "Report" state. However, when RB4 leaves the campus and the
   campus-wide Sz is updated to 1800, the link MTU test of link RB2-RB3
   cannot be successful.

3. TRILL IS-IS MTU Negotiation

   It is improper to use campus-wide Sz in link MTU testing and LSP
   database synchronization. In order to solved the problems depicted in
   Section 2, this draft introduces a new value "Lz" which is the
   minimum acceptable inter-RBridge link size required by RBridges on a
   specific LAN link. Lz is used in link MTU size testing and LSP
   database synchronization to replace the role of campus-wide Sz. After
   link MTU size is successfully tested, the adjacency is changed to
   "Report" state. 

3.1. Determination of Lz

   RBridges on a LAN link should exchange their local Sz through LSPs
   using the originatingLSPBufferSize, TLV #14. The smallest value of
   these Sz is Lz. Therefore, Lz is actually a "link-wide Sz". It is
   different from the campus-wide Sz which is determined by having each
   RBridge in the campus advertise its own assumption of the value of Sz
   in LSPs as defined in Section 4.3.1 of [RFC6325]. 

   The maximum size of some types of PDUs should be confined by Lz
   rather than campus-wide Sz because they are only exchanged between
   neighbors instead of the whole campus. CSNPs and PSNPs are such kind
   of PDUs. They are exchanged just on the link after a DRB is selected
   on the link.

               Figure 3.1: Link MTU has to be negotiated 

   Even all RBridges on a specific LAN link have reached consensus on
   the value of Lz, it does not mean that these RBridges can safely
   exchange PDUs between each other. Take Figure 3.1 as an example. RB1,
   RB2 and RB3 are three RBridges on the same LAN link and their Sz are
   1800, so the link-wide Sz of this LAN link is 1800. There is a bridge
   (say B1) between RB2 and RB3 whose port MTU size is 1700. If RB2
   sends PDUs formatted in the size of 1800, it will be discarded by B1.
   Therefore the link MTU size has to be tested. Only after the link MTU
   size of an adjacency is successfully tested, these CSNP and PSNP PDUs
   will be formatted no greater than the tested link MTU size and will
   be safely transmitted on this link.

3.3. Link MTU Size Testing Algorithm

   The link MTU size testing method given by the last paragraph of
   Section 4.3.2 of [RFC6325] is updated by the following Binary Search
   algorithm in which Lz is used in the testing instead of campus-wide
   Sz.

   Step 0: RB1 sends an MTU-probe padded to the size of Lz. 

   1) If RB1 successfully receives the MTU-ACK to the probe of size Lz
      from RB2, then link MTU size is set to the size of Lz and stop. 

   2) RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to the size 1470. 

      a) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ACK from RB2 after k tries
         (where k is a configurable parameter whose default is 3), RB1
         sets the "failed minimum MTU test" flag for RB2 in RB1's Hello
         and stop. 

      b) Link MTU size <-- 1470, X1 <-- 1470, X2 <-- Lz, X <-- [(X1 +
         X2)/2] (Operation "[...]" returns the fraction-rounded-up
         integer.). Repeat Step 1.

INTERNET-DRAFT              MTU Negotiation             October 31, 2011


   Step 1: RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to the size X.   

   1) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ACK from RB2 after k tries, then: 

         X2 <-- X and X <-- [(X1 + X2)/2]

   2) If RB1 receives an MTU-ACK to a probe of size X from RB2 then: 

         link MTU size <-- X, X1 <-- X and X <-- [(X1 + X2)/2]

   3) If X1 >= X2 or Step 1 has been repeated n times (where n is a
      configurable parameter whose default is 5), stop. Else go to Step
      1.

   Since the execution of the above algorithm can be resource consuming,
   it is recommended that the DRB takes the responsibility to do the
   testing. If the testing is finished and the tested link MTU size is
   smaller than the original Lz and the minimum Sz that has been
   advertised to the DRB, the DRB should send the tested link MTU size
   as its local originatingLSPBufferSize in LSP number zero (shorted as
   LSP0). This will trigger other RBridges on the link to update their
   Lz to be the size of the tested link MTU. Then CSNPs, PSNPs and LSPs
   used for synchronization can be rightly resized and successfully
   exchanged on the link.

3.4. Re-determining Campus-Wide Sz

   RBridges may join in or leave the campus from time to time. The
   campus-wide Sz can become outdated. Section 4.3.1 of [RFC6325] does
   not define when to re-determine the campus-wide Sz. The following
   suggestions are given for campus-wide Sz re-determination.

   1) When a new RB whose Sz is smaller than current campus-wide Sz
      joins in the campus, it MUST report its Sz in an LSP which will
      cause other RBridges update their campus-wide Sz. The LSPs in the
      campus will be resized to be no greater than the new campus-wide
      Sz.

   2) When an RB whose Sz is right the campus-wide Sz leaves the campus,
      and the LSPs generated by this RBridge are purged from the
      remaining campus after reaching MaxAge [ISO10589]. The campus-wide
      Sz ought to be resized as well. Frequent LSP "resizing" is harmful
      to the stability of the whole campus, so it should be dampened.
      Within the two kinds of resizing actions, only the upward resizing
      will be dampened. When an upward resizing event happens, a timer
      is set (this is a configurable parameter whose default value is
      300 seconds). Before this timer expires, all subsequent upward
      resizing will be dampened.

   3) An RBridge may generate multiple LSPs. It is recommended that each
      RBridge carries its Sz in LSP0 [ISO10589]. Otherwise, if Sz is
      absent in LSP0, the campus-wide Sz will be set to a small value
      1470 at the receiver RBridge [RFC6325]. When subsequent LSPs
      carrying Sz arrives, the campus-wide Sz will be resized again.

3.5. Relationship between Port MTU and Sz

   When port MTU size is smaller than the local Sz of an RBridge, this
   port should be explicitly disabled from the TRILL campus. On the
   other hand, when an RBridge receives an LSP with size greater than
   its local Sz or the campus-wide Sz, this LSP should be normally
   processed rather than discarded. If an LSP is larger than the MTU
   size of a port over which it is to be propagated, no attempt shall be
   made to propagate this LSP over the port and an
   LSPTooLargeToPropagate alarm shall be generated [ISO10589].

3.6. LSP Synchronization

   The DRB of a LAN link is elected as early as in the "Detect" state of
   an adjacency. When a DRB is elected, it begins to send out CSNP to
   synchronize the LSP database of the RBridges attached to this LAN
   link when the adjacency between this RBridge and the DRB moves to 2-
   way state. If a non-DRB RBridge receives this CSNP and finds that
   LSPx is not in its LSP database, it will send out PSNP to request
   LSPx from the DRB. If a non-DRB receives this CSNP and finds that
   LSPx is not in the LSP database of the DRB, it will also send out
   LSPx to the DRB. 

   DRB and non-DRB on a link should start to synchronize LSP database
   using CSNPs and PSNPs with a neighbor when the adjacency between them
   moves to the 2-way state [RBclr]. The CSNPs and PSNPs should be
   formatted in chunks of size at most Lz. Since the link MTU size has
   not been tested, Lz may be greater than the actually the link MTU
   size. In that case, an CSNP or PSNP may be discarded if its size is
   greater than the link MTU size. After the link MTU size is
   successfully tested, the adjacencies will begin to formatted these
   PDUs in the size no greater than it, therefore these LSPs will
   successfully get through. 

4. Determining Link Traffic MTU Size

   Campus-wide Sz is used to confine the size of the TRILL link state
   information messages (LSPs). This value is different from the MTU
   size that restricting the size of TRILL data frames. TRILL data frame
   forwarded by an RBridge can be greater than the campus-wide Sz or Lz.
   They are restricted by the physical links and devices.

   The algorithm defined in link MTU size testing can also be used in
   TRILL traffic MTU size testing, only that Lz used in that algorithm
   should be replaced with the port MTU of the RBridge sending MTU
   probes. The successfully tested size X can be advertised as an
   attribute of this link using MTU sub-TLV defined in section 2.4 of
   [RBisis]. An end station may collect these values by TRILL ping or
   traceroute. Path MTU is the smallest tested link MTU on this path.

5. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.

6. IANA Considerations

   No new registry is requested to be assigned by IANA.
