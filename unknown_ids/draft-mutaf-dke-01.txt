Abstract

   This document describes a verbal key exchange protocol in which a
   short fingerprint is used to represent a "one-time" public key
   fingerprint.  The one-time public key is immediately used for key
   exchange, before an attacker has time to find a public/private key
   pair that gives the same fingerprint and mount a Man-in-the-Middle
   attack.  The protocol, however, requires that both users are present
   for fingerprint verification, making it suitable for mobile users
   only.

Internet-Draft             Verbal Key Exchange             December 2007


1.  Introduction

   Public key authentication is a difficult problem since a Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI) is generally required.  The problem is less
   challenging when two mobile users wishing to establish a security
   association are both present, i.e. when they meet each other.  The
   users can verify a shared public key by comparing its "fingerprint".
   However, up to 160 bits long fingerprints are generally recommended
   today.  Such a fingerprint looks like "E582 94F2 E9A2 2748 6E8B 061B
   31CC 528F D7FA 8919" which is difficult to read and type by users.

   This document describes how an easy to exchange small fingerprint can
   be used to authenticate a "one-time" public key.  The one-time public
   key is immediately used for key exchange, before an attacker has time
   to find a public/private key pair that gives the same fingerprint and
   mount a Man-in-the-Middle attack.


2.  Protocol description

   The proposed protocol is briefly described below:


          Initiator              MitM                 Responder

                     Request RSA public key PK
         ^ ----------------------------------------------->
       T |                        PK
         v <----------------------------------------------

           <========== Fingerprint words
   human verification      representing PK ================
   of words

           -----------------{secret key}PK---------------->

   where
            PK: A one time RSA public key
            ==: The responder user tells the words representing
                the fingerprint to the initiator user through
                oral communication.
           MitM: Man in the Middle

                                 Figure 1

   The fingerprint is represented using words from a dictionary.  It is
   assumed that both hosts have the same dictionary containing N words.
   Or, the responder may return a dictionary to the initiator (TBD).

   Using a dictionary has two benefits.  First, well-known words from a
   dictionary are easier to spell and understand than a 40-bit
   hexadecimal sequence like "E58294F2E9".  Secondly, using a large
   dictionary containing N words, one can represent a large number of
   bits per word.  Each word in the dictionary will contribute log2(N)
   bits of entropy.  If the dictionary contains N=1024 words, 4 words
   such as

                               tokyo
                               pizza
                               madonna
                               mercedes

   can represent a 4*10=40 bits long fingerprint.  The initiator, having
   the same dictionary, can reduce the verification effort using
   automated word completion.

   The fingerprint is used to authenticate a "one-time" public key.  In
   T time units, MitM has to find a PK' giving the same fingerprint as
   PK, and return it to the initiator before PK. 2^40, for example, is
   large enough to assume that the attacker cannot reasonably succeed.


3.  Security considerations

   The fingerprint size can be increased either by increasing the number
   of words in the dictionary (N), or the number of read/typed words (S)
   by the users.  The entropy per word increases logarithmically with N.
   Doubling the dictionary size will add only 1 bit of entropy per word.
   The fingerprint size increases linearly with S at the cost of
   reading/typing more words and hence increasing the key exchange time.
   Since most of the human effort will be made by the verifier typing
   the words read by the responder, an implementation should consider
   user friendly techniques e.g. word completion.  Using GUI word
   completion making use of a keyboard and pointer, words can be entered
   very easily in a way that is probably acceptable to the user.

   A too large dictionary will increase the word completion complexity.
   The initiator user will either need to type more letters to reduce
   the size of a list of words, or scroll over a large list for
   searching a word in a list.  This will increase the key agreement
   time perceived by the responder user and the effort made by the
   initiator user.  On the other hand, a very small dictionary will
   increase the number of words needed to represent a fingerprint, hence
   also increase the user effort.

4.  Related work

   Other solutions have been proposed in the literature, exploiting the
   presence of both users (i.e. user contact).  For example, in "Seeing
   is Believing", cell phones equipped with a camera, authenticate each
   other using a two-dimensional barcode representation of a public key.
   The public key is verified by taking its photo displayed on the peer
   device's screen [SEEING].

   "Loud & Clear" is another solution based on a text-to-speech engine
   to read an auditorially-robust, grammatically-correct sentence
   derived from the fingerprint of a device's public key.  The text
   representing the fingerprint is heard from both devices equipped with
   speakers, and compared by the user(s).  Or, alternatively, the
   fingerprint is heard from one device, displayed by the second device,
   and compared [LOUD].

   "Pretty Good Privacy" uses a dictionary of words for reliable public
   key fingerprint transmission over a potentially noisy voice channel,
   in a clear unambiguous way.  This is apparently inspired from the
   NATO phonetic alphabet used by pilots [PGPWORDLIST].  "Diceware" also
   uses a dictionary of 6^5=7,776 unique words that are easy to spell
   and remember for creating passphrases, passwords, and other
   cryptographic variables.  Each word adds log2(7,776)=12.9 bits of
   entropy to the passphrase [DICEWARE].


5.  IANA considerations

   TBD.


6.  Acknowledgements

   Michael Richardson and Nicolas Williams suggested a name like Verbal
   Key Exchange.  Michael Richardson suggested that in IKEv2 one can
   authenticate the Diffie-Hellman exponent directly (instead of using a
   new key exchange protocol).


7.  Conclusion

   This document described a verbal key exchange protocol.
