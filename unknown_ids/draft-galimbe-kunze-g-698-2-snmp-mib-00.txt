1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP- based
   internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical
   Interfaces associated with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   systems or characterized by the Optical Transport Network (OTN) in
   accordance with the Black-Link approach defined in G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2]

   Black Link approach allows supporting an optical transmitter/receiver
   pair of one vendor to inject a DWDM channel and run it over an
   optical network composed of amplifiers, filters, add-drop
   multiplexers from a different vendor.  Whereas the standardization of
   black link for 2.5 and 10G is settled for 40G and 100G interfaces and
   Black Link extensions are still in progress.  For carrier network
   deployments, interoperability is a key requirement.  Today it is
   state-of-the-art to interconnect IP Routers from different vendors
   and WDM transport systems using short-reach, grey interfaces.
   Applying the Black Link (BL) concept, routers now get directly
   connected to each via transport interfaces which must be
   interoperable to each other.

   The G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] provides optical parameter values for
   physical layer interfaces of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
   (DWDM) systems primarily intended for metro applications which
   include optical amplifiers.  Applications are defined using optical
   interface parameters at the single-channel connection points between
   optical transmitters and the optical multiplexer, as well as between
   optical receivers and the optical demultiplexer in the DWDM system.
   This Recommendation uses a methodology which does not specify the
   details of the optical link, e.g. the maximum fibre length,
   explicitly.  The Recommendation currently includes unidirectional
   DWDM applications at 2.5 and 10 Gbit/s with 100 GHz channel frequency
   spacing and may be extended to 40 and 100 Gbit/s channels with a
   lower channel frequency spacing.

   The Building a SNMP MIB describing the optical parameters defined in
   G.698 [ITU.G698.2] allow the different vendors and operator to
   retrieve, provision and exchange information related to Optical
   Networks in a standardized way.  This ensures interworking in case of
   using optical interfaces from different vendors at the end of the
   link.  Decoupling DWDM layer from the optical layer The Optical
   Parameters and their values characterize the features and the
   performances of the Network optical components and allow a reliable
   network design in case of Multivendor Optical Networks.

   Although RFC 3591 [RFC3591] describe and define the SNMP MIB of a

   number of key optical parameters, alarms and Performance Monitoring,
   a more complete description of optical parameters and processes can
   be found in the ITU-T Recommendations.  Appendix A of this document
   provides an overview about the extensive ITU-T documentation in this
   area.  The same considerations can be applied to the RFC 4054
   [RFC4054]

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] In
   the description of OIDs the convention: Set (S) Get (G) and Trap (T)
   conventions will describe the action allowed by the paramenter.

4.  Overview

   In this document, the term OTN (Optical Transport Network) system is
   used to describe devices that are compliant with the requirements
   specified in the ITU-T Recommendations G.872 [ITU.G872], G.709
   [ITU.G709] , G.798 [ITU.G798], G.874 [ITU.G874], and G.874.1
   [ITU.G874.1] while refer to [ITU.G698.2] for the Black Link and DWDM
   parameter description.

   The optical objects will be managed using the MIB II ifTable and
   ifStackTable.  Additional tables will also be supported to monitor
   layer specific status and provide performance monitoring data.  In
   the tables, some entries are required for OTN systems only.  A
   Configuration (Config) table, Current Performance Monitoring (PM)
   table, and Interval PM table will be maintained for the OTSn, OMSn,
   OChGroup, and OCh layers on a source and sink trail termination
   basis.  These tables will be linked to the ifTable by using the
   ifIndex that is associated with that layer.

   An Alarm (Aalarm) table will be maintained for the OTSn, OMSn,
   OChGroup, and OCh layers on a source and sink trail termination
   basis.  These tables will be linked to the ifTable by using the
   ifIndex that is associated with that layer.

   Figure 1 shows a set of reference points, for the linear "black-link"
   approach, for single-channel connection (Ss and Rs) between
   transmitters (Tx) and receivers (Rx).  Here the DWDM network elements
   include an OM and an OD (which are used as a pair with the opposing
   element), one or more optical amplifiers and may also include one or
   more OADMs.

   realize an interface is an Optical Transport interface.  At present,
   this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-
   standard MIB:

   opticalChannel (195), opticalChannelGroup (219), opticalTransport
   (196).

   The definitions contained herein are based on the OTN specifications
   in ITU-T G.872 [ITU.G872], G.709 [ITU.G709], G.798 [ITU.G798], G.874
   [ITU.G874], and G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1].

4.1.  Optical Parameters Description

   The terminology used in this document describes the optical
   parameters, the states and the Alarms at the points Ss, Rs and DWDM
   depicted in fig.1.  The terms are defined in ITU-T Recommendations
   G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2].  Those definitions are made to increase the
   readability of the document.

4.1.1.  General

   Minimum channel spacing:
      This is the minimum nominal difference in frequency between two
      adjacent channels (G).

   Bit rate/line coding of optical tributary signals:
      Optical tributary signal class NRZ 2.5G or NRZ 10G nominally 2.4
      Gbit/s to nominally 10.71 Gbit/s. 40Gbit/s and 100Gbit/s are under
      definition (G, S).

   Channel Modulation Format:
      This parameter indicate what kind of modulation format is used at
      Ss (G).

   FEC Coding:
      This parameter indicate what Forward Error Correction (FEC) code
      is used at Ss and Rs (G, S).

   Wavelenght Range (see G.694.1):  [ITU.G694.1]
      This parameter indicate minimum and maximum wavelength spectrum
      (G) in a definite wavelenght Band (L, C and S).

   Wavelength Value (see G.694.1):
      This parameter indicates the wavelenght value that Ss and Rs will
      be set to work (G, S).

   Vendor Transceiver Class:
      Other than specifying all the Transceiver parameter, it might be
      convenient for the vendors to summarize a set of parameters in a
      single proprietary parameter: the Class of transceiver.  The
      Transceiver classification will be based on the Vendor Name and
      the main TX and RX parameters (i.e.  Trunk Mode, Framing, Bit
      rate, Trunk Type, Channel Band, Channel Grid, Modulation Format,
      etc.).  If this parameter is used, the MIB parameters specifying
      the Transceiver characteristics may not be significant and the
      vendor will be responsible to specify the Class contents and
      values.  The Vendor can publish the parameters of its Classes or
      declare to be compatible with published Classes.(G) Optional for
      compliance.

   single-channel application codes (see G.698.2):
      This parameter indicates the transceiver allication code at Ss and
      Rs as defined in [ITU.G698.2] Chapter 5.3 - this parameter can be
      called Optical Interface Identifier OII as per
      [draft-martinelli-wson-interface-class] (G, S).

4.1.2.  Parameters at Ss

   Maximum and minimum mean channel output power:
      The mean launched power at Ss is the average power of a pseudo-
      random data sequence coupled into the DWDM link It is defined the
      thange (Max and Min ) of the parameter (G, S)

   Minimum and maximum central frequency:
      The central frequency is the nominal single-channel frequency on
      which the digital coded information of the particular optical
      channel is modulated by use of the NRZ line code.  The central
      frequencies of all channels within an application lie on the
      frequency grid for the minimum channel spacing of the application
      given in ITU-T Rec. G.694.1.  This parameter give the Maximum and
      minimum frequency interval the channel must be modulated (G)

   Maximum spectral excursion:
      This is the maximum acceptable difference between the nominal
      central frequency of the channel and the minus 15 dB points of the
      transmitter spectrum furthest from the nominal central frequency
      measured at point Ss.  (G)

   Maximum transmitter (residual) dispersion OSNR penalty (B.3/G.959.1)
      [ITU.G959.1]
      Lowest OSNR at Ss with worst case (residual) dispersion.  Lowest
      OSNR at Ss with no dispersion (G)

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-00       July 2011


   Electrical Signal Framing:
      This is the indication of what framing (GE, Sonet/SDH, OTN) the Ss
      and Rs ports are set (G, S)

4.1.3.  Optical path from point Ss to Rs

   Maximum and minimum (residual) chromatic dispersion:
      These parameters define the maximum and minimum value of the
      optical path "end to end chromatic dispersion" that the system
      shall be able to tolerate.  (G)

   Minimum optical return loss at Ss:
      These parameter defines minimum optical return loss of the cable
      plant at the source reference point (Ss), including any connectors
      (G)

   Maximum discrete reflectance between SS and RS:
      Optical reflectance is defined to be the ratio of the reflected
      optical power present at a point, to the optical power incident to
      that point.  Control of reflections is discussed extensively in
      ITU-T Rec. G.957 (G)

   Maximum differential group delay:
      Differential group delay (DGD) is the time difference between the
      fractions of a pulse that are transmitted in the two principal
      states of polarization of an optical signal.  For distances
      greater than several kilometres, and assuming random (strong)
      polarization mode coupling, DGD in a fibre can be statistically
      modelled as having a Maxwellian distribution.  (G)

   Maximum polarisation dependent loss:
      The polarisation dependent loss (PDL) is the difference (in dB)
      between the maximum and minimum values of the channel insertion
      loss (or gain) of the black-link from point SS to RS due to a
      variation of the state of polarization (SOP) over all SOPs.  (G)

   Maximum inter-channel crosstalk:
      Inter-channel crosstalk is defined as the ratio of total power in
      all of the disturbing channels to that in the wanted channel,
      where the wanted and disturbing channels are at different
      wavelengths.  The parameter specify the isolation of a link
      conforming to the "black-link" approach such that under the worst-
      case operating conditions the inter-channel crosstalk at any
      reference point RS is less than the maximum inter-channel
      crosstalk value (G)

   Maximum interferometric crosstalk:
      This parameter places a requirement on the isolation of a link
      conforming to the "black-link" approach such that under the worst
      case operating conditions the interferometric crosstalk at any
      reference point RS is less than the maximum interferometric
      crosstalk value.  (G)

   Maximum optical path OSNR penalty:
      The optical path OSNR penalty is defined as the difference between
      the Lowest OSNR at Rs and Lowest OSNR at Ss (G)

4.1.4.  Interface at point Rs

   Maximum and minimum mean input power:
      The maximum and minimum values of the average received power at
      point Rs.  (G)

   Minimum optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR):
      The minimum optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) is the minimum
      value of the ratio of the signal power in the wanted channel to
      the highest noise power density in the range of the central
      frequency plus and minus the maximum spectral excursion (G)

   Receiver OSNR tolerance:
      The receiver OSNR tolerance is defined as the minimum value of
      OSNR at point Rs that can be tolerated while maintaining the
      maximum BER of the application.  (G)

   Minimum maximum Chromatic Disperion (CD) :
      This parameter define the CD range a Receiver (Rs) can tolerate in
      order to decode the received signal (G)

   Maximum Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) :
      This parameter define the maximum PMD value a Receiver (Rs) can
      tolerate in order to decode the received signal (G)

   Maximum differential group delay:
      Differential group delay (DGD) is the time difference between the
      fractions of a pulse that are transmitted in the two principal
      states of polarization of an optical signal.  For distances
      greater than several kilometres, and assuming random (strong)
      polarization mode coupling, DGD in a fibre can

4.2.  Use of ifTable

   This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is used for optical interfaces.  As described in
   the RFC 3591 figure 1 [RFC3591] Only the ifGeneralInformationGroup
   will be supported for the ifTable and the ifStackTable to maintain
   the relationship between the various layers.  The OTN layers are
   managed in the ifTable using IfEntries that correlate to the layers
   depicted in Figure 1.  For example, a DWDM device with an Optical
   Network Node Interface (ONNI) will have an Optical Transmission
   Section (OTS) physical layer, an Optical Multiplex Section (OMS)
   layer (transports multiple optical channels), and an Optical Channel
   (OCh) layer.  There is a one to one relationship between the OMS and
   OTS layers.  The OMS layer has fixed connectivity via the OTS and
   thus no connectivity flexibility at the OMS layer is supported.  This
   draft extend the RFC 3591 [RFC3591] as far as the OMSn and OTSn are
   concerned.  The sections 2.5 and 2.6 of RFC 3591 [RFC3591] must be
   considered as a reference for the ifStackTable use and Optical
   Network Terminology.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The managed Optical Networking interface objects are arranged into
   the following groups of tables:

   The optIfOTMn group handles the OTM information structure of an
   optical interface.

      optIfOTMnTable

   The optIfPerfMon group handles the current 15-minute and 24-hour
   interval elapsed time, as well as the number of 15-minute intervals

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-00       July 2011


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

Internet-Draft   draft-galimbe-kunze-g-698-2-snmp-mib-00       July 2011


   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
