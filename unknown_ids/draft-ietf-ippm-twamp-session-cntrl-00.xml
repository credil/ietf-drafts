      <t>The IETF has completed its work on the core specification of TWAMP -
      the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol. This memo describes a new
      feature for TWAMP, that gives the controlling host the ability to start
      and stop one or more individual test sessions using their Session
      Identifiers. The base capability of the TWAMP protocol requires all test
      sessions previously requested and accepted to start and stop at the same
      time.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF has completed its work on the core specification of TWAMP -
      the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>.
      TWAMP is an extension of the One-way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP
      <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>. The TWAMP specification gathered wide
      review as it approached completion, and the by-products were several
      recommendations for new features in TWAMP. There are a growing number
      TWAMP implementations at present, and wide-spread usage is expected.
      There are even devices that are designed to test implementations for
      protocol compliance.</t>

      <t>This memo describes a new feature for TWAMP. TWAMP (and OWAMP) start
      all previously requested and accepted test sessions at once. This
      feature allows the Control-Client to control individual test sessions on
      the basis of their Session Identifier (SID). The feature permits a short
      duration TWAMP test to start (and/or stop) during a longer test. This
      feature permits a specific diagnostic test to begin if intermediate
      results indicate that the test is warranted, for example.</t>

      <t>This feature requires a Mode bit position assignment and the
      assignment of two new TWAMP command numbers (for the augmented Start and
      Stop commands). This feature also specifies a new Stop-ACK Server
      response, to complete the symmetry of the session stopping process in
      the same way as the Start-ACK response.</t>

      <t>Implementers of this feature may also wish to implement the "Reflect
      Octets" feature, described in [draft-ietf-ippm-twamp-reflect-octets,
      work in progress]. This feature allows a Control-Client to insert a
      locally-specified request number into the Request-TW-Session command (in
      octets originally designated MBZ=Must Be Zero), and a compliant Server
      will return the request number in its reply (Accept message).</t>

      <t>This memo is intended to be an update to the TWAMP RFC.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is to describe an additional function and
      feature for TWAMP <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>. The feature needs a
      clear description so it can be discussed and (hopefully) adopted in the
      IP Performance Metrics Charter.</t>

      <t>The scope of the memo is currently limited to specifications of the
      following features:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Extension of the modes of operation through assignment of a new
          value in the Mode field to communicate feature capability and use,
          </t>

          <t>the definition of augmented Start Session and Stop Session
          commands, and </t>

          <t>the definition of related procedures for TWAMP entities. </t>
        </list>The motivation for this added feature is the ability to start
      and stop individual test sessions at will, using a single TWAMP-control
      connection.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="TWAMP Control Extensions">
      <t>TWAMP-Control protocol is a derivative of the OWAMP-Control protocol,
      and provides two-way measurement capability. TWAMP <xref
      target="RFC5357"></xref> uses the Modes Field to identify and select
      specific communication capabilities, and this field is a recognized
      extension mechanism. The following sections describe one such
      extension.</t>

      <section title="Connection Setup with Individual Session Control">
        <t>TWAMP-Control connection establishment follows the procedure
        defined in section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4656"></xref> OWAMP. The
        Individual Session Control mode requires one new bit position (and
        value) to identify the ability of the Server/Session-Reflector to
        start and stop specific sessions (according to their Session
        Identifier, or SID). This new feature requires an additional TWAMP
        mode bit assignment as follows:</t>

        <t>In the original OWAMP mode field, setting bit positions 0, 1 or 2
        indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test
        protocol inherited the same mode (see section 4 of <xref
        target="RFC4656"></xref>). In the <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-more-twamp"></xref> memo, bit position (3)
        allows a different security mode in the Test protocol and uses the
        unauthenticated test packet format.</t>

        <t>If the Server sets the new bit position (bit position Z) in the
        Server Greeting message to indicate its capabilities, then the Server
        and Session-Reflector MUST comply with the requirements of this memo
        to control sessions on an individual basis if desired.</t>

        <t>If the Control-Client intends to control sessions on an individual
        basis (according to the requirements in this memo), it MUST set the
        mode bit (Z, corresponding to the new mode) in the Setup Response
        message.</t>

        <t>IF the Control-Client has selected the Reflect Octets feature
        [draft-ietf-ippm-twamp-reflect-octets, work in progress] in
        combination with the Individual Session Control feature (after the
        Server identified its capability), AND utilizes the feature to insert
        a locally-specified request number in the Request-TW-Session command,
        THEN the Control Client MAY send more than one Request-TW-Session
        command to a given Server without waiting for the corresponding
        Accept-Session message.</t>

      <section title="Start-Sessions Command with Session Control">
        <t>Having requested one or more test sessions and received affirmative
        Accept-Session responses, a TWAMP Client MAY start the execution of
        the requested test sessions by sending a Start-Sessions message to the

        <t>The Number of sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
        this Start command applies to. The SID is as defined in OWAMP (and
        TWAMP) section 3.5 <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Server MUST respond with a Start-Ack message (which SHOULD be
        sent as quickly as possible). Start-Ack messages have the format
        defined in section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Control Client MUST NOT send a subsequent Start Sessions
        command until an outstanding message is acknowledged with a Start-Ack

      <section title="SERVWAIT Timeout Operation">
        <t>Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC5357"></xref> describes the
        operation of the optional SERVWAIT timer. In normal TWAMP operation,
        the Server suspends monitoring the SERVWAIT timer while test sessions
        are in progress. When the Individual Session Control feature is
        utilized, this suspension is extended to cover the time when ANY test
        session is in progress.</t>

        <t>Thus, the Server SHALL suspend monitoring control connection
        activity after receiving any Start-Sessions command, and after
        receiving a Stop-Sessions command for all corresponding SIDs (and no
        test sessions are in-progress), OR when REFWAIT expires on ALL test
        sessions initiated by a TWAMP-Control connection, then the SERVWAIT
        monitoring SHALL resume (as though a Stop-Sessions command had been
        received). An implementation which supports the SERVWAIT timeout
        option SHOULD also implement the REFWAIT timeout option.</t>

      Session-Reflector transmits test packets to the Session-Sender in
      response to each test packet it receives. TWAMP <xref
      target="RFC5357"></xref> defines two different test packet formats, one
      for packets transmitted by the Session-Sender and one for packets
      transmitted by the Session-Reflector. As with OWAMP-Test protocol there
      are three security modes: unauthenticated, authenticated, and encrypted.
      Unauthenticated mode has one test packet format, while authenticated and
      encrypted modes use another (common) format.</t>

      <section title="Sender Behavior">
        <t>The individual session control feature requires that the sender
        MUST manage test sessions according to their SID. Otherwise, the
        sender behavior is as describe in section 4.1 of <xref
        target="RFC5357"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reflector Behavior">
        <t>The TWAMP Reflector follows the procedures and guidelines in
        section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>, with the following
        additional functions required by this feature:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The Session-Reflector MUST manage all test sessions accepted
            according to their SID.</t>

            <t>Packets for a specific session/SID not received within the
            Timeout (following the Stop-Session command) MUST be ignored by
            the Session-Reflector. The Session-Reflector MUST NOT generate a
            test packet to the Session-Sender for packets that are

      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of

      in<xref target="RFC4656"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This memo requests assignment of one mode bit position/value to the
      IANA registry for the TWAMP Mode field, and describes behavior when the
      new mode is used. This field is a recognized extension mechanism for
      TWAMP.</t>

      <t>This memo also requests assignment of two command numbers in the
      TWAMP-Control Command Number registry, and describes the use of the new
      commands. The command number field is a recognized extension mechanism
      for TWAMP.</t>

      <section title="Registry Specification">
        <t>IANA has created a TWAMP-Modes registry (as requested in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-more-twamp"></xref>). TWAMP-Modes are specified
        in TWAMP Server Greeting messages and Set-up Response messages, as
        described in section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>, consistent
        with section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>, and extended by
        this memo. Modes are indicated by setting bits in the 32-bit Modes
        field. Thus, this registry can contain a total of 32 possible
        values.</t>

        <t>IANA has also created a TWAMP-Control Command Number registry.
        TWAMP-Control commands are specified by the first octet in
        TWAMP-Control messages as specified in section 3.5 of <xref
        target="RFC5357"></xref>, and augmented by this memo. This registry
        may contain sixteen possible values.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Registry Management">
        <t>Because the TWAMP-Control Command Number registry can contain only
        sixteen values, TWAMP-Modes can only contain thirty-two values, and
        because TWAMP is an IETF protocol, these registries must be updated
        only by "IETF Consensus" as specified in <xref
        target="RFC2434"></xref>(an RFC documenting registry use that is
        approved by the IESG). Management of these registries is described in
        section 8.2 of <xref target="RFC5357"></xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-more-twamp"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This memo proposes assignment of values 7 and 8.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Experimental Numbers">
        <t>One experimental value has been assigned in the TWAMP-Control
        Command Number registry.</t>

        <t>No additional experimental values are assigned in the TWAMP-Modes
        registry.</t>
