Internet-Draft              Extensions to PCP                   May 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document extends the base PCP protocol [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] with
   various PCP Options.

   Some of these options may be defined as new PCP OpCodes.

   The main goal of this document is to kick-off discussions on the need
   to define some useful PCP options which are not part of base PCP.


2.  DESCRIPTION

   This option (Code TBA, Figure 1) MAY be included in a PCP MAPx
   request to include a description associated with a requested mapping.
   This option is optional to be supported by PCP Servers and PCP
   Clients.  The maximum length SHOULD be a configurable option in the
   PCP Server.  If a PCP Client includes a Description PCP option with a
   length exceeding the maximum length supported by the PCP Server, only
   the portion of the Description field fitting that maximum length is
   stored by the PCP Server.

   This option can be used by a user to indicate a description
   associated with a given mapping such as "My mapping for my FTP
   server" or "My remote access to my CP router", etc.  In addition, in
   the some deployment scenarios, this field can be used for
   troubleshooting purposes and can be used to convey values as the ones
   listed hereafter:

   o  "This is the mapping for my specific IPsec implementation"

   o  "This is the mapping for subscriber bob@example.com"

   o  "This is the mapping for special subscriber
      adsl-line-1234@example.com"

   o  "This is the mapping that failed before due to XYZ"

   Issues related to the usage of this field for troubleshooting or for
   any further usage are out of scope of this document.

        This Option:

            Name: Description Option (DESCRIPTION)

            Number: TBA (IANA)

            Purpose: Used to associate a text description with a mapping

            is valid for OpCodes: MAP4, MAP6

3.  DSCP_POLICY

   In some scenarios, the DSCP marking in the internal interface (i.e.,
   customer-facing interface) and the external one (i.e., Internet-
   facing interface) of the PCP-controlled device may be distinct.  A
   Service Provider MAY allow its customers to configure their DSCP
   marking policies in an upstream device.  Distinct DSCP marking
   policies can be implemented in the internal and external sides of the
   PCP-controlled device.  A PCP Client MAY issue a PCP MAPx request
   indicating its internal DS code point and the external DSCP value.
   Instructed forwarding policies are applied only for packets marked
   with a given DSCP value.

   A Service Provider may not support DSCP re-marking feature and adopt
   a transparent scheme to QoS policy enforcement, that is, not
   controllable by subscribers.  Generic QoS enforcement policies can be
   enforced for all customers: such as leave DSCP field values
   unchanged.

   with regards to port forwarding operations.  Several Capability
   options MAY be conveyed in the same PCP response message if several
   functions are co-located in the same PCP-controlled device (e.g.,
   NAT44 and NAT64, NAT44 and ports set assignment capability, etc.).

   This option, when received from a PCP Server, is used by a PCP Client
   to constraint the content of its requests and therefore avoid errors.


        This Option:

           Name: PCP Capabilities Option (CAPABILITY)

5.  PERCEIVED_ADDRESS

   This option (Code TBA, Figure 4) is used by a PCP Server to indicate
   in a PCP Response the perceived IPv6/IPv4 address and port of PCP
   messages received from a PCP Client.  A PCP Client uses this
   information to detect whether a NAT is present in the path to reach
   its PCP Server.

   A PCP Client MAY include this option to learn the IP address and port
   as perceived by the PCP Server.  When this option is received by the
   PCP Server, it uses the source IP address and port of the received
   PCP request to set the Perceived Port and Perceived IP Address.

      Perceived Port: The source port number of a PCP request as seen
         by the PCP Server.
      Address Family: The Address Family of the perceived IP address.
      Perceived IPv4/IPv6 Address: If the Address Family is IPv4,
         an IPv4 address followed by 96 zero bits. If the Address Family
         is IPv6, an IPv6 address. This field includes the source IP
         address of a PCP request as seen by the PCP Server.

   An example of the use of this option is illustrated in the following
   figure where there is a NAT in the path between the PCP Client and
   the PCP Server.

   An example of instructing mappings in the PCP Server is as follows:

   o  NAT1 is detected in the path between the PCP Client and the PCP
      Server owing to the use of the PERCEIVED_ADDR Option;

   o  After learning about that NAT, the PCP Client uses UPnP IGD (or
      NAT-PMP) to interact with NAT1 and open the necessary port on NAT1
      (e.g., IP address= IPx, port=X);

   o  The PCP Client then sends PCP message to the PCP Server,
      indicating IPx and X as the internal IP address and port.  The PCP
      Server opens pinhole towards IPx and X.


6.  SCOPE

   The Scope Option (Code TBA, Figure 5) is used by a PCP Client to
   indicate to the PCP Server the scope of the flows that will use a
   given mapping.  This object is meant to be used in the context of
   cascaded PCP Servers/NAT levels.  Two values are defined:

                               0x00 Internet
                               0x01 Internal

   When 0x00 value is used, the PCP Proxy MUST propagate the mapping
   request to its upstream PCP Server.  When 0x01 value is used, the
   mapping is to be instantiated only in the first PCP-controlled
   device; no mapping is instantiated in the upstream PCP-controlled
   device.

   When no Scope Option is included in a PCP message, this is equivalent
   to including a Scope Option with a scope value of "Internet".

7.  REPORT

   The Report PCP Option (Code TBA, Figure 6) is used by a PCP Client to
   report a set of useful information to the PCP Server.  Several Report
   Options with distinct Report Sub-Code values MAY be conveyed in the
   same PCP message.  Only report data associated with the PCP Server to
   which this option is sent MUST be included in a Report Option.

   This option can be used for troubleshooting or diagnose purposes.

8.  CLIENT_IDENTIFIER

   PCP CLIENT_ID (Code TBA, Figure 7) is a token randomly [RFC4086]
   generated by the PCP Client.  Only one CLIENT_ID Option MUST be
   present in a PCP message.  The PCP Client and PCP Server MUST store
   the value included in this Option in a PCP MAPx request.

   o  The CLIENT_ID MUST be generated by the PCP Client and not the PCP
      Server;

   o  Upon change of the IP address of the PCP Client (or a third party
      on behalf of which a mapping has been created), the CLIENT_ID is
      used to update related mappings (e.g., PCP MAP delete request and
      PCP MAP create request);

   o  The same CLIENT_ID MUST be used for all requested mappings, unless
      a new CLIENT_ID is generated by the PCP Client (e.g., reboot, OS
      crash, etc.);

   o  The CLIENT_ID is stored by the PCP Server for all mappings
      (persistent storage);

   The length of the CLIENT_ID is encoded in the Length field in bytes.
   The length of the CLIENT_ID MUST be at least 4 bytes and MUST NOT
   exceed 16 bytes.

   The RECOMMENDED value is 16 bytes so as to have a robust random
   CLIENT_ID.  If a CLIENT_ID longer than 16 bytes or shorter than 4
   bytes is received, the PCP Server MUST issue a PCP Error message with
   an error cause equal to "Invalid Client-ID".

   For sanity checks, a PCP Server maintains the same CLIENT_ID value
   (which is used in the latest PCP request) for a given PCP Client for
   all mappings associated with the same internal IP address belonging
   to the same subscriber.  Indeed, the PCP Server maintains an
   additional identifier denoted as subscriber-Id.  A subscriber-is can
   be an IP address, IPv6 prefix or a subscriber identifier configured
   locally.


9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] must be
   considered.  The use of CLIENT_ID option allows to soften issues
   related to stale mappings.


10.  IANA Considerations

   The following PCP Option Code are to be allocated:

      DESCRIPTION

      DSCP_POLICY

      CAPABILITY

      PERCEIVED_ADDRESS
