        <t>An IP/ICMP translator has two possible modes of operation:
        stateless and stateful
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework"></xref>.


        In both cases, we assume that a system (a node or an application) that
        has an IPv4 address but not an IPv6 address is communicating with a
        system that has an IPv6 address but no IPv4 address, or that the two
        systems do not have contiguous routing connectivity
        and hence are forced to have their communications translated.</t>

        <t>In the stateless mode, a specific IPv6 address range will represent IPv4 systems (IPv4-converted addresses), 
	 and the IPv6 systems have addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) that can be algorithmically 
        mapped to a subset of the service provider's IPv4 addresses. 
	 Note that
        IPv4-translatable addresses  is a subset of IPv4-converted addresses.

	 In general, there is no need to concern
        oneself with translation tables, as the IPv4 and
        IPv6 counterparts are algorithmically related.
	</t>

        <t>In the stateful mode, a specific IPv6 address range will represent IPv4 systems (IPv4-converted addresses), 
	 but the IPv6 systems may use any IPv6
	addresses <xref target="RFC4291"></xref> except in that range. 
	 In this case, a translation table is required to bind the IPv6 systems' addresses to the IPv4 addresses maintained in the translator.

<section title="Path MTU Discovery and Fragmentation">
<t>
Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, which are 20+ octets and 40
octets respectively, handling the maximum packet size is critical for the operation 
of the IPv4/IPv6 translator. There are three mechanisms to handle this issue: 
path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and transport-layer negotiation such as 
the TCP MSS option
<xref target="RFC0879"></xref>.

Note that the translator MUST behave as a router, i.e. 
the translator MUST send a "Packet Too Big" error message or fragment the packet when the packet size exceeds 
the MTU of the next hop interface. 
</t>

<t>
"Don't Fragment", ICMP "Packet Too Big", and packet fragmentation are discussed
in sections 3 and 4 of this document.  

The reassembling of fragmented packets   in the stateful translator is discussed in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful"/>,
since it requires state maintenance in the translator.

<t>
   When an IP/ICMP translator receives an IPv4 datagram addressed to a
   destination towards the IPv6 domain, it translates the IPv4 header of
   that packet into an IPv6 header.  The original IPv4 header on the
   packet is removed and replaced by an IPv6 header and the transport
   checksum updated as needed, if that transport is supported by the
   translator.  The data portion of the packet is left
   unchanged.  The IP/ICMP translator then forwards the packet based on
   the IPv6 destination address.

      <t>
   Path MTU discovery is mandatory in IPv6 but it is optional in IPv4.
IPv6 routers never fragment a packet - only the sender can do
fragmentation.

     </t>

      <t>When an IPv4 node performs path MTU discovery (by setting the Don't Fragment (DF) bit
      in the header), path MTU discovery can operate end-to-end, i.e., across
      the translator. In this case either IPv4 or IPv6 routers (including the translator) might send back
      ICMP "Packet Too Big" messages to the sender. When the IPv6 routers send
      these ICMPv6 errors they will pass through a translator that will
      translate the ICMPv6 error to a form that the IPv4 sender can understand.
      As a result, an IPv6 fragment header is only included if the IPv4 packet
      is already fragmented.</t>

      <t>However, when the IPv4 sender does not set the Don't Fragment (DF) bit, the
      translator MUST ensure that the packet does not exceed the path MTU on
      the IPv6 side. This is done by fragmenting the IPv4 packet so that it
      fits in 1280-byte IPv6 packets, since that is the
      minimum IPv6 MTU. Also, when the IPv4 sender does not set the DF bit 
      the translator MUST always include an IPv6 fragment
      header to indicate that the sender allows fragmentation. 
	</t>

      <t>The rules in section 3.1 ensure that when packets are fragmented, either by
      the sender or by IPv4 routers, the low-order 16 bits of the fragment
      identification are carried end-to-end, ensuring that packets are correctly
      reassembled. In addition, the rules in section 3.1 use the presence of an IPv6 fragment
      header to indicate that the sender might not be using path MTU discovery 
      (i.e., the packet should not have the DF flag set should it later be
      translated back to IPv4).</t>

      <t>Other than the special rules for handling fragments and path MTU
      discovery, the actual translation of the packet header consists of a
      simple translation as defined below. Note that ICMPv4 packets require special
      handling in order to translate the content of ICMPv4 error messages and
      also to add the ICMPv6 pseudo-header checksum.</t>

<t>
   The translator SHOULD make sure that the packets belonging to the 
   same flow leave the translator in the same order in which they 
   arrived.
</t>

      <section anchor="section3.1"
               title="Translating IPv4 Headers into IPv6 Headers">

        <t>
        If the DF flag is not set and the IPv4 packet will result in an IPv6
        packet larger than 1280 bytes, the packet MUST be fragmented so the
        resulting IPv6 packet (with Fragment header added to each fragment)
        will be less than or equal to 1280 bytes. For example, if the packet
        is fragmented prior to the translation, the IPv4 packets must be
        fragmented so that their length, excluding the IPv4 header, is at
        most 1232 bytes (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the
        Fragment header).  The resulting fragments are then translated
        independently using the logic described below.
       </t>


<t>
If the DF bit is set and the MTU of the next-hop interface is less than the
total length value of the IPv4 packet plus 20, the translator MUST send an ICMPv4 "Fragmentation Needed" error message
to the IPv4 source address. 
</t>
        <t>If the DF bit is set and the packet is not a fragment (i.e., the MF
        flag is not set and the Fragment Offset is equal to zero) then the translator SHOULD NOT 
        add a Fragment header to the resulting packet. The IPv6 header fields are set
        as follows: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Version:">6</t>

            <t hangText="Traffic Class:">By default, copied from IP Type Of
            Service (TOS) octet. According to <xref target="RFC2474"></xref> the

            some IPv4 environments these fields might be used with the old
            semantics of "Type Of Service and Precedence". 


An implementation of a translator SHOULD support an
administratively-configurable option to ignore the IPv4 TOS and always
set the IPv6 traffic class (TC) to zero.

		In addition,
            if the translator is at an administrative boundary, the filtering
            and update considerations of <xref target="RFC2475"></xref> may be

            the IPv6 Hop Limit (after the translation). As part of
            decrementing the TTL or Hop Limit the translator (as any router)

If the received ICMPv4 packet contains an ICMPv4 Extension

the translation of the ICMPv4 packet will cause the ICMPv6 packet to change length. 
When this occurs, the ICMPv6 Extension length attribute MUST be adjusted accordingly 
(e.g., longer due to the translation from IPv4 to IPv6). 
If the ICMPv4 Extension exceeds the maximum size of an ICMPv6 message on the outgoing 
interface, the ICMPv4 extension SHOULD be simply truncated.

        checksum as part of translating the packet. 

   Other transport protocols (e.g., DCCP) are OPTIONAL

   translators MUST forward all transport protocols as described in
   the "Next Header" step of Section 3.1.

   If the IP/ICMP translator also provides normal forwarding function, and the destination IPv4 address is reachable by a
   more specific route without translation, the translator MUST forward it
   without translating it.  Otherwise, when an IP/ICMP translator
   receives an IPv4 datagram addressed to an IPv4 destination representing a host in the IPv6
   domain, the packet MUST be translated to IPv6.

      <t>There are some differences between IPv6 and IPv4 in the area of
      fragmentation and the minimum link MTU that affect the translation. An
      IPv6 link has to have an MTU of 1280 bytes or greater. The corresponding
      limit for IPv4 is 68 bytes. 


   Path MTU Discovery across a translator relies on ICMP 
   Packet Too Big messages being received and processed by IPv6
   hosts, including an ICMP Packet Too Big that indicates the MTU
   is less than the IPv6 minimum MTU.  This requirement is 
   described in Section 5 of 
<xref target="RFC2460"></xref>
(for IPv6's 1280 octet 
   minimum MTU) and Section 5 of 
<xref target="RFC1883"></xref>
(for IPv6's previous
   576 octet minimum MTU).

</t>

<t>
   In an environment where an ICMPv4 Packet Too Big message is
   translated to an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big messages, and the ICMPv6
   Packet Too Big message is successfully delivered to and correctly
   processed by the IPv6 hosts (e.g., a network owned/operated by 
   the same entity that owns/operates the translator), the translator 
   can rely on IPv6 hosts sending subsequent packets to the same
   IPv6 destination with IPv6 fragment headers.  In such an 
   environment, when the translator receives an IPv6 packet with a
   fragmentation header, the translator SHOULD generate the IPv4
   packet with a cleared Don't Fragment bit, and with its 
   identification value from the IPv6 fragment header, for 
   all of the IPv6 fragments (MF=0 or MF=1).

</t>

<t>
In an environment where an ICMPv4 Packet Too Big message
are filtered (by a network firewall or 
   by the host itself) or not correctly processed by the IPv6 hosts, 
   the IPv6 host will never generate an IPv6 packet with the IPv6 
   fragment header.  In such an environment, the translator SHOULD 
   set the IPv4 Don't Fragment bit.  While setting the Don't Fragment 
   bit may create PMTUD black holes 
<xref target="RFC2923"></xref>
if there are IPv4 links
   smaller than 1260 octets, this is considered safer than 
   causing IPv4 reassembly errors 
<xref target="RFC4963"></xref>.
</t>

      <t>Other than the special rules for handling fragments and path MTU
      discovery, the actual translation of the packet header consists of a
      simple translation as defined below. Note that ICMPv6 packets require special
      handling in order to translate the contents of ICMPv6 error messages and
      also to remove the ICMPv6 pseudo-header checksum.</t>

	<t>
	   The translator SHOULD make sure that the packets belonging to the 
   	same flow leave the translator in the same order in which they 
   	arrived.

If the received ICMPv6 packet contains an ICMPv6 Extension 
<xref target="RFC4884"></xref>,
the translation of the ICMPv6 packet will cause the ICMPv4 packet 
to change length. When this occurs, the ICMPv6 Extension length 
attribute MUST be adjusted accordingly (e.g., shorter due to the 
translation from IPv6 to IPv4). 
For extensions not defined in 
<xref target="RFC4884"></xref>,
the translator passes the extensions as opaque bit strings and  
those containing IPv6 address literals will not have those 
addresses translated to IPv4 address literals; this may
cause problems with processing of those ICMP extensions.

        message formats as detailed above. The ICMP error
        messages containing the packet in error MUST

   The translation of the inner IP header can be done by invoking 
the function that translated the outer IP headers. 
This process MUST stop at first embedded header and drop the packet 
if it contains more.


   Note that the IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header may not
   be IPv4-translatable addresses and there will be no corresponding
   IPv4 addresses.  
   In this case, the translator can do stateful translation.
   A mechanism by which the translator can instead do 
   stateless translation is left for future work.

<section title="Special Considerations for ICMPv6 Packet Too Big">
<t>
 Two recent studies analyzed the behavior of IPv6-capable web
   servers on the Internet and found that approximately 95% responded
   as expected to an IPv6 Packet Too Big that indicated MTU=1280, but
   only 43% responded as expected to an IPv6 Packet Too Big that
   indicated an MTU < 1280.  It is believed firewalls violating Section
   4.3.1 of <xref target="RFC4890"></xref>
    are at fault.  These failures will both cause 
   Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) black holes 
   <xref target="RFC2923"></xref>.
   Unfortunately the 
   translator cannot improve the failure rate of the first case (MTU = 1280), 
   but the translator can improve the failure rate of the second case 
   (MTU < 1280).  There are two approaches to resolving the problem with
   sending ICMPv6 messages indicating an MTU < 1280.  It SHOULD 
   be possible to configure a translator for either of the two 
   approaches.
</t>

<t>
  The first approach is to constrain the deployment of the IPv6/IPv4
   translator by observing that four of the scenarios intended for
   stateless IPv6/IPv4 translators do not have IPv6 hosts on the
   Internet (Scenarios 1, 2, 5 and 6 described in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework"/>,
	which refer to "An IPv6
   network"). In these scenarios IPv6 hosts, IPv6 host-based
   firewalls, and IPv6 network firewalls can be administered in
   compliance with Section 4.3.1 of 
   <xref target="RFC4890"></xref>
   and therefore avoid the
   problem witnessed with IPv6 hosts on the Internet.
</t>

<t>
   The second approach is necessary if the translator has IPv6 hosts,
   IPv6 host-based firewalls, or IPv6 network firewalls that do not
   (or cannot) comply with Section 5 of 
   <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>
   -- such as IPv6
   hosts on the Internet. This approach requires the translator to
   do the following:

<list style="numbers">
<t>
    	 in the IPv4 to IPv6 direction:  if the MTU value of
        ICMPv4 Packet Too Big messages is less than 1280, change it
        to 1280.  This is intended to cause the IPv6 host and IPv6
        firewall to process the ICMP PTB message and generate 
        subsequent packets to this destination with an IPv6 
        fragmentation header.

        <vspace blankLines="1" /> 
        Note:  Based on recent studies, this is effective for 
        95% of IPv6 hosts on the Internet.
	 <vspace blankLines="1" /> 
</t>
<t>
in the IPv6 to IPv4 direction: 
<list style="letters">
<t>
           if there is a Fragment header in the IPv6 packet,
           the last 16 bits of its value MUST be used for the 
           IPv4 identification value.
</t>
<t>
	    if there is no Fragment header in the IPv6 packet:
<list style="letters">
<t>
if the packet is less than or equal to 1280 bytes:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
the translator SHOULD set DF to 0 and generate 
                an IPv4 identification value.
</t>
<t>
To avoid the problems described in [RFC4963], it 
                is RECOMMENDED the translator maintain 3-tuple 
                state for generating the IPv4 identification value.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
if the packet is greater than 1280 bytes, the 
translator SHOULD set the IPv4 DF bit to 1.

      <t>Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
      correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are required,
      or if those assignments or registries are created during the RFC
      publication process. From the author's perspective, it may therefore be
      removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's discretion.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The use of stateless IP/ICMP translators does not introduce any new
      security issues beyond the security issues that are already present in
      the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols and in the routing protocols that are used
      to make the packets reach the translator.</t>

	<t>
There are potential issues that might arise by deriving an IPv4 address from 
an IPv6 address - particularly addresses like broadcast or loopback addresses 
and the non IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses, etc. The 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-address-format"/> 
addresses these issues.
	</t>

 <!--     <t>As the Authentication Header <xref target="RFC4302"></xref> is
      specified to include the IPv4 Identification field and the translating
      function is not able to always preserve the Identification field, it
      is not possible for an IPv6 endpoint to verify the AH on received packets
      that have been translated from IPv4 packets. Thus AH does not work
      through a translator.</t>

      <t>Packets with ESP can be translated since ESP does not depend on
      header fields prior to the ESP header. Note that ESP transport mode is
      easier to handle than ESP tunnel mode; in order to use ESP tunnel mode,
      the IPv6 node MUST be able to generate an inner IPv4 header when
      transmitting packets and remove such an IPv4 header when receiving
      packets.</t> -->

<t>
   As with network address translation of IPv4 to IPv4, the IPsec
   Authentication Header 
   <xref target="RFC4302"></xref>
   cannot be used across an IPv6
   to IPv4 translator.
</t>

<t>
   As with network address translation of IPv4 to IPv4, packets with 
   tunnel mode ESP can be translated since tunnel mode ESP does not 
   depend on header fields prior to the ESP header.  Similarly,
   transport mode ESP will fail with IPv6 to IPv4 translation 
   unless checksum neutral addresses are used.  In both cases, 
   the IPsec ESP endpoints will normally detect the presence of
   the translator and encapsulate ESP in UDP packets 
   <xref target="RFC3948"></xref>.

<t>
A translator (XLAT) connects the IPv6 network to the IPv4 network. 
This XLAT uses the Network Specific Prefix (NSP) 2001:db8:100::/40 
defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-address-format"/> 
to represent IPv4 addresses 
in the IPv6 address space (IPv4-converted addresses) and to represent 
IPv6 addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) in the IPv4 address space. 
In this example, 192.0.2.0/24 is the IPv4 block of the corresponding IPv4-translatable 
addresses.
</t>

<t>
Based on the address mapping rule, the IPv6 node H6 has an 
IPv4-translatable IPv6 address 2001:db8:1c0:2:21:: 
(address mapping from 192.0.2.33).  The IPv4 node H4 has 
IPv4 address 198.51.100.2.
</t>

<t>
The IPv6 routing is configured in such a way that the 
IPv6 packets addressed to a destination address in 
2001:db8:100::/40 are routed to the IPv6 interface of the XLAT. 
</t>

<t>
The IPv4 routing is configured in such a way that the 
IPv4 packets addressed to a destination address in 
192.0.2.0/24 are routed to the IPv4 interface of the XLAT.
