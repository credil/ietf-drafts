Abstract

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private
   Network (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their
   sites are connected via a Local Area Network (LAN). It is often
   required for the Service Provider (SP) to give the customer redundant
   connectivity to some sites, often called "multi-homing". This memo
   shows how BGP-based multi-homing can be offered in the context of LDP
   and BGP VPLS solutions.

1. Introduction

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private
   Network (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their
   sites are connected via a Local Area Network (LAN). It is often
   required for a Service Provider (SP) to give the customer redundant
   connectivity to one or more sites, often called "multi-homing".
   [RFC4761] explains how VPLS can be offered using BGP for auto-
   discovery and signaling; section 3.5 of that document describes how
   multi-homing can be achieved in this context. [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-
   signaling] explains how VPLS can be offered using BGP for auto-
   discovery (BGP-AD) and [RFC4762] explains how VPLS can be offered
   using LDP for signaling. This document provides a BGP-based multi-
   homing solution applicable to both BGP and LDP VPLS technologies.
   Note that BGP MH can be used for LDP VPLS without the use of the BGP-
   AD solution.

   Section 2 lays out some of the scenarios for multi-homing, other ways
   that this can be achieved, and some of the expectations of BGP-based
   multi-homing. Section 3 defines the components of BGP-based multi-

   homing, and the procedures required to achieve this. Section 7 may
   someday discuss security considerations.

1.1. General Terminology

   Some general terminology is defined here; most is from [RFC4761],
   [RFC4762] or [RFC4364]. Terminology specific to this memo is
   introduced as needed in later sections.

   A "Customer Edge" (CE) device, typically located on customer
   premises, connects to a "Provider Edge" (PE) device, which is owned
   and operated by the SP. A "Provider" (P) device is also owned and
   operated by the SP, but has no direct customer connections. A "VPLS
   Edge" (VE) device is a PE that offers VPLS services.

   A VPLS domain represents a bridging domain per customer. A Route
   Target community as described in [RFC4360] is typically used to
   identify all the PE routers participating in a particular VPLS
   domain. A VPLS site is a grouping of ports on a PE that belong to the
   same VPLS domain. A Multi-homed (MH) site is uniquely identified by a
   MH site ID (MH-ID). Sites are referred to as local or remote
   depending on whether they are configured on the PE router in context
   or on one of the remote PE routers (network peers).

1.2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Background

   This section describes various scenarios where multi-homing may be
   required, and the implications thereof. It also describes some of the
   singular properties of VPLS multi-homing, and what that means from
   both an operational point of view and an implementation point of
   view. There are other approaches for providing multi-homing such as
   Spanning Tree Protocol, and this document specifies use of BGP for
   multi-homing. Comprehensive comparison among the approaches is
   outside the scope of this document.

2.1. Scenarios

The most basic scenario is shown in Figure 1.

   CE1 is a VPLS CE that is dual-homed to both PE1 and PE2 for redundant
   connectivity.

2.2. VPLS Multi-homing Considerations

   The first (perhaps obvious) fact about a multi-homed VPLS CE, such as
   CE1 in Figure 1 is that if CE1 is an Ethernet switch or bridge, a
   loop has been created in the customer VPLS. This is a dangerous
   situation for an Ethernet network, and the loop must be broken. Even



Kothari, et al.         Expires January 12, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      BGP based Multi-homing in VPLS            July 2010


   if CE1 is a router, it will get duplicates every time a packet is
   flooded, which is clearly undesirable.

   The next is that (unlike the case of IP-based multi-homing) only one
   of PE1 and PE2 can be actively sending traffic, either towards CE1 or
   into the SP cloud. That is to say, load balancing techniques will not
   work. All other PEs MUST choose the same designated forwarder for a
   multi-homed site. Call the PE that is chosen to send traffic to/from
   CE1 the "designated forwarder".

   In Figure 2, CE1 and CE4 must be dealt with independently, since CE1
   is dual-homed, but CE4 is not.

3. Multi-homing Operation

   This section describes procedures for electing a designated forwarder
   among the set of PEs that are multi-homed to a customer site. The
   procedures described in this section are applicable to BGP based
   VPLS, LDP based VPLS with BGP-AD or a VPLS that contains a mix of
   both BGP and LDP signaled PWs.

3.1. Provisioning Model

   Figure 1 shows a customer site, CE1, multi-homed to two VPLS PEs, PE1
   and PE2. In order for all VPLS PEs within the same VPLS domain to
   elect one of the multi-homed PEs as the designated forwarder, an
   indicator that the PEs are multi-homed to the same customer site is
   required. This is achieved by assigning the same multi-homed site ID
   (MH-ID) on PE1 and PE2 for CE1. When remote VPLS PEs receive NLRI
   advertisement from PE1 and PE2 for CE1, the two NLRI advertisements
   for CE1 are identified as candidates for designated forwarder
   selection due to the same MH-ID. Thus, same MH-ID SHOULD be assigned
   on all VPLS PEs that are multi-homed to the same customer site. Note
   that a MH-ID=0 is invalid and a PE should discard such an
   advertisement.


3.2. Multi-homing NLRI

   Section 3.2.2 in [RFC4761] describes the encoding of the BGP VPLS
   NLRI. This NLRI contains fields VE-ID, VE block offset, VE block size
   and label base. For multi-homing operation, the same NLRI is used for
   identifying the multi-homed customers sites. The VE-ID field in the
   NLRI is set to MH-ID; the VE block offset, VE block size and label
   base are set to zero. Thus, the NLRI contains 2 octets indicating the

   length, 8 octets for Route Distinguisher, 2 octets for MH-ID and 7
   octets with value zero.

   Figure 2 shows two customer sites, CE1 and CE4, connected to PE1 with
   CE1 multi-homed to PE1 and PE2. CE4 does not require special
   addressing, being associated with the base VPLS instance identified
   by the VSI-ID for LDP VPLS and VE-ID for BGP VPLS. However, CE1 which
   is multi-homed to PE1 and PE2 requires configuration of MH-ID and
   both PE1 and PE2 MUST be provisioned with the same MH-ID for CE1. It
   is valid to have non-zero VE block offset, VE block size and label
   base in the VPLS NLRI for a multi-homed site. However, multi-homing
   operations in such a case are outside the scope of this document.

3.3. Designated Forwarder Election

   BGP-based multi-homing for VPLS relies on BGP DF election and VPLS DF
   election. The net result of doing both BGP and VPLS DF election is
   that of electing a single designated forwarder (DF) among the set of
   PEs to which a customer site is multi-homed. All the PEs that are
   elected as non-designated forwarders MUST keep their attachment
   circuit to the multi-homed CE in blocked status (no forwarding).

   These election algorithms operate on VPLS advertisements, which
   include both the NLRI and attached BGP attributes. In order to
   simplify the explanation of these algorithms, we will use a number of
   variables derived from fields in the VPLS advertisement. These
   variables are: RD, MH-ID, VBO, DOM, ACS, PREF and PE-ID. The notation
   ADV -> <RD, MH-ID, VBO, DOM, ACS, PREF, PE-ID> means that from a
   received VPLS advertisement ADV, the respective variables were
   derived. The following sections describe two attributes needed for DF
   election, then describe the variables and how they are derived from
   fields in VPLS advertisement ADV, and finally describe how DF
   election is done.

3.3.1. Attributes

   The procedures below refer to two attributes: the Route Origin
   community (see Section 4.1) and the L2-info community (see Section
   4.2.1). These attributes are required for inter-AS operation; for
   generality, the procedures below show how they are to be used. The
   procedures also say how to handle the case that either or both are
   not present.

Internet-Draft      BGP based Multi-homing in VPLS            July 2010


3.3.2. Variables Used

3.3.2.1. RD

   RD is simply set to the Route Distinguisher field in the NLRI part of
   ADV.

3.3.2.2. MH-ID

   MH-ID is simply set to the VE-ID field in the NLRI part of ADV.

3.3.2.3. VBO

   VBO is simply set to the VE Block Offset field in the NLRI part of
   ADV. This field will typically be zero.

3.3.2.4. DOM

   This variable, indicating the VPLS domain to which ADV belongs, is
   derived by applying BGP policy to the Route Target extended
   communities in ADV. The details of how this is done are outside the
   scope of this document.

3.3.2.5. ACS

   ACS is the status of the attachment circuits for a given site of a
   VPLS. ACS = 1 if all attachment circuits for the site are down, and 0
   otherwise.

   For BGP-based Multi-homing, ADV MUST contain an L2-info extended
   community; within this community are control flags. One of these
   flags is the 'D' bit, described in [I-D.kothari-l2vpn-auto-site-id].
   ACS is set to the value of the 'D' bit in ADV.

3.3.2.6. PREF

   PREF is derived from the Local Preference (LP) attribute in ADV as
   well as the VPLS Preference field (VP) in the L2-info extended
   community. If the Local Preference attribute is missing, LP is set to
   0; if the L2-info community is missing, VP is set to 0. The following
   table shows how PREF is computed from LP and VP.

   type 0x01, then PE-ID is set to the Global Administrator sub-field of
   the RO. Otherwise, if ADV has an ORIGINATOR_ID attribute, then PE-ID
   is set to the ORIGINATOR_ID. Otherwise, PE-ID is set to the BGP
   Identifier.

3.3.3. Election Procedures

   The election procedures described in this section apply equally to
   BGP VPLS and LDP VPLS.

   Election occurs in two stages. The first stage divides all received
   VPLS advertisements into buckets of relevant and comparable
   advertisements. Distinction MUST NOT be made on whether the NLRI is a
   multi-homing NLRI or not. In this stage, advertisements may be
   discarded as not being relevant to DF election. The second stage
   picks a single "winner" from each bucket by repeatedly applying a
   tie-breaking algorithm on a pair of advertisements from that bucket.
   The tie-breaking rules are such that the order in which
   advertisements are picked from the bucket does not affect the final
   result. Note that this is a conceptual description of the process; an
   implementation MAY choose to realize this differently as long as the
   semantics are preserved.

   Note: these procedures supersede the tie breaking rules described in
   (Section 9.1.2.2) [RFC4271]

3.3.3.1. Bucketization for BGP DF Election

   An advertisement

     ADV -> <RD, MH-ID, VBO, DOM, ACS, PREF, PE-ID>

   is discarded if DOM is not of interest to the BGP speaker. Otherwise,
   ADV is put into the bucket for <DOM, RD, MH-ID, VBO>. In other words,
   the information in BGP DF election consists of <DOM, RD, MH-ID, VBO>
   and only advertisements with exact same <DOM, RD, MH-ID, VBO, DOM>
   are candidates for DF election.

3.3.3.2. Bucketization for VPLS DF Election

   An advertisement

     ADV -> <RD, MH-ID, VBO, DOM, ACS, PREF, PE-ID>

   is discarded if DOM is not of interest to the VPLS PE. Otherwise, ADV
   is put into the bucket for <DOM, MH-ID>. In other words, all
   advertisements for a particular VPLS domain that have the same MH-ID
   are candidates for VPLS DF election.

3.3.3.3. Tie-breaking Rules

   This section describes the tie-breaking rules for both BGP and VPLS
   DF election. Tie-breaking rules for BGP DF election are applied to
   candidate advertisements by any BGP speaker. Since RD must be same
   for advertisements to be candidates for BGP DF election, use of
   unique RDs will result in no candidate advertisements for BGP tie-
   breaking rules and thus, a BGP speaker in such a case will simply not
   do BGP DF election. Tie-breaking rules for VPLS DF election are
   applied to candidate advertisements by all VPLS PEs and the actions
   taken by VPLS PEs based on the VPLS DF election result are described
   in Section 3.4.

   Given two advertisements ADV1 and ADV2 from a given bucket, first
   compute the variables needed for DF election:

     ADV1 -> <RD1, MH-ID1, VBO1, DOM1, ACS1, PREF1, PE-ID1>

     ADV2 -> <RD2, MH-ID2, VBO2, DOM2, ACS2, PREF2, PE-ID2>

Internet-Draft      BGP based Multi-homing in VPLS            July 2010


   Note that MH-ID1 = MH-ID2 and DOM1 = DOM2, since ADV1 and ADV2 came
   from the same bucket. If this is for BGP DF election, RD1 = RD2 and
   VBO1 = VBO2 as well. Then the following tie-breaking rules MUST be
   applied in the given order.

   1.  if (ACS1 != 1) AND (ACS2 == 1) ADV1 wins; stop

       if (ACS1 == 1) AND (ACS2 != 1) ADV2 wins; stop

       else continue



   2.  if (PREF1 > PREF2) ADV1 wins; stop;

       else if (PREF1 < PREF2) ADV2 wins; stop;

       else continue



   3.  if (PE-ID1 < PE-ID2) ADV1 wins; stop;

       else if (PE-ID1 > PE-ID2) ADV2 wins; stop;

       else ADV1 and ADV2 are from the same VPLS PE

   For BGP DF election, if there is no winner and ADV1 and ADV2 are from
   the same PE, BGP DF election should simply consider this as an
   update.

   For VPLS DF election, if there is no winner and ADV1 and ADV2 are
   from the same PE, a VPLS PE MUST retain both ADV1 and ADV2.

3.4. DF Election on PEs

   DF election algorithm MUST be run by all multi-homed VPLS PEs. In
   addition, all other PEs SHOULD also run the DF election algorithm. As
   a result of the DF election, multi-homed PEs that loose the DF
   election for a MH-ID MUST put the ACs associated with the MH-ID in
   non-forwarding state.

   DF election result on the egress PEs can be used in traffic
   forwarding decision. Figure 2 shows two customer sites, CE1 and CE4,
   connected to PE1 with CE1 multi-homed to PE1 and PE2. If PE1 is the
   designated forwarder for CE1, based on the DF election result, PE3
   can chose to not send unknown unicast and multicast traffic to PE2 as

Internet-Draft      BGP based Multi-homing in VPLS            July 2010


   PE2 is not the designated forwarder for any customer site and it has
   no other single homed sites connected to it.

4. Multi-AS VPLS

   This section describes multi-homing in an inter-AS context.

4.1. Route Origin Extended Community

   Due to lack of information about the PEs that originate the VPLS
   NLRIs in inter-AS operations, Route Origin Extended Community
   [RFC4360] is used to carry the source PE's IP address.

   To use Route Origin Extended Community for carrying the originator
   VPLS PE's loopback address, the type field of the community MUST be
   set to 0x01 and the Global Administrator sub-field MUST be set to the
   PE's loopback IP address.

4.2. VPLS Preference

   When multiple PEs are assigned the same site ID for multi-homing, it
   is often desired to be able to control the selection of a particular
   PE as the designated forwarder.  Section 3.5 in [RFC4761] describes
   the use of BGP Local Preference in path selection to choose a
   particular NLRI, where Local Preference indicates the degree of
   preference for a particular VE.  The use of Local Preference is
   inadequate when VPLS PEs are spread across multiple ASes as Local
   Preference is not carried across AS boundary.  A new field, VPLS
   preference (VP), is introduced in this document that can be used to
   accomplish this. VPLS preference indicates a degree of preference for
   a particular customer site.  VPLS preference is not mandatory for
   intra-AS operation; the algorithm explained in Section 3.3 will work
   with or without the presence of VPLS preference.

   Section 3.2.4 in [RFC4761] describes the Layer2 Info Extended
   Community that carries control information about the pseudowires. The
   last two octets that were reserved now carries VPLS preference as
   shown in Figure 3.

                 Figure 4 Layer 2 Info Extended Community

   A VPLS preference is a 2-octets unsigned integer. A value of zero
   indicates absence of a VP and is not a valid preference value. This
   interpretation is required for backwards compatibility.
   Implementations using Layer2 Info Extended Community as described in
   (Section 3.2.4) [RFC4761] MUST set the last two octets as zero since
   it was a reserved field.

   For backwards compatibility, if VP is used, then BGP Local Preference
   MUST be set to the value of VP. Note that a Local Preference value of
   zero for a MH-Site is not valid unless 'D' bit in the control flags
   is set (see [I-D.kothari-l2vpn-auto-site-id]). In addition, Local
   Preference value greater than or equal to 2^16 for VPLS
   advertisements is not valid.

4.3. Use of BGP-MH attributes in Inter-AS Methods

   Section 3.4 in [RFC4761] and section 4 in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-signaling]
   describe three methods (a, b and c) to connect sites in a VPLS to PEs
   that are across multiple AS. Since VPLS advertisements in method (a)
   do not cross AS boundaries, multi-homing operations for method (a)
   remain exactly the same as they are within as AS. However, for method
   (b) and (c), VPLS advertisements do cross AS boundary. This section
   describes the VPLS operations for method (b) and method (c). Consider
   Figure 5 for inter-AS VPLS with multi-homed customer sites.

                          Figure 5 Inter-AS VPLS

   A customer has four sites, CE1, CE2, CE3 and CE4. CE1 is multi-homed
   to PE1 and PE2 in AS1. CE2 is single-homed to PE1. CE3 and CE4 are
   also single homed to PE3 and PE4 respectively in AS2. Assume that in
   addition to the base LDP/BGP VPLS addressing (VSI-IDs/VE-IDs), MH ID
   1 is assigned for CE1. After running DF election algorithm, all four
   VPLS PEs must elect the same designated forwarder for CE1 site. Since
   BGP Local Preference is not carried across AS boundary, VPLS
   preference as described in Section 4.2 MUST be used for carrying site
   preference in inter-AS VPLS operations.

   For Inter-AS method (b) ASBR1 will send a VPLS NLRI received from PE1
   to ASBR2 with itself as the BGP nexthop. ASBR2 will send the received
   NLRI from ASBR1 to PE3 and PE4 with itself as the BGP nexthop. Since
   VPLS PEs use BGP Local Preference in DF election, for backwards
   compatibility, ASBR2 MUST set the Local Preference value in the VPLS
   advertisements it sends to PE3 and PE4 to the VPLS preference value
   contained in the VPLS advertisement it receives from ASBR1. ASBR1
   MUST do the same for the NLRIs it sends to PE1 and PE2. If ASBR1
   receives a VPLS advertisement without a valid VPLS preference from a
   PE within its AS, then ASBR1 MUST set the VPLS preference in the
   advertisements to the Local Preference value before sending it to
   ASBR2. Similarly, ASBR2 must do the same for advertisements without
   VPLS Preference it receives from PEs within its AS. Thus, in method
   (b), ASBRs MUST update the VPLS and Local Preference based on the
   advertisements they receive either from an ASBR or a PE within their
   AS.

   In Figure 5, PE1 will send the VPLS advertisements, including the
   ones for MH site CE1, with Route Origin Extended Community containing
   its loopback address. PE2 will do the same. Even though PE3 receives
   the VPLS advertisements from the same BGP nexthop, ASBR2, the source
   PE address contained in the Route Origin Extended Community is
   different for the VPLS advertisements received from PE1 and PE2, and
   thus, PE3 can apply correctly the DF Election algorithm as the
   resulting PE-IDs are different.

4.3.2. Inter-AS Method (c): Multi-Hop EBGP Redistribution of VPLS
   Information between ASes

   In this method, there is a multi-hop E-BGP peering between the PEs or
   Route Reflectors in AS1 and the PEs or Route Reflectors in AS2. There
   is no VPLS state in either control or data plane on the ASBRs.

   The multi-homing operations on the PEs in this method are exactly the
   same as they are in intra-AS scenario. However, since Local
   Preference is not carried across AS boundary, the translation of LP
   to VP and vice versa MUST be done by RR, if RR is used to reflect
   VPLS advertisements to other ASes. This is exactly the same as what a
   ASBR does in case of method (b). A RR must set the VP to the LP value
   in an advertisement before sending it to other ASes and must set the
   LP to the VP value in an advertisement that it receives from other
   ASes before sending to the PEs within the AS.

5. MAC Flush Operations

   In a service provider VPLS network, customer MAC learning is confined
   to PE devices and any intermediate nodes, such as a Route Reflector,
   do not have any state for MAC addresses.

   Topology changes either in the service provider's network or in
   customer's network can result in the movement of MAC addresses from
   one PE device to another. Such events can result into traffic being
   dropped due to stale state of MAC addresses on the PE devices. Age
   out timers that clear the stale state will resume the traffic
   forwarding, but age out timers are typically in minutes, and
   convergence of the order of minutes can severely impact customer's
   service. To handle such events and expedite convergence of traffic,
   flushing of affected MAC addresses is highly desirable.

   This section describes the scenarios where VPLS flush is desirable
   and the specific VPLS Flush TLVs that provide capability to flush the
   affected MAC addresses on the PE devices. All operations described in
   this section are in context of a particular VPLS domain and not
   across multiple VPLS domains. Mechanisms for MAC flush are described

Internet-Draft      BGP based Multi-homing in VPLS            July 2010


   in [I-D.kothari-l2vpn-vpls-flush] for BGP based VPLS and in [RFC4762]
   for LDP based VPLS.

5.1. MAC List Flush

   If multiple customer sites are connected to the same PE, PE1 as shown
   in Figure 2, and redundancy per site is desired when multi-homing
   procedures described in this document are in effect, then it is
   desirable to flush just the relevant MAC addresses from a particular
   site when the site connectivity is lost.

   To flush particular set of MAC addresses, a PE SHOULD originate a
   flush message with MAC list that contains a list of MAC addresses
   that needs to be flushed. In Figure 2, if connectivity between CE1
   and PE1 goes down and if PE1 was the designated forwarder for CE1,
   PE1 SHOULD send a list of MAC addresses that belong to CE1 to all its
   BGP peers.

   It is RECOMMENDED that in case of excessive link flap of customer
   attachment circuit in a short duration, a PE should have a means to
   throttle advertisements of flush messages so that excessive flooding
   of such advertisements do not occur.

5.2. Implicit MAC Flush

   When connectivity to a customer site is lost, remote PEs learn that a
   particular site is no longer reachable. The local PE either withdraws
   the VPLS NLRI that it previously advertised for the site or it sends
   a BGP update message for the site's VPLS NLRI with the 'D' bit set.

   If a remote PE detects that a multi-homed PE has transitioned from
   being a DF to a non-DF, then the remote PE can choose to flush all
   MAC addresses that it learned from the multi-homed PE transitioning
   from DF to non-DF. Alternatively the remote PE may chose to react
   when detecting the non-DF to DF transition for a multi-homed PE by
   flushing in the related VPLS context all the MACs learned with the
   exception of the MACs associated with the new DF PE.

6. Backwards Compatibility

   No forwarding loops are formed when PEs or Route Reflectors that do
   not support procedures defined in this section co exist in the
   network with PEs or Route Reflectors that do support.

Internet-Draft      BGP based Multi-homing in VPLS            July 2010


6.1. BGP based VPLS

   As explained in this section, multi-homed PEs to the same customer
   site MUST assign the same MH-ID and related NLRI SHOULD contain the
   block offset, block size and label base as zero. Remote PEs that lack
   support of multi-homing operations specified in this document will
   fail to create any PWs for the multi-homed MH-IDs due to the label
   value of zero and thus, the multi-homing NLRI should have no impact
   on the operation of Remote PEs that lack support of multi-homing
   operations specified in this document.

6.2. LDP VPLS with BGP Auto-discovery

   The BGP-AD NLRI has a prefix length of 12 containing only a 8 bytes
   RD and a 4 bytes VSI-ID. If a LDP VPLS PEs running BGP AD lacks
   support of multi-homing operations specified in this document, it
   SHOULD ignore a MH NLRI with the length field of 17. As a result it
   will not ask LDP to create any PWs for the multi-homed Site-ID and
   thus, the multi-homing NLRI should have no impact on LDP VPLS
   operation.

7. Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced beyond those that are described
   in [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

8. IANA Considerations

   At this time, this memo includes no request to IANA.
