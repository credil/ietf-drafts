Internet-Draft         Diameter Key Transport AVPs          January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter EAP application [RFC4072] defines the EAP-Master-
   Session-Key and EAP-Key-Name AVPs for the purpose of transporting
   cryptographic keying material derived during the execution of certain
   EAP [RFC3748] methods (for example, EAP-TLS [RFC5216]).  At most one
   instance of either of these AVPs is allowed in any Diameter message.

   However, recent work [RFC5295] has specified methods to derive other
   keys from the keying material created during EAP method execution
   that may require transport in addition to the MSK.  In addition, ERP
   [RFC5296] specifies new keys that may need to be transported between
   Diameter nodes.

   This note specifies a set of AVPs allowing the transport of multiple
   cryptographic keys in a single Diameter message.

3.  Attribute-Value Pair Definitions

   This section defines new AVPs for the transport of cryptographic keys
   in the Diameter EAP application [RFC4072], as well as other Diameter
   applications.

3.1.  Key AVP

   The Key AVP (AVP Code <AC1>) is of type Grouped [RFC3588] It contains
   the name, type and optionally, the usable lifetime of the key, as
   well as the keying material itself.

   Key ::= < AVP Header: AC1 >
             < Key-Type >
             { Keying-Material }
             [ Key-Lifetime ]
             [ Key-Name ]
           * [ AVP ]

3.1.1.  Key-Type AVP

   The Key-Type AVP (AVP Code <AC2>) is of type Enumerated and signifies
   the type of the key being sent.  The Key-Type AVP MAY be included in
   a DER command as a signal that a certain type of key is required in
   the response (e.g., to support ERP).  The following values are
   defined in this document:

Internet-Draft         Diameter Key Transport AVPs          January 2010


   MSK (0)
      The EAP Master Session Key [RFC3748]

   DSRK (1)
      A Domain-Specific Root Key [RFC5295].

   USRK (2)
      A Usage Specific Root Key [RFC5295].

   rRK (3)
      A reauthentication Root Key [RFC5296].

   rMSK (4)
      A reauthentication Master Session Key [RFC5296].

   DSUSRK (5)  A Domain-Specific Usage-Specific Root Key [RFC5295].

   If additional values are needed, they are to be assigned by IANA
   according to the policy stated in Section 6.2

3.1.2.  Key-Name AVP

   The Key-Name AVP is of type OctetString.  It contains an opaque key
   identifier.  Exactly how this name is generated and used depends on
   the key type and link layer in question, and is beyond the scope of
   this document (see [RFC5247] and [RFC5295] for discussions of key
   name generation in the context of EAP).

3.1.3.  Keying-Material AVP

   The Keying-Material AVP (AVP Code <AC3>) is of type OctetString.  The
   exact usage of this keying material depends upon several factors,
   including the link layer in use and the type of the key; it is beyond
   the scope of this document.

3.1.4.  Key-Lifetime AVP

   The Key-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code <AC4>) is of type Integer64 [RFC3588]
   and represents the period of time (in seconds) for which the contents
   of the Keying-Material AVP Section 3.1.3 is valid.

   NOTE:
      Applications using this value SHOULD consider the beginning of the
      lifetime to be the point in time when the keying material is first
      used.

   o  Keying-Material (<AC3>, Section 3.1.3

   o  Key-Lifetime (<AC4>, Section 3.1.4

6.2.  AVP Values
