          Network Configuration Protocol System Notifications
               draft-ietf-netconf-system-notifications-03

Abstract

   The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration
   datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware of
   common NETCONF system events such as a change in NETCONF
   capabilities, which may impact management applications.  Standard
   mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the NETCONF system
   events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a YANG
   module which allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for
   some common events.

1.  Introduction

   The NETCONF protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-4741bis] provides mechanisms
   to manipulate configuration datastores.  However, client applications
   often need to be aware of common NETCONF system events such as a
   change in NETCONF capabilities, which may impact management
   applications.  Standard mechanisms are needed to support the
   monitoring of the NETCONF system events within the NETCONF server.
   This document defines a YANG module [RFC6020] which allows a NETCONF
   client to receive notifications for some common events.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-4741bis]:
   o  client
   o  datastore
   o  operation
   o  server

   The following terms are defined in [RFC5277]:
   o  event
   o  stream
   o  subscription

   The following term is defined in [RFC6020]:
   o  data node


2.  YANG Module for NETCONF System Notifications

2.1.  Overview

   The YANG module defined within this document specifies a small number
   of notification event messages for use within the 'NETCONF' stream,
   and accessible to clients via the subscription mechanism in
   [RFC5277].

   These notifications pertain to the NETCONF portion of the managed
   system, not the entire system.

   The YANG language is defined in [RFC6020].

2.1.1.  Notifications

   This module defines some events for the 'NETCONF' stream to notify a
   client application that the NETCONF server state has changed.
   o  netconf-config-change: Generated when the NETCONF server detects
      that the <running> or <startup> configuration datastore has
      changed.  Summarizes each edit being reported.
   o  netconf-capability-change: Generated when the NETCONF server
      capabilities are changed.  Indicates which capabilities have been
      added, deleted, and/or modified.
   o  netconf-session-start: Generated when a NETCONF session is
      started.  Indicates the identity of the user that started the
      session.
   o  netconf-session-end: Generated when a NETCONF server detects that
      a session has terminated.  Indicates the identity of the user that
      owned the session, and why the session was terminated.
   o  netconf-confirmed-commit: Generated when a NETCONF confirmed-
      commit event occurs.  Indicates the current state of the
      confirmed-commit operation in progress.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers one XML namespace URN in the 'IETF XML
   registry', following the format defined in [RFC3688].

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-system-notifications

   Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers one module name in the 'YANG Module Names'
   registry, defined in [RFC6020] .

      name: ietf-netconf-system-notifications
      prefix: ncsys
      namespace:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-system-notifications
      RFC: XXXX // RFC Ed.: replace XXXX and remove this comment


4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a YANG module for reporting of particular
   system events.  Although unlikely, it is possible that data obtained
   from this module could be used in an attack of some kind, although no
   specific information in this module is considered sensitive.

   TBD: follow Security Consideration guidelines from new template text.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   -- RFC Ed.: remove this section before publication.

A.1.  02-03

   Renamed module back to NETCONF system notifications.  The module is
   now ietf-netconf-system-notifications.  The namespace and prefix are
   now changed as well.

   Leaf user-name is now username, and is now mandatory, to be
   consistent with netconf monitoring module.

   Leaf remote-host is now source-host to be consistent with netconf
   monitoring module.

   The changed-by choice (server-or-user) is now mandatory.

   The netconf-config-change description was updated and leaf target-
   database is now named target-datastore.

   Term 'database' changed to term 'datastore' in text.

   netconf-confirmed-commit: changed uses common-session-parms to use

Internet-Draft        NETCONF System Notifications            March 2011


A.2.  01-02

   Renamed module NETCONF Events instead of NETCONF system
   notifications.  Note that ietf-netconf-notifications is being
   reserved for the XML content defined in RFC 5277.

   Made changes based on mailing list comments and latest WG consensus.

   Filled in IANA section.

A.3.  00-01

   Removed sys-startup notification.

   Make changed-by into a grouping, and added usage to sys-config-change
   notification.

   Added target-database leaf to sys-config-change to distinguish
   between running and startup changes.

   Removed 'bad-start' from termination-reason leaf in sys-session-end
   notification.

A.4.  00

   Initial version, based on
   draft-bierman-netconf-system-monitoring-00.txt.
