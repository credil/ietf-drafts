             IMAP LIST extension for special-use mailboxes
                   draft-ietf-morg-list-specialuse-01

Abstract

   Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
   used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients
   allow users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put,
   but configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
   server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new
   mailbox flags that a server MAY include in IMAP LIST command
   responses to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing
   configuration.

Note

   A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC
   editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion
   and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to
   morg@ietf.org.

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       February 2010


1.  Introduction

   Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
   used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients
   allow users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put,
   but configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
   server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new
   mailbox flags that a server MAY include in IMAP LIST command
   responses to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing
   configuration.

   In addition, this extension adds an OPTIONAL parameter on the IMAP
   CREATE command, allowing a client to assign a special use to a
   mailbox when it is created.  Servers MAY choose to support this part
   of the extension, but are not required to.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Change log

   [[RFC EDITOR: Please remove this section and its subsections.]]

1.2.1.  Changes from -00 to -01

      Added wording about list-extended; added reference to RFC 5258;
      added example; added registration of list-extended return option.

      Changed CREATE syntax to use RFC 4466; added reference to RFC
      4466; fixed example.

      Added "\Archive" use flag.

      Noted that multiple mailboxes might have the same flag in some
      implementations.

      Changed some use flag names to be more general: \All (was
      \AllMail), \Junk (was \Spam), \Flagged (was \Starred).

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       February 2010


2.  New mailbox flags identifying special-use mailboxes

   An IMAP server that supports this extension MAY include any or all of
   the following flags in responses to the non-extended IMAP LIST
   command.  The new flags are included along with existing flags, such
   as "\Marked" and "\Noselect".  A given mailbox may have none, one, or
   more than one of these flags.  In some cases, a special use is advice
   to a client about what to put in that mailbox.  In other cases, it's
   advice to a client about what to expect to find there.

   For the extended list command [RFC5258], this extension adds a new
   return option, "SPECIAL-USE".  The new special-use flags SHOULD be
   returned if the client specifies the SPECIAL-USE return option, and
   MAY be returned even if the client does not specify it.

   The new flags defined here are as follows:

   \Drafts
        This mailbox is used to hold draft messages -- typically,
        messages that are being composed but have not yet been sent.  In
        some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with
        the "\Draft" message flag.  Alternatively, this might just be
        advice that a client put drafts here.

   \Flagged
        This mailbox presents all messages marked in some way as
        "important".  When this special use is supported, it is likely
        to represent a virtual mailbox collecting messages (from other
        mailboxes) that are marked with the "\Flagged" message flag.

   \Inbox
        This mailbox is the inbox, where new incoming mail is placed by
        default.  This will normally be the same as the mailbox with the
        name "inbox", as defined in the base IMAP protocol [RFC3501].

   \Junk
        This mailbox is where messages deemed to be junk mail are held.
        Some server implementations might put messages here
        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice to a
        client-side spam filter.

   \Sent
        This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that have been
        sent.  Some server implementations might put messages here
        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice that a
        client save sent messages here.

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       February 2010


   \Trash
        This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted, or
        marked for deletion.  In some server implementations, this might
        be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from other mailboxes
        that are marked with the "\Deleted" message flag.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that
        chooses not to use the IMAP "\Deleted" model should use this as
        its trash location.  In server implementations that strictly
        expect the IMAP "\Deleted" model, this special use is likely not
        to be supported.

   \All
        This mailbox presents all messages in the user's message store.
        Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those
        in \Trash and \Junk.  When this special use is supported, it is
        almost certain to represent a virtual mailbox.

   \Archive
        This mailbox is used to archive messages.  The meaning of an
        "archival" mailbox is server-dependent; typically, it will be
        used to get messages out of the inbox, or otherwise keep them
        out of the user's way, while still making them accessible.

   All of the above flags are OPTIONAL, and any given server or message
   store may support any combination of the flags, or none at all.  In
   some server or message store implementations it might be possible for
   multiple mailboxes to have the same special-use flag.  There is no
   capability string associated with this feature.


3.  Extension to IMAP CREATE command to set special-use flags

   As an OPTIONAL feature, a server MAY allow clients to designate a
   mailbox, at creation, as having one or more special uses.  This
   extension defines the "USE" parameter to the IMAP CREATE command for
   that purpose (using the syntax defined in RFC 4466 section 2.2
   [RFC4466]).  The new OPTIONAL "USE" parameter is followed by a
   parenthesized list of zero or more special-use flags, as defined
   above.

   In some server implementations, some special uses may imply automatic
   action by the server.  For example, creation of a "\Junk" mailbox
   might cause the server to start placing messages that have been
   evaluated as spam into the mailbox.

   In some server implementations, some special uses may result in a
   mailbox with unusual characteristics or side effects.  For example,
   creation of an "\All" mailbox might cause the server to create a

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       February 2010


   virtual mailbox, rather than a standard one, and that mailbox might
   behave in unexpected ways (COPY into it might fail, for example).

   Servers MAY allow the creation of a special-use mailbox even if one
   so designated already exists, having the effect of moving the special
   use from the old mailbox to the new one.  Alternatively, servers MAY
   refuse the creation, considering the designation to be a conflict.

   If the server can not create a mailbox with the designated special
   use defined, for whatever reason, it MUST NOT create the mailbox, and
   MUST respond to the CREATE command with a tagged NO response.

   An IMAP server that supports this OPTIONAL feature will advertise the
   CREATE-SPECIAL-USE capability string.  Clients MUST NOT use the "USE"
   parameter unless the server advertises the capability.


4.  Examples

4.1.  Example of an IMAP LIST command

   This example shows an IMAP LIST response from a server that supports
   this extension.  Note that not all of the flags are used.  This
   server also supports the Child Mailbox extension [RFC3348].

     C: t1 LIST "" "%"
     S: * LIST (\Marked \HasNoChildren) "/" Inbox
     S: * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "/" ToDo
     S: * LIST (\HasChildren) "/" Projects
     S: * LIST (\Sent \HasNoChildren) "/" SentMail
     S: * LIST (\Marked \Drafts \HasNoChildren) "/" MyDrafts
     S: * LIST (\Trash \HasNoChildren) "/" Trash
     S: t1 OK done

4.2.  Example of an extended IMAP LIST command

   This example shows an IMAP LIST response from a server that supports
   this extension.  The client uses the extended IMAP LIST command.

     C: t1 LIST "" "%" RETURN (SPECAL-USE)
     S: * LIST (\Marked) "/" Inbox
     S: * LIST () "/" ToDo
     S: * LIST () "/" Projects
     S: * LIST (\Sent) "/" SentMail
     S: * LIST (\Marked \Drafts) "/" MyDrafts
     S: * LIST (\Trash) "/" Trash
     S: t1 OK done

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes       February 2010


4.3.  Example of an IMAP CREATE command

   This example shows an IMAP CREATE command that might be used to
   create a mailbox designated to hold draft and sent messages.  It also
   attempts to create a mailbox that will contain all the user's
   messages, but the server does not support that special use for this
   user's message store.

     C: t1 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 CREATE-SPECIAL-USE
     S: t1 OK done
     C: t2 CREATE MySpecial (USE (\Drafts \Sent))
     S: t2 OK MySpecial created
     C: t3 CREATE Everything (USE (\All))
     S: t3 NO \All not supported


5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].

   create-param   =/  "USE" SP "(" [use-flag *(SP use-flag)] ")"
                    ; Extends "create-param" from RFC 4466 [RFC4466]

   mbx-list-oflag =/  use-flag
                    ; Extends "mbx-list-oflag" from IMAP base [RFC3501]

   return-option =/ "SPECIAL-USE"
                    ; Extends "return-option" from
                    ; LIST-extended [RFC5258]

   use-flag        =  "\All" / "\Archive" / "\Drafts" / "\Flagged" /
                    "\Inbox" / "\Junk" / "\Sent" / "\Trash" / use-flag-
                    ext

   use-flag-ext    =  "\" atom
                    ; Reserved for future extensions.  Clients
                    ; MUST ignore list flags they do not understand
                    ; Server implementations MUST NOT generate
                    ; extension flags except as defined by
                    ; future standards-track revisions of or
                    ; extensions to this specification.

6.  Security Considerations

   LIST response: There are no security issues with conveying special-
   use information to a client.

   CREATE command "USE" parameter: In some server implementations, some
   special uses may imply automatic action by the server.  For example,
   creation of a "\Junk" mailbox might cause the server to start placing
   messages that have been evaluated as spam into the mailbox.  Server
   implementors SHOULD consider the consequences of allowing a user (or
   client program) to designate the target of such automatic action.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of CREATE-SPECIAL-USE IMAP capability

   This document defines a new IMAP capability.  IANA is asked to add
   "CREATE-SPECIAL-USE" to the imap4-capabilities registry.

7.2.  Registration of SPECIAL-USE return option

   This document defines a new IMAP4 List Extended return option.  IANA
   is asked to add "SPECIAL-USE" to the imap4-list-extended registry, as
   follows:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of LIST-EXTENDED option SPECIAL-USE
   LIST-EXTENDED option name: SPECIAL-USE
   LIST-EXTENDED option type: RETURN
   LIST-EXTENDED option description: Request special-use mailbox
