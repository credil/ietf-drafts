Abstract

   The ubiquitous presence of the internet coupled with the increasing
   demand for high bandwidth dedicated large scale network has made it
   imperative that the multi-domain networks are facilitated by the
   development of GMPLS.  In such large scale network, the high
   performance network survivability is a significant factor to resist
   the fault service discontinue and interruption even to decrease
   economic loss and the society impact.  This document proposes a
   series of network survivability evaluation metrics and methodologies
   that can be used to demonstrate the network survivability performance
   in single and multi-domain GMPLS networks, more specifically, the
   network fault restoration performance.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  motivation

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Lable Switching (GMPLS) network is a
   promising choice with the use of optical technology in core networks
   combined with IP/Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) solution for
   the next generation Internet architecture.  The ubiquitous presence
   of the internet coupled with the increasing demand for high bandwidth
   and dedicated large scale network has made it imperative that the
   multi-domain networks are facilitated by the development of GMPLS.

   Survivability is the capability of the network to maintain service
   continuity in the presence of faults within the network, at the same
   time, service influenced could be switched over to free resource.
   All kinds of intra-domain and inter-domain faults occurs in multi-
   domain GMPLS Networks, therefore, in such large scale network, the
   high performance network survivability is a significant factor to
   resist the fault service interruption even to decrease economic loss
   and the society impact due to faults.  Recovery time is a key factor
   to measure network survivability performance which has an impact on
   the link and service evaluation.  The long recovery time could
   increase the traffic delay, packet losses, the resource collision,
   preemption and service discontinue even the whole network can not
   reach the level of reliability required by traffic service.  The time
   of every recovery phrase is required to be known by a series of
   measurement methodologies in order to reduce the fault restoration
   time.  Certain method could be adopted to reduce the every phrase
   time to achieve the aim of reducing the whole recovery time.
   Therefore, network survivability evaluation metrics is necessary in
   multi-domain Generalized MPLS Networks.

   This document proposes a series of network survivability evaluation
   metrics and methodologies that can be used to demonstrate the network
   survivability performance in single and multi-domain GMPLS networks,
   more specifically, the network fault restoration performance.  The
   time of every fault restoration phase is measured precisely to
   evaluate the whole network performance by proposed evaluation
   metrics.

3.  Overview of Network Survivability Evaluation Metrics

   There are two recovery mechanisms (eg. protection and restoration)
   and the former is outside the scope of this document currently.
   Network survivability evaluation metric is used to measure precise
   recovery time which is a key factor during the whole fault recovery
   process (eg. fault detection, fault location, fault notification,
   fault recovery and reversion).  These phases define the sequence of
   generic operations that need to be performed when a failure occurs.
   The evaluation metrics take the time of every phrase into account and
   give the specific measurement steps and methodologies.


4.  Network Survivability Evaluation Metrics

   High performance of network survivability has become a key issue to
   improve and satisfy the increasing requirements of reliability and
   Quality of Service (QoS) of the whole network.  This section defines
   a network survivability evaluation metric in single and multi-domain
   Generalized MPLS networks.

4.1.  Fault Restoration Time Phases

   This section gives several typical definitions of restoration times
   and durations as shown in figure 1.

   Phase 1: Fault detection.

   Phase 2: Fault localization and isolation.

                 Figure 1: Failure Restoration Time Phases

   A detailed analysis and specific definition is provided for each of
   the restoration phases as identified in [RFC4427] and [RFC4428].

   o  Fault detection time TDET

   Fault detection time is defined as the time between occurrence of
   fault and detecting the fault and degradation.

   TDET depends on several factors pertaining to the link propagation
   time, link transmission time, node processing time and node queuing
   time.

   o  Fault Localization and isolation time TLOC

   Fault Localization and isolation time is defined as the time the
   signal indication information is delivered from fault node to PSL.

   o  Fault notification time TNOT

   Fault notification time is defined as the time to inform the
   noderesponsible of the switchover that a failure has occurred.

   TNOT depends on failure notification delay and the notification
   method used.

   o  Backup routing time TBR

   Backup routing time is defined as the time for new backup creation,
   routing (TBR) and signaling (TBS).

   TBR depends on the routing method applied.

Internet-Draft       Survivability Evaluation Metric          April 2011


   o  Backup signaling time TBS

   Backup signaling time is defined as the time that is required to
   activate the backup path before the switchover.

   TBS depends on the signaling method applied.

   o  Backup activation time TBA

   Backup activation time is defined as the time between the settlement
   of backup path and the switching over the traffic.

   TBA depends on the backup path distance and signaling process.

   o  Switchover time TSW

   Switchover time is defined as the time of switching the traffic from
   the working path through which the traffic is flowing, to the
   alternative/backup path.

   TSW depends on the node technology.

   o  Restoration completion time TCR

   Restoration completion time is defined as the time to complete the
   fault recovery, i.e. the time it takes the first packet to arrive
   from the backup path to the ML.

   TCR depends on the backup distance.

   o  The total restoration time

   The total restoration time is defined as the sum of TDET, TNOT, TBR,
   TBS, TBA , TSW and TCR.

4.2.  Restoration Schemes and Scenarios

   Link restoration could effectively take use of network bandwidth to
   eliminate faults.  The restoration technique is also referred as
   reroute and fast reroute, for instance, no backup path is established
   prior to the failure to protect the working path.  Therefore,
   restoration requires dynamic routing algorithms and bandwidth
   allocation to establish a backup path on demand upon network failure.
   Once the backup path has been set up, traffic is then switched from
   the working path.

4.2.1.  Fault types

   There are three failure types according to the fault level in the
   optical network, such as service fault, channel failure and fiber
   failure.  We only take channel failure and fiber failure into
   account.

   Service fault : service mistake during the process of the message
   packaging.

   Channel fault: all the services are influenced if a TE link fault
   occurs in the certain wavelength channel due to transmitter or
   receiver and so on.

   Fiber fault: all the services traversing the link are influenced if a
   fiber fault occurs due to fiber cut or other external factor and so
   on.

4.2.2.  Faults in single domain

   There are two restoration methods in allusion to fault in single
   domain.  Fast reroute mainly provides the local repair function such
   as span restoration and segment restoration.  The start node of span
   and segment restoration is responsible for backup path computation
   and traffic switching as the PSL(Path Switch LSR) instead of the
   source node in reroute scheme.

   o  Reroute

   In the scenario of single domain, detecting entities in transport
   plane detect related fault information when node or link failure
   occurs.  Failure localization/isolation is triggered immediately
   after the failure detection.  And then the fault indication signaling
   is sent to the source node through the GMPLS-based signaling or
   flooding method by the detecting node.  In the case of flooding
   method, intermediate nodes pertaining to the fault end-to-end LSP are
   informed the fault indication signaling between the upstream node and
   source node through a notification mechanism.  In the signaling-based
   technique, detecting node sends fault indication signaling such as
   RSVP-TE to each LSP affected by the failure through different
   notification mechanism.

   After receiving the fault indication signaling, the source node
   computes a backup path by a series of routing algorithms or route
   pre-computation scheme and then allocates the bandwidth.  Path and
   RESV signaling are responsible for path establishment and resource
   reservation respectively for the new backup path.  After that, the
   traffic is switched to the backup path from the working path.

Internet-Draft       Survivability Evaluation Metric          April 2011


   o  Fast reroute

   In the scheme of fast reroute, failure localization/isolation is
   triggered immediately after the failure detection.  And then the
   fault indication signaling is sent to the span or segment PSL from
   the upstream node of failure link through the GMPLS-based signaling
   or flooding method.  These two notification methods are described in
   reroute part of section 4.2.1.  On receiving the fault indication
   signaling, PSL is computes a new path by a series of routing
   algorithms and allocates the bandwidth to the backup path bypass the
   fault LSP.  After that, the traffic is switched to the backup path
   from the working path.

4.2.3.  Faults in multi-domain

   There are three types of faults in multi-domain network, such as link
   or node failure within the domain, failure of a link at a domain
   border and failure of domain border node.  Inter-domain and Intra-
   domain restoration mechanisms are independent with each other.

4.2.3.1.  Faults within a domain

   When an intra-domain failure occurs, intra-domain restoration
   mechanism is set up first within a domain and the restoration scheme
   is similar to that of single domain in the scenario of multi-domain.
   Inter-domain restoration mechanism would be triggered only if the
   previous restoration mechanism fails.

   o  Reroute

   Detecting entities in transport plane detect related fault
   information when node or link failure occurs within a domain.
   Failure localization/isolation is triggered immediately after the
   failure detection.  And then the fault indication signaling is sent
   to the source node across intermediate domains through the GMPLS-
   based signaling or flooding method.  After receiving the fault
   indication signaling, the source node computes a new path by a series
   of routing algorithms and allocates the bandwidth.  Path and RESV
   signaling are responsible for path establishment and resource
   reservation respectively for the backup path.  After that, the
   traffic is switched to the backup path from the working path.

   o  Fast reroute

   In the same scenario above, detecting entities in transport plane
   detect related fault information when node or link failure occurs
   within a domain.  Failure localization/isolation is triggered
   immediately after the failure detection.  And then the fault

   indication signaling is sent to the local or segment PSL from the
   upstream node of failure link through the GMPLS-based signaling or
   flooding method.  These two notification methods are described in
   section 4.2.1.1.  After receiving the fault indication signaling,
   Path Switch LSR (PSL) is responsible for computing a new path by a
   series of routing algorithms and allocates the bandwidth to establish
   the backup path bypass the fault LSP.  After that, the traffic is
   switched to the backup path from the working path.

4.2.3.2.  Inter-domain faults

   Inter-domain faults comprise inter-domain link fault and border node
   fault of the domain.  Each domain has its own domain border node, and
   these two border nodes are connected by a TE link.  TE link is
   invalid once the border node fails.

   When the LSP traverses multiple domains and inter-domain failure
   occurs, the process of failure detection and localization/isolation
   is the same to that of single domain whose detail is described in
   section 4.2.1.  If the fault TE link is the only one between two
   domains, the restoration mechanism adopts the end-to-end reroute
   restoration scheme.  The fault indication signal is sent to source
   node by the upstream node along the LSP, and then the source node
   computes another path and allocates the resource avoiding the domain
   relative to the fault node and link.  Otherwise, the restoration
   mechanism could adopt either the reroute or the fast reroute scheme
   if there is more than one link between two domains.  Path and RESV
   signaling are responsible for path establishment and resource
   reservation respectively between PSL and ML.  After that, the traffic
   is switched to the backup path from the working path.


5.  Methodologies

   It is difficult to measure Detection time TDEF which depends on the
   monitoring technique and reversion is a normalization process.
   Therefore, the methodology of detection and reversion time are
   outside the scope of this document.

5.1.  Fault restoration in single domain network

   This section gives two measurement methods of fault restoration which
   are end-to-end reroute and fast reroute respectively in single domain
   network.  It is assumed that there exits an LSP (1-2-3-4) where data
   flow is from node 1 to node 4 as an example shown in figure 2 and 3.
   The link fault occurs between node 2 and node 3.

5.1.1.  Reroute

   Generally, when the failure occurs the methodology would proceed as
   follows:

   o  The node 3 sends Channelstatus Message to node 2 indicating the
      failure to the corresponding the upstream node.

   o  Record the timestamp (T1) when the first bit of Channelstatus
      Message is sent to the node 2 along the LSP.

   o  When node 2 receives the ChannelStatus message from node 3, it
      returns a ChannelStatusAck message back to node 3 and correlates
      the failure locally.  When Node 2 correlates the failure and
      verifies that the failure is clear, it has localized the failure
      to the data link between node 3 and node 2.  At that time, node 2
      sends a ChannelStatus message to node 3 indicating that the
      failure has been localized.

   o  Then record the timestamp (T2) when the last bit of ChannelStatus
      message from node 2 is received by node 3.

   o  The fault localization delay is T2-T1.

   o  The node 2 sends the notification information to the source
      node(node 1) of the LSP traversing intermediate nodes.  Then
      record the timestamp (T3) when the first bit of PathErr
      information is sent out.

   o  Record the timestamp (T4) when the node 1 receives the last bit of
      the PathErr Message.

   o  Notification delay is T4-T3.

   o  Record the timestamp (T5) after node receives the notification
      information.  Node 1 as the PSL computes a new path through either
      a series of route algorithms or pre-computed schemes.

   o  PATH and RESV signaling are responsible for path establishment
      request and resource reservation respectively for a new backup
      path.  Then the traffic is switched from a working path to the
      backup path.  Record the timestamp (T6) when the first packet of
      traffic arrives at the ML(node 4) through the backup path.

   o  Recovery time is T6-T5.

   o  The total fault restoration time is T2+T4+T6-T1-T3-T5.

5.1.2.  Fast Reroute

   Generally, when the failure occurs, the methodology would proceed as
   follows:

   o  The process of fault localization is similar to that of reroute
      restoration in single domain network which is described in section
      5.1.1.

   o  The fault localization delay is also T2-T1.

   o  PathErr information is sent to different PSL that differs from
      fast reroute restoration scheme.  Node 2 is the PSL as the ingress
      node of backup path if the span recovery scheme is adopted.
      Otherwise, consider other PSL as the ingress node of backup path
      if segment restoration scheme is implemented.

   o  Then record the timestamp (T3) when the first bit of notification
      information is sent out by the node 2 to the PSL which is
      responsible for switching over the traffic.

   o  Record the timestamp (T4) when the PSL receives the last bit of
      the notification information.

   o  Notification delay is T4-T3.

   o  Record the timestamp (T5) after PSL receives the PathErr Message.
      The PSL computes a new path through either a series of route
      algorithms or pre-computed scheme (eg. 1-2-5-3-4).

   o  PATH and RESV signaling are responsible for path establishment
      request and resource reservation respectively for the backup path.
      Then the traffic is switched from a working path to the backup
      path.  Record the timestamp (T6) when the first packet of traffic
      arrives at the ML(node 3) through the backup path.

5.2.1.  Reroute

   Figure 4 describes the node connection situation.  As illustrated
   node 1 and node 4 are in domain A and B respectively and node 2 and 3
   are all in domain B. Generally, when the failure occurs, the
   methodology would proceed as follows:

   o  The node 3 sends Channelstatus Message to node 2 indicating the
      failure to the corresponding upstream node.

   o  Record the timestamp (T1) when the first bit of Channelstatus
      Message is sent to the node 2 along the LSP.

   o  When node 2 receives the ChannelStatus message from node 3, it
      returns a ChannelStatusAck message back to node 3 and correlates
      the failure locally.  When Node 2 correlates the failure and
      verifies that the failure is clear, it has localized the failure
      to the data link between Node 3 and node 2.  At that time, Node 2
      sends a ChannelStatus message to Node 3 indicating that the
      failure has been localized.

   o  Then record the timestamp (T2) when the last bit of ChannelStatus
      message from node 2 is received by node 3.

   o  The fault localization delay is T2-T1.

   o  Node 2 sends the notification information to the source node of
      the LSP(node 1) traversing intra-domain nodes and border nodes.
      Notification time depends on whether the source and the
      destination node are in the same domain or not.  Then record the
      timestamp (T3) when the first bit of notification information is
      sent out.

   o  Record the timestamp (T4) when the node 1 receives the last bit of
      the notification information.

   o  Notification delay is T4-T3.

   o  Record the timestamp (T5) after node 1 receives the PathErr
      Message.  As the PSL, node 1 finds a new path through either a
      series of route algorithms or pre-computation scheme.

   o  PATH and RESV signaling are responsible for path establishment
      request and resource reservation respectively for a new backup
      path.  Then the traffic is switched from a working path to the
      backup path.  Record the timestamp (T6) when the first packet of
      traffic arrives at the destination node (node 4) through the
      backup path.

5.2.2.  Fast Reroute

   Figure 5 describes the nodes connection situation that is node 1 and
   node 4 are in domain A and B respectively and node 2 ,3 and 5 are all
   in domain B.

   Generally, when the failure occurs between node 2 and 3 in domain B,
   the methodology would proceed as follows:

   o  The process of fault localization is similar to that of reroute
      restoration in single domain network which is described in section
      5.1.2.  The fault localization delay is also T2-T1.

   o  Notification information is sent to different PSL that differs
      from fast reroute restoration scheme.  Node 2 is the PSL as the
      ingress node of restoration path if the span recovery scheme is
      adopted.  Otherwise, consider other PSL as the ingress node of
      restoration path if segment recovery scheme is implemented.

   o  Then record the timestamp (T3) when the first bit of notification
      information is sent out by the node 2 to the PSL which is
      responsible for switching over the traffic.

   o  Record the timestamp (T4) when the PSL receives the last bit of
      the PathERR message.

   o  Notification delay is T4-T3.

   o  Record the timestamp (T5) after PSL receives the PathErr Message.
      The PSL finds a new path through either a series of route
      algorithms or pre-computed schemes.

   o  PATH and RESV signaling are responsible for path establishment
      request and resource reservation respectively for a new backup
      path.  Then the traffic is switched from a working path(2-3) to
      the backup path(2-5-3).  Record the timestamp (T6) when the first
      packet of traffic arrives at the ML(node 3) through the backup
      path.

   o  Recovery time is T6-T5.

   o  The total fault restoration time is T2+T4+T6-T1-T3-T5.

   o  If the intra-domain fast reroute mechanism fails, reroute
      restoration is triggered whose methodology is illustrated in
      section 5.2.1.

   Figure 6 describes the node connection situation.  As illustrated
   node 1 and node 4 are in domain A and C respectively and node 2,3 and
   5 are all in domain B.

   Generally, when the failure between domain A and B occurs, the
   methodology would proceed as follows:

   o  The node 4 sends Channelstatus Message to node 3 indicating the
      failure to the corresponding upstream node.

   o  Record the timestamp (T1) when the first bit of Channelstatus
      Message is sent to the node 3 along the LSP.

   o  When node 3 receives the ChannelStatus message from node 4, it
      returns a ChannelStatusAck message back to node 4 and correlates
      the failure locally.  When Node 3 correlates the failure and
      verifies that the failure is clear, it has localized the failure
      to the data link between Node 3 and node 4.  At that time, Node 3
      sends a ChannelStatus message to Node 4 indicating that the
      failure has been localized.

   o  Record the timestamp (T2) when the last bit of ChannelStatus
      message from node 3 is received by node 4.

   o  The fault localization delay is T2-T1.

   o  Measurement method of notification delay is the same to that of
      fault reroute restoration within a domain in multi-domain network
      as described in section 5.2.1.

   o  Notification delay is T4-T3.

   o  Record the timestamp (T5) after node 1 receives the PathErr
      Message.  Node 1 as the PSL computes a new path through either a
      series of route algorithms or pre-computed scheme.  Consider to
      choose a backup path bypass the upstream domain of fault link if
      the fault link is the only link between domain B and domain C.

   o  PATH and RESV signaling are responsible for path establishment
      request and resource reservation respectively for a new backup
      path.  Then the traffic is switched from a working path to the
      backup path.  Record the timestamp (T6) when the first packet of
      traffic arrives at the destination node (node 4) through the
      backup path.

   o  Recovery time is T6-T5.

   o  The total fault restoration time is T2+T4+T6-T1-T3-T5.

6.  Protocol Extension Requirements

   It is assumed that clock of every control node is synchronous during
   the process of measurement.  Control plane reports different time to
   NMS(Network Management System) which is responsible for computing the
   sum of different fault restoration duration time.  LMP and RSVP
   extensions are required in order to record precise the start and end
   time in every restoration phrase.

   In the process of fault location measurement, detection entities send
   alarm information to upstream neighbor node through signaling of LMP
   when it detects the fault in control plane.  It is necessary to
   extend LMP by adding a FAULT_TIMESTAMP object as a timestamp in the
   ChannelStatus Message.  The FAULT_TIMESTAMP Object could be used to
   record the time when the signaling is sent and received to measure
   the precise fault location notification time.  Then when the fault
   notification is implemented, the fault indicating signal is delivered
   to the PSL through the PathErr signal of RSVP.  SEND_ERR_TIMESTAMP
   and RECEIVE_ERR_TIMESTAMP Objects are added in PathErr signal and
   defined to record the time of notification signal sent and received
   by upstream node next to the fault and PSL respectively.
