Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format
   for representing presence information for a presentity.  Presentities
   publish their presence information, typically towards presence
   agents.  PIDF has been extended to provide rich presence information,
   including, for example, the location of the presentity, their
   activities, mood, the capabilities of their user agents, etc.
   Presentities are willing to provide the description of available

   files at watcher's disposal.  This might be the case for photographs
   taken with a mobile device, a recorded lecture audio file, etc.  This
   document extends the PIDF to provide the syntax and format for the
   description of files within the PIDF.

Internet-Draft          File Descriptions in PIDF              June 2007


1.  Introduction

   Presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to
   communicate with other users on the network.  Historically, presence
   has been limited to "on-line" and "off-line" indicators, although the
   current trend allows to model a number of events in the presence
   information.

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) [RFC3863] defines a
   common presence data format for Common Profiles for Instant Messaging
   (CPIM) [RFC3860] and Presence (CPP) [RFC3859].

   The PIDF has been extended and adapted to work with SIP.  The Data
   Model for Presence [RFC4479] defines the underlying presence data
   model used by Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] for Instant
   Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) presence
   agents.  The presence data model structures the presence information
   of the PIDF in three components: the person, the service, and the
   device.

   On the other hand, there are scenarios where a user has a number of
   available files stored in an endpoint.  The user wants to make some
   of these files for public or private disposal.  One of these cases
   is, for example, when Alice takes some pictures with her camera phone
   and she wants to share them within a community.

   This document extends the PIDF, or more precise, it extends the
   device component of the presence data model, to allow the inclusion
   of a description of available files.  A presentity who publishes
   presence information can include a description of one or more files
   that are at a watcher's disposal for its downloading.

   The extension allows the publication of files that are "available" at
   that particular device.  For example, if a user has stored a few
   images in his phone, and he wants to advertise them through his
   presence information to his watchers, he would not use the service
   nor the person components of the presence data model because these
   images are not tied to any service or person.  Rather, these images
   are only available in the particular device that the presentity is
   describing in the device component of the presence data model.

   This can also be seen through a multiple device scenario.  Assume a
   user who has some images stored in his phone.  He is publishing his
   presence information from two devices: a laptop and a phone.

   The presence publication done from his phone contains a <device>
   component (in the PIDF) that represents the phone itself.  The file
   descriptors of those pictures are also included in the <device>

   element.  On the other hand, the presence publication done from his
   laptop will not contain those files representing the pictures, since
   they are not available in the laptop.  Then, a presence compositor
   can appropriately compose the presence information to watchers,
   potentially signalling the two devices for the same presentity, as
   separated devices, one including files for pictures.

   The extension defined in this document is fully compatible (in fact,
   it is exactly the same) with the 'file' event package
   [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-event-package].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.


3.  File descriptions in PIDF

   The 'file' event package [I-D.garcia-sipping-file-event-package]
   defines a 'file-metadata' document that is and XML document compliant
   with its XML schema.  We embed a 'file-metadata' XML document in the
   'device' component of the presence data model because files are
   highly coupled with the actual devices that the user is using.
   Unfortunately, the XML schema does not provide the means to
   normatively indicate that 'file-metadata' documents can be included
   in the 'device' component of the presence data model that is part of
   a PIDF document.  However, we provide the following example:

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
       xmlns:dm="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:data-model"
       xmlns:fd="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:file"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
       <tuple id="sg89ae">
        <status>
         <basic>open</basic>
        </status>
        <dm:deviceID>mac:8asd7d7d70</dm:deviceID>
        <contact>sip:someone@example.com</contact>
       </tuple>
       <dm:person id="p1">
       </dm:person>
       <dm:device id="pc122">
