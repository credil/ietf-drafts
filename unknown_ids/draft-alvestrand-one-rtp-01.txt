Internet-Draft         Single RTP Session Grouping           August 2011


1.  Introduction

   In the work with the RTCWEB specifications
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview], a need was discovered for representing
   within the SDP framework an SDP session consisting of a single RTP
   session, where that single RTP session, mapped to a single transport
   flow, contained multiple top-level data types.

   This is advantageous for the use case where there is no desire for
   different treatment by the network of the different flows in the
   session, there exist other appropriate mechanisms (for instance based
   on SSRC) to identify the flows in the session to the applications,
   and where the handling of multiple RTP sessions would increase the
   work required to establish the session (for instance by requiring
   multiple ICE [RFC5245] negotiations, or handling of failure cases
   where one RTP session is established and another is not).

   This document describes how to represent such a session.


2.  Requirements for a solution

   The requirements for our representation are:

   o  It should be possible to represent an SDP session consisting of a
      single RTP session, where that session carries both audio and
      video.

   o  If this description is presented in an Offer in the offer/answer
      model to an entity that does not understand it, the resulting
      Answer should contain a valid description of an SDP session
      consisting of one video RTP session and one audio RTP session.


3.  SDP Grouping Framework Parameter

   This document defines a new semantics extension called TOGETHER
   within the SDP Grouping framework [RFC5888].

   If this semantics extension is present in an SDP Session-level
   a=group: line, the semantics are that the two or more m lines are
   intended to be read as components of a single RTP session, creating a
   single SSRC numbering space that can contain components of all the
   types described in the referenced media sections.

   The following properties of the media sections are REQUIRED:





Alvestrand              Expires February 18, 2012               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Single RTP Session Grouping           August 2011


   o  The defined RTPMAP values of the section MUST NOT overlap

   o  The "proto" profile of the sections MUST be the same (e.g RTP/
      AVPF)

   The media sections MAY contain connection data (port numbers or ICE
   parameters), but some of these may be ignored in processing (see next
   section).

   The reason for the requirement for systematic proto is that there are
   many combinations that don't make sense (for instance "RTP/AVPF" in
   one section and "RTP/SAVP" in another would make encryption and
   availability of TMMBR depend on the outcome of negotiation, which
   seems strange).  The cases where combinations make sense (RTP/AVPF
   with UDP/FEC for instance) also usually require that separate RTP
   sessions be used.  [[QUESTION IN DRAFT: Are there sensible
   combinations?]]


4.  Use in Offer/Answer

   This extension MAY be included in a Offer; as specified in RFC 5888
   section 9 when describing SIP usage, if it is not included in an
   Offer, it MUST NOT be included in an answer.

   If the responder understands the semantics of the TOGETHER extension,
   the parameters of the first section MUST be used to establish the RTP
   session, and the parameters for the other sections MUST be ignored.

   The following parameters are taken from the first section only:

   o  Port number from the m= line

   o  All media-level attributes defined in RFC 5245 section 15.1 - this
      includes "candidate", "remote-candidates", "ice-mismatch", "ice-
      ufrag", "ice-pwd"

   The bandwidth of the "m" line is treated specially: The values for
   all "m=" lines in the group are added together, and the resulting
   value is taken to be the negotiated bandwidth value for the RTP
   session.

   The expected behaviour when the extension is present in an offer and
   not understood is that the generated answer will not contain the
   "a=group:TOGETHER" line, and that each sections' parameters will be
   used.

   If the answerer wishes to refuse an entire m= section, while

Internet-Draft         Single RTP Session Grouping           August 2011


   accepting the RTP session otherwise, he MAY indicate this by setting
   the port number of the relevant section to zero.  In all other cases,
   the port number of second and subsequent sections is to be ignored.

   The answerer cannot refuse the first m= section and establish the
   call.  [[NOTE IN DRAFT: This could be relaxed by allowing it when ICE
   is in use, or saying that the first non-zero port number is used.
   Both lead to nonobvious edge cases.  Is the extra complexity worth
   it?]]


5.  Parameter combining

   The general approach taken when combining the sections is to treat
   the parameters as if they were all contained in the same section.
   However, a number of special considerations have to apply.

   o  For the "a=rtpmap" lines, their interpretation depends on the "m="
      line they occur under, even after combination; "a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/
      8000" needs to carry the info that it occured under an "m=audio"
      line.

   o  For parameters that can only occur once in a section, such as the
      port number from the m= line, the occurence of the parameter that
      comes from the first section needs to take precedence.

   o  The "b=" (bandwidth) line needs to be considered specially, since
      the values are to be added together.

   o  Media-level ICE attributes need to come from the first section
      only, even though syntax would allow more occurences.

   [[QUESTION IN DRAFT: Should we instead say that "all lines come from
   the first section except a=rtpmap amd b= lines?  Is there a case for
   other parameters that need to be in second-and-subsequent sections?]]


6.  Interaction with other extensions

   If other extensions modify the bandwidth calculation algorithm, those
   extensions will have to take into consideration how bandwidth from
   multiple sections of the SDP description should be merged.


7.  RTCP bandwidth considerations

   A concern has been raised that when audio and video are combined, the
   bandwidth of RTCP reports required for an audio stream may exceed the



Alvestrand              Expires February 18, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Single RTP Session Grouping           August 2011


   bandwidth of the audio stream itself, which seems a bit bizarre.
   While not critical (overall RTCP bandwidth is still limited to 5% of
   the total bandwidth), this warrants a little more study.

   Considering a combined RTP session with one sender and one recipient,
   four 1-Mbit/sec video flows and four 100-Kbit/sec audio flows flowing
   in one direction.

   The total bandwidth is 4.4 Mbit/sec, so if the RTCP share of the
   bandwidth is 5% as recommended by [RFC3550] section 6.2, the RTCP
   bandwidth limit is 220 Kbits/sec.  Eight SSRCs need to be reported
   on.

   [CHECK: Does this mean there are 9 reporters (8 senders and 1
   receiver), or 2 reporters (1 of each)?  Assuming 9.]

   Each report sender will have 24.4 Kbits/second of RTCP bandwidth at
   its disposal.  Assuming a packet size of 100 bytes (11 bytes per SSRC
   reported on), the maximum RTCP rate allowed is 30 RTCP packets per
   second, which is slightly slower than the typical audio heartbeat
   flow of 50 packets per second (20 ms interval).

   If this is deemed excessive, one can adopt the RTP/AVPF model of
   5-second regular RTCP reports with additional availability of "on-
   demand" RTCP packets.  But the RTCP feedback interval also enters
   into congestion control algorithms, which may complicate the picture.


8.  Examples

   The examples are taken from RFC 4317, "SDP Offer/Answer Examples".

   This is a request to have both audio and video sent over port 49170.
   If this can't be done, audio will be sent over port 49170, and video
   will be sent on port 51372.  The total bandwidth, if combined, is
   1200 Kbits/second; if separated, 200 Kbits goes to audio and 1000
   Kbits goes to video.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the new SDP Grouping semantic
   extension called TOGETHER.


10.  Security Considerations

   No new security issues have been raised specifically for this
   extension.

   Third-party interceptors that sniff negotiation but do not understand
   the extension may end up listening to the wrong port number for some
   of the media flows.  This is not deemed greatly harmful.

A.1.  From draft-alvestrand-one-rtp-00 to -01

   Added change log and "other matters" appendix.

   Added section on parameter combining.

   Added an example for an entity that does not understand grouping.

   Added port-zero and no-codecs methods for refusing a section.


Appendix B.  Other matters

   This appendix is not normative.

   A number of matters have been raised in discussion on this draft.
   Some of the discussions have led to actual changes, others have
   pointed to the need to identify other documents as authoritative on
   these issues.  This appendix serves to collect such matters.

B.1.  RTCP session establishment

   This document does not specify anything about RTCP sessions.  Since a
   purpose of the specification is to minimize the number of transport
   connections, it's natural to use the "a=rtcp-mux" attribute defined
   in [RFC5761], but this document does not specify anything about that
   matter.

   If the TOGETHER extension is successfully negotiated, there will be
   only one RTCP session for the RTP session described by the TOGETHER
   group.

   Since the purpose of this extension is to have multiple SSRCs on one
   RTP session, it may be more important than usual to get SSRC
   metainformation such as CNAME quicly; this can be done by using the
   recommendation in [RFC6051]to send an RTCP SR at once when starting
   the flow, and the recipient can use the RTCP-SR-REQ defined in the
   same document to request an RTCP SR if the initial one is lost.

B.2.  Renegotiation

   After the session has been established, there might occur a need to
   change its parameters.  At the moment, no issues that are different
   from the issues for a session that does not use TOGETHER have been
   identified.

   If a renegotiation mechanism that uses SDP fragments, rather than
   whole SDP descriptors, is developed, there might be a need for



Alvestrand              Expires February 18, 2012              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Single RTP Session Grouping           August 2011


   specifying that all the fragments included in the TOGETHER group are
   sent together.  This will have to wait for the development of such a
   mechanism.

B.3.  ICE negotiation sequence

   When an SDP agent sends out an offer using TOGETHER and ICE, it must
   choose one of two strategies:

   o  List ICE parameters for all sections.  This means that candidate
      gathering and opening of local ports must happen before the SDP
      can be generated, and some of the ports get closed, unused, after
      the answer has been received.  Since the generation of candidates
      may involve negotiation with a remote server such as a TURN
      server, this may be an expensive proposition.

   o  List ICE parameters for only the first section.  If the TOGETHER
      extension is not understood, this will lead to only the first
      section's RTP session being established.  It is up to the
      application whether or not to consider this to be a call failure.

   The choice between these two options is left as a local matter.

   The offerer may also choose to send out ICE probes on either one port
   or all ports even before the answer comes back, in order to speed up
   connection establishment; this too is left as a local matter.

B.4.  SDP-inspecting intermediaries

   There may exist intermediaries that inspect, but do not modify, the
   SDP flow, and take some action based on what they parse there.

   Such intermediaries are architecturally unsound in general (if they
   really are needed, they should be explicit participants and be able
   to refuse to carry the extension they don't understand; if not, their
   working is of no concern to the callers), but they still exist.

   In the RTCWEB use case, they may have more problems existing, since
   the negotiation will normally be carried over encrypted HTTPS
   connections.  In other cases, where negotiation is done in the clear,
   they may be more common.
