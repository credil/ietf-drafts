      A Lightweight Approach to Node-to-Node Security in Diameter
                    draft-zorn-dime-n2n-sec-lite-00

Abstract

   This document describes a lightweight method for cryptographically
   protecting a portion of the contents of a Diameter message in transit
   between an arbitrary pair of Diameter nodes.  The scheme assumes that
   the destination node possesses an X.509 certificate containing an RSA
   public key and that that certificate is retrievable by the node
   originating the message through a DNS query.

   In addition to describing the operation of the protocol, this note
   specifies an Attribute-Value Pair (AVP) for the encapsulation of
   encrypted AVPs.

Internet-Draft      Node-to-Node Security in Diameter       October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Historically, Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
   network traffic has been secured on a hop-by-hop basis: messages
   between AAA entities (such as Diameter clients, agents and servers)
   have been protected on the wire but those entities have had
   unfettered access to the message contents.  This has not typically
   been considered to be a concern when all of the entities in question
   were within the same sphere of administrative control, but may be
   problematic if the messages pass through an outside system (for
   example, an agent residing in an intermediate domain in a roaming
   situation).  This document describes a lightweight method for
   cryptographically protecting a portion of the contents of a Diameter
   message while in transit between an arbitrary pair of Diameter nodes.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Operation

   The following sections describe the operation of the proposed end-to-
   end security scheme.  Although key establishment and data transfer
   are discussed separately, both will usually take place in the same
   message.

3.1.  Client Operation

3.1.1.  Key Establishment

   TBC.

3.1.2.  Protected Data Transfer

   TBC.

3.2.  Server Operation

3.2.1.  Key Establishment

   TBC.

   [RFC3588] are also applicable to this document.
