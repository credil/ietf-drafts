   Abstract 

      There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress Label 
      Switching Router (LSR) to receive binding of the Resource 
      ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engineered (RSVP-TE) Label Switched  
      Path (LSP) to an application, and payload identification, using 
      some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This document proposes 
      protocol mechanisms to address this requirement. The procedures 
      described in this document are equally applicable for point-to- 
      point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.

1. Introduction 

      When RSVP-TE is used for applications like MVPN [MVPN] and VPLS 
      [VPLS], an Egress LSR receives the binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to 
      an application, and payload identification, using an "out-of-
      band" (OOB) mechanism (e.g., using BGP). In such cases, the 
      Egress LSR cannot make correct forwarding decision until such OOB 
      mapping information is received. Furthermore, in order to apply 
      the binding information, the Egress LSR needs to identify the 
      incoming LSP on which traffic is coming. Therefore, non 
      Penultimate Hop Popping (non-PHP) behavior is required to apply 
      OOB mapping.  
    
      There are other applications that require non-PHP behavior. When 
      RSVP-TE P2MP LSPs are used to carry IP multicast traffic non-PHP 
      behavior enables a leaf LSR to identify the P2MP TE LSP, on which 
      traffic is received. Hence the egress LSR can determine whether 
      traffic is received on the expected P2MP LSP and discard traffic 
      that is not received on the expected P2MP LSP. Non-PHP behavior 
      is also required to determine the context of upstream assigned 
      labels when the context is a MPLS LSP. Non-PHP behavior may also 
      be required for MPLS-TP LSPs [RFC5921]. 
       
      This document defines two new flags in the Attributes Flags TLV 
      of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC5420]: one flag for 
      communication of non-PHP behavior, and one flag to indicate that 
      the binding of the LSP to an application and payload identifier 
      (payload-Id) needs to be learned via an out-of-band mapping 
      mechanism. The procedures described in this document are equally 
      applicable for P2P and P2MP LSPs. Specification of the OOB 
      communication mechanism(s) is beyond the scope of this document. 
        
2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

      This section describes the signaling extensions required to 
      address the above-mentioned requirements.  

2.1. Signaling non-PHP behavior 

      In order to request non-PHP behavior for an RSVP-TE LSP, this 
      document defines a new flag in the Attributes Flags TLV of the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC5420]: 
                        
                        
                    Expires October 2011                     [Page 3] 

   Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-07.txt 
       

      Bit Number 6 (TBD): non-PHP behavior flag.  

      An Ingress LSR sets the "non-PHP behavior flag" to signal the 
      egress LSRs SHOULD assign non-NULL label for the LSP being 
      signaled.  This flag MUST NOT be modified by any other LSRs in 
      the network. LSRs other than the Egress LSRs SHOULD ignore this 
      flag.  
       
      When signaling a P2MP LSP, a source node may wish to solicit 
      individual response to "non-PHP behavior flag" from the leaf 
      nodes. Given the constraints on how the LSP_ATTRIBUTES may be 
      carried in Path and Resv Messages according to RFC5420, in this 
      situation a source node MUST use a separate Path message for 
      each leaf. 
       
      If an egress LSR receiving the Path message, supports the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and the Attributes Flags TLV, and also 
      recognizes the "non-PHP behavior flag", it MUST allocate a non-
      NULL local label. The egress LSR MUST also include the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object with "non-PHP behavior flag" set in the 
      Resv message. For this purpose, as defined in RFC5420, the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object is placed in the flow descriptor and is 
      associated with the FILTER_SPEC object that precedes it. 
       
      If the egress LSR  

      - supports the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object but does not recognize the 
         Attributes Flags TLV; or  

      - supports the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and recognize the Attributes 
         Flags TLV, but does not recognize "non-PHP behavior flag";  

      then it SHOULD silently ignore this request. 

      An ingress LSR requesting non-PHP behavior SHOULD examine Resv 
      message for presence of "Non-PHP behavior flag" in the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object. An ingress LSR requesting non-PHP behavior 
      MAY send a Path Tear to the Egress which has not included the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in the Resv or which has included the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in Resv but has not set the "Non-PHP 
      behavior flag" in it. An ingress LSR requesting non-PHP behavior 
      MAY also examine the label value corresponding to the Egress 
      LSR(s) in the RRO, and MAY send a Path Tear to the Egress which 
      assigns a Null label value.

2.2. Signaling OOB Mapping Indication 

      This document defines a single flag to indicate that the normal 
      binding mechanism of an RSVP session is overridden.  The actual 
      out of band mappings are beyond the scope of this document.  The      
      flag is carried in the Attributes Flags TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES 
      object defined in [RFC5420] and is defined as follows:  
       

      Bit Number 7 (TBD): OOB mapping flag.  

       
      An Ingress LSR sets the OOB mapping flag to signal the Egress LSR 
      that binding of RSVP-TE LSP to an application and payload 
      identification is being signaled out of band. This flag MUST NOT 
      be modified by any other LSRs in the network. LSRs other than the 
      Egress LSRs SHOULD ignore this flag.  
       
      When signaling a P2MP LSP, a source node may wish to solicit 
      individual response to "OOB mapping flag" from the leaf nodes. 
      Given the constraints on how the LSP_ATTRIBUTES may be carried in 
      Path and Resv Messages according to RFC5420, in this situation a 
      source node MUST use a separate Path message for each leaf. 
       
      If an egress LSR receiving the Path message, supports the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and the Attributes Flags TLV, and also 
      recognizes the "OOB mapping flag", it MUST include the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object with "OOB mapping flag" set in the Resv 
      message. For this purpose, as defined in RFC5420, the 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object is placed in the flow descriptor and is 
      associated with the FILTER_SPEC object that precedes it.  
       
      The rest of the RSVP signaling proceeds as normal.  However, the 
      LSR MUST have received the OOB mapping before accepting traffic 
      on the LSP.  This implies that the egress LSR MUST NOT setup 
      forwarding state for the LSP before it receives the OOB mapping.  
       
      Note that the payload information SHOULD be supplied by the OOB 
      mapping. If the egress LSR receives the payload information from 
      OOB mapping then the LSR MUST ignore L3PID in the Label Request 
      Object [RFC3209]. 
    
      If the egress LSR  

      - supports the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object but does not recognize the 
         Attributes Flags TLV; or  

                        
                        
                    Expires October 2011                     [Page 5] 


   Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-07.txt 
       

      - supports the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and recognizes the 
         Attributes Flags TLV, but does not recognize the "OOB mapping 
         flag"; 

      then it SHOULD silently ignore this request.  

      An ingress LSR requesting OOB mapping SHOULD examine Resv message 
      for presence of "OOB mapping flag" in in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES 
      object. An ingress LSR requesting OOB mapping MAY send a Path 
      Tear to the Egress which has not included the LSP_ATTRIBUTES 
      object in the Resv or which has included the LSP_ATTRIBUTES 
      object in Resv but has not set the " OOB mapping flag" in it. 

       
      In deploying applications where Egress LSR receives the binding 
      of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload identification, 
      using OOB mechanism, it is important to recognize that OOB 
      mapping is sent asynchronously w.r.t. signaling of RSVP-TE LSP.  
      Egress LSR only installs forwarding state for the LSP after it 
      receives the OOB mapping. In deploying applications using OOB 
      mechanism, ingress LSR may need to know when egress is properly 
      setup for forwarding (i.e., has received OOB mapping). How 
      ingress LSR determines that LSR is properly setup for forwarding 
      at the Egress LSR is beyond the scope of this document. 
      Nonetheless, if OOB mapping is not received by the egress LSR 
      within a reasonable time, a procedure to tear down the LSP is 
      defined in section 2.4.   
       

2.3. Relationship between OOB and non-PHP flags 

      "Non-PHP behavior desired" and "OOB mapping indication" flags can 
      appear and be processed independently of each other. However, as 
      mentioned earlier, in the context of applications discussed in 
      this document, OOB mapping require non-PHP behavior. An Ingress 
      LSR requesting OOB mapping MAY also set "non-PHP behavior flag" 
      in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in the Path message.  

2.4. Egress Procedure for label binding 

      RSVP-TE signaling completion and the OOB mapping information 
      reception happen asynchronously at the Egress. As mentioned in 
      Section 2, Egress waits for the OOB mapping before accepting 
      traffic on the LSP.  

      In order to avoid unnecessary use of the resources and possible 
      black-holing of traffic, an Egress LSR MAY send a Path Error

   Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-07.txt 
       

      message if the OOB mapping information is not received within a 
      reasonable time. This Path Error message will include the error 
      code/sub-code "Notify Error/ no OOB mapping received" for all 
      affected LSPs. If notify request was included when the LSP was 
      initially setup, Notify message (as defined in [RFC3473]) MAY 
      also be used for delivery of this information to the Ingress LSR. 
      An Egress LSR MAY implement a cleanup timer for this purpose. The 
      time-out value is a local decision at the Egress, with a 
      RECOMMENDED default value of 60 seconds.  

3. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any new security issues above 
      those identified in [RFC2205], [RFC3209], [RFC3473], [RFC5420] 
      and [RFC4875]. 

    
4. IANA Considerations 

4.1. Attribute Flags for LSP_ATTRIBUTES object 

      The following new flags are being defined for the Attributes 
      Flags TLV in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  The numeric values are 
      to be assigned by IANA. 

      o  Non-PHP behavior flag - Bit Number 6 (Suggested value). 

      o  OOB mapping flag - Bit Number 7 (Suggested value). 

      o  These flags are to be used in the Attributes Flags TLV in both 
         Path and Resv messages.  

      For Error Code = 25 "Notify Error" (see [RFC3209]) the following 
      sub-code is defined. 
       
            Sub-code                    Value 
            --------                    ----- 
       
            No OOB mapping received     12 (TBD)
