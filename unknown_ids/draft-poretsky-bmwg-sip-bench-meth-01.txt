1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, conforming to RFC 2119 [1] and indicate
   requirement levels for compliant implementations.

   Terms specific to SIP Performance benchmarking are defined in [Po06].

   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the intent
   of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.  The term Throughput is defined in RFC 2544.


2.  Introduction

   This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology
   document [Po06].  The methodology and terminology are to be used for
   benchmarking signaling plane performance with varying signaling and
   media load.  Both scale and establishment rate are measured by
   signaling plane performance.

   The SIP Devices to be benchmarked may be a single device under test
   (DUT) or a system under test (SUT).  The DUT is a SIP Server, which
   may be any RFC 3261 [Ro02] conforming device.  The SUT can be any
   device or group of devices containing RFC 3261 conforming
   functionality along with Firewall and/or NAT functionality.  This
   enables benchmarks to be obtained and compared for different types of
   devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF, Proxy Server paired
   with a Firewall/NAT device, and P-CSCF paired with a Firewall/NAT
   device.  SIP Associated Media benchmarks can also be made when
   testing SUTs.

   The test cases covered in this methodology document provide
   benchmarks metrics of Registration Rate, SIP Session Setup Rate,
   Session Capacity, IM Rate, and Presence Rate.  These can be
   benchmarked with or without associated Media.  Some cases are also
   included to cover Forking, Loop detecion, Encrypted SIP, and SIP
   Flooding.  The test topologies that can be used are described in the
   Test Setup section.  Topologies are provided for benchmarking of a
   DUT or SUT.  Benchmarking with Associated Media can be performed when
   using a SUT.

   SIP permits a wide range of configuration options that are also
   explained in the Test Setup section.  Benchmark metrics could

   possibly be impacted by Associated Media.  The selected values for
   Session Duration and Media Streams per Session enable benchmark
   metrics to be benchmarked without Associated Media.  Session Setup
   Rate could possibly be impacted by the selected value for Maximum
   Sessions Attempted.  The benchmark for Session Setup Rate is measured
   with a fixed value for Maximum Sessions Attempted.


3.  Test Setup

3.1.  Test Topologies

   Figures 1 through 5 below provide various topologies to perform the
   SIP Performance Benchmarking.  These figures show the Device Under
   Test (DUT) to be a single server or a System Under Test (SUT).  Test
   Topology options to include benchmarking with Associated Media
   require use of a SUT and are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

3.2.  Test Considerations

3.2.1.  Selection of SIP Transport Protocol
   Discussion:
      Test cases may be performed with any transport protocol supported
      by SIP.  This includes, but is not limited to, SIP TCP, SIP UDP,
      and TLS.  The protocol used for the SIP transport protocol must be
      reported with benchmarking results.


3.2.2.  Server
   Discussion:
      The Server is a SIP-speaking device that complies with RFC 3261.
      The purpose of this document is to benchmark SIP performance, not
      conformance.  Conformance to RFC 3261 [Ro02] is assumed for all
      tests.  The Server may be the DUT or a component of a SUT that
      includes Firewall and/or NAT functionality.  The components of the
      SUT may be a single physical device or separate devices.


3.2.3.  Associated Media
   Discussion:
      Some tests may require associated media to be present for each SIP
      session.  The Server is not involved in the forwarding of media.
      Associated Media can be benchmarked only with a SUT in which the
      media traverses a Firewall, NAT, or Firewall NAT device.The test
      topologies to be used when benchmarking SUT performance for
      Associated Media are shown in Figures 4 and 5.


3.2.4.  Selection of Associated Media Protocol
   Discussion:
      The test cases specified in this document provide SIP performance
      independent of the protocol used for the media stream.  Any media
      protocol supported by SIP may be used.  This includes, but is not
      limited to, RTP, RTSP, and SRTP.  The protocol used for Associated
      Media must be reported with benchmarking results.


3.2.5.  Number of Associated Media Streams per SIP Session
   Discussion:
      Benchmarking results may vary with the number of media streams per
      SIP session.  When benchmarking a SUT for voice, a single media
      stream is used.  When benchmarking a SUT for voice and video, two
      media streams are used.  The number of Associated Media Streams
      must be reported with benchmarking results.

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology             July 2007




3.2.6.  Session Duration
   Discussion:
      SUT performance benchmarks may vary with the duration of SIP
      sessions.  Session Duration must be reported with benchmarking
      results.  A Session Duration of zero seconds indicates
      transmission of a BYE immediately following successful SIP
      establishment indicate by receipt of a 200 OK.  An infinite
      Session Duration indicates that a BYE is never transmitted.


3.2.7.  Attempted Sessions per Second
   Discussion:
      DUT and SUT performance benchmarks may vary with the the rate of
      attempted sessions offered by the Tester.  Attempted Sessions per
      Second must be reported with benchmarking results.


3.2.8.  Stress Testing
   Discussion:
      The purpose of this document is to benchmark SIP performance, not
      system stability under stressful conditions such as a high rate of
      Attempted Sessions per Second.


3.3.  Reporting Format

   Maximum Retransmits = _______________________________

   Mean Session Setup Delay = __________________________

   Mean Session Disconnect Delay = ______________________


4.  Test Cases

4.1.  Maximum Session Attempt Rate
   Objective:
      To benchmark the maximum session attempt rate of the DUT/SUT with
      zero failures.
   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
          SUT as shown in Figures 2 or 3.
      2.  Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate =
          100 SPS, Session Duration = 0 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted
          = 100,000 and media streams per session=0.
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          DUT.
      4.  Measure Failed Session Attempts and Total Sessions Established
          at the Tester.
      5.  If a Failed Session Attempt is recorded then reduce the
          Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.
      6.  If no Failed Session Attempt is recorded then increase the
          Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.
      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Maximum Session
          Establishment Rate is obtained.
   Expected Results:

4.2.  Maximum Session Attempt Rate with Media
   Objective:
      To benchmark the maximum session establishment rate of the SUT
      with zero failures when Associated Media is included in the
      benchmark test.
   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the SUT in the test topology shown in Figure 4 or 5.
      2.  Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate =
          100 SPS, Session Duration = 30 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted
          = 100,000 and media streams per session = 1.  The rate of
          offered load for each media stream SHOULD be (eq 1) Offered
          Load per Media Stream = Throughput / Maximum Sessions
          Attempted, where Throughput is defined in [Ba99].
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          SUT and transmit media through the SUT to a destination other
          than the server.

      4.  At the Tester measure Failed Session Attempts, Total Sessions
          Established, and Packet Loss [Ba99] of the media.
      5.  If a Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then
          reduce the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by
          50%.
      6.  If no Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then
          increase the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester
          by 50%.
      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Setup Rate is
          obtained.
      8.  Repeat steps 1 through 7 for multimedia in which media streams
          per session = 2.
   Expected Results:
      Maximum Session Establishment Rate results obtained with
      Associated Media with any number of media streams per SIP session
      will be identical to the Session Setup Rate results obtained
      without media.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
          the SUT as shown in Figure 2.
      2.  Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate =
          100 SPS, Session Duration = 0 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted
          = 100,000, Associated Media Streams per session = 0, and SIP
          INVITE Message Flood = 500 per second.
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          SUT and SIP Flood targetted at the Server.

      4.  At the Tester measure Failed Session Attempts, Total Sessions
          Established, and Packet Loss [Ba99] of the media.
      5.  If a Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then
          reduce the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by
          50%.
      6.  If no Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then
          increase the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester
          by 50%.
      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Setup Rate is
          obtained.
      8.  Repeat steps 1 through 7 with SIP INVITE Message Flood = 1000
          per second.
   Expected Results:  Session Setup Rate results obtained with SIP
      Flooding may be degraded.

4.9.  Maximum Registration Rate


4.10.  Maximum IM Rate


4.11.  Maximum Presence Rate


4.12.  Maximum Session Establishment Rate
   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Capacity of the SUT with Associated
      Media.
   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
          SUT as shown in Figures 2 or 3.
      2.  Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate =
          Zero-Failure Session Setup Rate, Session Duration = 0 sec,
          Maximum Sessions Attempted = 10,000 and media streams per
          session = 0.
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          DUT.
      4.  Measure Failed Session Attempts, Total Sessions Established,
          and Packet Loss [Ba99] at the Tester.
      5.  If a Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then
          reduce the Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the Tester
          by 5,000.
      6.  If no Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then
          increase the Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the
          Tester by 10,000.
      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Capacity is
          obtained.

      8.  Repeat steps 1 through 7 for multimedia in which media streams
          per session = 2.
   Expected Results:

4.13.  Maximum Session Establishment Rate with media
   Objective:
      To benchmark the Maximum Session Establishment Rate of the DUT/SUT
      with associated media.
   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
          SUT as shown in Figures 2 or 3.
      2.  Configure Tester for SIP UDP with a Session Attempt Rate = 100
          SPS, Session Duration = 30 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted =
          100,000 and media streams per session = 1.  The rate of
          offered load for each media stream SHOULD be (eq 1) Offered
          Load per Media Stream = Throughput / Maximum Sessions
          Attempted, where Throughput is defined in [Ba99].
      3.  Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
          SUT and transmit media through the SUT to a destination other
          than the server.
      4.  Measure Failed Session Attempts and Total Sessions Established
          at the Tester.
      5.  If a Failed Session Attempt is recorded then reduce the
          Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the Tester by 5,000.
      6.  If no Failed Session Attempt is recorded then increase the
          Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the Tester by 10,000.
      7.  Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Capacity is
          obtained.
   Expected Results:  Session establishment rate results obtained with
      Associated Media with any number of media streams per SIP session
      will be identical to the Session Capacity results obtained without
      media.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.


6.  Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to production networks.
   Security threats and how to counter these in SIP and the media layer
   is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and RFC3711 and various other
   drafts.  This document attempts to formalize a set of common
   methodology for benchmarking performance of SIP devices in a lab
