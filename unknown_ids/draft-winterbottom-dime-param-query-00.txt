Internet-Draft          Diameter Parameter Query            October 2009


Abstract

   In an emergency services environment a Location Information Server
   (LIS) receives requests from end hosts, SIP proxies or Public Safety
   Answering Points (PSAPs).  When receiving these requests a LIS has to
   perform a location determination procedure that depends on the
   specific network deployment.  In any case, an interation with other
   network elements is needed, particularly with AAA servers, that store
   information about the current attachment of the end host.

   This document descirbes a Diameter application, called Diameter
   Parameter Query, which allows a Location Information Server to
   interact with a Diameter server to obtain information needed for the
   location determination procedure.  The style of the described
   Diameter application offers flexibility for different deployments.

Internet-Draft          Diameter Parameter Query            October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The AAA backend infrastructure stores information about various
   device related interactions, such as network attachments, accounting
   streams, etc.  In certain cases, parts of this information needs to
   be shared with other entities in the operators network to provide
   smooth network operation.  An example of this interaction is when a
   Location Server is deployed in an IP-based network and needs to
   obtain information about the users point of attachment to make
   location information for emergency services.  This document describes
   how such a Diameter based interface can help a location server to
   query inforation from the backend infrastructure.  In particular, it
   allows the query to contain the IP address of the device and to
   request information about

   Figure 1 shows an example of how the Diameter interface used in this
   document can be used by a Location Server receiving a request to
   query a Diameter Server.

1.1.  Application Identifiers

   This specification defines a Diameter applications and their
   respective Application Identifiers:

      Diameter Parameter Query   (DPQ)  TBD by IANA

Internet-Draft          Diameter Parameter Query            October 2009


   The DPQ Application Identifier is used when a Diameter client
   utilizes the Diameter Parameter Query Request and Response messages.

1.2.  Session Management

   The Diameter server is stateless in the protocol interaction
   described by this document.  As such, the Session-Termination-Request
   (STR), the Session-Termination-Answer (STA), Abort-Session-Request
   (ASR) nor the Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message is used by this
   Diameter application.

1.3.  Accounting

   This Diameter application does not make use of accounting.  Hence,
   the Accounting-Request and the Accounting-Answer message is not used.

1.4.  Command Codes

   The DQP application uses two command codes as shown below.

   Command-Name          Abbrev. Code  Reference    Application
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Diameter-PQ-Request    PQR     TBD  This doc.    DPQ
   Diameter-PQ-Answer     PQA     TBD  This doc.    DPQ

                          Figure 2: Command Codes

1.4.1.  Diameter-PQ-Request

   The Diameter-PQ-Request (PQR) message, indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to TBD and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field, is
   sent by the Diameter Client to the Diameter server to query for
   parameters.  This Diameter application builds on top of Diameter
   NASREQ.

   The Diameter-PQ-Answer (PQA) message, indicated by the Command-Code

   sent in response to the Diameter-PQ-Request message.  The
   Application-Id field in the Diameter message header MUST be set to

1.6.1.  Success

   Errors that fall within the Success category are used to inform a
   peer that a request has been successfully completed.

   Errors that fall within the permanent failures category are used to
   inform the peer that the request failed and SHOULD NOT be attempted
   again.

   The following tables present the AVPs defined in this document and
   their occurrences in Diameter messages.  Note that AVPs that can only
   be present within a Grouped AVP are not represented in this table.

3.  Security Considerations

   AAA servers MUST prevent exposure of information (particularly the
   mapping of IP address to the subscriber information like identity or
   some form of location information, which can be an invasion of the
   subscribers privacy) by employing access control techniques.  A pre-
   requisity of this authorization step is authentication, which is
   provided by the Diameter base specification [RFC3588].  Furthermore,
   it is recommended that a AAA server configuration is available to
   control the granularity of the information exchange to restrict the
   exposure of information to those attributes previously agreed on
   between the involved parties, namely the Diameter client, the
   Diameter server and the subscriber as the owner of the information.
   The latter aspect is particularly important since the distribution of
   information for a stated purpose requires explicit consent of the
   subscriber since is a regulatory requirement in many juristictions.
   Because of the strong security requirements stated above it is
   envisioned that the Diameter application described in this document
   is used only between two entities belonging to the same
   administrative domain.  Distributed denial of service attacks against
   the Diameter by repeated requests from the Diameter client are not
   considered a threat since the Diameter client will be known to the
   Diameter server once cryptographic authentication, using TLS or IPsec
   as described in [RFC3588], is completed.
