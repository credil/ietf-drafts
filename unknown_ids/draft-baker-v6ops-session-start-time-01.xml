    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>One of the issues in IPv6 deployment is the time, from a user's
      perspective, that it takes to open a standard application, which is to
      say the time it takes to open a TCP session that the application can use
      to accomplish its mission.</t>
      <t>One thing to understand is that each source/destination pair of
      addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, including link-local, organizational
      scope such as <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> or <xref
      target="RFC4193">ULA</xref>, and global addresses) defines a path
      between those interfaces. The path may or may not actually work (the two
      addresses may not be in the same domain or the same scope, or routing
      may not be defined, or forwarding may be filtered), and even if the
      network workds, the peer may or may not be willing to respond to any
      given address. Hence, in the worst case, every pair of addresses may
      need to be tried in the process of finding a pair that enables
      communication.</t>
      <t>In the immortal words of <xref target="RFC1958"></xref>, <list
          style="empty">
          <t>The current exponential growth of the network seems to show that
          connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable than any
          individual application such as mail or the World-Wide Web. This
          connectivity requires technical cooperation between service
          providers, and flourishes in the increasingly liberal and
          competitive commercial telecommunications environment.</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>An application or API that fails to quickly enable connectivity
      between any two systems that are authorized to communicate has
      fundamentally missed the point, and can expect its customers to migrate
      to solutions that don't miss the point.</t>
      <t>Part of the issue has to do with source address choice in multihomed
      networks, as described in <xref
      target="I-D.troan-multihoming-without-nat66"></xref>; if the host
      selects the wrong source address for a session with a peer, <xref
      target="RFC2827">BCP 38</xref> ingress filtering will prevent its
      delivery. Any delay in selecting an alternative source address will
      irritate the user, making IPv6 appear less desirable.</t>
      <t>Part of it has to do with the standard response of TCP and SCTP
      clients to RST and ICMP Unreachable messages; if another address pair
      exists, any delay in selecting an alternative source address will
      irritate the user, making IPv6 appear less desirable.</t>
      <t>Part of it has to do with the rate of session attempts; if one takes
      multiple seconds per attempt and, present implementations require as
      much as 40 seconds to open a basic web page. Again, such delays irritate
      the user, making IPv6 appear less desirable.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Possible Solutions">
      <t>TCP's standard reaction to soft errors, which includes its response
      to an abrupt RST from the peer and its response to ICMP "unreachable
      messages", doesn't help. <xref target="RFC5461"></xref> makes pragmatic
      suggestions to address the issues. From an operator's perspective, it is
      felt that the fundamental suggestion is a good one, and either should be
      standardized and widely deployed or a better suggestion should be
      standardized and widely deployed.</t>
      <t>The <xref target="I-D.wing-v6ops-happy-eyeballs-ipv6">Happy Eyeballs</xref> draft
      addresses the startup question. From an operator's perspective, it is
      felt that the fundamental suggestion is a good one, and either should be
      standardized and widely deployed or a better suggestion should be
      standardized and widely deployed.</t>

      <t>Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
      correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are required,
      or if those assignments or registries are created during the RFC
      publication process. From the author"s perspective, it may therefore be
      removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor"s discretion.</t>
