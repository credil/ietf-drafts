Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291] allows multiple unicast
   addresses to be assigned to interfaces.  Because of this IPv6
   implementations need to handle multiple possible source and
   destination addresses when initiating communication.  RFC 3484
   [RFC3484] specifies the default algorithms, common across all
   implementations, for selecting source and destination addresses so
   that it is easier to predict the address selection behavior.

   Since RFC 3484 was specified, some issues have been identified with
   the algorithms specified there.  The issues include the longest match
   algorithm used in Rule 9 of destination address selection breaking
   DNS round-robin techniques, and prioritization of poor IPv6
   connectivity using transition mechanisms over native IPv4
   connectivity.

   There have also been some significant changes to the IPv6 addressing
   architecture that require changes in the RFC 3484 policy table.  Such
   changes include the deprecation of site-local unicast addresses
   [RFC3879] and of IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses, and the introduction
   of Unique Local Addresses [RFC4193].

   This document specifies a set of updates that modify the algorithms
   and fix the known defects.


2.  Specification

2.1.  Changes related to the default policy table

   The default policy table is defined in RFC 3484 Section 2.1 as
   follows:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               50     0
         ::/0                  40     1
         2002::/16             30     2
         ::/96                 20     3
         ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4

   The changes that should be included into the default policy table are
   those rules that are universally useful and do no harm in every
   reasonable network environment.  The changes we should consider for
   the default policy table are listed in this sub-section.

   The policy table is defined to be configurable.  The changes that are
   useful locally but not universally can be put into the policy table

   manually or by using the policy distribution mechanism proposed as a
   DHCP option [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-opt].

2.1.1.  ULA in the policy table

   RFC 5220 [RFC5220] sections 2.1.4, 2.2.2, and 2.2.3 describe address
   selection problems related to ULAs [RFC4193].  These problems can be
   solved by either changing the scope of ULAs to site-local, or by
   adding an entry for the default policy table that has its own label
   for ULAs.

   Centrally assigned ULAs [I-D.ietf-ipv6-ula-central] have been
   proposed, and are assigned fc00::/8.  Using the different labels for
   fc00::/8 and fd00::/8 makes sense if we assume the same kind of
   address block is assigned in the same or adjacent network.  However,
   we cannot expect that the type of ULA address block and network
   adjacency commonly have any relationships.

   Regarding the scope of ULAs, ULAs have been specified with a global
   scope because the reachability of ULAs was intended to be restricted
   by the routing system.  Since the ULAs will not be exposed outside of
   their reachability domain, if a ULA is available as a candidate
   destination address, it can be expected to be reachable.

   If we change the scope of ULAs to be smaller than global, we can
   prioritize ULA to ULA communication over GUA to GUA communication.
   At the same time, however, finer-grained configuration of ULA address
   selection will be impossible.  For example, even if you want to
   prioritize communication related to the only /48 ULA prefix used in
   your site, and do not want to prioritize communication to any other
   ULA prefix, such a policy cannot be implemented in the policy table.
   So, this draft proposes the use of the policy table to differentiate
   ULAs from GUAs.

2.1.2.  Teredo in the policy table

   Teredo [RFC4380] is defined and has been assigned 2001::/32.  This
   address block should be assigned its own label in the policy table.
   Teredo's priority should be less than or equal to 6to4, considering
   its characteristic of being a transitional tunnel mechanism.

2.1.3.  6to4, Teredo, and IPv4 prioritization

   Regarding the prioritization between IPv4 and these transitional
   mechanisms, their connectivity is known to usually be worse than
   IPv4.  These mechanisms are said to be the last resort access method
   to IPv6 resources. 6to4 should have higher precedence than Teredo,
   given that 6to4 host to 6to4 host communication can be over IPv4

   (which can result in a more optimal path) and that 6to4 should not
   used behind a NAT device.

2.1.4.  Deprecated addresses in the policy table

   IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses (::/96) are deprecated [RFC4291].
   IPv6 site-local unicast addresses (fec0::/10) are deprecated
   [RFC3879]. 6bone testing addresses [RFC3701] were returned.

   These addresses were removed from the current specification.  So they
   should not be treated differently, especially if we plan future re-
   use of these address blocks.  The 6bone testing address block should
   not be treated specially.

   Considering the inappropriate use of these address blocks, especially
   in outdated implementations and bad effects brought by them, they
   should be labeled differently from the legitimate address blocks as
   long as the address block is reserved by IANA.

2.1.5.  Renewed default policy table

   After applying these updates, the default policy table will be:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               60     0
         fc00::/7              50     1
         ::/0                  40     2
         ::ffff:0:0/96         30     3
         2002::/16             20     4
         2001::/32             10     5
         ::/96                  1    10
         fec0::/10              1    11

2.2.  The longest matching rule

   This issue is related to the longest matching rule, which was found
   by Dave Thaler.  It causes a malfunction of the DNS round robin
   technique, as described below.  It is common for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   When a destination address DA, DB, and the source address of DA
   Source(DA) are on the same subnet and Source(DA) == Source(DB), DNS
   round robin load-balancing cannot function.  By considering prefix
   lengths that are longer than the subnet prefix, this rule establishes
   preference between addresses that have no substantive differences
   between them.  The rule functions as an arbitrary tie-breaker between
   the hosts in a round robin, causing a given host to always prefer a
   given member of the round robin.




Matsumoto, et al.        Expires January 2, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     July 2011


   By limiting the calculation of common prefixes to a maximum length
   equal to the length of the subnet prefix of the source address, rule
   9 can continue to favor hosts that are nearby in the network
   hierarchy without arbitrarily sorting addresses within a given
   network.  This modification could be written as follows:

   Rule 9: Use longest matching prefix.

   When DA and DB belong to the same address family (both are IPv6 or
   both are IPv4): If CommonPrefixLen(DA & Netmask(Source(DA)),
   Source(DA)) > CommonPrefixLen(DB & Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)),
   then prefer DA.  Similarly, if CommonPrefixLen(DA &
   Netmask(Source(DA)), Source(DA)) < CommonPrefixLen(DB &
   Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)), then prefer DB.

2.3.  Utilize next-hop for source address selection

   RFC 3484 source address selection rule 5 says that the address that
   is attached to the outgoing interface should be preferred as the
   source address.  This rule is reasonable considering the prevalence
   of ingress filtering described in BCP 38 [RFC2827].  This is because
   an upstream network provider usually assumes it receives packets from
   their customer that only have the delegated addresses as the source
   addresses.

   This rule, however, is not effective in an environment such as that
   described in RFC 5220 Section 2.1.1, where a host has multiple
   upstream routers on the same link and has addresses delegated from
   each upstream router on a single interface.

   Also, DHCPv6 assigned addresses are not associated like SLAAC
   assigned addresses to a next-hop gateway, so implementations usually
   can't apply this heuristic in a DHCPv6 network.

   So, a new rule 5.1 that utilizes next-hop information for source
   address selection is inserted just after rule 5.

   Rule 5.1: Use an address assigned by the selected next-hop.

   If SA is assigned by the selected next-hop that will be used to send
   to D and SB is assigned by a different next-hop, then prefer SA.
   Similarly, if SB is assigned by the next-hop that will be used to
   send to D and SA is assigned by a different next-hop, then prefer SB.

2.4.  Private IPv4 address scope

   When a packet goes through a NAT, its source or destination address
   can get replaced with another address with a different scope.  It



Matsumoto, et al.        Expires January 2, 2012                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     July 2011


   follows that the result of the source address selection algorithm may
   be different when the original address is replaced with the NATed
   address.

   The algorithm currently specified in RFC 3484 is based on the
   assumption that a source address with a small scope cannot reach a
   destination address with a larger scope.  This assumption does not
   hold if private IPv4 addresses and a NAT are used to reach public
   IPv4 addresses.

   Due to this assumption, in the presence of both a NATed private IPv4
   address and a transitional address (like 6to4 or Teredo), the host
   will choose the transitional IPv6 address to access dual-stack peers
   [I-D.denis-v6ops-nat-addrsel].  Choosing transitional IPv6
   connectivity over native IPv4 connectivity, particularly where the
   transitional connectivity is unmanaged, is not considered to be
   generally desirable.

   This issue can be fixed by changing the address scope of private IPv4
   addresses to global.

2.5.  Deprecation of site-local unicast address

   RFC 3484 contains a few "site-local unicast" and "fec0::"
   descriptions.  It's better to remove examples related to site-local
   unicast addresses, or change the examples to use ULAs.  Possible
   points to be re-written are listed below.

      - 2nd paragraph in RFC 3484 Section 3.1 describes the scope
      comparison mechanism.
      - RFC 3484 Section 10 contains examples for site-local addresses.


3.  Security Considerations

   No security risk is found that degrades RFC 3484.


4.  IANA Considerations

   Address type number for the policy table may have to be assigned by
   IANA.

Appendix B.  Past Discussion

   This section summarizes discussions we had before related to address
   selection mechanisms.

B.1.  The longest match rule

   RFC 3484 defines that destination address selection rule 9 should be
   applied to both IPv4 and IPv6, which spoils the DNS-based load
   balancing technique that is widely used in the IPv4 Internet today.

   When two or more destination addresses are acquired from one FQDN,
   rule 9 states that the longest matching destination and source
   address pair should be chosen.  As in RFC 1794, the DNS-based load
   balancing technique is achieved by not re-ordering the destination
   addresses returned from the DNS server.  Rule 9 defines a
   deterministic rule for re-ordering hosts, hence the technique
   described in RFC 1794 is not available anymore.

   Regarding this problem, there was discussion in IETF and other places
   like below.

Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     July 2011


   Discussion: The possible changes to RFC 3484 are as follows:

   1.  To delete Rule 9 completely.
   2.  To apply Rule 9 only for IPv6 and not for IPv4.  In IPv6,
       hierarchical address assignment generally used at present, hence
       the longest matching rule is beneficial in many cases.  In IPv4,
       as stated above, the DNS based load balancing technique is widely
       used.
   3.  To apply Rule 9 for IPv6 conditionally and not for IPv4.  When
       the length of matching bits of the destination address and the
       source address is longer than N, rule 9 is applied.  Otherwise,
       the order of the destination addresses do not change.  The value
       of N should be configurable and it should be 32 by default.  This
       is simply because the two sites whose matching bit length is
       longer than 32 are probably adjacent.

   Now that IPv6 PI addresses are being introduced by RIRs, hierarchical
   address assignment is not always maintained anymore.  It seems that
   the longest matching algorithm may not worth the adverse effect of
   disabling the DNS-based load balance technique.

B.2.  NAT64 prefix issue

   The NAT64 WKP has recently been defined[RFC6052].  It depends site by
   site whether NAT64 should be preferred over IPv4, in other words
   NAT44, or NAT44 over NAT64.  So, the issue of local site policy
   should be solved by manual policy table changes locally, or by use of
   the proposed DHCP-based policy distribution mechanism.

B.3.  ISATAP issue

   Where a site is using ISATAP [RFC5214], there is generally no way to
   differentiate an ISATAP address from a native address without
   interface information.  However, a site will assign a prefix for its
   ISATAP overlay, and can choose to add an entry for that prefix to the
   policy table if it wishes to change the default preference for that
   prefix.
