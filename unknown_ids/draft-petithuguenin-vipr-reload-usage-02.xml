			<t>
				Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR) is a technique for inter-domain SIP federation.
				VIPR makes use of the RELOAD protocol to store unverified mappings from phone numbers to RELOAD nodes, with whom a validation process can be run.
				This document defines the usage of RELOAD for this purpose.

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				This document relies heavily on the concepts and terminology defined in <xref target="VIPR-OVERVIEW"/> and will not make sense if you have not read that document first.
				As it defines a usage for RELOAD <xref target="P2PSIP-BASE"/>, it assumes the reader is also familiar with that specification.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Terminology">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Registering an E.164 number">
			<t>
				To register an E.164 number a VIPR server stores a ViprRegistration structure using the fully qualified E.164 based number without any non-digit characters but the '+' character as Resource Name.
				For redundancy purpose, the VIPR server MUST store the same ViprRegistration structure two more times by using the same Resource Name prepended with the "COPY1" and "COPY2" character string respectively.
			</t>

			<t>The contents of the ViprRegistration structure are as follow:</t>

			<figure>
				<artwork><![CDATA[
enum { reserved(0), node_id(8200), (65535) } ViprRegistrationType;

struct {
    select (ViprRegistrationType) {
      case node_id:
        NodeId            pvp_provider;

      /* This type can be extended */
    } ViprRegistrationData;

struct {
    ViprRegistrationType  type;
    uint16                length;
    ViprRegistrationData  data;
} ViprRegistration;

				]]></artwork>
			</figure>

			<t>The ViprRegistration structure contains the following values:</t>

			<t>
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="type"/>
					<t>The type of the registration</t>
					<t/>
					<t hangText="length"/>
					<t>The length of the data structure, i.e. not counting the type and length fields</t>
					<t/>
					<t hangText="pvp_provider"/>
					<t>The Node-ID of the peer to which an AppAttach request should be sent to initiate the PVP protocol</t>
					<t/>
				</list>
			</t>

			<t>The Node-ID used in the pvp_provider field and in the key MUST be ready to process AppAttach requests for Application-ID 8470 at the time the registration is done.</t>

			<t>
				VIPR supports multiple registrations for a single E.164 number by using a Dictionary Data Model.
				The dictionary key is the concatenation of the Node-ID and the VServiceId, resulting in a 24 bytes long value.
				Using the Node-ID of the node performing the store segments the keyspace of the dictionary so that no two peers ever store using the same key.
				Using the VService allows for a single VIPR server to service multiple clusters, and to ensure that numbers published by one cluster (using one VServiceID) do not clobber or step on numbers published by another cluster (using a different VServiceID).
			</t>

			<t>
				The Store operations are paced into the overlay at a fixed rate.
				The VIPR server maintains a queue that is filled with store requests.
				The VIPR server services that queue at a fixed, provisioned rate, which is stored in a kind configuration variable named &lt;store-rate-limit&gt;.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Fetching a registration">
			<t>A VIPR server wishing to validate a E.164 number will start 3 Fetch transactions using respectivelly the fully qualified E.164 based number without any non-digit characters but the '+' character as Resource Name, the same Resource Name prepended with the "COPY1" character string and finally the same Resource Name prepended with the "COPY2" character string.</t>

			<t>
				The VIPR server will then inspects the elements in the 3 dictionary returned and will keep only the registrations that have the same key in at least 2 of the 3 dictionary returned.
				For each registration kept, the VIPR server will fetch the certificates associated with the Node-ID in the key using the CERTIFICATE_BY_NODE usage and will verify that the signature of the registration is valid.
			</t>

			<t>
				The VIPR server can then send an AppAttach to the Node-ID found in the key and registration, using the Application-ID 8470.
				After the connection is established, the VIPR server can start PVP as specified in <xref target="VIPR-PVP"/>.
			</t>

			<t>
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="Name">VIPR-REGISTRATION</t>
					<t/>
					<t hangText="Kind Ids">
						The Resource Name for the VIPR-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is a fully qualified E.164 based number without any non-digit characters but the '+' character, prepended by either an empty character string, the "COPY1" character string or the "COPY2" character string.
						The data stored is a ViprRegistration, which contains the Node-ID of the peer to which an AppAttach request should be sent to initiate the PVP protocol.
					</t>
					<t/>
					<t hangText="Data Model">
						The data model for the VIPR Kind-ID is dictionary.

					</t>
					<t/>
					<t hangText="Access Control">
						The VIPR-MATCH policy can only be used with a VIPR-REGISTRATION Kind-ID.
						In this policy, a given value MUST be written (or overwritten) if and only if the Node-ID in the pvp_provider field of the ViprRegistration structure is equal to the first 16 bytes of the dictionary key and if the same Node-ID is the one indicated in the SignerIdentity of the value.
						Note that VIPR always let the values stored expire, so the exists field is always equal to TRUE.
					</t>
					<t/>
					<t hangText="Quota">
						This kind MUST use the proportional quota algorithm described in <xref target="RELOAD-QUOTA"/> by adding the &lt;max-count-per&gt; element with a value of "SIGNER" to the configuration file.
						The &lt;max-count&gt; value, which measures the amount of E.164 numbers a particular node can store, MUST be adjusted to account for the application-layer copies (COPY1 and COPY2).
						A VIPR server MUST provide enough Node-IDs to store all the E.164 numbers it is responsible for by dividing this count by the &lt;max-count&gt; value, itself adjusted by an additional 3x factor to make sure that the probability is low that a rejection occurs due to imperfect distribution of Resource-IDs across the ring.

<abstract>
<t>This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the kinds of data that must be stored for a particular application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access from "client" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data for others.</t>

<abstract>
<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video communications.  Though it was designed from the outset to support inter-domain federation over the public Internet, such federation has not materialized.  The primary reasons for this are the complexities of inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security. This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, and then describes a new model and technique for inter-domain federation with SIP, called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR). ViPR addresses the problems that have prevented inter-domain federation over the Internet.  It provides fully distributed inter- domain routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phone numbers to domains, a new technique for automated VoIP anti-spam, and privacy of number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal model of SIP.

<abstract>
<t>One of the main challenges in inter-domain federation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls is that many domains continue to utilize phone numbers, and not email-style SIP URI.  Consequently, a mechanism is needed that enables secure mappings from phone numbers to domains.  The main technical challenge in doing this securely is to verify that the domain in question truly is the "owner" of the phone number.  This specification defines the PSTN Validation Protocol (PVP), which can be used by a domain to verify this ownership by means of a forward routability check in the PSTN.</t>
