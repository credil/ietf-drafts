       P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes: Scenarios and Related Issues
                        draft-lu-ppsp-mobile-01.txt


Abstract

   The scenarios where a Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) contains
   mobile nodes need special considerations.  An analysis of all the
   scenarios that involve mobile nodes is necessary to provide the
   guidelines to PPSP protocol design and applicability.  This document
   describes the major scenarios for a PPSP network with mobile nodes
   and identifies some of the key issues.

Internet-Draft      P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes            June 2010


1. Introduction

   The PPSP Working Group is developing protocols for Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
   streaming systems [I-D.zong-ppsp-reqs]. In the past P2P solutions
   have mostly targeted wired or fixed connections. Mobile P2P
   communications are expected to grow rapidly and the nature of mobile
   nodes and mobile environments cause specific challenges to P2P
   communications, specifically for streaming scenarios. This draft
   discusses such mobility specific issues with the illustration of
   different scenarios.

2. Conventions and Terminology

   This document uses the same terminologies as [I-D.zong-ppsp-reqs].
   For simplicity, this document illustrates scenarios showing a
   centralized Tracker architecture.  However, it should be understood
   that all the scenarios also apply to the distributed architecture,
   e.g. using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).

3. Link Layer Mobility

   PPSP uses a P2P based overlay network on top of the transport
   network. Mobility or link quality at link layers is not visible to
   the peers.

   As illustrated in Figure 1, if Peer 1 is connected to a poor quality
   link via mobile Access Network 1 (AN1), then the overall P2P
   streaming session quality can suffer from high error rate and low
   throughput due to poor link layer conditions. This will impact both
   the Peer-Peer connection and the Tracker-Peer connection.  For
   example, on the Peer-Peer connection frame loss, audio/video synch
   loss, or streaming stalls are likely to be seen on the media transfer
   protocols.

4. IP Mobility

4.1. Simple IP

   Simple IP refers to the scenario where there is no IP layer mobility
   protocol such as Mobile IP or Proxy Mobile IP, and a peer needs to
   obtain a new IP address through a standard method like DHCP after
   losing the previous IP address.

   As illustrated in Figure 2, when peer 1 moves from AN1 to AN1', its
   IP address changes from IP1 to IP1'. This will impact both the Peer-
   Peer connection and the Tracker-Peer connection. If the PPSP

   may be lost.

4.2. Mobile IP

   Mobile IP (MIP) provides IP mobility and hides the mobile's movement
   from the Correspondent Node (CN) [RFC3775].

   Figure 3 illustrates the case when Peer 1 moves from AN1 to AN1'.
   Because of Mobile IP, neither the Tracker nor Peer 2 are aware of the
   change of network for peer 1. However, due to the inherent tunneling
   and triangular routing of the Mobile IP protocol (through the Home
   Agent) the P2P session may in some scenarios experience extra

   latency. This may adversely affect the user experience of the P2P
   streaming session. As seen above, Mobile IP will impact primarily the
   Peer-Peer connection (and the Tracker-Peer connection is not
   significantly affected).

4.3. Proxy Mobile IP

   The use of Proxy Mobile IP [RFC5213] causes similar issues as the
   ones mentioned for Mobile IP in the above section. On top of these,
   Proxy Mobile IP also introduces a new issue for P2P streaming
   sessions. Since Proxy Mobile IP is a network based solution, the
   mobile node (peer) is not aware of its IP mobility so it cannot
   inform the Tracker, P2P Cache, CDNs or other peers of the IP level
   mobility. Therefore IP mobility is totally invisible to the P2P
   Streaming session entities and harder to detect and respond
   accordingly. Thus Proxy Mobile IP will impact both the Peer-Peer
   connection and the Tracker-Peer connection




5. Mobility support with RELOAD

   It has already been identified in the proposed WG charter that any
   PPSP developed protocol should be analyzed for interactions with the
   RELOAD protocol. The RELOAD protocol provides a signaling and routing
   mechanism for P2P overlay networks over the general Internet.  The
   latest RELOAD draft [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] also has a future
   consideration section for support of HIP (section 5.6.1.1).  HIP is
   an experimental mobility protocol with good security properties.

   In addition to HIP, the following mobility protocols should also be
   considered for PPSP-RELOAD interactions:

     .  Mobile IP

     .  Proxy Mobile IP



6. Tracker Mobility

   Normally Trackers are assumed to be fixed nodes. However, in a mobile
   environment mobile nodes can also become Trackers. In this sense,
   similar considerations to the ones described above for mobile peers
   should be applied to mobile Trackers.

7. Geo-Targeting Issues

   Geo-targeting is a technique used to determine the physical location
   (i.e. geo-location) of a user. The geo-location is based on
   geographical and other personal information provided by the requester


Lu, et al.            Expires December 10, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes            June 2010


   peer or a third party. Techniques to determine geo-location of a user
   can rely on civic location, GPS geographical coordinates, cellular
   base station ID, or most commonly IP address. The primary source for
   IP address geographical data is the regional Internet registries.

   Depending on the location, different regulations and rules may apply.
   For instance, some content may not be distributed on certain
   locations or can only be distributed on some other locations.

   Current content distribution policies can apply certain rules to P2P
   Streaming clients. However, IP mobility protocols such as Mobile IP
   and Proxy Mobile IP can hide the peer or a Tracker movement from one
   region to another where possibly different content distribution rules
   may apply hence rendering the set forth policies un-enforceable.
   This may also be the case where the peer is connecting through a
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) and in some cases even a Network
   Address Translator (NAT).


8. Mobile Node Capabilities

   Mobile nodes are constrained by nature due to their limited battery,
   screen size, computational capability and they operate in variable
   and unpredictable environments. These attributes bring about the
   problems mentioned above that may adversely affect the P2P Streaming
   sessions.

8.1. Multiple Interfaces

   A mobile node can switch between different radio access technologies
   such as 3G or Wi-Fi occasionally or frequently, which may cause the
   P2P Streaming session quality to degrade due to latency introduced or
   P2P Streaming session totally terminated.

8.2. Uplink vs. Downlink Bandwidth

   Often mobile devices have asymmetrical bandwidth capabilities. For
   instance, most mobile devices are capable of handling higher bit
   rates in the downlink than in the uplink. Since peer-to-peer
   streaming sessions can be either generated or terminated on a mobile
   device, these mobile node capabilities should be taken into account.

8.3. Processing Power

   Some devices are more capable than others in terms of computational
   performance or processing power. Similarly, devices can have
   different performance for generating a session (e.g. video recording)


Lu, et al.            Expires December 10, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes            June 2010


   or terminating it (e.g. video display). Taking these differences into
   account is important for maintaining a good quality of the P2P
   streaming session.

9. Conclusion

   The PPSP Working Group should consider the impacts of various aspects
   of mobility discussed in this draft.  In particular, PPSP should
   study how these issues can be mitigated in a mobile P2P streaming
   environment when designing both the PPSP Peer-Peer and the Tracker-
   Peer protocols.

10. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce new threats to security.

11. IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
