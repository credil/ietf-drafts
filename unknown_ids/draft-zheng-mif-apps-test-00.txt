Internet-Draft       MIF Applications Test Results             July 2011


1. Introduction

   The IPv6 introduction and deployment of IPv6 to IPv4 transition
   solutions increase the chances of multi-interface hosts, which face
   some challenges described in the MIF problem statement, [I-D.ietf-
   mif-problem-statement]. The applications on these hosts will be
   impacted not impacted on single-interface hosts. This document
   provides some test results of well-known applications in MIF and
   transition solutions environment.

   The tested applications include:

   o Windows 7: ping, IE 9, Live Messenger 2009, Skype 5.1, Firefox 3.6,
     Google Earth 6

   o Fedora 13: ping and ping6, Skype 2.2, Firefox 3.6, Google Earth 6.

   The following scenarios are tested:

   o Host has one network adapter with dual stack

   o Host has two network adapters respectively with IPv6 and IPv4
     Connections
The transition solutions in the test include AplusP [I-D.ymbk-
   aplusp], DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], NAT64
   [RFC6145]/DNS64 [RFC 6147] and the combination of them.

   The test behinds two DNS Servers that one in IPv4 Internet is not on
   Google's IPv6 whitelist and another in IPv6 Internet is on it.

2. Scenario 1: One network adapter with dual stack

2.1. Test environment

   In this scenario as showed in the Figure 1, the host accesses
   Internet by one network adapter with IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.
   Applications run on the host equipped with Windows 7 or Fedora 13
   system. DNS Servers are in IPv6 Internet and IPv4 Internet
   respectively.

2.2. Test results on Windows

2.2.1. Behaviors of DNS lookups

   When application needs to lookup a host name, which one DNS Server is
   selected and which type (A or AAAA) query is sent are decided by
   Windows system. In this scenario, the addresses of DNS Servers are
   provided through DHCP messenger to system. The IPv6 DNS Server has
   high priority. The system sends an A type query to IPv6 DNS Server at
   first. If the non-NXDOMAIN error response of the A type query is
   received, the system sends an AAAA query to IPv6 DNS Server, then
   provides DNS records coming from IPv6 DNS Server to applications and
   the DNS lookup finishes. Otherwise, the system sends an A type query
   to IPv4 DNS Server, then sends an AAAA query if the non-NXDOMAIN
   error response of the A type query is received, then DNS records
   coming from IPv4 DNS Server are provided to applications.

2.2.2. Applications results

   In this scenario, if the tested application is IPv6-enabled and the
   AAAA resource record is available, IPv6 has higher priority to be
   selected to communicate.

   Ping, IE and Firefox: IPv6 has high priority if AAAA resource record
   is available;

   Google Earth: IPv6;

   Skype and Live Messenger: IPv4 (because AAAA resource record is
   unavailable)

Internet-Draft       MIF Applications Test Results             July 2011


2.2.3. Problems and suggestions
   A problem was observed with Windows 7 when querying a host name that
   has only AAAA records (and no A or CNAME records), and receives
   NXDOMAIN from a faulty DNS server ([RFC4074], [CERT-714121]).
   Windows 7 always first queries a host name's A record, and if it
   receives an NXDOMAIN it will not query for an AAAA record. To
   accommodate this behavior, a host name that has only an AAAA record
   should have a CNAME which points to the AAAA.

2.3. Test results on Fedora

2.3.1. Behaviors of DNS lookups

   In this scenario, the addresses of DNS Servers are configured in
   /etc/resolv.conf. The configured order decides which DNS Server has
   high priority.

   When an application can be decided which type queries it needs, such
   as ping (A type) or ping6 (AAAA type), the system will send this type
   query to the DNS Servers. Otherwise, the system will send A and AAAA
   queries to the DNS Server at the same time. The system sends DNS
   query to DNS Servers according to the configured order in
   resolv.conf. Once the non-NXDOMAIN response of the queries is
   received, the query process will stop and the query results will be
   returned to the application. Otherwise, the system will query next
   DNS Server in the order.

2.3.2. Applications results

   In this scenario, which type IPv6 or IPv4 is used to communicate by
   the applications is impacted by the DNS Server configured order,
   records in queried zone and the applications' selection.

   o IPv6 DNS Server has high priority

    Ping: IPv4 (just sending A query);

    Ping6: IPv6 (just sending AAAA query);

    Firefox: IPv6 has high priority if AAAA resource record available;

    Google Earth: IPv6;

    Skype: IPv4 (because AAAA resource record is unavailable)

   o IPv4 DNS Server has high priority

    Ping: IPv4 (just sending A query);

Internet-Draft       MIF Applications Test Results             July 2011


     Ping6: IPv6 (just sending AAAA query and if the queried host name
     does not have an AAAA resource record through querying IPv4 DNS
     Server, system will ask IPv6 DNS Server for AAAA record);

     Firefox: IPv4, IPv6 only in the case: the AAAA record of the
     queried host name can be returned in the additional records section
     in the A query response, such as www.kame.net or be gotten through
     AAAA query response;

    Google Earth: IPv4;

    Skype: IPv4 (because IPv6 server side is unavailable)

2.3.3. Problems and suggestions

   Because the DNS Servers order configured in resolv.conf impacts the
   protocol type used to communicate by applications, the IPv6 DNS
   Server should be configured with high priority or the AAAA record of
   the queried host name can be returned in the additional records
   section in the A query response if IPv6 is wished for.

   Note: analysis of how Fedora orders its DNS servers when it is DHCP-
   configured is for future study.

3. Scenario 2: Two network adapters respectively with IPv6 and IPv4
  connections

3.1. Test environment

   In this scenario as showed in the Figure 2, the host has IPv6 and
   IPv4 two connections to accesses Internet by two network adapters.
   Applications run on the host equipped with Windows 7 or Fedora 13
   system. DNS Servers are in IPv6 Internet and IPv4 Internet
   respectively.

                  Figure 2 Test environment of Scenario 2

3.2. Test results on Windows

   In this scenario, there are two cases:

   o Case 1: The two interfaces of IPv6 and IPv4 all with IPv6 and IPv4
     dual protocol stacks

   o Case 2: IPv6 interface with IPv6-only protocol stack and IPv4
     interface with IPv4-only protocol stack

3.2.1. Behaviors of DNS lookups

   In this scenario, the addresses of DNS Servers are provided through
   DHCP messenger to system. The order of two adapters in which they can
   be accessed can be configured in Windows system. However, in our
   test, the order of adapters had no impact on the priority of DNS
   Servers. Compared with IPv4 DNS server, the IPv6 DNS Server always
   has high priority in Case 1 and low priority in Case 2.

   In Case 1, the IPv6 DNS Server has high priority. Behavior of DNS
   lookups is same as in section 2.2.1.

   In Case 2, the IPv4 DNS Server has high priority. The system sends an
   A type query to IPv4 DNS Server at first. If the non-NXDOMAIN
   response of the A type query is received, the system provides DNS
   records coming from IPv4 DNS Server to applications and the DNS
   lookup stops. Otherwise, the system sends an A type query to IPv6 DNS
   Server, then sends an AAAA query if the non-NXDOMAIN response of the
   A type query is received and DNS records coming from IPv6 DNS Server
   are provided to applications.

Internet-Draft       MIF Applications Test Results             July 2011


3.2.2. Applications results

   In Case 1, the results are same as in section 2.2.2.

   In Case 2:

   Ping, IE and Firefox: IPv4 (most of websites), IPv6 only when the
   AAAA record of the queried host name can be returned in the
   additional records section in the A query response, such as
   www.kame.net;

   Google Earth: IPv4 (because only A record is got from IPv4 DNS
   Server);

   Skype and Live Messenger: IPv4 (because AAAA resource record is
   unavailable)

3.2.3. Problems and suggestions

   If IPv6 is wished for, the configuration of case 2 should be avoided.

   In case 1, to avoid the problem same as in section 2.2.3, a host name
   that has only an AAAA record should have a CNAME which points to the
   AAAA.

3.3. Test results on Fedora

   The configuration of DNS Server is same as in scenario 1 and the test
   results are same as in section 2.3.2.

4. Transition solutions in MIF

   To investigate MIF issues in the context of transition solutions,
   three transition solutions Aplusp, DS-Lite and NAT64 are enabled in
   the test bed, and three cases of combination are tested.

4.3. Case 3: NAT64 and DS-Lite provisioned Host

   A concern that NAT64 may break existing popular applications has been
   arising. Hence, applications' NAT64 compatibility has been tested and
   tests results are listed in the section 4.5. In addition, since
   solutions addressing different scenarios may co-exist in the same
   subscribers' network, it is necessary to understand potential
   Therefore, both Dual-stack Lite and NAT64 are enabled in the test bed

   network, to see whether apps work properly, to see whether apps
   choose IPv6 prior to IPv4 or if they try both, and the corresponding
   results are shown in the section 4.6.

   Test Environments and DNS configuration details are described in
   Section 4.4.1.

4.3.1. Test Environment and DNS configuration

   An open-source implementation of a NAT64/DNS64 gateway funded by the
   NLnet Foundation and Viageie, Ecdysis has been used as NAT64/DNS64
   gateway. The host runs Windows XP.

   A Dnsmasq (a DNS forwarder), whose upstream DNS server is configured
   to DNS64, was installed in the B4 element as shown in figure 5. DNS64
   delegates A queries via IPv4 Internet and returns the A RRs to
   Dnsmasq, and also responsible for generating AAAA RRs to AAAA queries
   by forming a DNS64 prefix from A RRs and NAT64's prefix.

   Both AAAA and A RRs are then delegated by Dnsmasq to the Host behind

4.3.2. NAT64 impacts on applications and suggestions

   Introducing NAT64 may bring impacts, for instance some applications
   may break due to the IP protocol translation. First, AFTR
   provisioning was switched off to see applications' compatibility with
   NAT64. Results are shown in the figure 6.

   Live Messenger uses IPv6 to login to the server, but the IPv6 client
   did not send the same application layer message as the IPv4 client,
   so the IPv6 client (behind NAT64) failed to get reply from IPv4
   server. Therefore, the application layer of Live Messenger should be
   IP version independent.

   There are two suggestions for P2P applications:

   o There is a need for P2P applications behind NAT64 to learn the
     NAT64's prefix, so that IPv6 peer can talk with IPv4 peers via
     NAT64.


   o Otherwise, IPv4 connectivity is required to support remaining

     access to IPv4 peer, according to test results suggested in section
     4.3.3.

4.3.3. Test in a both NAT64 and DS-Lite accessible network and
  suggestions

   In this scenario, both AFTR and NAT64/DNS64 are provisioned to B4.

   Applications works fine with a both NAT64 and DS-Lite accessible
   network.

   Apps' behaviors in terms of IP preference, more specifically, how
   applications prioritize AAAA and A DNS records and which IP version
   protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) is preferred to initiate communication, are
   described in the figure 7.

         Figure 7 : Applications' transition solution preference

   Except BitComet, which although issues both A and AAAA quires,
   ignores AAAA RR and only uses IPv4 to initiate communication, all the
   other applications first try A RR to initiate IPv6 communications,
   and if it fails A RR is used to initiate IPv4 communications.

   Live messenger first fails IPv6 due to DNS64 translation, so it is
   suggested to avoid that translation when the application uses DNS64,

   as described in [I-D.wing-behave-dns64-config].

   Yet, after failing IPv6 Live messenger automatically switches to IPv4
   by which all the rest of communication were done. What we have
   learned from this test case is that the application layer should be
   IP version agnostic in order to decrease impacts introduced by IPv6
   transition solutions.

5. Security Considerations

   TBD

6. IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

7. Conclusions

   Despite some mainstream operating systems have already support IPv6,
   but in terms of our test results, there are still some issues
   impacting on the IPv6 practice, especially under MIF and transition
   solutions environment. It's worth to be considered during IPv6
   introduction.
