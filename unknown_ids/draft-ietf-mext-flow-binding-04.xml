            <t>This document introduces extensions to Mobile IPv6 that allow
                nodes to bind one or more flows to a care-of address. These
                extensions allow multihomed nodes to instruct home agents and
                other Mobile IPv6 entities to direct inbound flows to specific
                addresses.</t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
            <t>Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775"/>, DSMIPv6 <xref
                    target="RFC5555"/> and NEMO Basic Support <xref
                    target="RFC3963"/> allow a mobile node / mobile router to
                manage its mobility using the binding update message, which
                binds one care-of address to one home address and associated
                mobile networks. The binding update message can be sent to the
                home agent. In Mobile IPv6, the binding update can also be sent
                to correspondent node or to a mobility anchor point (see <xref
                    target="RFC5380"/>). The semantics of the binding update are
                limited to care-of address changes. That is, <xref
                    target="RFC3775"/>, <xref target="RFC5555"/>, and <xref
                    target="RFC3963"/> do not allow a mobile node / mobile
                router to bind more than one address to the home address. In
                    <xref target="RFC5648"/> Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support
                are extended to allow the binding of more than one care-of
                address to a home address. This specification further extends
                Mobile IPv6, DSMIPv6, and NEMO Basic Support to allow it to
                specify policies associated with each binding. A policy can
                contain a request for special treatment of a particular IPv4 or
                IPv6 flow, which is viewed as a group of packets matching a
                traffic selector. Hence, this specification allows a mobile node
                / mobile router to bind a particular flow to a care-of address
                without affecting other flows using the same home address. In
                addition, this specification allows to bind a particular flow to
                a particular care-of address directly with correspondent node
                and mobility agents (i.e., home agents <xref target="RFC3775"/>
                and mobility anchor points <xref target="RFC5380"/>).</t>
            <t>In this document, a flow is defined as a set of IP packets
                matching a traffic selector. A traffic selector can identify the
                source and destination IP addresses, transport protocol number,
                the source and destination port numbers and other fields in IP
                and higher layer headers. This specification, however, does not
                define traffic selectors and it is assumed that one or more ways
                of defining traffic selectors are going to be defined in other
                specifications. This specification, however, does define the
                traffic selector sub-option format to be used for any defined
                traffic selectors. </t>
            <t> Using the flow identifier option introduced in this
                specification a mobile node / mobile router can bind one or more
                flows to a care-of address while maintaining the reception of
                other flows on another care-of address. The mobile node / mobile
                router assembles the flow binding request based local policies,
                link characteristics and the types of applications running at
                the time. Such policies are outside the scope of this document.</t>
            <t>It should be noted that the flow identification mobility option
                can be associated with any binding update, whether it is sent to
                a mobility agent or a correspondent node.</t>
            <t>Note that per-packet load balancing may have negative impacts on
                TCP congestion avoidance mechanisms as it is desirable to
                maintain order between packets belonging to the same TCP
                connection. This behaviour is specified in <xref
                    target="RFC2702"/>. Other negative impacts are also foreseen
                for other types of real time connections due to the potential
                variations in round trip time between packets. Moreover,
                per-packet load-balancing will negatively affect traffic with
                anti-reply protection mechanisms. Hence, per-packet load
                balancing is not envisioned in this specification. </t>
            <t>In the rest of the document, the term "mobile node" is used to
                designate either a mobile node as defined in <xref
                    target="RFC3775"/> and <xref target="RFC5648"/>, or a mobile
                router as defined in <xref target="RFC3963"/> unless stated
                otherwise.</t>

                used in this document:<list>
                    <t>Flow: A flow is as a set of data packets that are
                        exchanged between two nodes. In the context of this
                        specification the term "flow" is some times used to
                        refer to a plurality of flows as well as a single flow.</t>
                    <t>Traffic Selector: Information that identifies one or more
                        flows. </t>
                    <t>Flow binding: It consists of a traffic selector, and an
                        action. IP packets from one or more flows that match the
                        traffic selector associated with the flow binding, are
                        processed according to the action associated with the
                        same flow binding.</t>
                    <t>Flow Identifier: A flow identifier uniquely identifies a
                        flow binding associated with a mobile node. It is
                        generated by a mobile node and is cached in the table of
                        flow binding entries maintained by the MN, HA, CN or
                        MAP.</t>

                    the list is ordered according to the FID-PRI field as
                    defined in the FID option that created each entry.</t>
                <t> For entries that take BIDs (i.e., entries that do not
                    indicate a 'Discard' action), a valid BID is required to
                    make the entry 'Active'. If all of the BIDs pointed to by a
                    given entry are deregistered <xref target="RFC5648"/>, the
                    flow binding entry becomes 'Inactive', in other words it
                    does not affect data traffic. Note that if the action
                    parameter in an entry indicates 'Forward' then the entry
                    becomes 'Inactive' only if all of the BIDs are deregistered.
                    If only some of the BIDs are still valid, the invalid BIDs
                    are simply ignored.</t>
                <t>Also note that the state described in this section is
                    maintained by the mobile node as well as in mobility agents
                    and correspondent nodes. As such the mobile node is fully
                    aware of which are the valid BIDs at any time and which flow
                    binding entries are active/inactive. <xref
                        target="operation"/> defines how these flow binding
                    entries are manipulated by the mobile node in detail.</t>
                <t>As an example the following represents an ordered flow
                    binding entry table for a mobile node that has registered
                    multiple care-of addresses and flow bindings.</t>

                    to a given care-of address (IP3), as shown below. Any
                    traffic that is not TCP, but has as source address IPx will
                    match the second entry, and according to the associated
                    Action it will be discarded. Note that any TCP traffic with
                    source address IPx will match the first entry and thus it
                    will be forwarded as per that entry. </t>
                <t> The third entry is marked as Inactive since the BID 4 does
                    not exist in the ordered list of BID entries below. Inactive
                    entries do not affect traffic, i.e., packets are not matched
                    against them.</t>
                <t> Any UDP traffic that does not match any of the earlier
                    entries will match the forth rule and according to the
                    Action indicated, it will be replicated and forwarded to
                    BIDs 1 and 3, corresponding to care-of addresses IP1 and IP2
                    shown below. </t>
                <t>Finally any remaining packets that do not match any of the

                    address indicated by the highest order BID in the table

                <t>This specification introduces a flow bindings list of entries
                    and an ordered list of flow binding identifiers, allowing
                    mobile nodes to associate flow binding policies with the
                    registered care-of addresses.</t>
                <t>The flow identification mobility option defines how the
                    mobile node can control a set of flow binding entries
                    maintained in a mobility agent, or correspondent node. The
                    fields of the flow identification mobility option are
                    necessary for ordering flow identification mobility options,
                    indicating the sort of action that should be undertaken to
                    the recipient's flow binding list of entries or for carrying
                    the results of such a petition. </t>
                <t>This specification allows mobile nodes to direct flows to a
                    particular care-of address. The granularity of what
                    constitutes a flow depends on the traffic selector used. </t>
                <t>The remainder of this section discusses how mobile nodes can
                    use the options and sub-options defined in this document
                    when sending binding updates to the correspondent node, home
                    agent, or mobility anchor point. In addition, refresh,

                    <t>Any node that supports this specification MUST maintain
                        an ordered list of care-of addresses for each mobile
                        node it maintains a list of flow bindings for. The
                        ordered list of care-of addresses is built based on the
                        BID-PRI field of the binding identifier mobility option

            <section title="Mobile Node Considerations">
                <t>This specification allows the mobile node to maintain several
                    bindings with its mobility agent, and correspondent nodes
                    and to direct packets to different care-of addresses
                    according to flow bindings. This section details the mobile
                    node operations necessary to implement this specification.</t>
                <t>The mobility agent and correspondent node list of flow
                    bindings is manipulated by the mobile node, via flow
                    identification and flow summary mobility options included in
                    binding update messages. Each flow binding update can add,
                    modify, refresh, or delete a given binding. More than one
                    flow identification mobility options MAY be included in the
                    same binding update but each of them MUST include a
                    different FID. In other words, two flow identification
                    options in the same message can not be about the same flow
                    binding. </t>
                <t>All flow binding state MUST be refreshed in every binding
                    update the mobile node sends. Any previously registered flow
                    binding that is not included in a given binding update will
                    be deleted. So, any flow bindings that are not added or
                    modified by a flow identification mobility option, but have
                    previously registered and need to be maintained MUST be
                    included in a flow summary mobility option. Only one flow
                    summary mobility option can be included in a given binding
                    update.</t>

                        MUST NOT bind a flow to a care-of address whose keygen
                        token (see RFC3775 <xref target="RFC3775"/>) was not
                        used to generate the key for securing the Binding

                <section title="Packet Processing">
                    <t>This section defines packet processing rules according to
                        this specification. This specification does not change
                        any of the packet interception rules defined in <xref
                            target="RFC3775"/>, and <xref target="RFC5555"/>.
                        These rules apply to HAs, MAPs, and CNs, as part of the
                        routing process for any packet with destination address
                        set to a valid home address of the mobile node. For
                        nodes other than CNs this also applies to packets with
                        destination address set to an address under any of the
                        registered prefixes. These rules apply equally to IPv6
                        packets as well as to IPv4 packets as per <xref
                            target="RFC5555"/>. </t>
                    <t>Before a packet is forwarded to the mobile node it MUST
                        be matched against the ordered list of flow bindings
                        stored in the list of flow binding entries for this
                        mobile node (see <xref target="BCext"/>). A match is
                        attempted with the traffic selector included in the
                        first line (highest order) of the table. If the packet
                        matches the traffic selector, the action defined by the
                        action parameter of the table SHOULD be performed. <list>
                            <t>- if the Action indicates 'Discard', the packet
                                is silently discarded </t>
                            <t>- if the Action indicates 'Forward", a copy of
                                the packet is forwarded to each of the care-of
                                addresses associated with the BIDs indicated in
                                the same line of the table. </t>
                        </list>
                    </t>
                    <t>If the action indicated in one of the entries in the list
                        of flow bindings is 'Discard' then, no BIDs need to be
                        indicated in the same entry since the packet is not
                        forwarded. If, however, the action indicated in an entry
                        of the list of flow bindings is 'Forward", the entry
                        should indicate one or more valid BIDs. For 'Forward' if
                        any of the BIDs indicated does not correspond to a valid
                        care-of address, e.g., the BID was deregistered then
                        that BID has no effect on the traffic. In other words,
                        packets matching the flow binding are forwarded to the
                        remaining BIDs, pointing to registered care-of
                        addresses. If none of the BIDs pointed to in a flow
                        binding entry is valid then the entry is considered to
                        be inactive (as defined in <xref target="BCext"/>) and
                        is skipped. In other words packets should not be matched
                        against that entry.</t>
                    <t>If a packet does not match any of the active flow binding
                        entries for the given MN, the packet SHOULD be forwarded
                        to the care-of address associated with the BID with the
                        highest BID-PRI. </t>
                    <t>If a packet is fragmented, only the first fragment
                        contains all IP and transport layer headers, while
                        subsequent fragments only contain an IP header without
                        transport layer headers. For this reason it is possible
                        that subsequent fragments do not match the same traffic
                        selector as the initial fragment of such a packet.
                        Unless specific measures are taken the likely outcome is
                        that the initial fragment is routed as the MN intended
                        while subsequent fragments are routed differently, and
                        probably based on the default flow binding. HAs, MAPs,
                        and CNs SHOULD take care to forward all fragments of a
                        given packet the same way, and in accordance to the flow
                        binding matching the first fragment of said packet. This
                        should be possible given the fact that fragment headers
                        include enough information to identify a fragment as
                        part of a specific packet, but the details of how this
                        is ensured are implementation specific and are not
                        defined in this specification. </t>

            <t>This draft introduces a new option that adds more granularity to
                the binding update message. The new option allows the mobile
                node to associate some flows to one interface and other flows to
                another interface. Since the flow identification mobility option
                is part of the mobility header, it uses the same security as the
                Binding Update, whether it is sent to a mobility agent, or to a
