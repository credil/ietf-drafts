   recent documents have proposed ways to modify GMPLS signaling 
   protocols to support these new OTN features.  

   It is important that a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS 
   signaling and routing protocols. This solution must support ODUk 
   multiplexing capabilities, address all of the new features, be 
   acceptable to all equipment vendors, and be extensible considering 
   continued OTN evolution.  

   This document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolutive 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) addressing ODUk multiplexing and new 
   features including ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to include Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex 
   (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and ODU), Wavelength (OCh, Lambdas) Switching, 
   and Spatial Switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port 
   or fiber). [RFC3471] presents a functional description of the 
   extensions to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling 
   required to support Generalized MPLS.  RSVP-TE-specific formats and 
   mechanisms and technology specific details are defined in [RFC3473]. 

   With the evolution and deployment of G.709 technology, it is 
   necessary that appropriate enhanced control technology support be 
   provided for G.709. [RFC4328] describes the control technology 
   details that are specific to foundation G.709 Optical Transport 
   Networks (OTN), as specified in the ITU-T G.709 recommendation [ITUT-
   G709], for ODUk deployments without multiplexing. 

   In addition to increasing need to support ODUk multiplexing, the 
   evolution of OTN has introduced additional containers and new 
   flexibility. For example, ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 containers as described 
   in [G709-Amd3], and ODUflex being developed in [G709-v3]. 

   In addition, the following issues require consideration: 

      -  Support for ODUflex resizing capabilities, potentially hitless 
         (similar to LCAS, as defined in [VCAT-LCAS]), which is under 
         discussion in ITU-T. 

      -  Support for Tributary Port Number. The Tributary Port Number 
         has to be negotiated on each link for flexible assignment of 
         tributary ports to tributary slots in case of LO-ODU over HO-
         ODU (e.g., ODU2 into ODU3). Alternatively, the nodes of the 
         network are supposed to run AutoMSI mode. 

   Therefore, it is clear that [RFC4328] has to be updated or replaced 
   in order to support ODUk multiplexing, as well as other ODU 
   enhancements introduced by evolution of OTN standards.  

   This document updates RFC4328 extending the G.709 ODUk traffic 
   parameters and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible and scalable.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. GMPLS Extensions for the Evolutive G.709 - Overview 

   The new features for the evolutive OTN are described in the separate 
   ITU-T documents, for example, ODU0, ODU2e,ODU4 are described in 
   [G709-Amd3] and ODUflex is being developed in [G709-v3]. 

   The new signal types of digital wrapper layer for the evolutive OTN 
   are listed as follows: 

      - Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk): 
         . OTU4 

      - Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 
         . ODU0 
         . ODU2e 
         . ODU4 
         . ODUflex 

   A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) is introduced 
   in [G709-Amd3]. At this point there are two TS granularities for the 
   original ODU1, ODU2, ODU3. The TS granularity at 2.5 Gbps is used on 
   legacy interfaces while the new 1.25 Gbps will be used for the new 
   interfaces. 

   New ITU-T documents not only introduce new signal types but also 
   define the new multiplexing hierarchy for the evolutive OTN. In 
   addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4), 
   G.709 and its amendments, support ODUk multiplexing. For the 
   evolutive OTN, the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) 
   into an ODUk (k > j) signal can be depicted as follows: 

      -  ODU0 into ODU1 multiplexing (with 1,25Gbps TS granularity) 

      -  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex into ODU2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS 
         granularity) 

      -  ODU1 into ODU2 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

      -  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e and ODUflex into ODU3 multiplexing 
         (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity)

      -  ODU1, ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

      -  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3 and ODUflex into ODU4 
         multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

   [RFC4328] describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control 
   for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN) [ITUT-G709]. However, 
   [RFC4328] need to be updated because it does not provide the means to 
   signal all the new signal types and related mapping and multiplexing 
   functionalities. Moreover, it supports only the optional auto-MSI 
   mode which assumes that the Tributary Port Number is automatically 
   assigned in the transmit direction and not checked in the receive 
   direction. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible and scalable. 

   [Editors note] There are several possibilities to include the 
   Tributary Port Number information in the signaling. Note that ITU-T 
   has not yet given a clear interpretation of the Tributary Port number 
   information in case of bidirectional paths, so the adoption of any 
   solution should be kept on hold until ITU-T provides an approved 
   definition. 

4. Extensions for Traffic Parameters for the Evolutive G.709 

   The traffic parameters for G.709 are defined as follows: 

    

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |  Signal Type  |   Tolerance   |              NMC              | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |              NVC              |        Multiplier (MT)        | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                            Bit_Rate                           | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   [Editors note] NMC field in RFC4328 had the meaning to indicate how 
   many labels have to be expected.  This information allows the 
   protocol to operate without specific knowledge of the signal type. 
   The same effect could be obtained either indicating the bit map 
   length or indicating the number of labels.

   The Signal Type should be extended to cover the new Signal Type 
   introduced by the evolutive OTN. The new Signal Type is extended as 
   follows: 

      Value  Type 
      -----  ---- 
      0      Not significant 
      1      ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps) 
      2      ODU2 (i.e., 10 Gbps) 
      3      ODU3 (i.e., 40 Gbps) 
      4      ODU4 (i.e., 100 Gbps) 
      5      Reserved (for future use) 
      6      OCh at 2.5 Gbps 
      7      OCh at 10 Gbps 
      8      OCh at 40 Gbps 
      9      OCh at 100 Gbps 
      10~19  Reserved (for future use) 
      20     ODU0 (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 
      21~30  Reserved (for future use) 
      31     ODU2e (i.e., 10Gbps for FC1200 and GE LAN) 
      32     ODUflex (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      33~255 Reserved (for future use) 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields are used 
   together to represent the actual bandwidth of ODUflex, where: 

   -  The Bit_Rate field indicates the nominal bit rate of ODUflex(CBR) 
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number 
      (referring to [RFC4506] and [IEEE]). 

   -  The Tolerance field indicates the bit rate tolerance (part per 
      million, ppm) of the ODUflex(CBR) encoded as an unsigned integer.  

   For example, for an ODUflex(CBR) service with Bit_Rate = 2.5Gbps and 
   Tolerance = 50ppm, the actual bandwidth of the ODUflex is: 

               2.5Gbps * (1 - 50ppm) ~ 2.5Gbps * (1 + 50ppm) 

   In case of other ODUk signal types, the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields 
   are not necessary and MUST be filled with 0.

4.1. Usage of ODUflex traffic parameter 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the information of Bit_Rate and Tolerance in 
   the ODUflex traffic parameter is used to determine the total number 
   of tributary slots N in the HO ODUk link to be reserved. Here:  

         N = Ceiling of 

   ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate * (1 + ODUflex(CBR) bit rate tolerance) 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
       ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

    
   Therefore, a node receiving a Path message containing ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter can allocate precise number of tributary slots and 
   set up the cross-connection for the ODUflex service. 

   The table below shows the actual bandwidth of the tributary slot of 
   ODUk (in Gbps), referring to [G709-v3]. 

      ODUk       Minimum          Nominal          Maximum 
      ------------------------------------------------------- 
      ODU2    1.249 384 632    1.249 409 620    1.249 434 608 
      ODU3    1.254 678 635    1.254 703 729    1.254 728 823 
      ODU4    1.301 683 217    1.301 709 251    1.301 735 285 

      Note that: 

      Minimum bandwidth of ODUTk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

      Maximum bandwidth of ODTUk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 + HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

      Where: HO OPUk bit rate tolerance = 20ppm 

   For different ODUk, the bandwidths of the tributary slot are 
   different, and so the total number of tributary slots to be reserved 
   for the ODUflex(CBR) may not be the same on different HO ODUk links. 
   This is why the traffic parameter should bring the actual bandwidth 
   information other than the NMC field. 

   In case of ODUflex(GFP), the total number of tributary slots to be 
   reserved for one ODUflex service MUST keep the same in different HO 
   ODUk links. So the NMC field can be used to indicate the total number 
   of TS, instead of using the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields. Therefore, 
   when Signal Type = ODUflex(32), the zero value of NMC field and

   nonzero values of Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields imply an ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter, and the nonzero value of NMC field and zero values 
   of Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields imply an ODUflex(GFP) traffic 
   parameter. 

4.2. Example of ODUflex traffic parameter 

   This section gives an example to illustrate the usage of ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter. 

   Assume there is an ODUflex(CBR) service requesting a bandwidth of 
   (2.5Gbps, +/-20ppm) from node A to node C. In other words, the 
   ODUflex traffic parameter indicates that Signal Type is 32 (ODUflex), 
   Bit_Rate is 2.5Gbps and Tolerance is 20ppm.

       =========: TS occupied by ODUflex 
       ---------: free TS 
    

   -  On the HO ODU4 link between node A and B: 

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm), 
      and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU4 equals 
      1.301 683 217Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots N1 to 
      be reserved on this link is: 

      N1 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm) / 1.301 683 217) = 2 

   -  On the HO ODU2 link between node B and C: 

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm), 
      and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU2 equals 
      1.249 384 632Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots N2 to 
      be reserved on this link is: 

      N2 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm) / 1.249 384 632) = 3

5. Generalized Label 

   [RFC3471] has defined the Generalized Label which extends the 
   traditional label by allowing the representation of not only labels 
   which travel in-band with associated data packets, but also labels 
   which identify time-slots, wavelengths, or space division multiplexed 
   positions. The format of the corresponding RSVP-TE Generalized Label   
   object is defined in the Section 2.3 of [RFC3473]. 

   However, for different technologies, we usually need use specific 
   label rather than the Generalized Label. For example, the label 
   format described in [RFC4606] could be used for SDH/SONET, the label 
   format in [RFC4328] for G.709. 

   According to the ODUk label format defined in [RFC4328], it could be 
   updated to support new signal types defined in G.709 amendment 3 but 
   would hardly be further enhanced to support possible new signal types. 
   Furthermore such label format can face big problems related to 
   scalability matters due to the high number of labels needed. For 
   example, when ODU3 is mapped into ODU4 with 1.25G tributary slots, it 
   will need thirty-one labels (31*4*8=992 bits) to be allocated for one 
   ODU3 connection. If ODUflex into ODU4, it may need up to eighty 
   labels (80*4*8=2560 bits) to be allocated for one ODUflex connection. 

   In this document, a new ODUk label format is defined. The new ODUk 
   label format is very flexible and scalable. 

5.1. New definition of ODUk label  

   In order to be compatible with new types of ODU signal and new types 
   of tributary slot, the following new ODUk label format is defined: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   ODUj and OD(T)Uk (4 bits respectively): indicate that LO ODUj is 
   multiplexed into HO ODUk(k>j), or LO ODUj is mapped into OTUk (j=k).

   In case of an ODUk mapped into OTUk, it's no need to indicate which 
   tributary slots will be used, so the size of Bit Map is 0. 

   Padded bits are added behind the Bit Map to make the whole label a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary. Padded bit MUST be set to 0 and 
   MUST be ignored. 

   [Editors note] Tributary Port Number information to be inserted as 
   soon as clarification from ITU has been provided.

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the label 
   format described in the previous sections of this document. 

   (1) ODUk into OTUk mapping:  

   In such conditions, the downstream node along an LSP returns a label 
   indicating that the ODU1 (ODU2 or ODU3 or ODU4) is directly mapped 
   into the corresponding OTU1 (OTU2 or OTU3 or ODU4). The following 
   example label indicates an ODU1 mapped into OTU1.

   and 7th tributary slot of ODU3, wherein the type of the tributary 
   slot is 2.5Gbps. 

5.3. Label Distribution Procedure 

   This document does not change the existing label distribution 
   procedures [RFC4328] for GMPLS except that the new ODUk label should 
   be processed as follows. 

   When a node receives a generalized label request for setting up an 
   ODUj LSP from its upstream node, the node should generate an ODU 
   label according to the signal type of the requested LSP and the free 
   resources (i.e., free tributary slots of ODUk) that will be reserved 
   for the LSP, and send the label to its upstream node. Note that these 
   labels can also be specified by the source node of the connection.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then set the bits to 1 in 
   the Bit Map field corresponding to the reserved tributary slots. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the node only needs to fill the ODUj 
   and the ODUk fields with corresponding values in the label. Other 
   bits are reserved and MUST be set to 0.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-04.txt              February 2010 


   When receiving an ODU label from its downstream node, the node should 
   learn which ODU signal type is multiplexed or mapped into which ODU 
   signal type by analyzing the ODUj and the ODUk fields.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then obtain which tributary 
   slots in ODUk are reserved by its downstream node according to the 
   position of the bits that are set to 1 in the Bit Map field, so that 
   the node can multiplex the ODUj into the reserved tributary slots of 
   ODUk after the LSP is established. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the size of Bit Map field is 0 and 
   no additional procedure is needed. 

5.4. Backward Compatibility Considerations 

5.4.1. Control Plane Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   Since the [RFC4328] has been deployed in the network for the nodes 
   which support the [ITUT-G709] (herein we call them "old nodes"), the 
   backward compatibility SHOULD be take into consideration when the new 
   nodes (i.e., nodes that support the [G709-Amd3] or [G709-v3]) and the 
   old nodes are interworking. 

   For backward compatibility consideration, the new node SHOULD have 
   the ability to generate and parse old labels. 

   o  For the old node, it always generates and sends old label to its 
      upstream node, no matter the upstream node is new or old, as 
      described in [RFC4328]. 

   o  For the new node, it will generate and send old label if its 
      upstream node is an old one, and generate and send new label if 
      its upstream node is a new one. 

   One backward compatibility example is shown below: 

            Path          Path          Path          Path 
    +-----+ ----> +-----+ ----> +-----+ ----> +-----+ ----> +-----+ 
    |     |       |     |       |     |       |     |       |     | 
    |  A  +-------+  B  +-------+  C  +-------+  D  +-------+  E  | 
    |(new)|       |(new)|       |(old)|       |(old)|       |(new)| 
    +-----+ <---- +-----+ <---- +-----+ <---- +-----+ <---- +-----+ 
             Resv          Resv          Resv          Resv 
          (new label)   (old label)   (old label)   (old label)

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-04.txt              February 2010 


   As described above, for backward compatibility considerations, it is 
   necessary for a new node to know whether the neighbor node is new or 
   old. 

   One optional method is manual configuration. But it is recommended to 
   use LMP to discover the capability of the neighbor node automatically, 
   as described in [OTN-LMP].  

   When performing the HO ODU link capability negotiation: 

   o  If the neighbor node only support the 2.5Gbps TS and only support 
      ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, the neighbor node should be treated as an old node. 

   o  If the neighbor node can support the 1.25Gbps TS, or can support 
      other LO ODU types defined in [G709-Amd3] or [G709-v3]), the 
      neighbor node should be treated as new node. 

   o  If the neighbor node returns a LinkSummaryNack message including 
      an ERROR_CODE indicating nonsupport of HO ODU link capability 
      negotiation, the neighbor node should be treated as an old node. 

    

5.4.2. Data Plane Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   As described in chapter 3.1 and 4.1 of [OTN-LMP], the node supporting 
   1.25Gbps TS can interwork with the other nodes that supporting 
   2.5Gbps TS by combining Specific TSs together in data plane. The 
   control plane MUST support this TS combination. 

   Take the following figure as an example. Assume that there is an ODU2 
   link between node A and B, where node A only supports the 2.5Gbps TS 
   while node B supports the 1.25Gbps TS. In this case, the TS#i and 
   TS#i+4 (where i<=4) of node B are combined together. When creating an 
   ODU1 service in this ODU2 link, node B reserves the TS#i and TS#i+4 
   with the granularity of 1.25Gbps. But in the label sent from B to A, 
   it is indicated that the TS#i with the granularity of 2.5Gbps is 
   reserved.

            node A           Resv           node B 

   In the contrary direction, when receiving a label from node A 
   indicating that the TS#i with the granularity of 2.5Gbps is reserved, 
   node B will reserved the TS#i and TS#i+4 with the granularity of 
   1.25Gbps in its control plane. 

5.5. Collision management 

   [Editors note] This chapter should indicate the procedure in case of 
   collision between Tributary Port Numbers and/or Tributary Slots e.g. 
   two different LSP setups may choose a disjoint set of Tributary Slots 
   but they may request the same Tributary Port Number value (same MSI 
   in G.709 OPUk field). 

   In this case the first signaling should be successful and the second 
   one must fail.

   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of   
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be   
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology   
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license   
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it   
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any   
   such rights.

   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or   
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or   
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR   
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement   
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please   
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org. 

   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or   
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are   
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into   
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions   
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions

   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards   
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of   
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the   
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms,   
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the   
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect and   
   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such   
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
