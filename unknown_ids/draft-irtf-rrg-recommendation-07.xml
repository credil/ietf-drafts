ITRs drop the packet(s) they have no mapping	  for.  After the mapping arrives, the ITR waits for a resent	  packet and will tunnel that packet correctly.  These "initial	  packet delays" reduce performance and so create a major barrier	  to voluntary adoption on wide enough basis to solve the routing	  scaling problem.	</t>	<t>	  ALT's delays are compounded by its structure being "aggressively	  aggregated", without regard to the geographic location of the	  routers.  Tunnels between ALT routers will often span	  intercontinental distances and traverse many Internet routers.	</t>	<t>	  The many levels to which a query typically ascends in the ALT	  hierarchy before descending towards its destination will often	  involve excessively long geographic paths and so worsen initial	  packet delays.	</t>	<t>	  No solution has been proposed for these problems or for the	  contradiction between the need for high aggregation while making	  the ALT structure robust against single points of failure.	</t>	<t>	  LISP's ITRs multihoming service restoration depends on them	  determining reachability of end-user networks via two or more	  ETRs.  Large numbers of ITRs doing this is inefficient and may	  overburden ETRs.	</t>	<t>	  Testing reachability of the ETRs is complex and costly - and	  insufficient.  ITRs cannot test network reachability via each	  ETR, since the ITRs have no address of a device in that network.	  So ETRs must report network un-reachability to ITRs.	</t>	<t>	  LISP involves complex communication between ITRs and ETRs, with	  UDP and 64-bit LISP headers in all traffic packets.	</t>	<t>	  The advantage of LISP+ALT is that its ability to handle billions	  of EIDs is not constrained by the need to transmit or store the	  mapping to any one location.  Such numbers, beyond a few tens of	  millions of EIDs, will only result if the system is used for	  Mobility.  Yet the concerns just mentioned about ALT's structure	  arise from the millions of ETRs which would be needed just for	  non-mobile networks.	</t>	<t>	  In LISP's mobility approach each MN needs an RLOC address to be	  its own ETR, meaning the MN cannot be behind NAT. Mapping changes	  must be sent instantly to all relevant ITRs every time the MN	  gets a new address - which LISP cannot achieve.	</t>	<t>	  In order to enforce ISP filtering of incoming packets by source	  address, LISP ITRs would have to implement the same filtering on	  each decapsulated packet. This may be prohibitively expensive.	</t>	<t>	  LISP monolithically integrates multihoming failure detection and	  restoration decision-making processes into the core-edge	  separation scheme itself.  End-user networks must rely on the	  necessarily limited capabilities which are built into every ITR.	</t>	<t>	  LISP-ALT may be able to solve the routing scaling problem, but	  alternative approaches would be superior because they eliminate	  the initial packet delay problem and give end-user networks	  real-time control over ITR tunneling.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  Initial-packet loss/delays turn out not to be a deep	  issue. Mechanisms for interoperation with the legacy part of the	  network are needed in any viably deployable design, and LISP has	  such mechanisms. If needed, initial packets can be sent via those	  legacy mechanisms until the ITR has a mapping. (Field experience	  has shown that the caches on those interoperation devices are	  guaranteed to be populated, as 'crackers' doing address-space	  sweeps periodically send packets to every available mapping.)	</t>	<t>	  On ALT issues, it is not at all mandatory that ALT be the mapping	  system used in the long term. LISP has a standardized mapping	  system interface, in part to allow reasonably smooth deployment	  of whatever new mapping system(s) experience might show are	  required. At least one other mapping system (LISP-TREE), which	  avoids ALT's problems (such as query load concentration at	  high-level nodes), has already been laid out and extensively	  simulated. Exactly what mixture of mapping system(s) is optimal	  is not really answerable without more extensive experience, but	  LISP is designed to allow evolutionary changes to other mapping	  system(s).	</t>	<t>	  As far as ETR reachability goes, a potential problem to which	  there is a solution which has an adequate level of efficiency,	  complexity and robustness is not really a problem. LISP has a	  number of overlapping mechanisms which it is believed will	  provide adequate reachability detection (along the three axes	  above), and in field testing to date, they have behaved as	  expected.	</t>	<t>	  Operation of LISP devices behind a NAT has already been	  demonstrated. A number of mechanisms to update correspondent	  nodes when a mapping is updated have been designed (some are	  already in use).	</t>      </section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title="Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet		    (RANGI)">       <section title='Summary'>	<section title="Key Idea">	  <t>	    Similar to HIP <xref target='RFC4423'/>, RANGI introduces a host	    identifier layer between the network layer and the transport	    layer, and the transport-layer associations (i.e., TCP	    connections) are no longer bound to IP addresses, but to host	    identifiers. The major difference from the HIP is that the host	    identifier in RANGI is a 128-bit hierarchical and cryptographic	    identifier which has organizational structure. As a result, the	    corresponding ID->locator mapping system for such identifiers has	    reasonable business model and clear trust boundaries. In	    addition, RANGI uses IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses as locators. The	    LD ID (i.e., the leftmost 96 bits) of this locator is a	    provider-assigned /96 IPv6 prefix, while the last four octets of	    this locator is a local IPv4 address (either public or	    private). This special locator could be used to realize 6over4	    automatic tunneling (borrowing ideas from ISATAP	    <xref target='RFC5214'/>), which will reduce the deployment cost	    of this new routing architecture. Within RANGI, the mappings from	    FQDN to host identifiers are stored in the DNS system, while the	    mappings from host identifiers to locators are stored in a	    distributed id/locator mapping system (e.g., a hierarchical	    Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system, or a reverse DNS system).	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Gains'>	  <t>	    RANGI achieves almost all of goals set by RRG as follows:	    <list style='numbers'>	      <t>		Routing Scalability: Scalability is achieved by decoupling		identifiers from locators.	      </t>	      <t>		Traffic Engineering: Hosts located in a multi-homed site can		suggest the upstream ISP for outbound and inbound traffics,		while the first-hop LDBR (i.  e., site border router) has the		final decision right on the upstream ISP selection.	      </t>	      <t>		Mobility and Multi-homing: Sessions will not be interrupted		due to locator change in cases of mobility or multi-homing.	      </t>	      <t>		Simplified Renumbering: When changing providers, the local		IPv4 addresses of the site do not need to change. Hence the		internal routers within the site don't need renumbering.	      </t>	      <t>		Decoupling Location and Identifier: Obvious.	      </t>	      <t>		Routing Stability: Since the locators are topologically		aggregatable and the internal topology within LD will not be		disclosed outside, the routing stability could be improved		greatly.	      </t>	      <t>		Routing Security: RANGI reuses the current routing system		and does not introduce any new security risk into the		routing system.	      </t>	      <t>		Incremental Deployability: RANGI allows easy transition from		IPv4 network to IPv6 network. In addition, RANGI proxy allows		RANGI-aware hosts to communicate to legacy IPv4 or IPv6		hosts, and vice versa.	      </t>	    </list>	  </t>	</section>	<section title="Costs">	  <t>	    <list style='numbers'>	      <t>		Host change is required	      </t>	      <t>		First-hop LDBR change is required to support site-controlled		traffic-engineering capability.	      </t>	      <t>		The ID->Locator mapping system is a new infrastructure to be		deployed.	      </t>	      <t>		Proxy needs to be deployed for communication between		RANGI-aware hosts and legacy hosts.	      </t>	    </list>	  </t>	</section>      </section>      <section title='Critique'>	<t>	  RANGI is an ID/locator split protocol that, like HIP, places a	  cryptographically signed ID between the network layer (IPv6) and	  transport. Unlike the HIP ID, the RANGI ID has a hierarchical	  structure that allows it to support ID->locator lookups. This	  hierarchical structure addresses two weaknesses of the flat HIP	  ID: the difficulty of doing the ID->locator lookup, and the	  administrative scalability of doing firewall filtering on flat	  IDs. The usage of this hierarchy is overloaded: it serves to make	  the ID unique, to drive the lookup process, and possibly other	  things like firewall filtering.  More thought is needed as to	  what constitutes these levels with respect to these various	  roles.	</t>	<t>	  The RANGI draft suggests FQDN->ID lookup through DNS, and	  separately an ID->locator lookup which may be DNS or may be	  something else (a hierarchy of DHTs).  It would be more efficient	  if the FQDN lookup produces both ID and locators (as does ILNP).	  Probably DNS alone is sufficient for the ID->locator lookup since	  individual DNS servers can hold very large numbers of mappings.	</t>	<t>	  RANGI provides strong sender identification, but at the cost of	  computing crypto.  Many hosts (public web servers) may prefer to	  forgo the crypto at the expense of losing some functionality	  (receiver mobility or dynamic multihome load balance).  While	  RANGI doesn't require that the receiver validate the sender, it	  may be good to have a mechanism whereby the receiver can signal	  to the sender that it is not validating, so that the sender can	  avoid locator changes.	</t>	<t>	  Architecturally there are many advantages to putting the mapping	  function at the end host (versus at the edge).  This simplifies	  the neighbor aliveness and delayed first packet problems, and	  avoids statefull middleboxes.  Unfortunately, the early-adopter	  incentive for host upgrade may not be adequate (HIP's lack of	  uptake being an example).	</t>	<t>	  RANGI does not have an explicit solution for the mobility race	  condition (there is no mention of a home-agent like device).	  However, host-to-host notification combined with fallback on the	  ID->locators lookup (assuming adequate dynamic update of the	  lookup system) may be good enough for the vast majority of	  mobility situations.	</t>	<t>	  RANGI uses proxies to deal with both legacy IPv6 and IPv4 sites.	  RANGI proxies have no mechanisms to deal with the edge-to-edge	  aliveness problem. The edge-to-edge proxy approach dirties-up an	  otherwise clean end-to-end model.	</t>	<t>	  RANGI exploits existing IPv6 transition technologies (ISATAP and	  softwire).  These transition technologies are in any event being	  pursued outside of RRG and do not need to be specified in RANGI	  drafts per se.  RANGI only needs to address how it interoperates	  with IPv4 and legacy IPv6, which through proxies it appears to do	  adequately well.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  The reason why the ID->Locator lookup is separated from the	  FQDN->ID lookup is: 1) not all applications are tied to FQDNs,	  and 2) it seems not necessary to require all devices to possess a	  FQDN of their own. Basically RANGI uses DNS to realize the	  ID->Locator mapping system. If there are too many entries to be	  maintained by the authoritative servers of a given Administrative	  Domain (AD), Distribute Hash Table (DHT) technology can be used	  to make these authoritative servers scale better, e.g., the	  mappings maintained by a given AD will be distributed among a	  group of authoritative servers in a DHT fashion. As a result, the	  robustness feature of DHT is inherited naturally into the	  ID->Locator mapping system. Meanwhile, there is no trust issue	  since each AD authority runs its own DHT ring which maintains	  only its presidial mappings.	</t>	<t>	  For host mobility, if communicating entities are RANGI nodes, the	  mobile node will notice the correspondence node of its new	  locator once its locator changes due to a mobility or re-homing	  event. Meanwhile, it should also update its locator information	  in the ID->Locator mapping system timely by using the Secure DNS	  Dynamic Update mechanism defined in <xref target='RFC3007'/>.

It provides multihoming, portability	    of address space and inbound traffic engineering for end-user	    networks of all sizes and types, including those of	    corporations, SOHO and mobile devices.	  </t>	  <t>	    Ivip meets all the constraints imposed by the need for widespread	    voluntary adoption <xref target='Ivip Constraints' />.	  </t>	  <t>	    Ivip's global fast-push mapping distribution network is	    structured like a cross-linked multicast tree.  This pushes all	    mapping changes to full database query servers (QSDs) within	    ISPs and end-user networks which have ITRs.  Each mapping	    change is sent to all QSDs within a few seconds.	  </t>	  <t>	    ITRs gain mapping information from these local QSDs within a	    few tens of milliseconds.  QSDs notify ITRs of changed mapping	    with similarly low latency.  ITRs tunnel all traffic packets to	    the correct ETR without significant delay.	  </t>	  <t>	    Ivip's mapping consists of a single ETR address for each range	    of mapped address space.  Ivip ITRs do not need to test	    reachability to ETRs because the mapping is changed in	    real-time to that of the desired ETR.	  </t>	  <t>	    End-user networks control the mapping, typically by contracting	    a specialized company to monitor the reachability of their ETRs	    and change the mapping to achieve multihoming and/or TE.  So	    the mechanisms which control ITR tunneling are controlled by	    the end-user networks in real-time and are completely separate	    from the core-edge separation scheme itself.	  </t>	  <t>	    ITRs can be implemented in dedicated servers or hardware-based	    routers.  The ITR function can also be integrated into sending	    hosts.  ETRs are relatively simple and only communicate with	    ITRs rarely - for Path MTU management with longer packets.	  </t>	  <t>	    Ivip-mapped ranges of end-user address space need not be subnets.	    They can be of any length, in units of IPv4 addresses or IPv6 /64s.	  </t>	  <t>	    Compared to conventional unscalable BGP techniques, and to the	    use of core-edge separation architectures with non-real-time	    mapping systems, end-user networks will be able to achieve more	    flexible and responsive inbound TE.  If inbound traffic is	    split into several streams, each to addresses in different	    mapped ranges, then real-time mapping changes can be used to	    steer the streams between multiple ETRs at multiple ISPs.	  </t>	  <t>	    Default ITRs in the DFZ (DITRs, similar to LISP's Proxy Tunnel	    Routers) tunnel packets sent by hosts in networks which lack	    ITRs.  So multihoming, portability and TE benefits apply to all	    traffic.	  </t>	  <t>	    ITRs request mapping either directly from a local QSD or via	    one or more layers of caching query servers (QSCs) which in	    turn request it from a local QSD.  QSCs are optional but	    generally desirable since they reduce the query load on QSDs.	  </t>	  <t>	    ETRs may be in ISP or end-user networks.  IP-in-IP encapsulation is	    used, so there is no UDP or any other header.  PMTUD (Path MTU	    Discovery) management with minimal complexity and overhead will	    handle the problems caused by encapsulation, and adapt smoothly to	    jumbo frame paths becoming available in the DFZ.  The outer header's	    source address is that of the sending host - which enables existing	    ISP BR filtering of source addresses to be extended to encapsulated	    traffic packets by the simple mechanism of the ETR dropping packets	    whose inner and outer source address do not match.	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Extensions'>	  <section title='TTR Mobility'>	    <t>	      The TTR approach to mobility <xref target='Ivip Mobility' /> is	      applicable to all core-edge separation techniques and provides	      scalable IPv4 and IPv6 mobility in which the MN keeps its own	      mapped IP address(es) no matter how or where it is physically	      connected, including behind one or more layers of NAT.	    </t>	    <t>	      Path-lengths are typically optimal or close to optimal and	      the MN communicates normally with all other non-mobile hosts	      (no stack or app changes), and of course other MNs.

However the details differ	  substantially. Ivip design takes a bold assumption that, with	  technology advances, one could afford to maintain a real time	  distributed global mapping database for all networks and	  hosts. Ivip proposes that multiple parties collaborate to build a	  mapping distribution system which pushes all mapping information	  and updates to local, full database query servers located in all	  ISPs within a few seconds.  The system has no single point of	  failure, and uses end-to end authentication.	</t>	<t>	  "Real time, globally synchronized mapping database" is a critical	  assumption in Ivip. Using that as a foundation, Ivip design	  avoids several challenging design issues that LISP team has	  studied extensively, which include	  <list style='numbers'>	    <t>	      special considerations of mobility support which adds	      additional complexity to the overall system;	    </t>	    <t>	      prompt detection of ETR failures and notification to all	      relevant ITRs, which turn out to be a rather difficult	      problem; and	    </t>	    <t>	      development of LISP-ALT lookup sub-system. Ivip assumes the	      existence of local query servers with full database with the	      latest mapping information changes.	    </t>	  </list>	</t>	<t>	  However to be considered as a viable solution to Internet routing	  scalability problem, Ivip faces two fundamental questions.	  First, it is an entirely open question whether a global-scale	  system is able to achieve real time synchronized operations as	  assumed by Ivip.  Past experiences suggest otherwise.	</t>	<t>	  The second question concerns incremental rollout. Ivip represents	  an ambitious approach, with real-time mapping and local full	  database query servers - which many people regard as impossible.	  Developing and implementing Ivip may take fair amount of	  resources, yet there is an open question regarding how to	  *quantify* the gains by first movers - both those who will	  provide the Ivip infrastructure and those which will use	  it. Significant global routing table reduction only happens when	  a large enough number of parties have adopted Ivip. The same	  question arises for most other proposals as well.	</t>	<t>	  One belief is that Ivip's more ambitious mapping system makes a	  good design tradeoff for the greater benefits for end-user	  networks and for those which develop the infrastructure. Another	  belief is that this ambitious design is not viable.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  Since the Summary and Critique were written, Ivip's mapping system	  has been significantly redesigned: DRTM - Distributed Real Time	  Mapping <xref target="I-D.whittle-ivip-drtm"/>.	</t>	<t>	  DRTM makes it easier for ISPs to install their own ITRs.  It also	  facilitates MAB (Mapped Address Block) operating companies - which	  need not be ISPs - leasing SPI address space to end-user networks	  with almost no ISP involvement.  ISPs need not install ITRs or ETRs.	  For an ISP to support its customers using SPI space, they need only	  allow the forwarding outgoing packets whose source addresses are from	  SPI space.  End-user networks can implement their own ETRs on their	  existing PA address(es) - and MAB operating companies make all the	  initial investments.	</t>	<t>	  Once SPI adoption becomes widespread, ISPs will be motivated to	  install their own ITRs to locally tunnel packets sent from customer	  networks which must be tunneled to SPI-using customers of the same	  ISP - rather than letting these packets exit the ISP's network and	  return in tunnels to ETRs in the network.	</t>	<t>	  There is no need for full-database query servers in ISPs or for any	  device which stores the full mapping information for all Mapped	  Address Blocks (MABs).  ISPs which want ITRs will install two or more	  Map Resolver (MR) servers.  These are caching query servers which	  query multiple typically nearby query servers which are full-database	  for the subset of MABs they serve.  These "nearby" query servers will	  be at DITR (Default ITR in the DFZ) sites, which will be run by, or	  for, MAB operating companies who lease MAB space to large numbers of	  end-user networks.  These DITR-site servers will usually be close	  enough to the MRs to generate replies with sufficiently low delay and	  risk of packet loss for ITRs to buffer initial packets for a few tens	  of milliseconds while the mapping arrives.	</t>	<t>	  DRTM will scale to billions of micronets, tens of thousands of MABs	  and potentially hundreds of MAB operating companies, without single	  points of failure or central coordination.	</t>	<t>	  The critique implies a threshold of adoption is required before	  significant routing scaling benefits occur.  This is untrue of any	  Core-Edge Separation proposal, including LISP and Ivip.  Both can	  achieve scalable routing benefits in direct proportion to their level	  of adoption by providing portability, multihoming and inbound TE to	  large numbers of end-user networks.	</t>	<t>	  Core-Edge Elimination architectures require all Internet	  communications to change to IPv6 with a new Locator/Identifier	  Separation naming model.  This would impose burdens of extra	  management effort, packets and session establishment delays on all	  hosts - which is a particularly unacceptable burden on	  battery-operated mobile hosts which rely on wireless links.	</t>	<t>	  Core-Edge Separation architectures retain the current, efficient,	  naming model, require no changes to hosts and support both IPv4 and	  IPv6.  Ivip is the most promising architecture for future development	  because its scalable, distributed, real-time mapping system best	  supports TTR Mobility, enables ITRs to be simpler and gives real-time	  control of ITR tunneling to the end-user network or to organizations	  they appoint to control the mapping of their micronets.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title="hIPv4">      <section title='Summary'>	<section title='Key Idea'>	  <t>	    The hierarchical IPv4 framework is adding scalability in the	    routing architecture by introducing hierarchy in the IPv4	    address space. The IPv4 addressing scheme is divided into two	    parts, the Area Locator (ALOC) address space which is globally	    unique and the Endpoint Locator (ELOC) address space which is	    only regionally unique. The ALOC and ELOC prefixes are added as	    a shim header between the IP header and transport protocol	    header, the shim header is identified with a new protocol	    number in the IP header. Instead of creating a tunneling	    (i.e. overlay) solution a new routing element is needed in the	    service provider's routing domain (called ALOC realm) - a	    Locator Swap Router. The current IPv4 forwarding plane remains	    intact, also no new routing protocols, mapping systems or	    caching solutions are required. The control plane of the ALOC	    realm routers needs some modification in order for ICMP to be	    compatible with the hIPv4 framework. When an area (one or	    several AS) of an ISP has transformed into an ALOC realm only	    ALOC prefixes are exchanged with other ALOC realms. Directly	    attached ELOC prefixes are only inserted to the RIB of the	    local ALOC realm, ELOC prefixes are not distributed to the	    DFZ. Multi-homing can be achieved in two ways, either the	    enterprise request an ALOC prefix from the RIR (this is not	    recommended) or the enterprise receive the ALOC prefixes from	    their upstream ISPs ELOC prefixes are PI addresses and	    remains intact when a upstream ISP is changed, only the ALOC	    prefix is replaced. When the RIB of DFZ is compressed	    (containing only ALOC prefixes) no longer an ingress router	    knows the availability of the destination prefix, thus the	    endpoints must take more responsibility for their	    sessions. This can be achieved by using multipath enabled	    transport protocols, such as SCTP (RFC 4960) and Multipath TCP	    (MPTCP), at the endpoints. The multipath transport protocols	    also provides a session identifier, i.e. verification tag or	    token, thus the location and identifier split is carried out -	    site mobility, endpoint mobility and mobile site mobility is	    achieved. DNS needs to be upgraded, in order to resolve the	    location of an endpoint the endpoint must have one ELOC value	    (current A-record) and at least one ALOC value in DNS (in	    multi-homing solutions there will be several ALOC values for an	    endpoint).	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Gains'>	  <t>	    <list style='numbers'>	      <t>		Improved routing scalability: Adding hierarchy in the		address space enables a new hierarchy in the routing		architecture.

Ivip's	  DITRs (Default ITRs in the DFZ) and LISP's PTRs (Proxy Tunnel	  Routers) both accept packets sent by any non-upgraded host/network	  and tunnel them to the correct ETR - so providing full benefits of	  portability, multihoming and inbound TE for these packets as well as	  those sent by hosts in networks with ITRs.  hIPv4 appears to have no	  such mechanism - so these benefits are only available for	  communications between two upgraded hosts in upgraded networks.	</t>	<t>	  This means that significant benefits for adopters - the ability to	  rely on the new system to provide the portability, multihoming and	  inbound TE benefits for all, or almost all, their communications -	  will only arise after all, or almost all networks upgrade their	  networks, hosts and addressing arrangements.  hIPv4's relationship	  between adoption levels and benefits to any adopter therefore are far	  less favourable to widespread adoption than those of CES	  architectures such as Ivip and LISP.	</t>	<t>	  This results in hIPv4 also being at a disadvantage regarding the	  achievement of significant routing scaling benefits - which likewise	  will only result once adoption is close to ubiquitous.  Ivip and LISP	  can provide routing scaling benefits in direct proportion to their	  level of adoption, since all adopters gain full benefits for all	  their communications, in a highly scalable manner.	</t>	<t>	  hIPv4 requires stack upgrades, which are not required by any CES	  architecture.  Furthermore, a large number of existing IPv4	  application protocols convey IP addresses between hosts in a manner	  which will not work with hIPv4:  "There are several applications that	  are inserting IPv4 address information in the payload of a packet.	  Some applications use the IPv4 address information to create new	  sessions or for identification purposes.

The legacy software that	      are not maintained any more will not contribute benefits for	      routing scalability in the core-edge elimination	      situation. In the core-edge separation scheme, a new gateway	      NTR (Name Transfer Relay) is deployed to prevent edge	      specific PI prefixes into transit core. It doesn't impede the	      legacy ends behind the NTR to access the outside Internet,	      but the legacy ends cannot or is difficult to access the ends	      behind a NTR without the help of NOL.	    </t>	    <t>	      In the scenario of core-edge elimination, the end site will	      assigned to multiple PA address space, which lead to	      renumbering troubles on switching to other upstream	      providers. Upgrading ends to support NOL doesn't give any	      benefits to edge networks. It has little incentives to use 	      NOL in the core-edge elimination, and the same to other	      host-based ID/locator split proposals. I believe that the	      edge networks prefer PI address space to PA address space	      whether they are IPv4 or IPv6 networks.	    </t>	    <t>	      In the scenario of core-edge separation, the additional	      gateway NTR is to prevent the specific prefixes from the edge	      networks, just like a NAT or the ITR/ETR of LISP. A NTR	      gateway is can be seen as an extension of NAT (Network	      Address Translation). Although NATs are deployed widely,	      upgrading them to support NOL extension or deploying	      additional new gateway NTRs at the edge networks are on a	      voluntary basis and have few economic incentives.	    </t>	    <t>	      The statefull or stateless translating for each packet	      traversing a NTR will require the cost of the CPU and memory	      of NTRs, and increase forwarding delay.

For the	      reliability, all of the association between multiple NTRs and	      the end site name will be kept in DNS, which may increase the	      load of DNS.	    </t>	    <t>	      In the support for mobility, it is necessary for the DNS to	      update the corresponding name-NTR mapping records in time	      when an end system move from behind one NTR to other	      NTRs. The NOL-enabled end relies on NOL layer to keep the	      continuity of applications data transport, while the	      underlying TCP/UDP transport session would be broken when the	      IP address changed.	    </t>	  </list>	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  NOL resembles neither CEE or CES as a solution. With supporting	  application level session by name overlay, NOL can support some	  solution of style of CEE. NOL is closer to the way of CES, i.e.,	  preventing PI prefixes of edge networks from entering into the	  upstream transit networks.This is done by NTR, like the ITR/ETRs	  in CES, but NOL has no need to define the clear boundary between	  core and edge networks.  NOL is designed to try to provide end	  users or networks a service that faciliates the adoption of	  multihoming, multipath routing and traffic engineering by the	  indirect routing through NTRs, and, in the mean time, doesn't	  accelarate, or decrease, the growth of global routing table size.	</t>	<t>	  Some problems are stated in the NOL critique. In the original NOL	  proposal document, DNS query for a host that is behind a NTR will	  induce the return of the actual IP addresses of the host and the	  address of the NTR. This arrangement might cause some	  difficulties for the legacy application due to the non-standard	  response request for DNS. To resolve this problem, we can make	  NOL service use a new namespace, and DNS not return NTR IP	  address for the legacy hosts. The names used for NOL is formatted	  like email addresses, such as "des@domain.net".  The mapping	  between "domain.net" and IP address of corresponding NTR will be	  registered in DNS. NOL layer understand the meaning of the name	  "des@domain.net" , and it will send a query to DNS only for	  "domain.net".  And then, DNS will return IP addresses of the	  corresponding NTRs. For the legacy applications, they will still	  use the traditional FQDN name and DNS will return the actual IP	  address of the host. However, if the host is behind a NTR, the	  legacy applications may be unable to access the host.	</t>	<t>	  The stateless address translation or stateful address and port	  translation maybe cause a scaling problems for the limitiations	  of the number of table entries NTR must maintain. And the legacy	  applications can not initiate sessions with hosts inside the	  NOL-adopting EUN. However, these problems may not be the big	  barrier for the deployment of NOL or other similar	  approaches. Many NAT-like boxes and proxy and firewall devices	  are widely used at the Ingress/Egress points of Enterprise	  networks, campus networks or other stub EUNs.The hosts running as	  servers can be deployed outside NTRs or be assigned PA addresses	  in a NTR-adopting EUN.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title='Compact routing in locator identifier mapping system'>      <section title='Summary'>	<section title='Key Idea'>	  <t>	    Builds a highly scalable locator identity mapping system using	    compact routing principles.

No matter how ALT's path lengths and delays	  are optimised, there is a problem with a querier - which could be	  anywhere in the world - relying on mapping information from one	  or ideally two or more authoritative query servers, which could	  also be anywhere in the world.  The delays and risks of packet	  loss which are inherent in such a system constitute a fundamental	  problem. This is especially when multiple, potentially long,	  traffic packets received by ITRs which are awaiting a map reply	  are carried over the CRM networks for delivery to the destination	  network, while also functioning as map requests.	</t>	<t>	  Secondly, the alterations contemplated in this proposal involve	  the roles of particular nodes in the network being dynamically	  assigned - as part of its self-organizing nature.	</t>	<t>	  The discussion of Clustering in the middle of page 4 also	  indicates that particular nodes are responsible for registering	  EIDs from typically far-distant ETRs, all of which are handling	  closely related EIDs which this node can aggregate.  Since MSes	  are apparently nodes within the compact routing system, and the	  process of an MS deciding whether to accept EID registrations is	  determined as part of the self-organising properties of the	  system, there are concerns about how EID registration can be	  performed securely, when no particular physical node is	  responsible for it.	</t>	<t>	  Thirdly there are concerns about individually owned nodes	  performing work for other organisations.  Such problems of trust	  and of responsibilities and costs being placed on those who do	  not directly benefit already exist in the interdomain routing	  system, and are a challenge for any scalable routing solution.	</t>	<t>	  There are simpler solutions to the mapping problem than having an	  elaborate network of routers.  If a global-scale query system is	  still preferred, then it would be better to have ITRs use local	  MRs, each of which is dynamically configured to know the IP	  address of the million or so authoritative Map Server (MS) query	  servers - or two million or so assuming they exist in pairs for	  redundancy.	</t>	<t>	  It appears that the inherently greater delays and risks of packet	  loss of any global query server system make them unsuitable	  mapping solutions for Core-Edge Elimination or Core-Edge	  Separation architectures.  The solution to these problems appears	  to involve a greater number of widely distributed authoritative	  query servers, one or more of which will therefore be close	  enough to each querier that delays and risk of packet loss are	  reduced to acceptable levels.  Such a structure would be suitable	  for map requests, but perhaps not for handling traffic packets to	  be delivered to the destination networks.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  CRM is most easily understood as an alteration to the routing	  structure of the LISP-ALT mapping overlay system, by altering or	  adding to the network's BGP control plane.	</t>	<t>	  CRM's aims includes this delivery of initial traffic packets to	  their destination networks, where they also function as map	  requests.  These packets may be long and numerous in the	  fractions of a second to perhaps several seconds may elapse	  before the ITR receives the map reply.	</t>	<t>	  Compact Routing principles are used to optimise the path length	  taken by these query or traffic packets through a significantly	  modified version of the ALT (or similar) network while also	  generally reducing typical or maximum paths taken by the query	  packets.	</t>	<t>	  An overlay network is a diversion from the shortest	  path.

In	  fact, any proposal that needs a global mapping system with keys	  of similar properties of that "edge address" in the edge-core	  separation can use such a mechanism. This means that those keys	  are globally unique (by authorization or just statistically), at	  the disposal of edge users, and may have several satisfied	  mappings (with different weights, maybe). Once a proposal that	  needs mapping but doesn't specify the mapping mechanism, is used	  to solve the scalability problem, LMS can be used to strengthen	  its function.	</t>	<t>	  The key idea of LMS is similar to LISP+ALT that the mapping	  system should be hierarchically organized, to gain scalability in	  the storage and update sense and to achieve quick index for	  mapping lookup. However, LMS advocates an ISP-independent mapping	  system and ETRs are not the authorities of mapping data. ETRs or	  edge-sites report their mapping data to related mapping servers.	</t>	<t>	  Though LMS assumes that mapping servers can be incrementally	  deployed in that a server may not be constructed if none of its	  administered edge addresses are allocated, and that mapping	  servers can charge for their services, which provides the	  economic reason for their existence, how this brand-new system	  can be constructed is still not clear. Explicit layering is only	  an ideal state, and it rather analyzes the layering limits and	  feasibility, than provide a practical way for deployment.	</t>	<t>	  The drawbacks of LMS's feasibility analysis also include 1)	  based on current PC power and may not represent future	  circumstances (especially for IPv6); 2) does not consider the	  variability of address utilization. Some IP address spaces may be	  effectively allocated and used while some may not, causing some	  mapping servers overloaded while others poorly utilized. More	  thoughts are needed as to the flexibility of the layer design.	</t>	<t>	  LMS doesn't fit well for mobility. It does not solve the problem	  when hosts move faster that the mapping updates and propagations	  between relative mapping servers. On the other hand, mobile hosts	  moving across ASes and changing their attach points (core	  addresses) is less frequent than hosts moving within an AS.	</t>	<t>	  I personally advocate that separation needs two planes: edge-core	  separation, which is to gain routing table scalability;	  identity-location separation, which is to achieve mobility. GLI	  does a good clarification and in that case, LMS can be used to	  provide identity-to-core address mapping. Of course, other	  schemes may be competent and LMS can be incorporate with it if it	  has globally seen keys and needs to map them to other namespaces.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  No rebuttal was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title='2-phased mapping'>      <section title='Summary'>	<section title='Considerations'>	  <t>	    <list style='numbers'>	      <t>		Mapping from prefixes to ETRs is an M:M mapping.

Before routing a packet received from upper layers,	  network stacks in hosts firstly need resolve the DNS name to an	  IP address; if the IP address is GLI-formed, it may look up the	  map from the identifier extracted from the IP address to the	  local locator. If the communication is between different	  GLI-domains, hosts may further look up the map from the	  identifier to the global locator the local mapping system	  forwarding requests to the global mapping system for hosts is	  just an option. Though host lookup may ease the burden of	  intermediate nodes which would otherwise to perform the mapping	  lookup, the three lookups by hosts in the worst case may lead to	  large delays unless a very efficient mapping mechanism is	  devised. The work may also become impractical for low-powered	  hosts. On one hand, GLI-split can provide backward compatibility	  where classic and upgraded IPv6 hosts can communicate, which is	  its big virtue; while the upgrades may be costly to against	  hosts enthusiasm to change, compared to the benefits they would	  gain.	</t>	<t>	  GLI-split provides additional features to improve TE and to	  improve resilience, e.g., exerting multipath routing. However the	  cost is that more burdens are placed on hosts, e.g. they may need	  more lookup actions and route selections. However, the kind of	  tradeoffs between costs and gains exists in most proposals.	</t>	<t>	  I think one improvement of GLI-Split on its support for mobility	  is to update DNS data as GLI-hosts move across	  GLI-domains. Through this GLI-corresponding-node can query DNS to	  get valid global locator of the GLI-mobile-node and need not to	  query the global mapping system (unless it wants to do multipath	  routing), giving more incentives for nodes to become	  GLI-kind. The merit of GLI-Split, simplified-mobility-handover	  provision, well supports this improvement.	</t>	<t>	  GLI-Split claims to use rewriting instead of tunneling for	  conversions between local and global locators, when packets span	  GLI-domains. The major advantage is that this kind of rewriting	  needs no extra states to maintain, since local and global	  locators need not to map to each other. Many other rewriting	  mechanisms instead need to maintain extra states. It also avoids	  the MTU problem faced by the tunneling methods. However,	  GLI-Split achieves this only by compressing the namespace size of	  each attribute (identifier, local and global locator). GLI-Split	  codes two terms (identifier and local/global locator) into an	  IPv6 address, each has space size of 2^64 or less, while	  map-and-encaps proposals assume that identifier and locator each	  occupies 128 bits space, in the IPv6 scene.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  The arguments in the GLI-Split critique are correct. There are	  only two points that should be clarified here. (1) First, it is	  not a drawback that hosts perform the mapping lookups. (2)	  Second, the critique proposed an improvement to the mobility	  mechanism, which is of general nature and not specific to	  GLI-Split.	</t>	<t>	  (1) The additional burden on the hosts is actually a benefit,	  compared to having the same burden on the gateways. If the	  gateway would perform the lookups and packets addressed to not	  yet cached EIDs arrive, a lookup in the mapping system must be	  initiated. Until the mapping reply returns, packets must be	  either dropped, cached, or the packets must be sent over the	  mapping system to the destination. All these options are not	  optimal and have their drawbacks. To avoid these problems in	  GLI-Split, the hosts perform the lookup. The short additional	  delay is not a big issue in the hosts because it happens before	  the first packets are sent. So no packets are lost or have to be	  cached. GLI-Split could also easily be adapted to special	  GLI-hosts (e.g., low power sensor nodes) that do not have to do	  any lookup and simply let the gateway do all the work. This	  functionality is included anyway for backward compatibility with	  regular IPv6-hosts inside the GLI-domain.  (2) The critique	  proposes a DNS-based mobility mechanism as an improvement to	  GLI-Split. However, this improvement is an alternative mobility	  approach which can be applied to any routing architecture	  including GLI-Split and raises also some concerns, e.g., the	  update speed of DNS. Therefore, we prefer to keep this issue out	  of the discussion.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title='Tunneled Inter-domain Routing (TIDR)'>      <section title='Summary'>	<section title='Key Idea'>	  <t>	    Provides a method for locator-identifier separation using tunnels	    between routers of the edge of the Internet transit	    infrastructure.

Messages	  advertising routes for TIDR-managed prefixes may be handled with	  lower priority, but this would only marginally reduce the	  workload for each DFZ router compared to handling an	  advertisement of a conventional PI prefix.	</t>	<t>	  Therefore, TIDR cannot be considered for RRG recommendation as a	  solution to the routing scaling problem.	</t>	<t>	  For a TIDR-using network to receive packets sent from any host,	  every BR of all ISPs must be upgraded to have the new ITR-like	  functionality.  Furthermore, all DFZ routers would need to be	  altered so they accepted and correctly propagated the routes for	  end-user network address space, with the new LOCATOR attribute	  which contains the ETR address and a REMOTE-PREFERENCE value.	  Firstly, if they received two such advertisements with different	  LOCATORs, they would advertise a single route to this prefix	  containing both.  Secondly, for end-user address space (for IPv4)	  to be more finely divided, the DFZ routers must propagate	  LOCATOR-containing advertisements for prefixes longer than /24.	</t>	<t>	  TIDR's ITR-like routers store the full mapping database - so	  there would be no delay in obtaining mapping, and therefore no	  significant delay in tunneling traffic packets.	</t>	<t>	  The TIDR ID is written as if traffic packets are classified by	  reference to the RIB - but routers use the FIB for this purpose,	  and "FIB" does not appear in the ID.	</t>	<t>	  TIDR does not specify a tunneling technique, leaving this to be	  chosen by the ETR-like function of BRs and specified as part of a	  second-kind of new BGP route advertised by that ETR-like BR.	  There is no provision for solving the PMTUD problems inherent in	  encapsulation-based tunneling.	</t>	<t>	  ITR functions must be performed by already busy routers of ISPs,	  rather than being distributed to other routers or to sending	  hosts.

If a site is	  currently using PI space, it can only stop advertising that space	  when the entire site is ILNP capable.  This needs at least clear	  elucidation of the incentives for ILNP which are not related to	  routing scaling, in order for there to be a path for this to	  address the RRG needs.  Similarly, the incentives for upgrading	  hosts need to align with the value for those hosts.	</t>	<t>	  A closely related question is whether this mechanism actually	  addresses the sites need for PI addresses.  Assuming ILNP is	  deployed, the site does achieve flexible, resilient,	  communication using all of its Internet connections.  While the	  proposal address the host updates when the host learns of	  provider changes, there are other aspects of provider change that	  are not addressed.  This includes renumbering router, subnets,	  and certain servers.  (It is presumed that most servers, once the	  entire site has moved to ILNP, will not be concerned if their	  locator changes.  However, some servers must have known locators,	  such as the DNS server.)  The issues described in	  <xref target='I-D.carpenter-renum-needs-work'/> will be	  ameliorated, but not resolved.  To be able to adopt this	  proposal, and have sites use it, we need to address these issues.	  When a site changes points of attachment only a small amount of	  DNS provisioning should be required.  The LP record is apparently	  intended to help with this.  It is also likely that the use of	  dynamic DNS will help this.	</t>	<t>	  The ILNP mechanism is described as being suitable for use in	  conjunction with mobility.  This raises the question of race	  conditions.  To the degree that mobility concerns are valid at	  this time, it is worth asking how communication can be	  established if a node is sufficiently mobile that it is moving	  faster than the DNS update and DNS fetch cycle can effectively	  propagate changes.	</t>	<t>	  This proposal does presume that all communication using this	  mechanism is tied to DNS names.  while it is true that most	  communication does start from a DNS name, it is not the case that	  all exchanges have this property.  Some communication initiation	  and referral can be done with an explicit I/L pair.  This does	  appear to require some extensions to the existing mechanism (for	  both sides adding locators).  In general, some additional clarity	  on the assumptions regarding DNS, particularly for low end	  devices, would seem appropriate.	</t>	<t>	  One issue that this proposal shares with many others is the	  question of how to determine which locator pairs (local and	  remote) are actually functional.  This is an issue both for	  initial communications establishment, and for robustly	  maintaining communication.  While it is likely that a combination	  of monitoring of traffic (in the host, where this is tractable),	  coupled with other active measures, can address this.  ICMP is	  clearly insufficient.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  ILNP eliminates the perceived need for PI addressing,	  and encourage increased DFZ aggregation. Many enterprise users 	  view DFZ scaling issues as too abstruse.  So ILNP creates 	  more user-visible incentives to upgrade deployed systems.	</t>	<t>	  ILNP mobility eliminates Duplicate Address Detection (DAD),	  reducing the layer-3 handoff time significantly, compared IETF	  standard Mobile IP. <xref target='MobiArch1'/>	  <xref target='MobiArch2'/> ICMP Location updates separately	  reduce the layer-3 handoff latency.	</t>	<t>	  Also, ILNP enables both host multi-homing and site 	  multi-homing.  Current BGP approaches cannot support 	  host multi-homing.  Host multi-homing is valuable in	  reducing the site's set of externally visible nodes.	</t>	<t>	  Improved mobility support is very important.  This is shown 	  by the research literature and also appears in discussions 	  with vendors of mobile devices (smartphones, MP3-players).  	  Several operating system vendors push "updates" with major 	  networking software changes in maintenance releases today.	  Security concerns mean most hosts receive vendor updates 	  more quickly these days.	</t>	<t>	  ILNP enables a site to hide exterior connectivity changes	  from interior nodes, using various approaches.  One approach 	  deploys ULA prefixes within the site and has the site border 	  router(s) rewrite the Locator values.

This makes global-scope PI addressing much	  less desirable for end sites than formerly.	</t>	<t>	  ILNP-capable nodes can talk existing IP with legacy 	  IP-only nodes, with no loss of current IP capability.  	  So ILNP-capable nodes will never be worse off.	</t>	<t>	  Secure Dynamic DNS Update is standard, and widely supported in	  deployed hosts and DNS servers.  <xref target='DNSnBIND'/> says	  many sites have deployed this technology without realizing it	  (e.g. by enabling both the DHCP server and Active Directory of	  MS-Windows Server).	</t>	<t>	  If a node is as mobile as the critique says, then existing 	  IETF Mobile IP standards also will fail.  They also use 	  location updates (e.g. MN->HA, MN->FA).  	</t>	<t>	  ILNP also enables new approaches to security that eliminate	  dependence upon location-dependent ACLs without packet	  authentication.  Instead, security appliances track flows using	  Identifier values, and validate the I/L relationship	  cryptographically <xref target='RFC4033'/>	  <xref target='RFC4034'/> <xref target='RFC4035'/> or	  non-cryptographically by reading the	  <xref target='I-D.rja-ilnp-nonce'/>.	</t>	<t>	  The DNS LP record has a more detailed explanation now.	  LP records enable a site to change its upstream connectivity	  by changing the L records of a single FQDN covering the	  whole site, providing scalability.	</t>	<t>	  DNS-based server load balancing works well with ILNP	  by using DNS SRV records.  DNS SRV records are not new,	  are widely available in DNS clients &amp; servers, and	  are widely used today in the IPv4 Internet for SLB.	</t>	<t>	  Recent ILNP I-Ds discuss referrals in more detail.

These principles	    enhance the efficiency of the map-and-encap protocols in terms of	    (1) better utilization of resources (e.g., processing and memory)	    at Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and mapping servers, and	    consequently, (2) reduction of response time (e.g., first packet	    delay). We consider how Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) can perform	    aggregation of end-point ID (EID) address space belonging to	    their downstream delivery networks, in spite of	    migration/re-homing of some subprefixes to other ETRs. This	    aggregation may be useful for reducing the processing load and	    memory consumption associated with map messages, especially at	    some resource-constrained ITRs and subsystems of the mapping	    distribution system. We also consider another architectural	    concept where the ETRs are organized in a hierarchical manner for	    the potential benefit of aggregation of their EID address	    spaces. The two key architectural ideas are discussed in some	    more detail below. A more complete description can be found in a	    document <xref target='EEMDP Considerations'/> that was presented	    at the RRG meeting in Dublin <xref					    target='EEMDP Presentation'/>.	  </t>	  <t>	    It will be helpful to refer to Figures 1, 2, and 3 in the	    document noted above for some of the discussions that follow here	    below.	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Management of Mapping Distribution of Subprefixes			Spread Across Multiple ETRs'>	  <t>	    To assist in this discussion, we start with the high level	    architecture of a map-and-encap approach (it would be helpful to	    see Fig. 1 in the document mentioned above). In this architecture	    we have the usual ITRs, ETRs, delivery networks, etc. In	    addition, we have the ID-Locator Mapping (ILM) servers which are	    repositories for complete mapping information, while the	    ILM-Regional (ILM-R) servers can contain partial and/or	    regionally relevant mapping information.	  </t>	  <t>	    While a large endpoint address space contained in a prefix may be	    mostly associated with the delivery networks served by one ETR,	    some fragments (subprefixes) of that address space may be located	    elsewhere at other ETRs. Let a/20 denote a prefix that is	    conceptually viewed as composed of 16 subnets of /24 size that	    are denoted as a1/24, a2/24, :::, a16/24. For example, a/20 is	    mostly at ETR1, while only two of its subprefixes a8/24 and	    a15/24 are elsewhere at ETR3 and ETR2, respectively (see Fig. 2	    in the document). From the point of view of efficiency of the	    mapping distribution protocol, it may be beneficial for ETR1 to	    announce a map for the entire space a/20 (rather than fragment it	    into a multitude of more-specific prefixes), and provide the	    necessary exceptions in the map information. Thus the map message	    could be in the form of Map:(a/20, ETR1; Exceptions: a8/24,	    a15/24). In addition, ETR2 and ETR3 announce the maps for a15/24	    and a8/24, respectively, and so the ILMs know where the exception	    EID addresses are located. Now consider a host associated with	    ITR1 initiating a packet destined for an address a7(1), which is	    in a7/24 that is not in the exception portion of a/20. Now a	    question arises as to which of the following approaches would be	    the best choice:	    <list style='numbers'>	      <t>		ILM-R provides the complete mapping information for a/20 to		ITR1 including all maps for relevant exception subprefixes.	      </t>	      <t>		ILM-R provides only the directly relevant map to ITR1 which		in this case is (a/20, ETR1).	      </t>	    </list>	  </t>	  <t>	    In the first approach, the advantage is that ITR1 would have the	    complete mapping for a/20 (including exception subnets), and it	    would not have to generate queries for subsequent first packets	    that are destined to any address in a/20, including a8/24 and	    a15/24. However, the disadvantage is that if there is a	    significant number of exception subprefixes, then the very first	    packet destined for a/20 will experience a long delay, and also	    the processors at ITR1 and ILM-R can experience overload. In	    addition, the memory usage at ITR1 can be very inefficient as	    well. The advantage of the second approach above is that the	    ILM-R does not overload resources at ITR1 both in terms of	    processing and memory usage but it needs an enhanced map response	    in of the form Map:(a/20, ETR1, MS=1), where MS (more specific)	    indicator is set to 1 to indicate to ITR1 that not all subnets in	    a/20 map to ETR1. The key idea is that aggregation is beneficial	    and subnet exceptions must be handled with additional messages or	    indicators in the maps.	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Management of Mapping Distribution for Scenarios with			Hierarchy of ETRs and Multi-Homing'>	  <t>	    Now we highlight another architectural concept related to mapping	    management (helpful here to refer to Fig. 3 in the	    document). Here we consider the possibility that ETRs may be	    organized in a hierarchical manner. For instance ETR7 is higher	    in hierarchy relative to ETR1, ETR2, and ETR3, and like-wise ETR8	    is higher relative to ETR4, ETR5, and ETR6. For instance, ETRs 1	    through 3 can relegate locator role to ETR7 for their EID address	    space. In essence, they can allow ETR7 to act as the locator for	    the delivery networks in their purview. ETR7 keeps a local	    mapping table for mapping the appropriate EID address space to	    specific ETRs that are hierarchically associated with it in the	    level below. In this situation, ETR7 can perform EID address	    space aggregation across ETRs 1 through 3 and can also include	    its own immediate EID address space for the purpose of that	    aggregation. The many details related to this approach and	    special circumstances involving multi-homing of subnets are	    discussed in detail in the detailed document noted earlier. The	    hierarchical organization of ETRs and delivery networks should	    help in the future growth and scalability of ETRs and mapping	    distribution networks. This is essentially recursive	    map-and-encap, and some of the mapping distribution and	    management functionality will remain local to topologically	    neighboring delivery networks which are hierarchically underneath	    ETRs.	  </t>	</section>      </section>      <section title='Critique'>	<t>	  This scheme <xref target='EEMDP Considerations'/> represents one	  approach to mapping overhead reduction, and it is a general idea	  that is applicable to any proposal that includes prefix or EID	  aggregation. A somewhat similar idea is also used in Level-3	  aggregation in the FIB aggregation proposal.	  <xref target='FIBAggregatability'/> There can be cases where	  deaggregation of EID prefixes occur in such a way that bulk of an	  EID prefix P would be attached to one locator (say, ETR1) while a	  few subprefixes under P would be attached to other locators	  elsewhere (say, ETR2, ETR3, etc.). Ideally such cases should not	  happen, however in reality it can happen as RIR's address	  allocations are imperfect. In addition, as new IP address	  allocations become harder to get, an IPv4 prefix owner might	  split previously unused subprefixes of that prefix and allocate	  them to remote sites (homed to other ETRs). Assuming these	  situations could arise in practice, the nature of solution would	  be that the response from mapping server for the coarser site	  would include information about the more specifics. The solution	  as presented seems correct.	</t>	<t>	  The proposal mentions that in Approach 1, the ID-Locator	  Mapping (ILM) system provides the complete mapping information	  for an aggregate EID prefix to a querying ITR including all the	  maps for the relevant exception subprefixes. The sheer number	  of such more-specifics can be worrisome, for example, in	  LISP. What if a company's mobile-node EIDs came out of their	  corporate EID-prefix? Approach 2 is far better but still there	  may be too many entries for a regional ILM to store. In	  Approach 2, ILM communicates that there are more specifics but	  does not communicate their mask-length. A suggested improvement	  would be that rather than saying that there are more specifics,	  indicate what their mask-lengths are. There can be multiple	  mask lengths. This number should be pretty small for For IPv4	  but can be large for IPv6.	</t>	<t>	  Later in the proposal, a different problem is addressed	  involving a hierarchy of ETRs and how aggregation of EID	  prefixes from lower level ETRs can be performed at a higher	  level ETR. The various scenarios here are well illustrated and	  described. This seems like a good idea, and a solution like	  LISP can support this as specified. As any optimization scheme	  would inevitably add some complexity; the proposed scheme for	  enhancing mapping efficiency comes with some of its own	  overhead. The gain depends on the details of specific EID	  blocks, i.e., how frequently the situations arise such as an	  ETR having a bigger EID block with a few holes.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  There are two main points in the critique that would be addressed	  here: (1) The gain depends on the details of specific EID blocks,	  i.e., how frequently the situations arise such as an ETR having a	  bigger EID block with a few holes, and (2) Approach 2 is lacking	  an added feature of conveying just the mask-length of the more	  specifics that exist as part of current map-response.	</t>	<t>	  Regarding comment (1) above, there are multiple possibilities	  regarding how situations can arise resulting in allocations	  having holes in them.  An example of one of these possibilities	  is as follows. Org-A has historically received multiple /20s,	  /22s, /24s over the course of time which are adjacent to each	  other. At the present time, these prefixes would all aggregate to	  a /16 but for the fact that just a few of the underlying /24s	  have been allocated elsewhere historically to other organizations	  by an RIR or ISPs.  An example of a second possibility is that	  Org-A has an allocation of a /16 prefix. It has suballocated a	  /22 to one of its subsidiaries, and subsequently sold the	  subsidiary to another Org-B. For ease of keeping the /22 subnet	  up and running without service disruption, the /22 subprefix is	  allowed to be transferred in the acquisition process.  Now the	  /22 subprefix originates from a different AS and is serviced by a	  different ETR (as compared to the parent \16 prefix).  We are in	  the process of performing an analysis of RIR allocation data and	  are aware of other studies (notably at UCLA) which are also	  performing similar analysis to quantify the frequency of	  occurrence of the holes. We feel that the problem that has been	  addressed is a realistic one, and the proposed scheme would help	  reduce the overheads associated with the mapping distribution	  system.	</t>	<t>	  Regarding comment (2) above, the suggested modification to	  Approach 2 would be definitely beneficial. In fact, we feel that	  it would be fairly straight forward to dynamically use Approach 1	  or Approach 2 (with the suggested modification), depending on	  whether there are only a few (e.g., &lt;=5) or many (e.g., >5)	  more specifics, respectively. The suggested modification of	  notifying the mask-length of the more specifics in map-response	  is indeed very helpful because then the ITR would not have to	  resend a map-query for EID addresses that match the EID address	  in the previous query up to at least mask-length bit	  positions. There can be a two-bit field in map-response that	  would indicate: (a) With value 00 for notifying that there are no	  more-specifics; (b) With value 01 for notifying that there are	  more-specifics and their exact information follows in additional	  map-responses, and (c) With value 10 for notifying that there are	  more-specifics and the mask-length of the next more-specific is	  indicated in the current map-response. An additional field will	  be included which will be used to specify the mask-length of the	  next more-specific in the case of the "10" indication (case (c)	  above).	  </t>	</section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title='Evolution'>      <section title='Summary'>	<t>	  As the Internet continues its rapid growth, router memory size and	  CPU cycle requirements are outpacing feasible hardware upgrade	  schedules. We propose to solve this problem by applying aggregation	  with increasing scopes to gradually evolve the routing system	  towards a scalable structure. At each evolutionary step, our	  solution is able to interoperate with the existing system and	  provide immediate benefits to adopters to enable deployment. This	  document summarizes the need for an evolutionary design, the	  relationship between our proposal and other revolutionary proposals	  and the steps of aggregation with increasing scopes. Our detailed	  proposal can be found in <xref target='I-D.zhang-evolution' />.	</t>	<section title='Need for Evolution'>	  <t>	    Multiple different views exist regarding the routing scalability	    problem.  Networks differ vastly in goals, behavior, and	    resources, giving each a different view of the severity and	    imminence of the scalability problem. Therefore we believe that,	    for any solution to be adopted, it will start with one or a few	    early adopters, and may not ever reach the entire Internet. The	    evolutionary approach recognizes that changes to the Internet can	    only be a gradual process with multiple stages. At each stage,	    adopters are driven by and rewarded with solving an immediate	    problem. Each solution must be deployable by individual networks	    who deem it necessary at a time they deem it necessary, without	    requiring coordination from other networks, and the solution has	    to bring immediate relief to a single first-mover.	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Relation to Other RRG Proposals'>	  <t>	    Most proposals take a revolutionary approach that expects the	    entire Internet to eventually move to some new design whose	    main benefits would not materialize until the vast majority of	    the system has been upgraded; their incremental deployment plan	    simply ensures interoperation between upgraded and legacy parts	    of the system. In contrast, the evolutionary approach depicts a	    picture where changes may happen here and there as needed, but	    there is no dependency on the system as a whole making a	    change. Whoever takes a step forward gains the benefit by	    solving his own problem, without depending on others to take	    actions.  Thus, deployability includes not only	    interoperability, but also the alignment of costs and gains.	  </t>	  <t>	    The main differences between our approach and more revolutionary	    map-encap proposals are: (a) we do not start with a pre-defined	    boundary between edge and core; and (b) each step brings	    immediate benefits to individual first-movers. Note that our	    proposal neither interferes nor prevents any revolutionary	    host-based solutions such as ILNP from being rolled out. However,	    host-based solutions do not bring useful impact until a large	    portion of hosts have been upgraded. Thus even if a host-based	    solution is rolled out in the long run, an evolutionary solution	    is still needed for the near term.	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Aggregation with Increasing Scopes'>	  <t>	    Aggregating many routing entries to a fewer number is a basic	    approach to improving routing scalability. Aggregation can take	    different forms and be done within different scopes. In our	    design, the aggregation scope starts from a single router, then	    expands to a single network, and neighbor networks. The order of	    the following steps is not fixed but merely a suggestion; it is	    under each individual network's discretion which steps they	    choose to take based on their evaluation of the severity of the	    problems and the affordability of the solutions.	    <list style='numbers'>	      <t>		FIB Aggregation (FA) in a single router. A router		algorithmically aggregates its FIB entries without changing		its RIB or its routing announcements. No coordinations among		routers is needed, nor any change to existing protocols. This		brings scalability relief to individual routers with only a		software upgrade.	      </t>	      <t>		Enabling 'best external' on PEs, ASBRs, and RRs, and turning		on next-hop-self on RRs.  For hierarchical networks, the RRs		in each PoP can serve as a default gateway for nodes in the		PoP, thus allowing the non-RR nodes in each PoP to maintain		smaller routing tables that only include paths that egress		out of that PoP. This is known as 'topology-based mode'		Virtual Aggregation, and can be done with existing hardware		and configuration changes only. Please see		<xref target='Evolution Grow Presentation'/> for details.	      </t>	      <t>		Virtual Aggregation (VA) in a single network. Within an AS,		some fraction of existing routers are designated as		Aggregation Point Routers (APRs). These routers are either		individually or collectively maintain the full FIB		table. Other routers may suppress entries from their FIBs,		instead forwarding packets to APRs, which will then tunnel		the packets to the correct egress routers. VA can be viewed		as an intra-domain map-encap system to provide the operators		a control mechanism for the FIB size in their routers.	      </t>	      <t>		VA across neighbor networks. When adjacent networks have VA		deployed, they can go one step further by piggybacking egress		router information on existing BGP announcements, so that		packets can be tunneled directly to a neighbor network's		egress router. This improves packet delivery performance by		performing the encapsulation/decapsulation only once across		these neighbor networks, as well as reducing the stretch of		the path.	      </t>	      <t>		Reducing RIB Size by separating control plane from the data		plane. Although a router's FIB can be reduced by FA or VA, it		usually still needs to maintain the full RIB in order for		routing announcements to its neighbors. To reduce the RIB		size, a network can set up special boxes, which we call		controllers, to take over the eBGP sessions from border		routers.  The controllers receive eBGP announcements, make		routing decisions, and then inform other routers in the same		network of how to forward packets, while the regular routers		just focus on the job of forwarding packets. The controllers,		not being part of the data path, can be scaled using		commodity hardware.	      </t>	      <t>		Insulating forwarding routers from routing churns. For		routers with a smaller RIB, the rate of routing churns is		naturally reduced. Further reduction can be achieved by not		announcing failures of customer prefixes into the core, but		handling these failures in a data-driven fashion, e.g., a		link failure to an edge network is not reported unless and		until there are data packets that are heading towards the		failed link.	      </t>	    </list>	  </t>	</section>      </section>      <section title='Critique'>	<t>	  All the RRG proposals that scale the routing share one	  fundamental approach, route aggregation, in different forms,	  e.g., LISP removes "edge prefixes" using encapsulation at ITRs,	  ILNP achieves the goal by locator rewrite. In this evolutionary	  path proposal, each stage of the evolution applies aggregation	  with increasing scopes to solve a specific scalability problem,	  and eventually the path leads towards global routing	  scalability. E.g., it uses FIB aggregation at single router	  level, virtual aggregation at network level, then between	  neighbor networks at inter-domain level.	</t>	<t>	  Compared to others, this proposal has the lowest hurdle to	  deployment, because it does not require all networks move to use	  a global mapping system or to upgrade all hosts, and it is	  designed for each individual network to get immediate benefits	  after its own deployment.	</t>	<t>	  Critiques to this proposal fall into two types.  The first type	  concerns several potential issues in the technical design as	  listed below:	  <list style='numbers'>	    <t>	      FIB aggregation, at level-3 and level-4, may introduce extra	      routable space.  Concerns are raised about the potential	      routing loops resulted from forwarding otherwise non-routable	      packets, and potential impact on RPF checking.  These	      concerns can be addressed by choosing a lower level of	      aggregation and by adding null routes to minimize the extra	      space, at the cost of reduced aggregation gain.	    </t>	    <t>	      Virtual Aggregation changes the traffic paths in an ISP	      network, hence introduces path stretch. Changing the traffic	      path may also impact the reverse path checking practice used	      to filter out packets from spoofed sources.  More analysis is	      need to identify the potential side-effects of VA and to	      address	    </t>	    <t>	      The current Virtual aggregation description is difficult to	      understand, due to its multiple options for encapsulation and	      popular prefix configurations, which makes the mechanism look	      over-complicated. More thought is needed to simplify the	      design and description.	    </t>	    <t>	      FIB Aggregation and Virtual Aggregation may require	      additional operational cost.  There may be new design	      trade-offs that the operators need to understand in order to	      select the best option for their networks. More analysis is	      needed to identify and quantify all potential operational	      costs.	    </t>	    <t>	      Different from a number of other proposals, this solution	      does not provide mobility support. It remains an open	      question whether the routing system should handle mobility.	    </t>	  </list>	</t>	<t>	  The second type of critique concerns whether deploying quick	  fixes like FIB aggregation would alleviate scalability problems	  in the short term and reduce the incentives for deploying a new	  architecture; and whether an evolutionary approach would end up	  with adding more and more patches on the old architecture, and	  not lead to a fundamentally new architecture as the proposal had	  expected.  Though this solution may get rolled out more easily	  and quicker, a new architecture, if/once deployed, could solve	  more problems with cleaner solutions.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  No rebuttal was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title='Name-Based Sockets'>      <section title='Summary'>	<t>	  Name-based sockets are an evolution of the existing address-based	  sockets, enabling applications to initiate and receive	  communication sessions by use of domain names in lieu of IP	  addresses.  Name-based sockets move the existing indirection from	  domain names to IP addresses from its current position in	  applications down to the IP layer.  As a result, applications	  communicate exclusively based on domain names, while the	  discovery, selection, and potentially in-session re-selection of	  IP addresses is centrally performed by the operating system.	</t>	<t>	  Name-based sockets help mitigate the Internet routing scalability	  problem by separating naming and addressing more consistently	  than what is possible with the existing address-based sockets.	  This supports IP address aggregation because it simplifies the	  use of IP addresses with high topological significance, as well	  as the dynamic replacement of IP addresses during	  network-topological and host-attachment changes.	</t>	<t>	  A particularly positive effect of name-based sockets on Internet	  routing scalability is new incentives for edge network operators	  to use provider-assigned IP addresses, which are better	  aggregatable than the typically preferred provider-independent IP	  addresses.  Even though provider-independent IP addresses are	  harder to get and more expensive than provider-assigned IP	  addresses, many operators desire provider- independent addresses	  due to the high indirect cost of provider-assigned IP addresses.	  This indirect cost comprises both, difficulties to multi- home,	  and tedious and largely manual renumbering upon provider changes.	</t>	<t>	  Name-based sockets reduce the indirect cost of provider-assigned	  IP addresses in three ways, and hence make the use of	  provider-assigned IP addresses more acceptable: (1) They enable	  fine-granular and responsive multi-homing.  (2) They simplify	  renumbering by offering an easy means to replace IP addresses in	  referrals with domain names.  This helps avoiding updates to	  application and operating system configurations, scripts, and	  databases during renumbering.  (3) They facilitate low-cost	  solutions that eliminate renumbering altogether.  One such	  low-cost solution is IP address translation, which in combination	  with name-based sockets loses its adverse impact on applications.	</t>	<t>	  Prerequisite for a positive effect of name-based sockets on	  Internet routing scalability is their adoption in operating	  systems and applications.  Operating systems should be augmented	  to offer name-based sockets as a new alternative to the existing	  address-based sockets, and applications should use name-based	  sockets for their communications.  Neither an instantaneous, nor	  an eventually complete transition to name-based sockets is	  required, yet the positive effect on Internet routing scalability	  will grow with the extent of this transition.	</t>	<t>	  Name-based sockets were hence designed with focus on deployment	  incentives, comprising both immediate deployment benefits as well	  as low deployment costs.  Name-based sockets provide a benefit to	  application developers because the alleviation of applications	  from IP address management responsibilities simplifies and	  expedites application development.  This benefit is immediate	  owing to the backwards compatibility of name-based sockets with	  legacy applications and legacy peers.  The appeal to application	  developers, in turn, is an immediate benefit for operating system	  vendors who adopt name-based sockets.	</t>	<t>	  Name-based sockets furthermore minimize deployment costs:	  Alternative techniques to separate naming and addressing provide	  applications with "surrogate IP addresses" that dynamically map	  onto regular IP addresses.  A surrogate IP address is	  indistinguishable from a regular IP address for applications, but	  does not have the topological significance of a regular IP	  address.  Mobile IP and the Host Identity Protocol are examples	  of such separation techniques.  Mobile IP uses "home IP	  addresses" as surrogate IP addresses with reduced topological	  significance.  The Host Identity Protocol uses "host identifiers"	  as surrogate IP addresses without topological significance.  A	  disadvantage of surrogate IP addresses is their incurred cost in	  terms of extra administrative overhead and, for some techniques,	  extra infrastructure.  Since surrogate IP addresses must be	  resolvable to the corresponding regular IP addresses, they must	  be provisioned in the DNS or similar infrastructure.  Mobile IP	  uses a new infrastructure of home agents for this purpose, while	  the Host Identity Protocol populates DNS servers with host	  identities.  Name-based sockets avoid this cost because they	  function without surrogate IP addresses, and hence without the	  provisioning and infrastructure requirements that accompany	  those.	</t>	<t>	  Certainly, some edge networks will continue to use	  provider-independent addresses despite name-based sockets,	  perhaps simply due to inertia. But name-based sockets will help	  reduce the number of those networks, and thus have a positive	  impact on Internet routing scalability.	</t>	<t>	  A more comprehensive description of name-based sockets can be found	  in <xref target='Name Based Sockets'/>.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Critique'>	<t>	  Name-based sockets contribution to the routing scalability	  problem is to decrease the reliance on PI addresses, allowing a	  greater use of PA addresses, and thus a less fragmented routing	  table. It provides end hosts with an API which makes the	  applications address-agnostic. The name abstraction allows the	  hosts to use any type of locator, independent of format or	  provider. This increases the motivation and usability of PA	  addresses. Some applications, in particular bootstrapping	  applications, may still require hard coded IP addresses, and as	  such will still motivate the use of PI addresses.	</t>	<section title='Deployment'>	  <t>	    The main incentives and drivers are geared towards the	    transition of applications to the name-based sockets. Adoption	    by applications will be driven by benefits in terms of reduced	    application development cost. Legacy applications are expected	    to migrate to the new API in a slower pace, as the name-based	    sockets are backwards compatible, this can happen in an	    per-host fashion. Also, not all applications can be ported to a	    FQDN dependent infrastructure, e.g. DNS functions. This hurdle	    is manageable, and may not be a definite obstacle for the	    transition of a whole domain, but it needs to be taken into	    account when striving for mobility/multi-homing of an entire	    site. The transition of functions on individual hosts may be	    trivial, either through upgrades/changes to the OS or as linked	    libraries. This can still happen incrementally and disjoint, as	    compatibility is not affected by the use of name-based sockets.	  </t>	</section>	<section title='Edge-networks'>	  <t>	    The name-based sockets rely on the transition of individual	    applications, the name-based sockets are backwards compatible,	    hence it does not require bilateral upgrades. This does allow	    each host to migrate its applications independently. Name-based	    sockets may make an individual client agnostic to the	    networking medium, be it PA/PI IP-addresses or in a the future	    an entirely different networking medium. However, an entire	    edge-network, with internal and external services will not be	    able to make a complete transition in the near future. Hence,	    even if a substantial fraction of the hosts in an edge-network	    use name-based sockets, PI addresses may still be required by	    the edge-network. In short, new services may be implemented	    using name-based sockets, old services may be	    ported. Name-based sockets provide an increased motivation to	    move to PA-addresses as actual provider independence relies	    less and less on PI-addressing.	  </t>	</section>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  No rebuttal was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Counterpoint'>	<t>	  No counterpoint was submitted for this proposal.	</t>      </section>    </section>    <section title='Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global		    Enterprise Recursion (IRON-RANGER)'>      <section title='Summary'>	<t>	  RANGER is a locator-identifier separation approach that uses	  IP-in-IP encapsulation to connect edge networks across transit	  networks such as the global Internet.

For instance, the ID	  contains no specification for a mapping protocol, how the	  mapping lookup system would work on a global scale.	</t>	<t>	  There is no provision for RANGER's ITR-like routers being able	  to probe the reachability of end-user networks via multiple	  ETR-like routers - nor for any other approach to multihoming	  service restoration.	</t>	<t>	  Nor is there any provision for inbound TE or support of mobile	  devices which frequently change their point of attachment.	</t>	<t>	  Therefore, it its current form, RANGER cannot be contemplated as	  a superior scalable routing solution to some other proposals	  which are specified in sufficient detail and which appear to be	  feasible.	</t>	<t>	  RANGER uses its own tunneling and PMTUD management protocol:	  SEAL.  Adoption of SEAL in its current form would prevent the	  proper utilization of jumbo frame paths in the DFZ, which will	  become the norm in the future.  SEAL uses RFC 1191 PTB messages	  to the sending host only to fix a preset maximum packet length.	  To avoid the need for the SEAL layer to fragment packets of this	  length, this MTU value (for the input of the tunnel) needs to be	  set significantly below 1500 bytes, assuming the typically ~1500	  byte MTU values for paths across the DFZ today.  In order to	  avoid this excessive fragmentation, this value could only be	  raised to a ~9k byte value at some time in the future where	  essentially all paths between ITRs and ETRs were jumbo frame	  capable.	</t>	<t>	  A fuller version of this critique was posted to the RRG list on	  2010-01-26.	</t>      </section>      <section title='Rebuttal'>	<t>	  The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON)	  <xref target='I-D.templin-iron'/> is a scalable Internet routing	  architecture that builds on the RANGER recursive enterprise	  network hierarchy <xref target='RFC5720'/>. IRON bonds together	  participating RANGER networks using VET	  <xref target='I-D.templin-intarea-vet'/> and SEAL	  <xref target='I-D.templin-intarea-seal'/> to enable secure and	  scalable routing through automatic tunneling within the Internet	  core.  The IRON-RANGER automatic tunneling abstraction views the	  entire global Internet DFZ as a virtual NBMA link similar to	  ISATAP <xref target='RFC5214'/>.	</t>	<t>	  IRON-RANGER is an example of a Core-Edge Separation (CES)	  system. Instead of a classical mapping database, however,	  IRON-RANGER uses a hybrid combination of a proactive dynamic	  routing protocol for distributing highly aggregated Virtual	  Prefixes (VPs) and an on-demand data driven protocol for	  distributing more-specific Provider Independent (PI) prefixes	  derived from the VPs.	</t>	<t>	  The IRON-RANGER hierarchy consists of recursively-nested	  RANGER enterprise networks joined together by IRON routers	  that participate in a global BGP instance. The IRON BGP	  instance is maintained separately from the current Internet	  BGP Routing LOCator (RLOC) address space (i.e., the set of	  all public IPv4 prefixes in the Internet). Instead, the IRON	  BGP instance maintains VPs taken from Endpoint Interface	  iDentifier (EID) address space, e.g., the IPv6 global unicast	  address space. To accommodate scaling, only O(10k) - O(100k)	  VPs are allocated e.g., using /20 or shorter IPv6 prefixes.	</t>	<t>	  IRON routers lease portions of their VPs as Provider	  Independent (PI) prefixes for customer equipment (CEs),	  thereby creating a sustaining business model. CEs that lease	  PI prefixes propagate address mapping(s) throughout their	  attached RANGER networks and up to VP-owning IRON router(s)	  through periodic transmission of "bubbles" with authenticating	  and PI prefix information. Routers in RANGER networks and IRON	  routers that receive and forward the bubbles securely install	  PI prefixes in their FIBs, but do not inject them into the RIB.	  IRON routers therefore keep track of only their customer base	  via the FIB entries and keep track of only the Internet-wide	  VP database in the RIB.	</t>	<t>	  IRON routers propagate more-specific prefixes using secure	  redirection to update router FIBs. Prefix redirection is	  driven by the data plane and does not affect the control	  plane. Redirected prefixes are not injected into the RIB,	  but rather are maintained as FIB soft state that is purged	  after expiration or route failure. Neighbor unreachability	  detection is used to detect failure.	</t>	<t>	  Secure prefix registrations and redirections are accommodated	  through the mechanisms of SEAL. Tunnel endpoints using SEAL	  synchronize sequence numbers, and can therefore discard any	  packets they receive that are outside of the current sequence	  number window. Hence, off-path attacks are defeated. These	  synchronized tunnel endpoints can therefore exchange prefixes	  with signed certificates that prove prefix ownership in such	  a way that DoS vectors that attack crypto calculation overhead	  are eliminated due to the prevention of off-path attacks.	</t>	<t>	  CEs can move from old RANGER networks and re-inject their PI	  prefixes into new RANGER networks. This would be accommodated by	  IRON-RANGER as a site multihoming event while host mobility and	  true locator-ID separation is accommodated via HIP	  <xref target='RFC5201'/>.	</t>
