Abstract

   This memo presents the different security threats related to
   SPEERMINT classifying them into threats to the Location Function, to
   the Signaling Function and to the Media Function.  The different
   instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the
   classification.  Finally the existing security solutions in SIP and
   RTP/RTCP are presented to describe the countermeasures currently
   available for such threats.  The objective of this document is to
   identify and enumerate the SPEERMINT-specific threat vectors in order
   to specify security-related requirements.  Once the requirements are
   identified, methods and solutions how to achieve such requirements
   can be selected.

Internet-Draft                VoIP Threats                   August 2007


1.  Introduction

   With VoIP, the need for security is compounded because there is the
   need to protect both the control plane and the data plane.  In a
   legacy telephone system, security is a more valid assumption.
   Intercepting conversations requires either physical access to
   telephone lines or to compromise the Public Switched Telephone
   Network (PSTN) nodes or the office Private Branch eXchanges (PBXs).
   Only particularly security-sensitive organizations bother to encrypt
   voice traffic over traditional telephone lines.  In contrast, the
   risk of sending unencrypted data across the Internet is more
   significant (e.g.  DTMF tones corresponding to the credit card
   number).  An additional security threat to Internet Telephony comes
   from the fact that the signaling is sent using the same network as
   the multimedia data; traditional telephone systems have the signaling
   network separated from the data network.  This is an increased
   security threat since a hacker could attack the signaling network and
   its servers with increased damage potential (call hijacking, call
   drop, DoS attacks, etc.).  Therefore there is the need of
   investigating the different security threats, to extract security-
   related requirements and to highlight the solutions how to protect
   from such threats.

2.  Security Threats relevant to SPEERMINT

   This section enumerates potential security threats relevant to
   SPEERMINT.  A taxonomy of VoIP security threats is defined in [1].
   Such a taxonomy is really comprehensive and takes into account also
   non-VoIP-specific threats (e.g. loss of power, etc.).  Threats
   relevant to the boundaries of layer-5 SIP networks are extracted from
   such a taxonomy and mapped to the classification relevant for the
   SPEERMINT architecture as defined in [2], moreover additional threats
   for the SPEERMINT architecture are listed and detailed under the same
   classification:

   o  Location Function (LF);

   o  Signaling Function (SF);

   o  Media Function (MF).

   An additional category is also included for completeness to address
   social threats relevant to SPEERMINT even if they are currently out
   of the scope of the SPEERMINT charter.

2.1.  Threats Relevant to the Location Function (LF)

2.1.1.  Threats to LF Confidentiality

   o  numbers/identities harvesting - the attacker harvests numbers
      and/or user identities by issuing a multitude of location requests
      with the purpose of discovering the existent ones and their
      identifiers/addresses for calling them, for using them as spoofed
      identities or just for retrieving their location in the physical
      topology;

   o  signaling entities harvesting - the attacker harvests signaling
      entities (SIP Proxy Servers, etc.) addresses by issuing a specific
      number of requests with the purpose of discovering their location
      in the physical topology or for targeting them with subsequent
      attacks.

2.1.2.  Threats to LF Integrity

   o  routing directories modification - the attacker modifies routing
      directories (e.g.  DNS, ENUM tree, etc.) in an unauthorized way in
      order to modify the call routing.  The scope could be to reroute
      the call inserting unauthorized nodes in the path, to exclude
      authorized nodes from the path, to route the call towards a wrong
      destination causing a Denial of Service (DoS), to route the call
      towards a wrong destination causing annoyance for the callee;

Internet-Draft                VoIP Threats                   August 2007


   o  call routing modification by Man in the Middle (MitM) - the
      attacker has already or inserts an unauthorized node in the
      signaling path in order to modify the call routing.  The scope
      could be to reroute the call inserting other unauthorized nodes in
      the path, to exclude authorized nodes from the path, to route the
      call towards a wrong destination causing a Denial of Service
      (DoS), to route the call towards a wrong destination causing
      annoyance for the callee;

   o  DNS and ENUM hijacking - the attacker uses a technique called
      cache poisoning that exploits a flaw in the DNS software and
      tricks the server into receiving incorrect information.  The
      compromised server would cache and serve the incorrect information
      locally.  This technique can be used to replace arbitrary NAPTR
      records for a set of ENUM queries with NAPTR records of an
      attacker's choosing.  This allows the attacker to redirect all
      calls to a malicious destination.

   o  proxy impersonation - the attacker tricks a SIP UA or proxy into
      communicating with a rogue proxy.  VoIP calls established among
      different peering providers may introduce a number of new
      opportunities for such attack as intermediate proxies are
      discovered dynamically during call routing.  A successful proxy
      impersonation allows full access and control to all routed SIP
      messages.

2.1.3.  Threats to LF Availability

   o  Denial of Service Attacks to LF - A DoS attack to the location
      function is possible by sending a large number of queries to the
      associated ENUM gateways or DNS servers.  This prevents a User
      Agent to look up the NAPTR record of the intended recipient of the
      call.

2.2.  Threats to the Signaling Function (SF)

   Signaling function involves a great number of sensitive information.
   Through signaling function, user agents (UA) assert identities and
   VSP operators authorize billable resources.  Correct and trusted
   operations of signaling function is essential for service providers.
   This section discusses potential security threats to the signaling
   function to detail the possible attack vectors.

2.2.1.  Threats to SF Confidentiality

   o  call pattern tracking - the attacker tracks the call patterns of
      the users violating his/her privacy;

Internet-Draft                VoIP Threats                   August 2007


2.2.2.  Threats to SF Integrity

   o  session black holing - the attacker intentionally drops essential
      packets (e.g.  INVITE) of the VoIP protocol resulting the call
      initiation to fail, it is needed that the attacker controls (or
      is) a node in the middle of the signaling path;

   o  session tear down - the attacker uses CANCEL/BYE messages in order
      to tear down an existing call at SIP layer, it is needed that the
      attacker replicates the proper SIP header for the hijacking to be
      successful (To, From, Call-ID, CSeq);

   o  seesion hijacking - the attacker uses SIP messages (e.g. 301 Moved
      Temporarily) in order to hijack an existing call towards
      unexisting proxy/endpoint to make the session initiation fail, it
      is needed that the attacker replicates the proper SIP header for
      the hijacking to be successful (To, From, Call-ID, CSeq);

   o  SIP message spoofing - There are a number of ways to perform a DoS
      attack by spoofing SIP messages.  An attacker may directly send
      initial INVITE messages to a User Agent that has no capability to
      authenticate them.  Such messages may cause the UA to ring non-
      stop and effectively make it unusable.  Moreover, if the INVITE
      appears to come from a SIP server, the UA may keep responding to
      the server with multiple messages.  This may cause a DrDoS
      (Distributed Reflection DoS) attack to the SIP server if enough
      UAs are comprimised.  Another technique involves injecting faked
      BYE/CANCEL or error reponses to an ongoing dialogue in order to
      tear down a session or interrupt a session establishment.

   o  accounting fraud by media oversize - the attacker injects in the
      network more traffic than declared in the session request in order
      to avoid paying for the used resources;

   o  session replay - the attacker replays a past session of another
      user in order to have access to the same resources (e.g. a bank
      account, etc.).  This attack can results in using resources
      without paying for them, having access to sensitive inforation,
      loss of money, etc.;

   o  call hijacking - the attacker uses SIP messages (e.g. 301 Moved
      Temporarily) in order to hijack an existing call towards other
      proxy/endpoint, it is needed that the attacker replicates the
      proper SIP header for the hijacking to be successful (To, From,
      Call-ID, CSeq);

   o  caller ID spoofing - the attacker spoofs the caller identifier in
      order to make calls avoiding paying for them.

   o  bypassing SF - the attacker sends the session intiation directly
      to the endpoint (Ua, media gateway, etc.) bypassing signaling
      entities in order to avoid paying for the used resources.

   o  weak caller ID assertion by peers - a carrier member fails to
      achieve the level of identity assertion expected by the federation
      may introduce an entry point for attackers to conduct CID (caller
      ID) spoofing fraud.  This would affect all members in the
      federation, despite their efforts to strengthen the assertion
      within their own domains.

   o  illegitimate transit peers - multimedia traffic may be
      unknowningly delivered through an illegitimate transit peer.  This
      introduces opportunities for a variety of attacks by rough peers.

   o  codec negotiation interruption/modification - signaling function
      is used to perform handshake regarding the codec(s) to be used
      during multimedia session.  An attacker may intentionally drop or
      modify only packets involved in the handshake.  This attack could
      interrupt the multimedia communication or degrade the quality
      achievable in the case o lower quality codec is used.

   o  SIP protocol spefication interruption/modification - signaling
      function may use specific details of the signaling protocol.
      Extensions and the signaling associated may vary.  An attacker may
      intentionally drop or modify only packets meant to give evidence
      or declare such extensions tricking the peering party into wrong
      assumptions.  This attack could make the peering party wrongly
      allocating protocol mediation function resulting in failure to
      establish communications or parts of them.  Moreover the peering
      party would unnecessarly use resources in allocating such protocol
      mediation function resulting in a DoS attack.

   o  bid-down attack to SF - a number of encryption key exchange
      protocols performs handshake through the Signaling Function.  An
      attacker may intentionally drop or modify only packets involved in
      the handshake.  While this attack does not interrupt the voice
      communication, calling parties are prenvented from establishing an
      SRTP session to secure privacy.

2.2.3.  Threats to SF Availability

   o  SIP malformed requests and messages - the attacker tries to cause
      a crash or a reboot of the proxy/endpoint by sending SIP malformed
      requests and messages;

   o  SIP requests and messages flooding - the attacker tries to exhaust
      the resources of the proxy/endpoint by sending many SIP requests

      and messages;

2.3.  Threats to the Media Function (MF)

   Media function is responsible for the actual delivery of multimedia
   comunication between the users and carries sensitive information.
   Through media function, user agents (UA) can establish secure
   communications and monitor quality of conversations.  Correct and
   trusted operations of media function is essential for privacy and
   service assurance issues.  This section discusses potential security
   threats to the media function to detail the possible attack vectors.

2.3.1.  Threats to MF Confidentiality

   o  eavesdropping - the attacker reconstruct the conversation and/or
      additional data delivered with it (e.g.numbers transmitted with
      DTMF tones);

2.3.2.  Threats to MF Integrity

   o  media alteration - the attacker alters some RTP packets in order
      to modify the conversation between two users;

   o  bid-down attack to MF - a number of encryption key exchange
      protocols performs handshake through the Media Function.  ZRTP [3]
      is an example of such protocol that exchanges key information
      using RTP at the beginning before establishing an SRTP session.
      An attacker may intentionally drop only RTP packets involved in
      the handshake.  While this attack does not interrupt the voice
      communication, calling parties are prenvented from establishing an
      SRTP session to secure privacy.

2.3.3.  Threats to MF Availability

   o  RTP/RTCP malformed messages - the attacker tries to cause a crash
      or a reboot of the proxy/endpoint by sending RTP/RTCP malformed
      messages;

   o  RTP/RTCP messages flooding - the attacker tries to exhaust the
      resources of the proxy/endpoint by sending many RTP/RTCP messages;

   o  RTP/RTCP session tear down - the attacker uses RTCP messages (e.g.
      BYE) in order to tear down an existing call at RTP layer, the SIP
      layer will not notice that the RTP flow has been torn down and the
      call will not result as released;

   o  RTP/RTCP QoS degradation - the attacker sends wrong RTCP reports
      advertising more packet loss or more jitter than actually
