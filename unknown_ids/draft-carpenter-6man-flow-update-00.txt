Abstract

   Various uses proposed for the IPv6 flow label are incompatible with

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update              February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The flow label field in the IPv6 header is reserved but left
   experimental by [RFC2460] and is specified by [RFC3697].  We quote
   three rules from that RFC:
   1.  "The Flow Label value set by the source MUST be delivered
       unchanged to the destination node(s)."
   2.  "IPv6 nodes MUST NOT assume any mathematical or other properties
       of the Flow Label values assigned by source nodes."
   3.  "Router performance SHOULD NOT be dependent on the distribution
       of the Flow Label values.  Especially, the Flow Label bits alone
       make poor material for a hash key."

   The second two rules essentially forbid a usage in which the bits of
   the flow label are encoded with a specific semantic meaning, or are
   assumed to have any particular property such as randomness.  However,
   both before and after these rules were laid down, a considerable
   number of proposals for use of the flow label have been published
   that seem incompatible with them.  Examples are
   [I-D.conta-ipv6-flow-label], [I-D.conta-diffserv-ipv6-fl-classifier],
   [I-D.chakravorty-6lsa], [I-D.banerjee-flowlabel-ipv6-qos],
   [I-D.metzler-ipv6-flowlabel], [LeeKim], [LinTseng], and [Prakash].
   These authors propose use cases in which some combination of the
   following options apply:
   o  The flow label may be changed by intermediate systems.
   o  It doesn't matter if the flow label is changed, because the
      receiver doesn't use it.
   o  Some or all bits of the flow label are coded: they have specific
      meanings understood by routers and switches along the path.
   o  The coding is related to the required quality of service, as well
      as identifying a flow.
   o  The label is used to control forwarding or switching in some way.

   These proposals all require either some form of encoding of semantics
   in the bits of the flow label, or the ability for routers to modify
   the flow label, or both.  Thus they infringe the rules from RFC 3697
   quoted above.

   Although [I-D.roberts-inband-qos-ipv6] does not explicitly consider
   the flow label, it requests hop-by-hop functionality in IPv6 packets
   very similar to what is needed by the above proposals.

   We can conclude that a considerable number of researchers and
   designers are stymied by RFC 3697.  On the other hand, proposals such
   as [I-D.martinbeckman-ietf-ipv6-fls-ipv6flowswitching],
   [I-D.martinbeckman-ietf-ipv6-amp-ipv6hcamp],
   [I-D.blake-ipv6-flow-label-nonce], and [I-D.carpenter-flow-ecmp]
   appear to be compatible with RFC 3697.  The latter two are based on

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update              February 2010


   the originator of a packet choosing a pseudo-random flow label for
   each flow.  Thus, we can also conclude that there is a useful role
   for this approach too.  The proposal below is intended to resolve
   this dilemma by allowing both approaches to co-exist.


2.  Normative Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Changes to specification

   We note that although RFC 3697 requires the flow label to be
   delivered unchanged, it is not included in any transport layer
   pseudo-header checksums nor in IPsec authentication [RFC4302].  We
   also note that at the time of writing, the flow label is observed to
   be set to zero in an overwhelming proportion of IPv6 packets; neither
   operating systems nor applications currently set it, and routers do
   not rely on it.  Thus there is no reason to expect operational
   difficulties if a careful change is made to the rules of RFC 3697.

   The purpose of the proposed change is that some flow label values
   should be available for domain-specific use, with locally defined
   semantics, and that other flow label values should be available for
   uses essentially compatible with RFC 3697.  There should be no impact
   on specifications other than RFC 3697 and no impact on currently
   operational software and hardware.

   The proposal is as follows:
   o  If the most significant bit (MSB) of the flow label is 0, then the
      remaining 19 bits MUST obey the rules of [RFC3697].  (Note that
      this does not change the meaning of an all-zero flow label or the
      requirement to deliver it unchanged.)
   o  If the MSB of the flow label is 1, the remaining 19 bits MAY obey
      a locally defined set of rules and those bits MAY be changed en
      route.

   The locally defined set of rules will apply within a given Flow Label
   Domain, analagous to a Differentiated Services Domain [RFC2474].  A
   "boundary router" is defined as any router at the boundary between a
   Flow Label Domain and other parts of the Internet.  The following
   rules define the consequences for compatibility:
   o  Sending hosts that are not updated will in practice continue to
      send zero labels, which MUST be delivered unchanged.

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update              February 2010


   o  Sending hosts wishing to rely on RFC 3697 behaviour MUST choose
      labels with MSB = 0.
   o  Sending hosts wishing to use locally defined behaviour MUST choose
      labels with MSB = 1 and whatever other rules apply locally.
   o  Receiving hosts that are not updated will continue to ignore
      labels.
   o  Receiving hosts wishing to rely on RFC 3697 behaviour MUST verify
      that MSB = 0.
   o  Receiving hosts wishing to use locally defined behaviour MUST
      verify that MSB = 1.
   o  Routers wishing to implement or rely on locally defined behaviour
      MUST verify that MSB = 1; if MSB = 0 they MUST NOT change the flow
      label.
   o  Considering packets outbound from the Flow Label Domain, if MSB =
      0, a boundary router MUST NOT change the flow label.  If MSB = 1,
      it MUST set all 20 bits of the flow label to zero, so that the
      locally defined behaviour is not exported from the domain.
   o  Considering packets inbound to the Flow Label Domain, if MSB = 0,
      a boundary router MUST NOT change the flow label.  If an inbound
      packet has MSB = 1, it has originated from a source not following
      the current specification.  This is considered to be an extremely
      unlikely case, and the boundary router MUST set all 20 bits of the
      flow label to zero, as the choice least likely to cause unwanted
      behaviour.  (Note that this means the rules for inbound and
      outbound packets at the boundary router are identical.)

   With the ability to define local semantics for 19 bits of the flow
   label, and the above provisions for compatibility, we add a further
   recommendation.  Its intention is to encourage load balancing
   solutions based on the flow label, or to enable the behaviour defined
   in [I-D.blake-ipv6-flow-label-nonce].
   o  Sending hosts that do not use a locally defined flow label
      behaviour SHOULD choose flow labels with MSB = 0 followed by a
      pseudo-random 19 bit number between 1 and 0x7FFFF.


4.  Alternative Approach

   Note that an alternative approach would be possible, using a specific
   differentiated services code point (DSCP)[RFC2474] in the Traffic
   Class octet instead of the MSB of the flow label itself, to flag a
   locally defined behaviour.  In this model, the above rules would be
   modified by replacing the condition "MSB = 1" by the condition "DSCP
   = xxxxxx" (for a specific value xxxxxx) and other fairly
   straightforward changes.  A more elaborate version of this was
   proposed in [I-D.martinbeckman-ietf-ipv6-fls-ipv6flowswitching].
   However, there are two issues with this approach.  One is that DSCP
   values are themselves only locally significant, whereas the

Internet-Draft              Flow Label Update              February 2010


   specification above makes the MSB a globally signficant flag,
   consistent with the end-to-end nature of the original flow label
   definition.  Secondly, it seems unwise to meld the semantics of
   differentiated services, which are currently deployed to some extent,
   with the unknown future semantics of flow label usage.


5.  Security Considerations

   The flow label is not protected in any way and can be forged by an
   on-path attacker.  On the other hand, a pseudo-random flow label
   cannot be readily guessed by an off-path attacker.  See RFC 3697 for
   further discussion.

   This document requests no action by IANA.
