    <abstract>
      <t>This document analyzes the set of requirements for Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) for the Transport Profile of
      MPLS(MPLS-TP) as defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref>, to
      evaluate whether existing OAM tools (either from the current MPLS
      toolset or from the ITU-T documents) can be applied to these
      requirements. Eventually, the purpose of the document is to map the set
      of functions to a set of tools based on the existing OAM toolset.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Scope">
        <t>OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) plays a
        significant role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault
        management and performance monitoring in both the transport and the
        service layers in order to improve their ability to support services
        with guaranteed and strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while
        reducing their operational costs.</t>

        <t><xref target="MPLS-TP Reqs"></xref> in general, and <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> in particular define a set of
        requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
        for MPLS-TP Segments, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) (network
        infrastructure) and Pseudowires (PWs) (services). One of the mandates
        of the joint (IETF and ITU-T) MPLS-TP work-item is the objective of
        developing a Transport Profile is to base the toolset on existing MPLS
        technologies. In addition, <xref target="MPLS-TP Reqs"></xref>
        indicates the need for the OAM toolset for MPLS-TP to be fully
        interoperable with existing MPLS OAM tools.</t>

        <t>The purpose of this document is to outline the recommendations of
        the MPLS-TP design team and confirmed by the working group for the 
		toolset that should be defined to fulfill the OAM functionality 
		requirements as documented in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> 
		and <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>. Based on the principles 
		cited above, it was determined to base the MPLS-TP OAM toolset on the
        following existing MPLS tools:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>LSP-Ping as defined in <xref target="LSP Ping"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) as defined in <xref
            target="BASE BFD"></xref> and refined in <xref
            target="MPLS BFD"></xref>.</t>

            <t>ITU-T OAM for Ethernet toolset as defined in <xref
            target="Y.1731"></xref> this will be used for functionality
            guidelines for the performance measurement tools that are not
            currently supported in MPLS.</t>
          </list> It should be noted that certain extensions and adjustments
        may be made to the existing MPLS tools, in order to conform to the
        transport environment and the requirements of MPLS-TP.</t>

    <section title="Basic OAM infrastructure functionality">
      <t></t>

      <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> defines a set of requirements
      on OAM architecture and general principles of operations which are
      evaluated below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> requires that OAM
          mechanisms in MPLS-TP are independent of the transmission media and
          of the client service being emulated by the PW.</t>

          <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> requires that the MPLS-TP
          OAM must be able to support both an IP based and non-IP based
          environment. If the network is IP based, i.e. IP routing and
          forwarding are available, then the MPLS-TP OAM toolset should rely
          on the IP routing and forwarding capabilities. On the other hand, in
          environments where IP functionality is not available, the OAM tools
          must still be able to operate without dependence on IP forwarding
          and routing.</t>

          <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> requires that all OAM
          protocols support identification information, at least in the form
          of IP addressing structure and be extensible to support additional
          identification schemes.</t>

          <t>It is also required that OAM packets and the user traffic are
          congruent (i.e. OAM packets are transmitted in-band) and there is a
          need to differentiate OAM packets from user-plane ones. Inherent in
          this requirement is the principle that MPLS-TP OAM be independent of
          any existing control-plane, although it should not preclude use of
          the control-plane functionality.</t>

          <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> requires a single OAM
          technology and consistent OAM capabilities for LSPs, PWs, and
          Sections.</t>

          <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> requires allowing OAM
          packets to be directed to an intermediate point of a LSP/PW.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The following comprise the document-set that addresses the basic
      requirements listed above:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> document describes
          the architecural framework for conformance to the basic requirements
          listed above. It also defines the basic relationships between the
          MPLS structures, e.g. LSP, PW, and the structures necessary for OAM
          functionality, i.e. the Managed Entity Group, its End-points, and
          Intermediate Points.</t>

          <t>The <xref target="MPLS G-ACH"></xref> document specifies the use
          of the MPLS-TP in- band control channel. This is modeled after the
          VCCV channel described in <xref target="PW ACH"></xref> and allows
          transporting the OAM messages congruently with the data traffic
          while allowing the required identification of the packets. It is
          expected that all of the OAM protocols will be used in conjunction
          with this Generic Associated Channel.</t>

          <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP ACH TLV"></xref> document specifies a
          basic set of TLV fields that could be used by different OAM
          messages, in conjunction with the Generic Associated Channel, to
          supply the additional parameter values necessary for the proper
          functionality.</t>

          <t>The <xref target="MPLS TP Idents"></xref> document addresses the
          need of MPLS-TP to support different addressing spaces. This
          document describes different formats for addresses that could be
          used to identify the transport entities in the network and
          referenced by the different OAM protocols.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="MPLS-TP OAM Functions">
      <t>The following sections discuss the required OAM functions that were
      identified in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> and expanded upon
      in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification">
        <t>Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) are OAM
        operations generally used in tandem, and compliment each other. These
        functions are generally run proactively, but may also be used
        on-demand, either due to bandwidth considerations or for diagnoses of
        a specific condition. Proactively <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> states that the function should
        allow the MEPs to monitor the liveness and connectivity of a transport
        path. In on-demand mode, this function should support monitoring
        between the MEPs and, in addition, between a MEP and MIP.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> highlights the need for
        the CC-V messages to include unique identification of the MEG that is
        being monitored and the MEP that originated the message. The function,
        both proactively and in on-demand mode, need to be transmitted at
        regular rates pre-configured by the operator.</t>

        <section title="Documents for CC-V tools">
          <t><xref target="Pro CC-V"></xref> defines the BFD extensions that
          will be used for proactive CC-V applications. While <xref
          target="Demand CV"></xref> provides the LSP-Ping extensions that
          will be used to implement on-demand Connectivity Verification. Both
          of these tools will be used together with the basic tools mentioned
          above in section 2</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Remote Defect Indication">
        <t>Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is used by a path end-point to
        report to its peer end-point that a defect is detected on a
        bi-directional connection between them. <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> points out that this function may be
        applied to a unidirectional LSP only if there a return path exists.
        <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> points out that this function
        is associated with the proactive CC-V function</t>

        <section title="Documents for RDI">
          <t>The <xref target="Pro CC-V"></xref> document includes and
          extension for BFD that would include the RDI indication in the BFD
          format, and a specification of how this indication is to be
          used.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Route Tracing">
        <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> defines that there is a
        need for functionality that would allow a path end-point to identify
        the intermediate and end-points of the path. This function would be
        used in on-demand mode. Normally, this path will be used for
        bidirectional PW, LSP, and sections, however, unidirectional paths may
        be supported only if a return path exists.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Route Tracing">
          <t>The <xref target="Demand CV"></xref> document that specifies the
          LSP-Ping enhancements for MPLS-TP on-demand Connectivity
          Verification includes information on the use of LSP-Ping for route
          tracing of a MPLS-TP transport path.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Alarm Reporting">
        <t>Alarm Reporting is a function used by an intermediate point of a
        path, that becomes aware of a fault on the path, to report to the
        end-points of the path. <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>
        states that this may occur as a result of a defect condition
        discovered at a server sub-layer. This generates an Alarm Indication
        Signal (AIS) that continues until the fault is cleared. The consequent
        action of this function is detailed in <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Alarm Reporting">
          <t>MPLS-TP defines a new protocol to address this functionality that
          is documented in <xref target="Fault Mng"></xref>. This protocol
          uses all of the basic mechanisms detailed in Section 2.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Lock Reporting">
        <t>Lock reporting, defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref>,
        is similar to the Alarm Reporting function described above. It is used
        by an intermediate point to notify the end points of a transport path
        that an administrative lock condition exists for this transport
        path.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Lock Reporting">
          <t>MPLS-TP defines a new protocol to address this functionality that
          is documented in <xref target="Fault Mng"></xref>. This protocol
          uses all of the basic mechanisms detailed in Section 2.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Diagnostic">
        <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> indicates that there is
        need to provide a OAM function that would enable conducting different
        diagnostic tests on a PW, LSP, or Section. The <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> provides two types of specific
        tests to be used through this functionality:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Throughput Estimation &ndash; allowing the provider to verify
            the bandwidth/throughput of a transport path. This is an
            out-of-service tool, that uses special packets of varying sizes to
            test the actual bandwidth and/or throughput of the path.</t>

            <t>Data-plane loopback &ndash; this out-of-service tool that
            causes all traffic that reaches the target node, either a MEP or
            MIP, to be looped back to the originating MEP. For targeting MIPs,
            a corouted bi-directional path is required.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Documents for Diagnostic Testing">
          <t>These diagnostic functions are being defined in a merge of existing
		  separate individual drafts.  The merged <!-- <xref target="Diagnostic"></xref> --> 
		  document will define a new G-ACH based protocol message that addresses 
		  the Throughput Estimation tool, and also provide various flavors of loopback
          functionality.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Lock Instruct">
        <t>The Lock Instruct function is an administrative control tool that
        allows a path end-point to instruct its peer end-point to lock the
        path. The tool is necessary to support single-side provisioning for
        administartive locking, according to <xfer
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk" />. This function is used on-demand.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Lock Instruct">
          <t>Work is being done on a document <!-- <xref target="Admin Commands"></xref> -->
		  that will specify the new ACH based protocol format for this tool.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Client Failure Indication">
        <t>Client Failure Indication (CFI) is defined in <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> to allow the propagation information
        from one edge of the network to the other. The information concerns a
        defect to a client, in the case that the client does not support alarm
        notification.</t>

        <section title="Documents for CFI">
          <t>Work is being done on a document <!-- <xref target="MPLS-TP CFI"></xref> -->
		  that will specify the new ACH based protocol format for this tool.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Packet Loss Measurement">
        <t>Packet Loss Measurement is required, by <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> to provide a quantification of the
        packet loss ratio on a transport path. This is the ratio of the number
        of user packets lost to the total number of user packets during a
        defined time interval. To employ this function, <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> defines that the two end-points of
        the transport path should exchange counters of messages transmitted
        and received within a time period bounded by loss-measurement
        messages. The framework warns that there may be small errors in the
        computation that result from various issues.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Packet Loss Measurement">
          <t>The <xref target="Loss-Delay"></xref> describes the protocol
          formats and procedures for using the tool. The tool logic is based
          on the behavior of the parallel function described in <xref
          target="Y.1731"></xref>.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Packet Delay Measurement">
        <t>Packet Delay Measurement is a function that is used to measure
        one-way or two-way delay of a packet transmission between a pair of
        the end-points of a path (PW, LSP, or Section), as described in <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref>. Where:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>One-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of
            transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until
            the reception of the last bit of that packet by the destination
            node.</t>

            <t>Two-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of
            transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until
            the reception of the last bit of the loop-backed packet by the
            same source node, when the loopback is performed at the packet's
            destination node.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> describes how the tool
        could be performed (both in proactive and on-demand modes) for either
        one-way or two-way measurement. However, it warns that the one-way
        delay option requires precise time synchronization between the
        end-points.</t>

            can be used to detect data plane failures in Multi-Protocol Label
            Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). There are two parts
            to this document: information carried in an MPLS "echo request"
            and "echo reply" for the purposes of fault detection and
            isolation, and mechanisms for reliably sending the echo reply.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>One desirable application of Bi-directional Forwarding
            Detection (BFD) is to detect a Multi Protocol Label Switched
            (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) data plane failure. LSP-Ping is
            an existing mechanism for detecting MPLS data plane failures and
            for verifying the MPLS LSP data plane against the control plane.
            BFD can be used for the former, but not for the latter. However
            the control plane processing required for BFD control packets is
            relatively smaller than the processing required for LSP-Ping
            messages. A combination of LSP-Ping and BFD can be used to provide
            faster data plane failure detection and/or make it possible to
            provide such detection on a greater number of LSPs. This document
            describes the applicability of BFD in relation to LSP-Ping for
            this application. It also describes procedures for using BFD in
            this environment.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>An essential Operations, Administration and Maintenance
            requirement of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability
            to monitor performance metrics for packet loss and one-way and
            two-way delay for MPLS-TP pseudowires, Label Switched Paths, and
            Sections. This document specifies protocol mechanisms to
            facilitate the efficient and accurate measurement of these
            performance metrics.</t>
