Abstract

   The BGP Encapsulation Subsequence Address Family Identifiers (SAFI)
   provides a method for the dynamic exchange of encapsulation
   information, and the indication of encapsulation protocol types to be
   used for different next hops.  Currently support for GRE and L2TPv3
   tunnel types are defined.  This document defines support for IPsec

1. Introduction

   The BGP [RFC4271] Encapsulation Subsequence Address Family
   Identifiers (SAFI) allows for the communication of tunnel information
   and the association of this information to a BGP next hop.  The
   Encapsulation SAFI can be used to support the mapping of prefixes to
   next hops and tunnels of the same address family, IPv6 prefixes to
   IPv4 next hops and tunnels using [RFC4798], and IPv4 prefixes to IPv6
   next hops and tunnels using [V4NLRI-V6NH].  The Encapsulation SAFI
   can also be used to support the mapping of VPN prefixes to tunnels
   when VPN prefixes are advertised per [RFC4364] or [RFC4659].
   [SOFTWIRES] provides useful context for the use of the Encapsulation
   SAFI.

   The Encapsulation SAFI is defined in [ENCAPS-SAFI].  [ENCAPS-SAFI]
   also defines support for the GRE [RFC2784] and L2TPv3 [RFC3931]
   tunnel types.  This document builds on [ENCAPS-SAFI] and defines
   support for IPsec tunnels.  Support is defined for IP Authentication
   Header in Tunnel-mode (AH), [RFC4302], and for IP Encapsulating
   Security Payload in Tunnel-mode (ESP), [RFC4303].  Support for IP-in-
   IP, [RFC2003], and MPLS-in-IP, [RFC4023] protected by IPsec Transport
   Mode is also defined.

   The Encapsulation NLRI Format is not modified by this document.


1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. IPsec Tunnel Encapsulation Types

   Per [ENCAPS-SAFI], tunnel type is indicated in the Tunnel
   Encapsulation attribute. This document defines the following tunnel
   type values:

     - AH in Tunnel-mode: Tunnel Type = 3

     - ESP in Tunnel-mode: Tunnel Type = 4

     - IP-in-IP Tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 5

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-softwire-encaps-ipsec-00.txt  March 10, 2008


     - MPLS-in-IP Tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 6

     Note, see Section 4.3 of [ENCAPS-SAFI] for a discussion on the
     advertisement and use of multiple tunnel types.

   This document does not specify the use of the sub-TLV types defined
   in [ENCAPS-SAFI] with these tunnel types.  See below for the
   definition of an IPsec tunnel type specific sub-TLV.


3. Use of IPsec

   If a R1 is a BGP speaker that receives an Encapsulation SAFI update
   from another BGP speaker, R2, then if R1 has any data packets for
   which R2 is the BGP next hop, R1 MUST initiate an IPsec SA of the
   specified "tunnel type", and all such data packets MUST be sent
   through that SA.

   Let R1 and R2 be two BGP speakers that may send data packets through
   R3, such that the data packets from R1 and from R2 may be received by
   R3 over the same interface.  Then if R3 has sent an update containing
   an Encapsulation SAFI, and if this update specifies an IPsec tunnel
   type, and if this update is received by R2, and an Encapsulation-SAFI
   with an IPsec tunnel type, MUST also be received by R1.  That is, on
   a given interface, if IPsec is required for any data packets, it MUST
   be required for all.  It does not necessarily need to be required for
   control packets that are directly addressed to R3.

   Security policy has the granularity of BGP speaker to BGP speaker.
   The required security policies must be configured into the BGP
   speakers, and the policy for each SA is negotiated via IKE.


4. IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV

   This document defines a new sub-TLV for use with the Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute defined in [ENCAPS-SAFI].  The new sub-TLV is
   referred to as the "IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV" and MAY be
   included in any Encapsulation SAFI NLRI ([ENCAPS-SAFI]) indicating a
   Tunnel Type defined in this document. Support for the IPsec Tunnel
   Authenticator sub-TLV" MUST be implemented whenever the tunnel types
   defined in this document are implemented.  However, its use is
   OPTIONAL, and is a matter of policy.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-softwire-encaps-ipsec-00.txt  March 10, 2008


   The sub-TLV type of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV is 3.  The
   sub-TLV length is variable.  The structure of the sub-TLV is as
   follows:

     - Authenticator Type: two octets

       This document defines authenticator type 1, "SHA-1 hash of public
       key", as defined in section 3.7 of RFC 4306.

     - Value: (variable)

       A value used to authenticate the BGP speaker that generated this
       NLRI.  The length of this field is is not encoded explicitly, but
       can be calculated as (sub-TLV length - 2).

       In the case of authenticator type 1, this field contains the
       20-octet value of the hash.

   A BGP speaker which sends the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV with
   authenticator type 1 MUST be configured with a certificate containing
   the public key whose hash is sent in the value field of the sub-TLV.
   This certificate MAY be self-signed.


4.1. Use of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV

   If a IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV with authenticator type 1 is
   present in the Encapsulation SAFI update, then R1 (as defined above
   in Section 3) must use IKE to obtain a certificate from R2 (as
   defined above in Section 3), and R2 must send a certificate
   containing the public key whose hash occurred in the value field of
   the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV.  R1 MUST NOT attempt to
   establish an SA to R2 UNLESS the public key in the certificate hashes
   to the same value that occurs in the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-
   TLV.


5. Security Considerations

   This document uses IP based tunnel technologies to support data plane
   transport.  Consequently, the security considerations of those tunnel
   technologies apply.  This document defines support for IPsec AH
   [RFC4302] and ESP [RFC4303].  The security considerations from those
   documents apply to the data plane aspects of this document.

   As with [ENCAPS-SAFI], any modification of the information that is
   used to form encapsulation headers, or to choose a tunnel type, or to
   choose a particular tunnel for a particular payload type, user data

   packets may end up getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.
   Misdelivery is less of an issue when IPsec is used as such
   misdelivery is likely to result in a failure of authentication or
   decryption at the receiver.  Furthermore, in environments where
   authentication of BGP speakers is desired, the IPsec Tunnel
   Authenticator sub-TLV defined in Section 4 may be used.

   More broadly, the security considerations for the transport of IP
   reachability information using BGP are discussed in [RFC4271] and
   [RFC4272], and are equally applicable for the extensions described in
   this document.


6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new namespaces and new
   values for namespaces defined in this document and reviewed in this
   section.

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignment in
   the Tunnel TLVs and sub-TLVs section of the registry.

      Tunnel Type                                      Reference
      -----------                                      ---------
      AH:                                      Type = 3 [This document]
      ESP:                                     Type = 4 [This document]
      IP-in-IP tunnel
          with IPsec Transport Mode:           Type = 5 [This document]
      MPLS-in-IP tunnel
          with IPsec Transport Mode:           Type = 6 [This document]


      Tunnel Type  Sub-TLV Type                         Reference
      -----------  ------------                         ---------
