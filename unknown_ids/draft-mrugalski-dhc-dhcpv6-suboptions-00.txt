                    Requesting Suboptions in DHCPv6
                draft-mrugalski-dhc-dhcpv6-suboptions-00

Abstract

   DHCPv6 clients may use Option Request Option (ORO) to specify, which
   options they would like to get configured by DHCPv6 servers.  Clients
   may also be interested in specific options that do not appear in
   DHCPv6 message directly (top-level options), but rather as a
   compounds of other options (suboptions).  This document defines way
   of using existing ORO to request for specific suboptions.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft       Requesting Suboptions in DHCPv6          March 2011


1.  Introduction

   There are 2 ways DHCPv6 client can inform a server about its intent
   to have an option configured.  The first (mandatory) way is to send
   ORO.  The second way (optional, can be used as an addition to the
   first one) is to send the actual requested option to provide hints
   for server.  Unfortunately, this only solves the problem of
   requesting top-level options.

   Clients may also be interested in receiving specific sub-options
   (i.e. options that do not appear in DHCPv6 messages directly, but
   rather as components in other options).  Unfortunately, this is no
   clear way for clients to request such sub-options.  [RFC3315] does
   not provide any guidance regarding such problem.


2.  Requesting Suboptions

   Clients that want specific suboptions provided by the server, include
   ORO in the top-level option that requested option is expected in.
   For example, if client expects to have suboption FOO configured in
   IA_NA, it should transmit IA_NA option that contains ORO.  This ORO
   should convey a single FOO option code.


3.  Justification

   Proposed approach allows clients to limit the amount of information
   parameters servers will send.  This avoids larger than necessary
   DHCPv6 messages.  With complex configuration parameters, like
   [I-D.ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option], the amount of available
   additional information may be significant.

   It was suggested that clients may use top-level ORO to express desire
   to receive specific suboptions.  Several existing server
   implementations deal with all options in an uniform way.  Using top-
   level ORO to request suboptions would cause server to misplace
   requested options (i.e. to place it as top-levle option rather than
   suboption).  Avoiding such pitfalls, would complicate server
   implementation significantly, as server would have to be configured
   with extra information regarding each option (where does specific
   option is supposed to appear - top level or as suboption).


4.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   Client includes ORO in each option that it would like to receive
   suboptions in.  For example, if client wants to receive suboption FOO

   in IA_NA option, it SHOULD transmit IA_NA that contains a single ORO
   list.


5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Server processes the whole client message in a regular way, as
   explained in [RFC3315].  For each option that is allowed to have
   suboptions, server checks if there is ORO present within.  Each
   returning top-level option, server populates its response with
   options specified in said ORO.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is not requested to take any actions regarding this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   TBD
