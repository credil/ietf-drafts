                         PKI Proxy Architecture
              draft-zhipeng-pkix-drm-proxy-architecture-03

Abstract

   This document specifies a method and its architecture for proxy
   application based on the PKI environment with X.509 certificate
   [X.509].  This kind of proxy service is applicable in the occasions
   that a proxy entity is authorized by the client to implement the
   tasks with the service provider.  As a typical application, this
   method can be used on DRM service regardless the specific DRM
   standard which is implemented on the interface between the Client
   Device and Service Server.  An DRM instance of the PKI proxy service
   is given in the appendix of this document and is fully addressed to
   support the proxy architecture defined in this document.

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


1.  Introduction

   In the PKI applications, there exist many requirements on
   establishing and verifying the trust relationships among multiple
   entities.  For example, in the proxy services there exist the
   requirement for maintaining the trust relationship among the server,
   the client and the proxy entity.  This kind of trust chain exists in
   many industries, for example in bank services there exists the broker
   as the proxy of the client for the bank services.  An example is the
   proxy service from bank (e.g. e-bank platform) can delegate the
   clients to pay electricity fees from the client's account
   automatically every month if the client has authorized the bank to do
   this service.

   Below list two typical situations when an application MAY use this
   proxy method for service or content access :

   - In home network, the home server or home gateway can manage the
   home devices and subscribe services for these home devices and only
   the home server or home gateway has the right to subscribe services.
   Thus, the home devices can only access service under the permission
   of the home server or home gateway.

   - In business environment, the device with higher grade can control
   the access rights of the devices with lower grade.  So the lower
   grade device can only access some special services or some secret
   content through a server when it holds the authorization of a device
   with higher grade.

   Under this proxy method and architecture, the proxy device on one
   hand can manage the service subscription of the request device, and
   on the other hand can take on most communication tasks with the
   Service Server to reduce the burden of request device.

   In the proxy service, to verify the service subscription or service
   acquisition, the Service Provider (Service Server) SHOULD verify the
   trusted relationship between the request device and the proxy device.
   Based on PKI technology, it is available to conduct such verification
   to support such proxy service under the PKI environment with X.509
   certification.

   Generally, in order to set up the trusted relationship with proxy
   device, the request device SHALL create an authorization document
   with its digital signature to authorize the proxy device of proxy
   responsibilities.  The authorization document SHALL contain the
   detail service information that the proxy device can subscribe for
   the request device.  After receiving the authorization document, the
   proxy device can follow the authorization to take the service

   operation for the request device.

   Meanwhile the authorization between the request device and the proxy
   device SHALL be delivered to the Service Server.  Thus the Service
   Server will only send or issue the service response which is
   compliant to the authorization to the proxy device.  Finally, the
   service response will be transferred to the request device by the
   proxy device.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Architecture for Proxy Service

   The general service architecture for the proxy application is listed
   as Figure 1:

   +----------+   Request    +----------+  Proxy  Request  +----------+
   | Request  | -----------> | Proxy    | ---------------->| Service  |
   | Device A |<-----------  | Device B |<---------------- | Server   |
   +----------+   Response   +----------+  Proxy  Response +----------+

               Figure 1.  Architecture for Proxy Service

   On the request flow, the Request Device A creates the " Request" and
   sends it to the Proxy Device B. After verifying over the request
   successfully, the Proxy Device B creates and sends the "Proxy
   Request" to Service Server to apply for service for the Request
   Device A. The "Proxy Request" can contain the whole "Request" as an
   element or contain relative elements picked up from the "Request".

   Similarly, on the response flow, the Service Server sends the "Proxy
   Response" upon the "Proxy Request" to the Proxy Device B. Then the
   Proxy Device B creates the "Response" on the basis of the "Proxy
   Response" and sends the "Response" to the Request Device A. In
   general third party proxy services, such kind of interactive flow is
   rather usual.  While for secure application, the key issue is to
   build up and to effectively deliver the trust mechanism since the
   Service Server SHOULD control the risk from all the devices that
   could access the service or content.

   The solution defined in this document to deliver the trust mechanism
   is that the Request Device A sets up trusted authorization with the

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


   Proxy Device B and authorizes the Proxy Device B with the proxy
   rights to take service operations with the Service Server for the
   Request Device A. After the Proxy Device B completes the service
   session with the Service Server, it will send the response that
   corresponds to the trusted authorization back to the Request Device
   A. The mechanism to set up trusted relationship is fully elaborated
   in the following section 4.The message formats of "Request" and
   "Response" in the Figure 1 depends on the specific applications.


4.  Trust Architecture for Proxy service

   In bi-entity architecture, based on PKI environment, the trust
   verification is conducted via verifying the Certificate Chain of each
   other between the two entities of the service.  So, to fulfill the
   trust verification among the three entities within the proxy service,
   a method is given that the Request Device creates an authorization to
   enumerate what right the Proxy Device can hold to subscribe the
   service for the Request Device A. The Trust Architecture is shown as
   Figure 2:

              Certificate A        Certificate A + Certificate B
                    +                            +
 +----------+ Authorization +----------+  Authorization     +----------+
 | Request  | ------------->| Proxy    | -----------------> | Service  |
 | Device A |<------------- | Device B |<-----------------  | Server   |
 +----------+   Response    +----------+   Proxy Response   +----------+

           Figure 2.  Trust Architecture for proxy Service

   The Authorization can be contained in a document.  The Authorization
   Document is sent to Proxy Device B as well as the Certificate Chain
   of Request Device A. The Proxy Device B verifies the secure status of
   Request Device A by checking certificate revocation list (CRL)
   [RFC5280] for the Certificate A. If successfully, then verifies the
   Authorization Document using the public Key of Request Device A that
   is enclosed in the Certificate A, including verifying the signature
   and the proxy rights enclosed in the Authorization Document.  If all
   the verifications are correct, the Proxy Device B parses each element
   in the Authorization document to be aware of the proxy rights that
   are authorized by the Request Device A and confirms that the trusted
   relationship has been set up successfully.

   In the proxy service, the Authorization Document as well as the
   certificates of both Request Device A and Proxy Device B SHALL also
   be delivered to Service Server.  Upon receiving the two Certificates
   and the Authorization Document, Service Server SHALL verify the
   secure statuses of both Request Device A and Proxy Device B by



Zhou & Chen              Expires October 7, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


   checking CRL for their certificates.  If both devices are in secure
   status, then verifies the Authorization Document using the public Key
   of Request Device A that is enclosed in the Certificate A. Once the
   verification of the Authorization Document is successful, the Service
   Server will catch the rights that are authorized to Proxy Device B by
   Request Device A via parsing the elements in the Authorization
   document.

   After all the operations above have been finished, the trusted
   relationship has been set up successfully for the proxy service.
   Thus, the Proxy Device B can only execute the proxy service operation
   under the authorization by the Request Device A. At the same time the
   Service Server will only issue the permitted service to the Request
   Device A via the Proxy Device B according to the Proxy Request (For
   service flow, please refer to section 3).


5.  Format of Authorization Document

   The Authorization Document(AD) is composed of:
      -- name of Request Device
      -- CertId of Request Device
      -- name of Proxy Device
      -- CertId of Proxy Device
      -- authorized service rights
      -- extensions
      -- signature algorithm
      -- signature

   By owning the Authorization Document, the proxy entity can be trusted
   by others that it has already held the authorization by the client
   for the assigned services depicted in the "authorized service rights"
   element while the "authorized service rights" MUST depend on the real
   application.

   The binary structure of Authorization Document is defined as follow:

 AuthorizationDocument() {
       DeviceId()     // The id of Request Device A
       CertId()       // The key information of certificate A
       DeviceId()     // The id of Proxy Device B
       CertId()       // The key information of certificate B
       AuthorizedRights() //proxy rights authorized to Proxy Device B
       ExpireDate()     //The deadline of validity, UTC time
       SerialNumber   32   uimsbf
       SignatureAlgorithm() //Refer to X.509
       Signature()
   }

   DeviceId() {
      Hash()
   }

   CertId() {
          hashAlgorithmId   8   uimsbf  //AlgorithmIdentifier
          issuerNameHash()            //Hash of Issuer's name
          issuerKeyHash()             //Hash of Issuer's public key
          serialNumber   32   uimsbf  //CertificateSerialNumber
   }

   The "hashAlgorithmId" is used to indicate the hash Algorithm.
   Following is the definitions of "hashAlgorithmId" in this document.
   +----------------------------------------+
   | hash Algorithm      |      value       |

       OctetString8()
   }

   AuthorizedRights(){
       // The service rights in proxy service are defined in the implementation.
       // Given each service right will be assigned an Id value.

       for( i = 0; i < RightsNub; i++ ){

       for( i = 0; i < length; i++ ){
           octet   8   uimsbf
       }
   }
   The fields are defined as follows:
   .length - Length of the octet string
   .octet  - A byte

   ExpireDate: For security concern, the Authorization Document contains
   an "ExpireDate" element.  Once that date exceeds the ExpireDate, the
   authorization turns invalid immediately.

   SerialNumber: the serial number of the Authorization Document.  The
   Request Device SHALL assign each Authorization Document a unique
   serial number.

   Signature and SignatureAlgorithm: For verifying whether the AD is
   true or not, the Authorization Document contains the digital
   signature over the other part of the Authorization Document except
   the Signature itself under the request Device's private device key.
   The SignatureAlgorithm indicates the Algorithm for creating the
   digital signature.

   For details of each element of the Authorization Document, it can be
   referred by the DRM instance in the appendix.


6.  Initiation and Update of Authorization

   The procedure of initiating or updating the Authorization can be an
   independent service flow.  The Request Device will get a response for



Zhou & Chen              Expires October 7, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


   its request of Authorization Initiation or Authorization Update.

   Once the authorization is expired, the trusted relationship between
   the Request Device and the Proxy Device will not exist any more.  The
   Request Device needs to initiate a new Authorization.  And during the
   valid duration, the authorization can also be updated.  For example,
   the Request Device wants to authorize the Proxy Device some more
   rights, it can either suspend the original Authorization Document and
   then create a new Authorization Document or just create another
   Authorization Document containing the additional authorized rights.
   Hence the Proxy Device can conduct all the proxy rights up to date.

   If the Request Device wishes to suspend the whole or part of the
   existing authorization, it can create an Authorization Document to
   the Proxy Device to indicate which Authorization Document or which
   proxy right SHOULD be suspended on the base that the Proxy Device is
   fully trusted by the Request Device.  If to guarantee a higher
   security, the Request Device can take a measure to inform the Service
   Server that the trusted relationship to the Proxy Device or some a
   proxy right is suspended.

   On the other side, in the real application, the Proxy Device can also
   suspend part or whole of the trusted relationship.  Thus the Proxy
   Device will not apply for the suspended service for the Request
   Device any more.

   The procedure of Authorization Initiation & Update is shown in Figure
   3 below.

    The message formats are defined as follow:
    AuthorizationRequest() {
        AuthorizationDocument();
        Certificate A;
    }

    AuthorizationResponse() {
        Status;
    }

    ProxyAuthorizationRequest() {
        AuthorizationDocument();
        Certificate A;
        Certificate B;
    }

    ProxyAuthorizationResponse() {
        Status;
    }

    The possible status value of AuthorizationResponse and
    ProxyAuthorizationResponse are defined as below:
    +---------------------------------------------+
    | status                   |      value       |
    +--------------------------+------------------+

   In the Authorization Request, the certificate of Request Device



Zhou & Chen              Expires October 7, 2010               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


   A(certificate A) and the Authorization Document are contained.  If
   the certificate A and Authorization Document are verified
   successfully by the Proxy Device B, and the Proxy Device B has
   accepted the Authorization request, then the Proxy Device B will send
   the Proxy Authorization Request to the Service Server, else return
   the Authorization Response with the status value indicating the
   failure reason.  The Proxy Authorization Request contains the
   certificates of both Request Device A and Proxy Device B(certificate
   A and certificate B) and the Authorization Document.  If the
   information in the Proxy Authorization Request is verified
   successfully and Service Server has accepted the Proxy Authorization
   Request, the Proxy Authorization Response will contain the status
   value of 'SUCCESS', else contain the status value according to the
   failure reason.  Once the Proxy Device B receives the Proxy
   Authorization Response with the status value of 'SUCCESS', it will
   return the Request Device A the Authorization Response with the
   status value of 'SUCCESS', else if the failure reason in the Proxy
   Authorization Response is only on the side of Proxy Device B(such as
   the 'Certificate B invalid'), it will correct the errors and send the
   Proxy Authorization Request again to the Service Server, else will
   return the Request Device A the Authorization Response with the
   status value of the failure reason.


7.  Application Example

   Take the home application as an example, the Home Gateway( or the
   Home Server) acts as the Proxy Device.  The benefit is the User can
   just register one Device(the Home Server) to the Service Provider and
   apply for the services for all his personal devices as his desire
   very conveniently.

   The procedure is very simple that the User operates a device to
   create and send an Authorization Document to the Home Server.  Then
   he can use that device to apply for service via the Home Server's
   proxy at once after the Home Serve accepts the authorization.  On
   this architecture the service charging will also be very convenient
   to the service since the charge can be bounded on the Home Server
   only.

   On this architecture, another advantage is that the Home Server can
   actually control the other devices for applying the service.  Somehow
   this architecture acts similarly as the "Parent Mechanism" to
   constrain the children's content applications via controlling the
   devices of the children since the Home Server can judge and refuse
   the service applications of the Request Device, or refuse the
   "Authorized Rights" from the Request Device.

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


   On some cases, the Request Device SHOULD ask the Home Server to
   suspend some service applications.  For instance, the Request Device
   will be given to the User's friend, then the Proxy relationship can
   be suspended once the Request Device sends the Authorization Document
   containing the suspending rights.


8.  Extended Architecture

   In the section 3, one Proxy Device is deployed in the Proxy
   Architecture.  In fact, by the proxy mechanism defined above, a
   Multiple-Proxy Architecture can be implemented as shown in Figure 4
   below:

                               Proxy                 Proxy
+--------+ Request +---------+ Request-1 +---------+ Request-n +-------+
|Request | ------->|Proxy    | .........>|Proxy    |---------->|Service|

   In the Multiple-Proxy Architecture, if the Proxy Device can not apply
   for service to the Service Server directly either, it can forward the
   Request to the next Proxy Device.  On the return way, the Response
   will be delivered back one by one to the Request Device.

   The Trust Architecture for Multiple-Proxy Service is shown in Figure
   5 below.

       Figure 5.  Trust Architecture for Multiple-Proxy Service

   In the Trust Architecture for the Multiple-Proxy Service, the
   certificates and authorization SHOULD be relayed until to the Service
   Server.  If in one step, the verification of certificates and
   Authorization is not successful, the trusted relationship chain
   between the Request Device and the Service Server can not be built
   up.  Hence the proxy service will not be available for the Request
   Device.


9.  Security Considerations

   To guarantee the Authorization Document is valid in limited period,
   it SHALL contain the expiration date which SHALL be earlier than the
   expiration date ("notAfter" element defined in X.509) of the
   certificates of both Request Device and Proxy Device.  During the
   valid period, the Authorization Document does not need to be
   delivered in every service operation if the target entity (the Proxy
   Device or Service Server) has already held it.

   If during the valid period, either the Request Device or the Proxy
   Device has updated its certificate, this Authorization Document will
   expire automatically.  It means either the Proxy Device or the
   Service Server will reject the Request or Proxy Request if the
   Authorization Document can not be verified successfully.  Therefore
   the Request Device needs to create a new one if it like to continue
   the proxy service.

   In the Trust Architecture, all the involved entities including the
   Request Device, the Proxy Device and the Service Server MUST be
   secure device and server meanwhile should correctly execute the
   service protocols.

Appendix A.  Proxy DRM Service

   As a typical PKI application, the DRM(Digital Rights Management)
   service currently has been well developed on the service protocol, so
   in this appendix, the full solution of proxy trust relationship on
   the DRM service based on the OMA DRM2.1 is taken as an instance for
   the implementation of the Trust Architecture for proxy Service.  As
   following, this appendix gives the definition of proxy rights based
   on [OMA DRM2.1 TS] for the OMA DRM service that can be referenced by
   other kinds of services.

   For the DRM implementation, two issues SHOULD depend on the specific
   application:

   The first issue is "types of DRM service".  This document does not
   define the types of DRM service while section 5.1 gives the
   definition of Authorization Document based on the services defined in
   OMA DRM specification [OMA DRM2.1 TS] such as "RO Acquisition" and
   "Join Domain" are referred as an example.

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


   The second issue is "message of DRM service".  This document will not
   define the message of DRM service either.  It can depend on the DRM
   specification.  The method defined in this document can be used for
   any DRM devices if they support PKI and X.509 certificate.

A.1.  Architecture for Proxy DRM Service

   The figure 1 in this document has given the general "Architecture for
   Proxy Service".  As for the DRM application, the "Request" and
   "Response" will be the "DRM Request" and "DRM Response".  Similarly,
   the "Proxy Request" and "Proxy Response" will be the "Proxy DRM
   Request" and "Proxy DRM Response".  See as the following Figure 6.

  +----------+ DRM Request  +----------+ Proxy DRM Request  +----------+
  | Request  | -----------> | Proxy    | ------------------>| Service  |
  | Device A |<-----------  | Device B |<------------------ | Server   |
  +----------+ DRM Response +----------+ Proxy DRM Response +----------+

              Figure 6.  Architecture for Proxy DRM Service

   The message format of the "DRM Request" and "DRM Response" are
   defined in DRM specifications.  This appendix just take the OMA
   DRM2.1 TS as the basement to give a full description on the Proxy DRM
   Service.

A.2.  Authorization Document based on OMA DRM2.1 TS

   This sub-section provides a instance of Authorization Document for
   DRM service.  In this instance, the service types or service
   authorization are based on the OMA DRM2.1 specification (For details,
   please refer to [OMA DRM2.1 TS] ).

   Defined in the specification of OMA DRM2.1, the service operations
   include "2-pass RO Acquisition","4-pass Confirmed RO Acquisition",
   "1-pass RO Acquisition","3-pass Confirmed RO Acquisition","2-pass
   Join Domain", "2-pass Leave Domain", "2-pass Metering Report" and
   "2-pass RO Upload".

   For example, if the Authorization Document only contains the rights
   of 2-pass RO Acquisition, the Proxy Device can subscribe the ROs for
   the Request Device via the 2-pass RO Acquisition protocol defined in
   OMA DRM2.1 and can not subscribe for the Request Device for joining a
   Domain.

   The fields in Authorization Document for DRM service can be defined
   as following:

   DeviceId: In OMA DRM 2.1, <deviceID> is defined as the hash of the

Internet-Draft           PKI Proxy Architecture               April 2010


   Device's public key info.  Here that definition is followed and the
   hash algorithm is SHA-1 that is set as default hash algorithm in OMA
   DRM 2.1.

   CertId: The essential information of the device's Public Key
   Certificate, including hashAlgorithmId, issuerNameHash,
   issuerKeyHash, and serialNumber.

   AuthorizedRights: It contains three parts: ProxyRightsId,
   SuspendedRightsId and SuspendedAuthorizationNumber.  The
   ProxyRightsId indicates the right that the Request Device has
   authorized to the Proxy Device to subscribe a specific service.  This
   document supports the services defined in OMA DRM2.1, including
   2-pass RO Acquisition, 4-pass Confirmed RO Acquisition, 1-pass RO
   Acquisition, 3-pass Confirmed RO Acquisition, 2-pass Join Domain,
   2-pass Leave Domain, 2-pass Metering Report and 2-pass RO Upload.  To
   support suspending a proxy right, the SuspendedRightsId is used to
   indicate which right is suspended (refer to the section of "Update of
   Authorization").The SuspendedAuthorizationNumber indicates the
   suspended Authorization Document by its serial number.  For details,
   see as following:

AuthorizedRights(){
       // The following service rights in proxy service are defined
       // with the assigned Id respectively:
       // 0    2-pass RO Acquisition
       // 1    4-pass Confirmed RO Acquisition
       // 2    1-pass RO Acquisition
       // 3    3-pass Confirmed RO Acquisition
       // 4    2-pass Join Domain
       // 5    2-pass Leave Domain
       // 6    2-pass Metering Report
       // 7    2-pass RO Upload

       //at most contain eight kinds of authorized right as listed above
       for( i = 0; i < RightsNub; i++ ){
            ProxyRightsId    8     uimsbf
       }

       for( i = 0; i < RightsNub; i++ ){
            SuspendedRightsId    8     uimsbf
       }

       for( i = 0; i < AuthorizationDocumentNub; i++ ){
          //Serial Number of the Authorization Document to be suspended
            SuspendedAuthorizationNumber   32     uimsbf
       }

A.3.  Trust Architecture for Multiple-Proxy DRM Service

   In the DRM application, one device can assign another device for the
   DRM service.  Theoretically, the proxy relationship can be relayed
   for multiple times.  Based on the "Trust Architecture for Multiple-
   Proxy Service", the DRM application can be depicted as the following
   figure 7 while the "Response" will be the "DRM Response" .

              Certificate-A         Certificate-A + Certificate-1

A.4.  Security on Proxy DRM Service

   In DRM service, except the general secure requirement, the DRM
   entities SHALL also comply for the secure measures defined in DRM
   specification or DRM applications.

   With regard to the DRM devices(including the requesting device and
   proxy device) in DRM applications, they SHALL obey the DRM
   specification strictly and SHALL own the security capability
   requested for DRM device in the DRM specification.  Therefore all the
   related security measures defined in DRM specification SHALL be
   completely implemented in these Devices.  The Proxy Device MAY need
   to register with Service Device and only the registered Proxy Device
   can conduct the Proxy Service.  But the Proxy Device will be able to
   take proxy service for any Request Device although it SHOULD send the
   certificate of the Request Device to the Service Server to ensure
   that the Service Server can verify the Request Device's security
   status.

   With regard to the Service Server in DRM applications, it SHALL obey
   the DRM specification too.  For instance, it acts as the RI (Rights
   Issuer) that is defined in OMA DRM2.1 [OMA DRM2.1 TS] .
