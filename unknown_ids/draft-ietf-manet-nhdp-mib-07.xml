      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects      
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in 
      <xref target="RFC2578"/>,  
      <xref target="RFC2579"/> and  
      <xref target="RFC2580"/>.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="Overview">
      <t><xref target="NHDP"/> allows a router in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) to discover and track topological information of routers up to two hops away by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages. This information is useful for routers running various routing and multicast flooding protocols developed within the IETF MANET Working Group.</t>


      <section title="Terms">
        <t>The following definitions apply throughout this document:</t>
        <t><list style='symbols'>
          <t>Notification Objects - triggers and associated notification             messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined            events on the managed router.</t>
          <t>Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are initialized to default settings or set through the management interface defined by this MIB.</t>
          <t>State Objects - automatically generated values which            define the current operating state of the NHDP protocol process in the router.</t>
          <t>Performance Objects - automatically generated values             which help an administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the NHDP protocol process on the router and the overall discovery performance within the MANET.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>    

    </section>



    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">
      <t>This section presents the structure of the NHDP-MIB module. 
         The MIB is arranged into the following structure:</t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
        <t>nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP-MIB notifications.</t>
        <t>nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB.
           The objects are arranged into the following groups:
           <list style='symbols'>
              <t>Configuration Group - defining objects related to 
                 the configuration of the NHDP instance on the router.</t>
              <t>State Group - defining objects which reflect the current
                 state of the NHDP instance running on the router.</t>
              <t>Performance Group - defining objects which are 
                 useful to a management station when characterizing the
                 performance of NHDP on the router and in the MANET.</t>
           </list></t>
        <t>nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
           requirements for implementations of this MIB.</t>
      </list></t>


	   <section title="Notifications">
      	<t>This section describes the use of notifications, and mechanisms to enhance the ability to manage NHDP networks.</t>
      	
         <section title="Introduction">
         	<t>Notifications can be emitted by an NHDP router as a reaction to a specific event. This allows a network manager to efficiently determine the source of problems or significant changes of configuration or topology, instead of polling a possibly large number of NHDP routers.</t>
         </section>
         
         <section title="Notification Generation">
         	<t>When an exception event occurs, the application notifies the local agent, which sends a notification to the appropriate SNMP management stations.  The message includes the notification type and may include a list of notification-specific variables.  <xref target="MIB"/> contains, amongst others, the notification definitions, which includes the variable lists. At least one IP address of the NHDP router that originates the notification is included in the variable list so that the network manager may determine the source of the notification.</t>
         </section>
         
         <section title="Limiting Frequency of Notifications">
         	<t>To limit the frequency of notifications, the following additional   mechanisms are suggested, similar to those in <xref target="RFC4750"/>:</t>
             <section title="Ignoring Initial Activity">
             	<t>The majority of critical events occur when NHDP is enabled on a router, at which time the symmetric neighbors and two-hop neighbors of the NHDP router are discovered. During this initial period, a potential flood of notifications is unnecessary since the events are expected. To avoid unnecessary notifications, a router should not originate expected notifications until a certain time interval has elapsed, which is to be predefined by the network manager.</t>
             </section>
         
             <section title="Throttling Traps">
             	<t>The mechanism for throttling the notifications is the same as in <xref target="RFC4750"/> (i.e. the amount of transmitted notifications per time is bounded).</t>

  				<t>Appropriate values for the window time and upper bound are to be selected by the network manager and depend on the deployment of the MANET.</t>
             </section>
         
             <section title="One Notification per Event">
             	<t>Similar to the according mechanism in <xref target="RFC4750"/>, only one notification is sent per event.</t>
             </section>
         </section>
      </section>



      <section title="The Configuration Group">
        <t>The NHDP router is configured with a set of controls. The authoritative list of configuration controls within the NHDP-MIB           are found within the MIB module itself. Generally, an attempt was           made in developing the NHDP-MIB module to support all configuration           objects defined in <xref target="NHDP"/>. For all of the configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of these parameters as defined in <xref target="NHDP"/> are followed.</t>
      </section>



      <section title="The State Group">
        <t>The State Group reports current state information of a router running <xref target="NHDP"/>. The NHDP-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain the complete set of state information defined within the information bases in <xref target="NHDP"/>.</t>

        <t>Two constructs, i.e., TEXTUAL CONVENTIONs, are defined in support of the tables in the State Group. These are NeighborIfIndex and NeighborRouterId.  These are locally (to the NHDP router) defined, unique identifiers. They are used to define indexes to the appropriate State Group tables and to correlate table entries to interface addresses, interfaces and routers within the MANET. NeighborIfIndex is a unique identifier of discovered NHDP interfaces on all routers within the MANET. NeighborRouterId is a unique identifier of discovered NHDP routers within the MANET.</t>
      </section>


      <section anchor="perf_group" title="The Performance Group">
        <t>The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
           This section lists objects for NHDP performance monitoring,
           some of which are explicitly defined in the NHDP-MIB and others which
           are obtainable through a combination of base objects from this MIB 
           and reports available through the <xref target="REPORT">REPORT-MIB</xref>.
           Throughout this section, those objects will be pointed out that are 
           intended as base objects which are explicitly defined within this MIB and those objects which are derived through a combination of the base objects and capabilities offered by the REPORT-MIB.</t>
        
        <t>Unstable neighbors or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes 
           of sets can have a negative influence on the performance of NHDP. 
           The following objects allow management applications to acquire 
           information related to the stability and performance of NHDP:</t>
        
        <t>The following objects return statistics related to HELLO messages:
                 <list style='symbols'>
                    <t>Total number of sent HELLO messages on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This is a Base Object.</t>
                          <t>Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageXmits</t>
                          <t>Object type: Counter32</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Total number of received HELLO messages on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This is a Base Object.</t>
                          <t>Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageRecvd</t>
                          <t>Object type: Counter32</t>
                       </list></t>
                       
                    <t>Total number of sent periodic HELLO messages on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This is a Base Object.</t>
                          <t>Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits</t>
                          <t>Object type: Counter32</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Total number of sent triggered HELLO messages on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This is a Base Object.</t>
                          <t>Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageTriggeredXmits</t>
                          <t>Object type: Counter32</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Acquire history of HELLO message scheduling instances for a given time duration on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>It is desirable to develop the history of the exact timestamps of each HELLO message that has been sent as well as the type of the message (triggered or periodical). The list of events starts at the given point of time t0 and ends at the given time t1.</t>
                          <t>This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB. It is derived from, e.g., the nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits                             Base Object from the NHDP-MIB along with the capabilities derived from the reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB.</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Histogram of the intervals between HELLO messages on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>It is desirable to track the values (in a 2-dimensional array) that represent a histogram                              of intervals between HELLO messages, separated by periodic and triggered types. The histogram would display the distribution of intervals between two consecutive HELLOs of the same type (triggered or periodical) using a given bin size. It includes all HELLOs that have been sent after the given time t0 and before the given time t1.</t>
                          <t>This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB. It can be derived from, e.g., the nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits Base Object from the NHDP-MIB along with the capabilities derived from the reportHistoryGroup from the REPORT-MIB. The network management application could convert this information                             into the desired histogram.</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Changes of the frequency of the message scheduling on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1 into a given number of equal parts. It then creates a  histogram for each part and calculates the distances (e.g. using the Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent histograms in time. A higher value between two histograms means more difference between the histograms. For instance, this is representative of an event that suddenly sends many triggered HELLO messages, whereas before there have been only very few such triggered messages.</t>
                          <t>This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB, as previously discussed, albeit this is a bit more complex with respect to the management application.</t>
                       </list></t>

                    <t>Average number of sent HELLO messages per second between 
                       the given time t0 and t1 on an interface
                       <list style='hanging'>
                          <t>This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the reportSampledGroup from the REPORT-MIB.
                             It is derived from, e.g., the nhdpIfHelloMessageXmits

      <section title="Relationship to Other MIB Modules">
         <t>This section specifies the
            relationship of the MIB modules contained in this document to
            other standards, particularly to standards containing other MIB
            modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB modules and other MIB
            modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction with the MIB
            module contained within this document are identified in this section.</t>


          <section title="Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB">
            <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"/> is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a whole. The 'system' group provides identification of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The NHDP-MIB does not duplicate those objects.</t>
          </section>


          <section title="Relationship to Routing Protocol MIBs relying on the NHDP-MIB">
            <t><xref target="NHDP"/> allows routing protocols to rely on the neighborhood information that is discovered by means of HELLO message exchange. In order to allow for troubleshoot, fault isolate, and manage such routing protocols through a routing protocol MIB, it               may be desired to align the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB and the routing protocol MIB. This is accomplished through the definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB: the NeighborInterfaceId and the NeighborRouterId.  These object types are used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB and routing protocol State Group tables. These objects are locally significant but should be locally common to the NHDP-MIB and the routing protocol MIB implemented on a common networked router. This will allow for improved cross referencing of information across the two MIBs.</t>
          </section>


          <section title="Relationship to the REPORT-MIB">
            <t>This document describes several Performance Management metrics for the management of NHDP network routers. However, not all of these metrics are explicitly defined solely within the context of this NHDP-MIB. Some of these metrics are obtained through joint interaction between this MIB and the REPORT-MIB <xref target="REPORT"/>. This NHDP-MIB defines the minimum necessary objects (often of type COUNTER) which form the underlying basis for more sophisticated Performance Management reporting available in conjunction with the REPORT-MIB.  See <xref target="perf_group"/> for a discussion of the performance metrics for NHDP management.</t>

    DESCRIPTION
        "A locally arbitrary unique identifier associated with an
        NHDP neighbor interface.

        All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
        out of a common number space. In other words, NeighborIfIndex
        values assigned to entries in one table must not overlap with
        NeighborIfIndex values assigned to entries in another
        table.

        The NeighborIfIndex defines a discovered interface of a 1-hop
        or 2-hop neighbor of the local router.  The agent identifies a 
        unique neighbor interface through the receipt of an address
        lists advertised through an NHDP HELLO message.  

        The value for each discovered neighbor interface must remain
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
        network management system to the next re-initialization, except
        that if an application is deleted and re-created.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity. An NeighborIfIndex value must not be re-used until the
        next agent restart."

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This MIB defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
         notification of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol <xref target="NHDP"/>. 
         NHDP allows routers to acquire topological information up to two hops away 
         by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages. The information acquired by NHDP 
         may be used by routing protocols. The neighborhood information, exchanged 
         between routers using NHDP, serves these routing protocols as a baseline 
         for calculating paths to all destinations in the MANET, relay set selection 
         for network-wide transmissions etc.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
         with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
         may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
         The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
         proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
         These are the tables and objects and their        sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>nhdpIfStatus - this writable object turns on or off the NHDP
             process for the specified interface.  If disabled, higher level
             protocol functions, e.g., routing, would fail causing
             network-wide disruptions.</t>

          <t>nhdpHelloInterval, nhdpHelloMinInterval, and nhdpRefreshInterval
             - these writable objects control the rate at which HELLO messages 
             are sent on a wireless interface.  If set at too high a rate, 
             this could represent a form of DOS attack by overloading interface 
             resources.</t>

          <t>nhdpHystAcceptQuality, nhdpHystRejectQuality, nhdpInitialQuality,
             nhdpInitialPending - these writable objects affect the perceived 
             quality of the NHDP links and hence the overall stability of the network.  
             If improperly set, these settings could result in network-wide disruptions.</t>

          <t>nhdpInterfaceTable - this table contains writable objects that affect 
             the overall performance and stability of the NHDP process.  
             Failure of the NHDP process would result in network-wide failure.  
             Particularly sensitive objects from this table are discussed 
             in the previous list items. This is the only table in the 
             NHDP-MIB with writable objects.</t>
        </list></t>


      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
         MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
         vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
         even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
         encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
         via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
         sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         <list style="symbols">
          <t>nhdpDiscIfSetTable - The contains information on discovered neighbors,
             specifically their IP address in the nhdpDiscIfSetIpAddr object. 
             This information provides an adversary broad information on the 
             members of the MANET, located within this single table.  
             This information can be use to expedite attacks on the other members 
             of the MANET without having to go through a laborious discovery 
             process on their own. This object is the index into the table, 
             and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'.  However, this information 
             can be exposed using SNMP operations.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of 
         emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these 
         applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of the
         communications network and to protect sensitive information related 
         to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these capabilities, 
         the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for authentication 
         and privacy is RECOMMENDED.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
         if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
         there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed 
         to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
         provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
         section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
         mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
         RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
         cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to 
         ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
         module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
         those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
         SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.

             nhdp2HopNbrStateChange and nhdpIfRxBadPacket notification
             objects to all the administrator to set the related
             sensitivity tuning parameters for the notifications.</t>

          <t>Ran smilint and cleaned up discovered bugs.</t>
      </list></t>

          <t>Cleaned up and condensed text in the front material to this draft.  
             Specifically, shortened the Configuration and State Group sections, 
             deferring to the MIB as definitive.  Left the Performance Group 
             discussion primarily intact due to its discussion of base and 
             derived performance objects and statistics and their value to management 
             and operations of NHDP.</t>
          <t>Added information identifying objects requiring non-volatile
             storage within the DESCRIPTION clause of the objects within the NHDP-MIB.</t>
          <t>Updated to to NHDP draft version 12.</t>
          <t>Changed type of several objects in the MIB (for timers, and floating point values).</t>
          <t>Removed link-quality object for performance reasons.</t>
          <t>Fixed many small editorial issues.</t>

             the derived (from the REPORT-MIB) objects.</t>
          <t>Added the local nhdpIfIndex to the nhdpIibLinkSetTable.  
             A duplex of interface indexes is required to define a wireless link.</t>
          <t>Added text to the Security Considerations section.</t>
          <t>Added notifications.</t>

      <t>We list here the changes made on the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft to generate
         the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-02 draft.</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Cleaned up several things (e.g. moved N_HOLD_TIME from interface

          <t>Made and extensive addition in the area of performance monitoring.  Added text
             in the front material, added a PerformanceGroup to the MIB and added the PerformanceGroup
             to the Conformance Sections.</t>

      <t>We list here the changes made on the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft to generate
         the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-00 draft.</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Cleanup up numerous typos and add material to the Conformance section in order

          <t>Defined the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterId textual conventions.  These
             identify a remote neighbor IfIndex and a remote neighbor router and are
             used as indexes into NHDP state tables. These constructs were necessary in order
             to associate address lists with specific remote interfaces as required by the

    <section title="Open Issues">
      <t>This section contains the set of open issues related to the
         development and design of the NHDP-MIB.

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Check out the definitions of the Notification Group and their
             relationship within the subtree of the NHDP-MIB.  Should we specify
             thresholds for neighbor change Notifications? How do we
             specify these?</t>
          <t>Also, specify specific SNMP response to the snmp set request,
