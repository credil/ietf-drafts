Internet-Draft       Internal BGP as PE-CE protocol             May 2010


1.  Introduction

   In current deployments, when BGP is used as the PE-CE routing
   protocol, these peering sessions are typically configured as an
   external peering between the VPN provider AS and the customer network
   AS.  At each External BGP boundary, Path Attributes [RFC4271] are
   modified as per standard BGP rules.  This includes prepending the
   AS_PATH attribute with the autonomous system of the originating
   customer CE and the autonomous system(s) of the provider edge
   router(s).

   In order for such routes not to be rejected by AS_PATH loop
   detection, a PE router advertising a route received from a remote PE,
   often remaps the customer network autonomous-system number to its
   own.  Otherwise the customer network can use different autonomous-
   system numbers at different sites or configure their CE routers to
   accept routes containing their own AS number.

   While this technique works well in situations where there are no BGP
   routing exchanges between the client network and other networks, it
   does have drawbacks for customer networks that use BGP internally for
   purposes other than interaction between CE and PE routers.

   In order to make the usage of BGP/MPLS VPN services as transparent as
   possible to any external interaction, it is desirable to define a
   mechanism by which PE-CE routers can exchange BGP routes by means
   other than external BGP.

   One can consider a BGP/MPLS VPN as a provider-managed backbone
   service interconnecting several customer-managed sites.  While this
   model is not universal it does constitute a good starting point.

   Independently of the presence of VPN service, networks which use an
   hierarchical design are typically modeled such that the top-level
   core or backbone participates in a full iBGP mesh which distributes
   routing information between sites via BGP route reflection [RFC4456]
   or confederations [RFC5065].  This will be our service model
   definition.

2.  IP VPN network as a Route Server

   In a typical backbone/area hierarchical design, routers that attach
   an area (or site) to the core, use BGP route reflection (or
   confederations) to distribute routes between the top-level core iBGP
   mesh and the local area iBGP cluster.

   To provide equivalent functionality in a network using a provider
   provisioned backbone, one can consider the VPN network as the
   equivalent of an Internal BGP Route Server which multiplexes
   information from _N_ VPN attachment points.

   A route learned by any of the PEs in the IP VPN network, is available
   to all other PEs that import the Route Target used to identify the
   customer network.  This is conceptually equivalent to a centralized
   route server.

   In a PE router, PE received routes are not advertised back to other
   PEs.  It is this split horizon technique that prevents routing loops
   in an IP VPN environment.  This is also consistent with the behavior
   of a top level mesh of RRs.

   In order to complete the Route Server model, is necessary to be able
   to transparently carry the Internal BGP PATH attributes of customer
   network routes through the BGP/MPLS VPN core.  This is achieved by
   using a new BGP path attribute described below that allows the
   customer network attributes to be saved and restored at the BGP/MPLS
   VPN boundaries.

   When a route is advertised from PE to CE, if it is advertised as an
   iBGP route, the CE will not advertise it further unless it is itself
   configured as a Route Reflector (or has an external BGP session).
   This is a consequence of the default BGP behavior of not advertising
   iBGP routes back to iBGP peers.  This behavior is not modified.

   On a BGP/MPLS VPN PE, a CE-received route MUST be advertised to other
   VPN PEs that import the Route Targets which are associated with the
   route.  This is independent of whether the CE route has been received
   as an external or internal route.  However, a CE received route is
   not readvertised back to other CEs unless Route Reflection is
   explicitly configured.  This is the equivalent of disabling client to
   client reflection in BGP RR implementations.

   When reflection is configured on the PE router, with local CE routers
   as clients, there is no need to internally mesh multiple CEs that may
   exist in the site.

   This Route Server model can also be used to support a confederation

   style abstraction to CE devices.  We choose not to describe in detail
   the procedures for that mode of operation, at this point.
   Confederations are considered to be less common than route reflection
   in enterprise environments.

3.  Path attributes

               --> push path attributes --> vrf-export --> 2547
     VRF route                                             PE-PE route
                                                           advertisement
              <--  pop path attributes <--  vrf-import <--

   The diagram above shows the BGP path attribute stack processing in
   relation to existing 2547 route processing procedures.  BGP path
   attributes received from a customer network are pushed into the
   stack, before adding the Export Route Targets to the BGP path
   attributes.  Conversely, the stack is poped after the Import Target
   processing step that identifies the VRF table in which a PE received
   route is accepted.

   When the advertising PE performs a "push" operation at the "vrf-
   export" processing stage it SHOULD initialize the attributes of the
   BGP IP VPN route advertisement as if for a locally originated route
   from the respective VRF context.

   When a PE received route is imported into a VRF, its IGP metric, as
   far as BGP path selection is concerned, should be the metric to the
   remote PE address, expressed in terms of the service provider metric
   domain.

   For the purposes of VRF route selection performed at the PE, between
   routes received from local CEs and remote PEs, VPN network IGP
   metrics should always be considered higher (thus least preferred)
   than local site metrics.

   When backdoor links are present, this would tend to direct the
   traffic between two sites through the backdoor link for BGP routes
   originated by a remote site.  However BGP already has policy
   mechanisms to address this type of situations such as the LOCAL_PREF
   attribute.

   When a given CE is connected to more than one PE, it will not
   advertise the route that it receives from a PE to another PE unless
   configured as a route reflector, due to the standard BGP route
   advertisement rules.

   When a CE reflects a PE received route to another PE, the fact that
   the original attributes of a route are preserved across the VPN
   network prevents the formation of routing loops due to mutual
   redistribution between the two networks.

4.  Carrying internal BGP routes

   In order to carry the original BGP attributes of a route received
   from a CE, this document defines a new BGP path attribute:

      ATTR_SET (type code 128)

         ATTR_SET is an optional transitive attribute that carries a set
         of BGP path attributes.  An attribute set (ATTR_SET) can
         include any BGP attribute that can occur in a BGP UPDATE
         message, except the MP_REACH and MP_UNREACH attributes.

   The ATTR_SET attribute is encoded as follows:

                      +------------------------------+
                      | Attr Flags (O|T) Code = 128  |
                      +------------------------------+
                      | Attr. Length (1 or 2 octets) |
                      +------------------------------+
                      | Origin AS (4 octets)         |
                      +------------------------------+
                      | Path attributes (variable)   |
                      +------------------------------+

   The attribute value consists on a 4 octet "origin AS" value followed
   by a variable length field which conforms to the BGP UPDATE message
   path attribute encoding rules.  The attribute length is 4 plus the
   total length of the encoded attributes.

   This attribute is used by a PE router to store the original set of
   BGP attributes it receives from a CE.  When a PE router advertises a
   PE-received route to a CE, it will use the path attributes carried in
   the ATTR_SET attribute.

   In other words, the BGP Path Attributes are "pushed" into this stack
   like attribute when the route is received by the VPN network and
   "popped" when the route is advertised in the PE to CE direction.

   Using this mechanism isolates the customer network from the
   attributes used in the VPN network and vice versa.  Attributes as the
   route reflection cluster list attribute are segregated such that
   customer network cluster identifiers won't be considered by the VPN
   network route reflectors and vice-versa.

   The Origin autonomous system number is designed to prevent a route
   originating in a given autonomous-system iBGP to be leaked into a
   different autonomous-system, without proper AS_PATH manipulation.  It
   should contain the autonomous system of the customer network that

Internet-Draft       Internal BGP as PE-CE protocol             May 2010


   originates the given set of attributes.  The value is encoded as a
   32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order, regardless of whether
   or not the originating PE supports Four-octet AS Numbers [RFC4893].

   The AS_PATH and AGGREGATOR attributes contained within an ATTR_SET
   attribute MUST be encoded using Four-octet AS Numbers [RFC4893],
   regardless of the capabilities advertised by the BGP speaker to which
   the ATTR_SET attribute is transmitted.  BGP speakers that support the
   extensions defined in this document must also support [RFC4893].  The
   reason for this requirement is to remove ambiguity between two-octect
   and four-octect AS_PATH attribute encoding.

   The NEXT_HOP attribute SHOULD NOT be included in an ATTR_SET.  When
   present it should be ignored by the receiving PE.

   The ATTR_SET attribute SHALL be considered malformed if any of the
   following applies:

   o  Its length is less than 4 octets

   o  The original path attributes carried in the variable length
      attribute data include the MP_REACH or MP_UNREACH attribute.

   o  The included attributes are malformed themselves.

   An UPDATE message with a malformed ATTR_SET attribute SHALL be
   handled as follows.  If its Partial flag is set and its Neighbor-
   Complete flag is clear, the UPDATE is treated as a route withdraw as
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-idr-optional-transitive].  Otherwise (i.e.
   Partial flag is clear or Neighbor-Complete is set), the procedures of
   the BGP-4 base specification [RFC4271] MUST be followed with respect
   to an Optional Attribute Error.

5.  Next-hop handling

   When BGP/MPLS VPNs are not in use, the NEXT_HOP attribute in iBGP
   routes carries the address of the border router advertising the route
   into the domain.

   An important component of BGP route selection is the IGP distance to
   the NEXT_HOP of the route.

   When a BGP/MPLS VPN service is used to provide interconnection
   between different sites, since the VPN network runs a different IGP
   domain, metrics between the VPN and customer networks are not
   comparable.

   However, the most important component of a metric is the inter-area
   metric, which is known to the VPN network.  The intra-area metric is
   typically negligible.

   The use of route reflection, for instance, requires metrics to be
   configured so that inter-cluster/area metrics are always greater than
   intra-cluster metrics.

   The approach taken by this document is to rewrite the NEXT_HOP
   attribute at the PE-CE boundary.  PE routers take into account the
   PE-PE IGP distance calculated by the VPN network IGP, when selecting
   between routes advertised from different PEs.

   An advantage of the proposed method is that the customer network can
   run independent IGPs at each site.

6.  Exchanging routes between different VPN customer networks

   A given VPN customer network SHOULD use internal or external BGP
   sessions consistently for peering sessions where the same autonomous
   system is used.

   In scenarios such as what is commonly referred to an "extranet" VPN,
   routes MAY be advertised to both internal and external VPN
   attachments, belonging to different autonomous systems.


                          +-----+                 +-----+
                          | PE1 |-----------------| PE2 |
                          +-----+                 +-----+
                         /       \                   |
                  +-----+         +-----+         +-----+
                  | CE1 |         | CE2 |         | CE3 |
                  +-----+         +-----+         +-----+
                    AS 1            AS 2            AS 1

   Consider the example given above where (PE1, CE1) and (PE2, CE3)
   sessions are iBGP.  In RFC2547 VPNs, a route received from CE1 above
   may be distributed to the VRFs corresponding to the attachment points
   for CEs 2 and 3.

   The desired result, in such a scenario is to present the internal
   peer (CE3) with a BGP advertisement that contains the same BGP Path
   Attributes received from CE1 and to the external peer (CE 2) a BGP
   advertisement that would correspond to a situation where AS 1 and 2
   have an external BGP session between them.

   It order to achieve this goal the following set of rules apply:

      When advertising an iBGP originated route to iBGP, a PE router
      MUST check that the autonomous-system contained in the ATTR_SET
      attribute matches the autonomous system of the CE to which the
      route is being advertised.

      In case the autonomous-systems do match, the route is advertised
      with the attributes contained in the ATTR_SET attribute.
      Otherwise, in the case of an autonomous-system mismatch, the set
      of attributes to be advertised to the CE in question shall be
      constructed as follows:

      1.  The path attributes are set to the attributes contained in the
          ATTR_SET attribute.

Internet-Draft       Internal BGP as PE-CE protocol             May 2010


      2.  Internal BGP specific attributes are discarded (LOCAL_PREF,
          ORIGINATOR, CLUSTER_LIST, etc).

      3.  The autonomous-system contained in the ATTR_SET attribute is
          prepended to the as-path following the rules that would apply
          to an external BGP peering between the source and destination
          ASes.

      4.  Internal BGP specific attributes corresponding to the
          configuration of destination AS (LOCAL_PREF) are added.

      When advertising an iBGP originated route to eBGP, a PE router
      shall apply steps 1 to 3 defined above and subsequently prepend
      its own autonomous-system number to the AS_PATH attribute (i.e.
      both the originator and VPN network as numbers are prepended).

      When advertising an eBGP originated route to iBGP, a PE router
      MUST prepend its own as number before adding iBGP only as-path
      attributes (LOCAL_PREF).

   In all cases where an iBGP originating route is processed, attributes
   present on the VPN route other than the NEXT_HOP attribute are
   ignored, both from the point of view of route selection in the VRF
   Adj-RIB-in and route advertisement to a CE router.

7.  Deployment considerations

   It is recommend that different VRFs of the same VPN (i.e. in
   different PE routers) which are configured with iBGP PE-CE peering
   sessions use different Route Distinguisher values.  Otherwise (in the
   case where the same RD is used) the BGP IP VPN infrastructure may
   select a single BGP customer path for a given IP NLRI; without access
   to the detailed path information that is contained in the ATTR_SET
   attribute.

   As mentioned previously, the model for this service is a "Route
   Server" where the IP VPN provides the customer network with all the
   BGP paths known by the CEs.  This effectively implies the use of
   unique RDs per VRF.

   The stated goal of this extension is to isolate the customer network
   from the BGP path attribute operations performed by the IP VPN and
   conversely isolate the service provider network from any attributes
   injected by the customer.  For instance, BGP communities can be used
   to influence the behavior of the IP VPN infrastructure.  Using this
   extension, the service provider network can transparently carry these
   attributes without interference with its operations.

   Another example of unwanted interaction between customer and IP VPN
   BGP attributes is a scenario where the same Service Provider
   autonomous-system number is used both to provide internet service as
   well as the IP VPN service.  In this case, it is not uncommon to have
   a VPN customer route contain the AS Number of the Service Provider.
   The IP VPN network should work transparently in this case as in all
   others.

   This scenario exemplifies the need for isolating the IP VPN network
   from any attributes present in the customer route and is the reason
   why BGP attributes SHOULD be reset after an ATTR_SET "push".  However
   in situations where the service provider network is transitioning and
   contains VPN PEs that do not yet support this extension, an
   originating PE MAY operate in a mixed mode where the customer network
   attributes are retained and influence the IP VPN path attributes.

9.  Security considerations

   It is worthwhile to consider the security implications of this
   proposal from two independent perspectives: the IP VPN provider and
   the IP VPN customer.

   From an IP VPN provider perspective, this mechanism will assure
   separation between the BGP path attributes advertised by the customer
   CE router and the BGP attributes used within the provider network,
   thus potentially improving security.

   Although this behavior is largely implementation dependent, currently
   it is possible for a CE device to inject BGP attributes (extended
   communities, for example) that have semantics on the IP VPN provider
   network, unless explicitly disabled by configuration in the PE.

   With the rules specified for the ATTR_SET path attribute, any
   attribute that has been received from a CE is pushed into the stack
   before the route is advertised out to other PEs.

   From the perspective of the VPN customer network, it is our opinion
   that there is no change to the security profile of PE-CE interaction.
   While having an iBGP session allows the PE to specify additional
   attributes not allowed on an eBGP session (e.g. local-pref), this
   does not significantly change the fact that the VPN customer must
   trust its service provider to provide it correct routing information.
