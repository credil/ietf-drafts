2.  Introduction
    
    Mailing lists are an important part of email usage and collaborative
    communications.  The introduction of internationalized email
    addresses affects mailing lists in three main areas: (1) transport
    (receiving and sending messages); (2) message headers of received
    and retransmitted messages; and (3) mailing list operational
    policies.
    
    A mailing list is a mechanism whereby a message may be distributed
    to multiple recipients by sending to one address.  An agent
    (typically not a human being) at that single address receives the
    message and then causes the message to be redistributed to a list of
    recipients.  This agent sets the envelope return address of the
    redistributed message to a different address from that of the
    original message.  Using a different envelope return address
    (reverse-path) directs error (and other automatically generated)
    messages to an error handling address associated with the mailing
    list. (This avoids having error and other automatic messages go to
    the original sender, who typically doesn't control the list and
    hence can't do anything about them.)

    In most cases, the mailing list agent redistributes a received
    message to its subscribers as a new message, that is, conceptually
    it uses message submission [submission] (as did the sender of the
    original message).  The exception, where the mailing list is not a
    separate agent that receives and redistributes messages in separate
    transactions, but is instead an expansion step within an SMTP
    transaction where one local address expands to multiple local or
    non-local addresses, is out of scope for this document.
    
    Some mailing lists alter the message header, while others do not.  A
    number of standardized list-related header fields have been defined,
    and many lists add one or more of these headers.  Separate from
    these standardized list-specific header fields, and despite a
    history of interoperability problems from doing so, some lists alter
    or add header fields in an attempt to control where replies are
    sent.  Such lists typically add or replace the "Reply-To" field and
    some add or replace the "Sender" field.  Poorly-behaved lists may
    alter or replace other fields, including "From".
    
    Among these list-specific header fields are those specified in RFC
    2369 ("The Use of URLs as Meta-Syntax for Core Mail List Commands
    and their Transport through Message Header Fields") [List-*] and RFC
    2919 ("List-Id:  A Structured Field and Namespace for the
    Identification of Mailing Lists") [List-ID].  For more information,
    see Section 5.
    
    While the mail transport protocol does not differ between regular
    email recipients and mailing list recipients, lists have special
    considerations with internationalized email addresses because they
    retransmit messages composed by other agents to potentially many
    recipients.
    
    There are considerations for internationalized email addresses in
    the envelope as well as in header fields of redistributed messages.
    In particular, an internationalized message cannot be downgraded
    unless all envelope addresses are available in ASCII (that is, each
    address either is ASCII or has an ALT-ADDRESS).
    
    With mailing lists, there are two different types of considerations:
    first, the purely technical ones involving message handling, error
    cases, downgrades, and the like, and second, those that arise from
    the fact that humans use mailing lists to communicate.  As an
    example of the first, mailing lists might choose to reject all
    messages from internationalized addresses that lack an alt-address,
    or even all internationalized messages that can not be downgraded.
    As an example of the second, a user who sends a message to a list
    often is unaware of the list membership.  In particular, the user
    often doesn't know if the members are i18mail users or not, and
    often neither the original sender nor the recipients personally know

    each other.  As a consequence of this, remedies that may be readily
    available for one-to-one communication might not be appropriate when
    dealing with mailing lists.  For example, if a user sends a message
    which is undeliverable, normally the telephone, instant messaging,
    or other forms of communication are available to obtain a working
    address.  With mailing lists, the users may not have any recourse.
    Of course, with mailing lists, the original sender usually does not
    know if the message was successfully received by any list members,
    or if it was undeliverable to some.
    
    Conceptually, a mailing list's internationalization can be divided
    into three capabilities:  First, does it have a UTF-8 submission or
    return-path address?  Second, does it accept subscriptions to UTF-8
    addresses?  And third, does it accept [UTF8SMTP] messages?  This is
    explored in Section 4.
    
    A brief discussion on a few additional considerations for mailing
    list operation is in Section 6.
    
    
3.  Scenarios Involving Mailing Lists
    
    Generally (and exclusively within the scope of this document), an
    original message is sent to a mailing list as a completely separate
    and independent transaction from the mailing list agent sending the
    retransmitted message to one or more list recipients.  In both
    cases, the message might have only one recipient, or might have
    multiple recipients.  That is, the original message might be sent to
    additional recipients as well as the mailing list agent, and the
    mailing list might choose to send the retransmitted message to each
    list recipient in a separate message submission [submission]
    transaction, or might choose to include multiple recipients per
    transaction. (Often, mailing lists are constructed to work in
    cooperation with, rather than include the functionality of, a
    message submission server [submission], and hence the list transmits
    to a single submission server one copy of the retransmitted message,
    with all list recipients specified in the SMTP envelope.  The
    submission server then decides which recipients to include in which
    transaction.)
    
    The retransmitted message sent by the mailing list to its
    subscribers might need to be downgraded [EAI-Downgrade].  In order
    for a downgrade to be possible, the return path set by the mailing
    list agent must be an ASCII address or have ALT-ADDRESS specified.
    In addition, the recipient addresses need to have ASCII addresses
    available.  It may be advisable for mailing list operators to
    pre-obtain an alt-address for all its internationalized member
    addresses.

Internet Draft      Mailing Lists and i18mail Addresses      March 2010


    In the case where a member or non-member with an internationalized
    email address is sending to a mailing list, no alt-address is
    specified, and a downgrade is required, the message cannot be
    delivered.  To protect against this, a UTF8SMTP-aware [UTF8SMTP]
    mailing list might prefer to reject submissions from
    internationalized email addresses that lack an alt-address.
    
    (Note that the situation is not unique to mailing lists.  Mail
    relays that are UTF8SMTP-aware will potentially encounter the same
    situation.) Further discussions are included in section 6 of this
    document.
    
    
4.  Capabilities and Requirements
    
    There are three primary internationalization capabilities of mailing
    lists:  First, does it have a UTF-8 submission or return-path
    address?  Second, does it allow subscriptions from UTF-8 addresses?
    And third, does it accept [UTF8SMTP] messages?
    
    In theory, any list can support any combination of these.  In
    practice, only some offer any benefit.  For example, neither
    allowing UTF-8 addresses to subscribe, nor accepting UTF8SMTP
    messages, makes much sense without the other (an all-ASCII address
    might or might not be capable of receiving UTF8SMTP messages, but a
    UTF-8 address of necessity needs to accept UTF8SMTP messages).
    Likewise, there is no real benefit to a list in using a UTF-8
    submission address unless it also accepts UTF8SMTP messages and
    permits UTF-8 addresses to subscribe.
    
    However, requirements for lists can be discussed separately for each
    of the three capabilities.
    
    1.  If the list uses a UTF-8 submission or return-path address, it
    SHOULD specify an alt-address for it.  Clearly, it needs to sit
    behind a UTF8SMTP-enabled final-delivery SMTP server [UTF8SMTP] and
    delivery agent.  Likewise, if a list uses a UTF-8 return-path
    address, then its MSA [submission] needs to support UTF8SMTP.
    
    The list's return-path address is usually separate from its
    submission address (so that delivery reports and other
    automatically-generated messages are not sent to the submission
    address).  For reliability in receiving delivery status
    notifications, a list MAY choose to use an all-ASCII return-path
    even if it uses a UTF-8 submission address.  If the list does use a
    UTF-8 return path, it MUST specify an alt-address (or else there is
    a high risk of being unable to receive non-delivery reports).

    There are also implications for the List-* headers (see below).
    
    2.  If it allows UTF-8 addresses to subscribe, it MAY require an
    alt-address to be specified for each UTF-8 subscriber.
    
    Naturally, if it permits UTF-8 addresses to subscribe, it needs a
    mechanism to accept subscription requests from such addresses
    (preferably specified in the form <utf8@utf8 <ascii@ascii>>).
    Likewise, its MSA needs to support [UTF8SMTP].
    
    3.  If it accepts UTF8SMTP messages, its MSA needs to support
    UTF8SMTP.
    
    
5.  List Header Fields
    
    A number of header fields specifically for mailing lists have been
    introduced in RFC 2369 and RFC 2919.  These include, for example:
    
    List-Id: List Header Mailing List <list-header.nisto.com> 
    List-Help: <mailto:list@host.com?subject=help> (List Instructions) 
    List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:list@host.com?subject=unsubscribe> 
    List-Subscribe: <mailto:list@host.com?subject=subscribe> 
    List-Post: <mailto:list@host.com> 
    List-Owner: <mailto:listmom@host.com> (Contact Person for Help) 
    List-Archive: <mailto:archive@host.com?subject=index%20list>
    
    As described in RFC 2369, "The contents of the list header fields
    mostly consist of angle-bracket ('<', '>') enclosed URLs, with
    internal whitespace being ignored." [List-*] Whereas RFC2919
    specifies that, "The list identifier will, in most cases, appear
    like a host name in a domain of the list owner." [List-ID]
    
    These mailing list header fields contain URLs.  The most common
    schemes are generally HTTP, HTTPS, mailto, and FTP.  Schemes which
    permit both URI and IRI [IRI] forms should use the URI-encoded form
    described in [IRI].  Future work may extend these header fields or
    define replacements to directly support non-encoded UTF-8 in IRIs
    (for example, [mailto-bis]), but in the absence of such extension or
    replacement, non-ASCII characters can only appear within when
    encoded as ASCII.  Note that discussion on whether internationalized
    domain names should be percent-encoded or puny-coded, is ongoing;
    see [IRI-bis]
    
    Even without these header fields being extended to support UTF-8,
    some special provisions may be helpful when downgrading.  In
    particular, if a List-* header contains a UTF-8 mailto (even encoded
    in ASCII) followed by an ASCII mailto, it may be advisable to not
    only copy and preserve the original header as usual (ENCAPSULATION


R. Gellens                Expires September 2010                [Page 7]

Internet Draft      Mailing Lists and i18mail Addresses      March 2010


    method of [EAI-Downgrade]), but also to edit the header to remove
    the UTF-8 address.  Otherwise, a client might run into trouble if
    the decoded mailto results in a non-ASCII address.
    
    When mailing lists use a UTF-8 form of a List-* header, an ASCII
    form SHOULD also be used.  These headers are vital to good
    operations and use of mailing lists; caution is called for when
    considering how to form and use these headers in a non-ASCII
    environment.
    
    The most commonly-used URI schemes in List-* headers tend to be HTTP
    and mailto.  The current specification for mailto does not permit
    unencoded UTF-8 characters, although work has been proposed to
    extend or more likely replace mailto in order to permit this.  For
    mailto URIs, a separate consideration is how to include an alternate
    ASCII address (alt-address) for a UTF-8 address.  Note that the
    existing ability to specify multiple URLs within each List-* header
    field provides one solution.
    
    [List-*] says:
       A list of multiple, alternate, URLs MAY be specified by a comma-
       separated list of angle-bracket enclosed URLs.  The URLs have
       order of preference from left to right.  The client application
       should use the left most protocol that it supports, or knows how
       to access by a separate application.
    
    When a UTF-8 mailto is used in a List-* header field, an
    alt-address, if available, SHOULD immediately follow it.
    
    The List-ID header field uniquely identifies a list.  The intent is
    that the value of this header remain constant, even if the machine
    or system used to operate or host the list changes.  This header
    field is often used in various filters and tests, such as
    client-side filters, Sieve filters, and so forth.  Such filters and
    tests may not properly compare a non-ASCII value which has been
    encoded into ASCII.  In addition to these comparison considerations,
    it is generally desirable that this header field contain something
    meaningful that users can type in.  However, ASCII encodings of
    non-ASCII characters are unlikely to be meaningful to users or easy
    for them to accurately type.
    
    
6.  Further Discussion
    
    While mailing lists do not create a significant additional burden to
    the deployment of internationalized email address functionalities,
    there are some specific areas that need to be considered when the
    operator of a mailing list or of a final delivery MTA that serves a
    mailing list upgrades to internationalized mail.

Internet Draft      Mailing Lists and i18mail Addresses      March 2010


    Mailing lists face additional complexity since they redistribute
    messages composed by other agents.  Hence, they may be asked to
    accept a message with non-ASCII headers composed by a UTF8SMTP-aware
    user agent [UTF8SMTP], and redistribute it to i18mail and
    non-i18mail users via systems that are not UTF8SMTP-aware.
    
    1.  Obtaining Downgrade Information -- for a mailing list, or mail
    relay server for that matter, that is UTF8SMTP-aware, receiving mail
    from an internationalized email address, the alt-address is not
    required from the sending MTA for the transport to be complete.
    When the mailing list then retransmits the message to its
    subscribers, it may encounter paths where a downgrade is needed (if
    a relay or final MSA does not supports UTF8SMTP).  In order to
    mitigate this situation, the mailing list might perhaps decide to
    reject all incoming mail from an internationalized email address
    that lacks an alt-address.  However, note that in general,
    downgrades are not expected to be the normal case.
    
    2.  Downgrading Considerations for mailto URLs -- UTF-8 addresses in
    mailto links in List-* headers will be easier to downgrade if they
    contain an alt-address.
    
    
7.  IANA Considerations
    
    None.
    
    
8.  Security Considerations
    
    Security considerations are discussed in the Framework document
    [EAI-Framework].  No further security considerations are raised by
    this document.
