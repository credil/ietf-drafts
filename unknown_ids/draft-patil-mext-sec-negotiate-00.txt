       Negotiation of security protocol for Mobile IPv6 operation
                   draft-patil-mext-sec-negotiate-00

Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKE/v2 for securing the signaling
   and user traffic.  A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does
   not adequately address various deployment scenarios.  The one-size-
   fits-all security approach is ill suited for Mobile IPv6.  Multiple
   alternatives to securing signaling and user traffic have been
   proposed and are being considered for standardization.  When multiple
   security protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6
   nodes, there is a need to negotiate the choice of protocol between a
   mobile node and home agent apriori.  This document proposes a method
   for negotiation the security protocol to be used betewen mobile IPv6
   nodes.

Internet-Draft        Security protocol negotiation           March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKE/v2 for securing the signaling
   and user traffic.  A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does
   not adequately address various deployment scenarios.  The one-size-
   fits-all security approach is ill suited for Mobile IPv6.  Multiple
   alternatives to securing signaling and user traffic have been
   proposed and are being considered for standardization.  When multiple
   security protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6
   nodes, there is a need to negotiate the choice of protocol between a
   mobile node and home agent apriori.  This document proposes a method
   for negotiation the security protocol to be used betewen mobile IPv6
   nodes.

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] security using IPsec and IKE is specified in
   [RFC3776] and [RFC4877].  A number of alternate security protocols
   for use by mobile IPv6 nodes have been proposed.  Authentication
   protocol for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4285] is an example of one such.  The
   use of such a mechanism is however restricted to networks with
   certain characterstics that are documented in the RFC.

   More recently other security mechanisms for use in Mobile IPv6
   deployments have been proposed.  Transport Layer Security-based
   Mobile IPv6 Security Framework for Mobile Node to Home Agent
   Communication [I-D.korhonen-mext-mip6-altsec] proposes a security
   solution that uses TLS between the mobile node (MN) and a home agent
   controller (HAC) to bootstrap the security protocol between the MN
   and home agent (HA).  Authorizing Mobile IPv6 Binding Update with
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses [I-D.laganier-mext-cga]
   proposes the use of CGA for securing the signaling between an MN and
   HA.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this I-D is based on the Mobile IPv6
   terminology defined in [RFC3775].

   Home Agent Controller (HAC)

      The home agent controller is a node responsible for bootstrapping
      Mobile IPv6 security associations between a mobile node and one or
      more home agents.  The home agent controller also provides key
      distribution to both mobile nodes and home agents.  Optionally,
      Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping can be done in addition to the security
      association bootstrapping between the mobile node and home agent
      controller.


3.  Problem Statement

   Security for Mobile IPv6 signaling and user traffic can be achieved
   via the use of different mechanisms.  At the present time the use of
   IPsec and IKEv2 is mandated and choice of any other security protocol
   does not exist.  However the use of IPsec and IKE for providing
   security does not fit all deployments.  Alternate security solutions
   have been proposed and could be used.  The use of a security protocol
   by mobile IPv6 nodes should be driven by the needs and requirements
   of a specific deployment.  An enterprise deployment of Mobile IPv6
   will have a different set of security requirements as compared to a
   cellular operator offering mobile IPv6 service.

   When multiple security protocols may be used for signaling and user
   traffic security, there is a need to negotiate the use of a specific
   protocol between a mobile node and home agent prior to operation.
   This problem is dealt with in the scope of this draft and solutions
   proposed.


4.  Using the Home agent controller

   The home agent controller (HAC) is an entity that is defined in
   [I-D.korhonen-mext-mip6-altsec].  The HAC enables bootstrapping of
   mobile IPv6.  It assigns the mobile node the home agent to use in
   addition to security parameters.  The home agent controller plays the
   role of negotiating the security protocol to be used between a mobile
   node and the home agent.  The HAC is aware of the capabilities and
   security protocols of various home agents that it is associated with.
   An MN MUST contact the HAC to obtain the home agent and home address
   to use.  The MN can also inform the HAC about the security protocols
   that it supports and can use for securing signaling and user traffic.
   The HAC will then assign the MN a valid home agent in addition to
   informing it of the security protocol to be used.  Optionally the HAC
   may provide the MN and assigned HA the relevant security paremeters
   such as keys, SPI, etc. for securing the signaling and traffic.

5.  Negotiation of security protocol

   The mobile node establishes a TLS connection to the home agent
   controller (HAC) and exchanges a set of messages via this secure TLS
   tunnel to bootstrap mobile IPv6 as well as negotiate the choice of
   security protocol.  The signaling flow diagram below illustrates this
   negotiation mechanism:

7.  Security Considerations

   The signaling between the mobile node and home agent controller is
   secured by TLS.  All the messages between the MN and HAC are
   tunnelled within the TLS connection and hence secured.  The MN and
   Home agent (HA) are either colocated or have a secure messaging
   interface between them.  There exists the potential to downgrade the
   choice of the security protocol between an MN and HA.  However the
   HAC chooses the security protocol to be used based on the
   capabilities of the MN as well as policy information from an entity
   such as AAA.  In case the MN is incapable of more robust secure

   mechanisms, the HAC may assign such a home agent with limited
   capabilities and connectivity.


8.  Summary and Conclusion

   The choice of security protocols to be used in mobile IPv6
   deployments increases the flexibility of the protocol and makes it
   viable for use in different deployment scenarios.  This however does
   result in the need for negotiation of a security protocol to be used
   between the MN and HA.  The capabilities of the MN and home agents
   available for use to an MN determine the security protocol that can
   be used.  Use of a home agent controller provides Mobile IPv6 with a
   robust mechanism for bootstrapping as well negotiation the security
   protocol.
