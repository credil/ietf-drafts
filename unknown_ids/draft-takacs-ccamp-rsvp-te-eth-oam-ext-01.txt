Abstract

   The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work is
   extending GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet
   LSPs.  Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies an
   adjunct OAM flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.  CFM can
   be also used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggering
   recovery mechanisms.  This memo specifies extensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE
   to support the setup of the associated CFM OAM entities for point-to-
   point Ethernet LSPs.

1.  Background

   Provider Backbone Bridging - Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE)
   [IEEE-PBBTE] decouples the Ethernet data and control planes by
   explicitly supporting external control/management mechanisms to
   configure static filtering entries in bridges and create explicitly
   routed Ethernet connections.  In addition PBB-TE defines mechanisms
   for 1:1 protection switching of bidirectional Ethernet connections.

   Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) defines an adjunct
   connectivity monitoring OAM flow to check the liveliness of Ethernet
   networks [IEEE-CFM].  With PBB-TE Ethernet networks will support
   explicitly-routed Ethernet connections.  CFM can be used to track the
   liveliness of PBB-TE connections and detect data plane failures.

   In IETF the GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS)
   [GELS-Framework] work is extending the GMPLS control plane to support
   the establishment of point-to-point PBB-TE data plane connections.
   We refer to GMPLS established PBB-TE connections as Ethernet LSPs.
   GELS enables the application of MPLS-TE and GMPLS provisioning and
   recovery features in Ethernet networks.

   MPLS OAM requirements are described in [RFC4377].  It provides
   requirements to create consistent OAM functionality for MPLS
   networks.  The GMPLS OAM requirements are described in [GMPLS-OAM].
   The GMPLS OAM requirements are based on the MPLS OAM requirements
   [RFC4377], in addition it also considers the existing OAM techniques
   in non-packet networks.  This memo discusses the basic aspects of
   Ethernet OAM and specifies RSVP-TE extensions addressing OAM
   requirements for Ethernet networks.

2.  Motivations and asumptions

   The following list is an excerpt of MPLS OAM requirements documented
   in [RFC4377].  Only a few requirements are discussed that bear a
   direct relevance to the discussion set forth in this memo and which
   also motivated the extensions specified in this document.

   o  It is desired to support the automation of LSP defect detection.
      It is especially important in cases where large numbers of LSPs
      might be tested.

   o  In particular some LSPs may require automated ingress-LSR to
      egress-LSR testing functionality, while others may not.

   o  Mechanisms are required to coordinate network responses to
      defects.  Such mechanisms may include alarm suppression,
      translating defect signals at technology boundaries, and
      synchronising defect detection times by setting appropriately
      bounded detection timeframes.

   Generally, the frequency of OAM execution must be set properly, to
   achieve the OAM requirements.  When periodic messages are used for
   liveliness check of LSPs the frequency of messages must be set
   properly fulfilling the requirements of the service and/or meeting
   the detection time boundaries posed by possible congruent
   connectivity check operations of higher layer applications.
   Furthermore, for consistent measurement of Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs) it may be required that measurement points agree on a common
   probing rate to avoid measurement problems.

   In order for Ethernet LSPs to provide reliable service delivery, data
   plane fault detection mechanisms are needed to trigger recovery
   actions.  Note that if lower layer fault detection (or protection)
   mechanisms (such as those supported by SONET/SDH) are available, we
   may rely on them and alleviate the need for frequent OAM message
   exchanges for liveliness checks of Ethernet LSPs.  However, when -
   for example - Ethernet is deployed over a WDM optical layer that does
   not provide the SONET/SDH protection characteristics, failure
   detection and recovery must be solved in the Ethernet layer.

   We assume that in networks where PBB-TE and GELS will be deployed the
   default LSP path fault detection mechanism will be based on CFM
   Connectivity Check Message (CCM) flows.

   Fast fault detection and recovery are key to reliable service
   delivery.  However, there is a trade-off between fast fault detection
   and signalling and processing overhead of connectivity monitoring
   flows.  Today, networks are providing transport of multiple service

   types each with special requirements on quality of service including
   the requirements on recovery.  To balance the tradeoff between fast
   detection and overhead it is essential that fault detection and
   recovery are matching the requirements of the supported service, as
   highlighted in [RFC3469].  For example, while business services may
   require sub-second protection switching best effort Internet traffic
   may rely on slower (in the order of seconds) restoration mechanisms.
   These different requirements are reflected in the frequency of
   connectivity monitoring packets that are needed to be exchanged over
   the Ethernet LSP supporting a particular service type.

   We assume that - for a network operator to be able to balance the
   trade-off in fast failure detection and overhead - it will be
   beneficial to configure the frequency of CCM messages on a per
   Ethernet-LSP basis.  Additionally, to simplify network management and
   reduce the risk (and impact) of misconfiguration, it is desirable to
   use Ethernet LSP signaling to configure CFM at both ends of the LSP
   automatically.

3.  Overview of Ethernet OAM operation in PBB-TE networks

   For the purposes of this document, we only discuss Ethernet OAM
   [IEEE-CFM] aspects that are relevant for the connectivity monitoring
   point-to-point PBB-TE connections.

   PBB-TE [IEEE-PBBTE] defines point-to-point Ethernet Switched Paths
   (ESPs) as a provisioned traffic engineered unidirectional
   connectivity, identified by the 3-tuple [ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-
   VID] where the ESP-MAC DA is the destination address of the ESP, the
   ESP-MAC SA is the source address of the ESP, and the ESP-VID is a
   VLAN identifier allocated for explicitly routed connections.  To form
   a bidirectional PBB-TE connection two co-routed point-to-point ESPs
   are combined.  The combined ESPs must have the same ESP-MAC addresses
   but may have different ESP-VIDs.

   Note that although it would be possible to use GMPLS to setup a
   single unidirectional ESP, the Ethernet OAM mechanisms are only full
   functional when bidirectional connections are established with co-
   routed ESPs.  Hence, we focus on bidirectional point-to-point PBB-TE
   connections.

   At both ends of the bidiretional point-to-point PBB-TE connection one
   Maintenance Endpoint (MEP) is configured.  The MEPs monitoring a
   PBB-TE connection must be configured with the same Maintenance Domain
   Level (MD Level) and Maintenance Association Identifier (MAID).  Each
   MEP has a unique identifier, the MEP ID.  Besides these identifiers a
   MEP monitoring a PBB-TE connection must be provisioned with the
   3-tuples [ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-VID] of the two ESPs.

   MEPs exchange Connectivity Check Messages (CCMs) periodically with
   fixed intervals.  Eight distinct intervals are defined in [IEEE-CFM]:

   If 3 consecutive CCM messages are not received by one of the MEPs it
   declares a connectivity failure and signals the failure in subsequent
   CCM messages, by setting the Remote Defect Indicator (RDI) bit, to
   the remote MEP.  If a MEP receives a CCM message with RDI set it
   immediately declares failure.  The detection of a failure may trigger
   protection switching mechanisms or my be signalled to a management
   system.  However, what happens once a failure is detected is out of
   the scope of this document.

4.  Scope of the RSVP-TE extensions

   Although the setup of both unidirectional and bidirectional Ethernet
   LSPs is feasible, due to the symmetric bidirectional connectivity
   requirement of CFM, we only consider bidirectional point-to-point
   Ethernet LSPs.  The applicability for multipoint Ethernet LSPs is for
   further study.

   Note that in addition to Connectivity Check, which is the focus of
   this memo, CFM defines Link Trace and Loopback mechanisms as well.
   The proposed extension automatically creates the MEPs and associates
   them to the LSP.  Once the MEPs are created the Link Trace and
   Loopback functionality is available for on demand OAM actions.
   Whether additional parameters besides those specified in the next
   sections are required (or are beneficial) to support Link Trace
   and/or Loopback is for further study.  In addition parameters needed
   to support measurement of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is also
   left for further study.  Hence additional parameters may be defined
   in subsequent versions of this document.

   Note also, that it has been discussed that the extensions defined may
   be applicable to other fault detection mechanisms that use periodic
   Hello messages, e.g., BFD, as well.  However, it is not clear whether
   there is a need to bootstrap BFD sessions using RSVP-TE.  As such BFD
   related discussions and extensions are left for further study.

5.  GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions

5.1.  Operation overview

   To simplify the configuration of connectivity monitoring, when an
   Ethernet LSP is signalled the associated MEPs should be automatically
   established.  Further more, GMPLS signalling should be able to
   enable/disable connectivity monitoring of a particular Ethernet LSP.

   To monitor an Ethernet LSP a set of parameters must be provided to
   setup a Maintenance Association and related MEPs.

   o  A unique MAID must be allocated for the PBB-TE connection and both
      MEPs must be configured with the same information.  The MAID
      consists of a Maintenance Domain Name (MD Name) and a Short
      Maintenance Association Name (Short MA Name).  Various formating
      rules for these names have been defined by [IEEE-CFM].  Since
      these information is also carried in all CC messages, the combined
      length of the Names is limited to 44 bytes.  How these parameters
      are determined is out of scope of this document.

   o  Each MEP must be provisioned with a MEP ID.  The MEP ID uniquely
      identifies a given MEP within a Maintenance Association.  That is,
      the combination of MAID and MEP ID must uniquely identify a MEP.
      How the value of the MEP ID is determined is out of scope of this
      document.

   o  The Maintenance Domain Level (MD Level) allows hierarchical
      separation of monitoring entities.  [IEEE-CFM] allows
      differentiation of 8 levels.  How the value of the MD Level is
      determined is out of scope of this document.  Note that most
      probably for all Ethernet LSPs a single (default) MD Level should
      be used.

   o  The desired CCM Interval must be specified by the management
      system based on service requirements or operator policy.  The same
      CCM Interval must be set in each of the MEPs monitoring a given
      Ethernet LSP.  How the value of the CCM Interval is determined is
      out of scope of this document.

   o  The desired CCM priority to be set by MEPs for the CCM frames can
      be specified.  How CCM priority is determined is out of scope of
      this document.

   o  MEPs must be aware of their own and the reachability parameters of
      the remote MEP.  In the case of bidirectional point-to-point
      PBB-TE connections this requires that the 3-tuples [ESP-MAC A,
      ESP-MAC B, ESP-VID1] and [ESP-MAC B, ESP-MAC A, ESP-VID2] are

      configured in each MEP.  The GMPLS Ethernet Label as defined in
      [Fedyk-GELS-PBBTE] consists of the ESP-MAC DA and ESP-VID.  Hence
      the necessary reachability parameters for the MEPs can be obtained
      form Ethernet Labels (i.e., carried in the "downstream" and
      upstream labels).

   Assuming the procedures described in [Fedyk-GELS-PBBTE] for
   bidirectional Ethernet LSP establishment the MEP configuration should
   be as follows.  When the RSVP-TE signalling is initiated for the
   bidirectional Ethernet LSP the local node generates a Path message
   and:

   o  Allocates an Upstream Label from its MAC address (ESP-MAC A) and
      locally selected VID (ESP-VID1);

   o  Inserts an Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
      object, specifying the CCM Interval and MD Level;

   o  Adds an MD Name Sub-TLV and a Short MA Name Sub-TLV to the
      Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV, that will unambiguously identify a
      Maintenance Association for this specific PBB-TE connection.  Note
      that values for these parameters may be derived from the GMPLS LSP
      identification parameters;

   o  Adds a MEP ID Sub-TLV to the Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV.  It
      selects two distinct integer values to identify the local and
      remote MEPs within the Maintenance Association created for
      monitoring of the point-to-point PBB-TE connection.

   Once the remote node receives the Path message it can use the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL to extract the reachability information of the
   initiator.  Then it allocates a LABEL by selecting the MAC address
   (ESP-MAC B) and VID (ESP-VID2) it would like to use to receive
   traffic.  These parameters determine the reachability information of
   the local MEP.  That is, the 3-tuples [ESP-MAC A, ESP-MAC B, ESP-
   VID1] and [ESP-MAC B, ESP-MAC A, ESP-VID2] are derived from the
   Ethernet Labels.  In addition the information received in the
   Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV is used to configure the local MEP.

   Once the Resv message successfully arrives to the initiator it can
   extract the remote side's reachability information from the LABEL
   object whereby this node has also obtained all the information needed
   to establish its local MEP.

   Once the MEPs are established the monitoring of the LSP is
   operational.  In certain situations, e.g., maintenance, re-
   optimisation of LSPs, it is desirable to explicitly enable or disable
   the monitoring of LSPs (i.e., start/stop exchanging CC messages).  To

   allow administrative control of LSP monitoring one bit in the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object is used.  The "Monitoring Disabled" (M) bit is
   allocated for this purpose.

   Note that since the reachability information could be extracted form
   the Ethernet Labels it is an option not to use any extension to
   support MEP configuration of Ethernet LSPs.  That is, an
   implementation could use default parameters for CCM intervals and
   determine Maintenance Association and MEP identification parameters
   automatically from LSP identification information.  However, we
   rejected this approach, as it does not provide means to set the CCM
   interval on a per LSP bases, leaving limited possibilities to
   configure CFM in a way that matches the supported services'
   requirements.  Moreover, there is no way for providing additional
   parameters to configure other aspects of Ethernet OAM, e.g.,
   Performance Monitoring.

5.2.  Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV

   In RSVP-TE the Flags field of the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object is used to
   indicate options and attributes of the LSP.  The Flags field has 8
   bits and hence is limited to differentiate only 8 options.  [RFC4420]
   defines a new object for RSVP-TE messages to allow the signalling of
   arbitrary attribute parameters making RSVP-TE easily extensible to
   support new applications.  Furthermore, [RFC4420] allows options and
   attributes that do not need to be acted on by all Label Switched
   Routers (LSRs) along the path of the LSP.  In particular, these
   options and attributes may apply only to key LSRs on the path such as
   the ingress LSR and egress LSR.  Options and attributes can be
   signalled transparently, and only examined at those points that need
   to act on them.  The LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and the
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects are defined in [RFC4420] to provide
   means to signal LSP attributes and options in the form of TLVs.
   Options and attributes signalled in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object can be
   passed transparently through LSRs not supporting a particular option
   or attribute, while the contents of the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
   object must be examined and processed by each LSR.  One TLV is
   defined in [RFC4420]: the Attributes Flags TLV.

   Since the extensions defined for CFM Continuity Check are required to
   be processed only by the edge nodes while internal nodes need to pass
   on the information transparently, the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object should be
   used to carry the new TLV for Ethernet OAM configuration information
   signalling.

   A new TLV, the Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV (depicted below) is
   defined to be used to setup CFM entities of Ethernet LSPs.  The
   Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES

   object in Path messages.  This new TLV accommodates information on
   CCM interval and carries sub-TLVs.  If the Ethernet OAM Configuration
   TLV is included in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object this signals the request
   that MEPs should be established for the LSP.  If MEPs cannot be
   established, due to any reason, an error must be generated.

   Local MEP ID: a 16 bit integer value in the range 1-8191 of the MEP
   ID on the initiator side.

   Remote MEP ID: a 16 bit integer value in the range 1-8191 of the MEP
   ID to be set for the MEP established at the receiving side.  This
   value is determined by the initiator node.  This is possible, since a
   new MAID is assigned to each PBB-TE connection, and MEP IDs must be
   only unique within the scope of the MAID.

5.3.  Monitoring Disabled - Admin_Status bit

   Administrative Status Information is carried in the ADMIN_STATUS
   Object.  The Administrative Status Information is described in
   [RFC3471], the ADMIN_STATUS Object is specified for RSVP-TE in
   [RFC3473].

   One bit is allocated for the administrative control of OAM
   monitoring.  In addition to the Reflect (R) bit, 7 bits are currently
   occupied (assigned by IANA or temporarily blocked by work in progress
   Internet drafts).  As the 24th bit (IANA to assign) this draft
   introduces the Monitoring Disabled (M) bit.  When this bit is set the
   connectivity monitoring of the LSP is disabled.

   Note that the Monitoring Disabled (M) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object
   should be technology agnostic and its use is not limited to the
   Ethernet related extensions defined in this memo.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies a new Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV to be
   carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES objects in Path messages.  In addition,
   it specifies sub-TLVs within the new TLV.

   One bit (Monitoring Disabled (M)) needs to be allocated in the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object.

7.  Security Considerations

   The signalling of OAM related parameters and the automatic
   establishment of OAM entities introduces additional security
   considerations to those discussed in [RFC3473].  In particular, a
   network element could be overloaded, if an attacker would request
   liveliness monitoring, with frequent periodic messages, for a high
   number of LSPs, targeting a single network element.

   Security aspects will be covered in more detailed in subsequent
   versions of this document.
