  A Packet Loss and Delay Measurement Profile for MPLS-based Transport

Abstract

   Procedures and protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and
   accurate measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS
   networks are defined in RFC XXXX.

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the set of MPLS protocol
   functions applicable to the construction and operation of packet-
   switched transport networks.

   This document describes a profile of the general MPLS loss, delay,
   and throughput measurement techniques that suffices to meet the
   specific requirements of MPLS-TP.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF
   Last Call.

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published
   RFC has IETF consensus.]

   [RFC Editor, please replace XXXX with the RFC number assigned to
   draft-ietf-mpls-loss-delay.]

Status of this Memo

1.  Introduction

   Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput
   in MPLS networks are defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-loss-delay].  This
   document describes a profile, i.e. a simplified subset, of these
   procedures that suffices to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-
   based transport networks [RFC5921] as defined in [RFC5860].  This
   profile is presented for the convenience of implementors who are
   concerned exclusively with the transport network context.

   The use of the profile specified in this document is purely optional.
   Implementors wishing to provide enhanced functionality that is within
   the scope of [I-D.ietf-mpls-loss-delay] but outside the scope of this
   profile may do so, whether or not the implementation is restricted to
   the transport network context.

   The assumption of this profile is that the devices involved in a
   measurement operation are configured for measurement by a means
   external to the measurement protocols themselves, for example via a
   Network Management System (NMS) or separate configuration protocol.

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement      February 2011


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.


2.  Packet Loss Measurement (LM) Profile

   When an LM session is externally configured, the values of several
   protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved
   in the session, so that inspection or negotiation of these parameters
   is not required.  These parameters, and their default values as
   specified by this profile, are as follows:

   Parameter                                 Default Value
   ----------------------------------------- --------------------------
   Query control code                        In-band response requested
   Byte/packet Count (B) Flag                Packet count
   Traffic-Class-specific (T) Flag           Traffic-class-scoped
   Origin Timestamp Format (OTF)             IEEE 1588 version 1

   This profile is restricted to direct-mode LM and therefore uses the
   MPLS Direct Packet Loss Measurement (DLM) Channel Type in the
   Associated Channel Header (ACH).

   A simple implementation may assume that external configuration will
   ensure that both ends of the communication are using the default
   values for these parameters.


3.  Packet Delay Measurement (DM) Profile

   When a DM session is externally configured, the values of several
   protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved
   in the session, so that inspection or negotiation of these parameters
   is not required.  These parameters, and their default values as
   specified by this profile, are as follows:

   Parameter                                  Default Value
   ------------------------------------------ --------------------------
   Query control code                         In-band response requested
   Querier Timestamp Format (QTF)             IEEE 1588 version 1
   Responder Timestamp Format (RTF)           IEEE 1588 version 1
   Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format     IEEE 1588 version 1
   (RPTF)

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement      February 2011


   This profile uses the MPLS Delay Measurement (DM) Channel Type in the
   Associated Channel Header (ACH).

   A simple implementation may assume that external configuration will
   ensure that both ends of the communication are using the default
   values for these parameters.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document delineates a subset of the procedures specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-loss-delay], and as such introduces no new security
   considerations in itself.  The security considerations discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-loss-delay] apply also to the profile presented in
   this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no new IANA considerations.
