Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States         December 2009


   Abstract

   This document contains definitions for all of the different states
   that documents (viz. Internet-Drafts) may experience with an IETF
   working group.  The first state occurs when an I-D is submitted for
   consideration as a working group item, and the last state is either
   when the I-D is sent to the IESG for publication, or declared as
   "dead".  The intended purpose of this Internet-Draft is to serve as
   a basis for defining requirements to update the I-D tracker tool, to
   permit WG Chairs and other persons to view the progression of all
   documents through working groups.

1. Introduction

   A deficiency of the current IETF I-D Tracker is that it has no
   information about the status of I-Ds, other than "I-D Exists" prior
   to the time when WGs send documents to the IESG along for
   publication.

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States         December 2009


   This document contains definitions for all of the different states
   that documents may experience after being accepting by an IETF
   working group.  The purpose of articulating these definitions is to
   enable community discussion on them, and on a state diagram for the
   'preferred' path that most WGs use to progress I-Ds.

   A desired outcome of this initiative is to facilitate the coding of
   front-end extensions to the I-D Tracker tool, to allow WG Chairs and
   other members of the community to monitor the status of I-Ds as they
   progress through IETF working groups.  In order for the I-D Tracker
   to reflect WG document status information, new WG document states
   and sub-state "annotation tags" need to be defined, agreed, and then
   coded into the front-end of the tool.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 Error!
   Reference source not found..

3. Definitions of Possible WG Document States

   Section 3.1 defines the possible states that could apply to an I-D
   that has been submitted to an IETF working group.  Section 3.2 maps
   those states into a first draft state diagram.  Section 3.3 defines
   additional terms to describe various WG Document sub-states

3.1. WG Document States

  3.1.1. Candidate WG Document

   This document is under consideration for becoming a working group
   document.  A document being in this state does not imply any
   consensus, and does not imply any precedence or selection.  The
   purpose of this state is simply to indicate that someone has asked
   for an existing I-D to be considered for acceptance as a working
   group document.

  3.1.2. Active WG Document

   This document has been adopted by a working group, and is being
   actively developed.

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States         December 2009


  3.1.3. Not a WG Document

   This document is not a WG Document.  An I-D may be in this state for
   a variety of reasons.  Three examples are:

   *  the I-D was a "Candidate WG Document" but was rejected by the WG;
   *  the I-D is an IAB or IRTF document, or an independent submission
      not intended to become a WG document

  3.1.4. Parked WG Document

   This document has lost its author or editor, is waiting for another
   document to be written, or cannot currently be progressed by the
   working group for some other reason.

  3.1.5. In WG Last Call

   A working group last call has been issued for this document, and is
   in progress.  After the last call is completed, the document may
   return to being an "Active WG Document" again, or be "Parked" for a
   variety of reasons, or enter the "Waiting for Document Shepherd
   Write-Up" state.

   Many members of the community ask for additional information to be
   forthcoming when the result of a WG Last Call is "Revised ID
   Needed".  See section 3.2.1 for a sub-state "annotation tag"
   intended to provide such additional information.

  3.1.6. Waiting for WG Document Shepherd Write-Up

   The working group last call has been completed and the document is
   waiting for the Document Shepherd to submit his/her write-up.

  3.1.7. Submitted to IESG for Publication

   The document has been submitted to the IESG for publication (and has
   not returned to the WG for further action).  The document may be
   under consideration by the IESG, it may have been approved and be in
   the RFC Editor's queue, or it may have been published as an RFC;
   this state does not distinguish between different states that may
   occur after the document has left the working group.

  3.1.8. Dead WG Document

   This document was a WG document, but has been abandoned.  Note that
   this does not have to be a final state.  If consensus is

   subsequently achieved in the working group, a Dead WG Document can
   be resurrected.

3.2. Straw Man State Diagram

   Figure 1 illustrates the different states defined in section 3.1,
   and some of the state transitions that an I-D may experience.

3.3. WG Document Sub-states

   In addition to identifying the state that each WG Document is in, it
   would be informative to indicate associated sub-states or conditions
   which may affect each WG Document.  These conditions do not change
   the state of WG documents, but they can be used, for example, to
   help the community to understand why a document is in the state it
   is in, and/or to indicate the next action needed for the document.

  3.3.1. Sub-state Annotations

   Each of the sub-state annotations defined here may be appropriate to
   indicate the sub-state of WG Documents at different times.  They
   are:

     *  "Awaiting Cross-Area Review"
     *  "Awaiting MIB Doctor Review"
     *  "Awaiting Security Review"
     *  "Awaiting Other Reviews"
     *  "Awaiting Merge with other Document"
     *  "Doc Shepherd Follow-up"
     *  "Editor Needed"
     *  "Held due to Dependency on other Document"
     *  "Held due to IESG concerns on this Document"
     *  "Revised ID Needed - based on WG consensus"
     *  "Revised ID Needed - after on WG last call"
     *  "Other - see Comment Log"

  3.3.2. Intended WG Document Status

   In addition to the sub-state annotation tags defined in section
   3.3.1, the intended maturity level of every WG Document should also
   be tracked.  The definition of the maturity levels are as in
   sections 4 and 5 of RFC 2026 [2].  They are:

     *  "Experimental"
     *  "Informational"
     *  "Best Current Practice"
     *  "Proposed Standard"
     *  "Draft Standard"
     *  "Full Standard"
     *  "Historic"

4. Security Considerations

   This document does not propose any new internet mechanisms, and has
   no security implications for the internet.



5. IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any new number assignments from IANA,
   and does not define any new numbering spaces to be administered by
   IANA.
