     Lab Test Results for Advancing Metrics on the Standards Track
                  draft-morton-ippm-advance-metrics-01

Abstract

   This memo supports the process of progressing performance metric RFCs
   along the standards track.  Observing that the metric definitions
   themselves should be the primary focus rather than the
   implementations of metrics, this memo describes results of example
   lab test procedures to evaluate specific metric RFC requirement
   clauses to determine if the requirement has been implemented as
   intended.  A single implementation has been tested against the key
   specifications of RFC 2679 on One-way Delay.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft             Std Track Lab Tests                 June 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IETF (IP Performance Metrics working group) has been considering
   how to advance their metrics along the standards track since 2001,
   with the initial publication of Bradner/Paxson/Mankin's memo [ref to
   work in progress, draft-bradner-metricstest-].  The original proposal
   was to compare the results of implementations of the metrics, because
   the usual procedures for advancing protocols did not appear to apply.
   It was found to be difficult to achieve consensus on exactly how to
   compare implementations, since there were many legitimate sources of
   variation that would emerge in the results despite the best attempts
   to keep the network path equal for both, and because considerable
   variation was allowed in the parameters of each metric.

   A renewed work effort sought to investigate ways in which the
   measurement variability could be reduced and thereby simplify the
   problem of comparison for equivalence.  An earlier version of this
   draft, titled "Problems and Possible Solutions for Advancing Metrics
   on the Standards Track", brought many issues to light and offered
   some solutions.  Sections from the earlier draft has now been
   combined with [draft-geib-ippm-metrictest] resulted in an IPPM
   working group draft, [draft-ippm-metrictest-00.txt].  The plan now
   emphasizes evaluating the metric specifications themselves, as a
   result of this interaction.

   There is now consensus that the metric definitions should be the
   primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, and
   equivalent results are deemed to be evidence that the metric
   specifications are clear and unambiguous.  This is the metric
   specification equivalent of protocol interoperability.  The
   advancement process either produces confidence that the metric
   definitions and supporting material are clearly worded and
   unambiguous, OR, identifies ways in which the metric definitions
   should be revised to achieve clarity.

   The process should also permit identification of options that were
   not implemented, so that they can be removed from the advancing
   specification (this is an aspect more typical of protocol advancement
   along the standards track).

   This memo's purpose is to add more support for the current approach
   as the author perceives it to be.  It was prepared to help progress
   discussions on the topic of metric advancement, both through e-mail
   and at the upcoming IPPM meeting at IETF-78 in Maastricht.

   Another aspect of the metric RFC advancement process which has
   received limited attention is the requirement to document the work
   and results.  The procedures of [RFC2026] are expanded in[RFC5657],

   including sample implementation and interoperability reports.
   Section 3 of this memo can serve as a template for the report that
   accompanies the protocol action request submitted to the Area
   Director, including description of the test set-up, procedures,
   results for each implementation and conclusions.

   Finally, this memo is also an open invitation to developers or
   testers who would be willing to use their equipment to help advance
   the IPPM metrics through lab tests, like the tests described below.


2.  A Definition-centric metric advancement process

   The process described in Section 3.5 of
   [draft-ippm-metrictest-00.txt] takes as a first principle that the
   metric definitions, embodied in the text of the RFCs, are the objects
   that require evaluation and possible revision in order to advance to
   the next step on the standards track.

   IF two implementations do not measure an equivalent singleton, or
   sample, or produce the an equivalent statistic,

   AND sources of measurement error do not adequately explain the lack
   of agreement,

   THEN the details of each implementation should be audited along with
   the exact definition text, to determine if there is a lack of clarity
   that has caused the implementations to vary in a way that affects the
   correspondence of the results.

   IF there was a lack of clarity or multiple legitimate interpretations
   of the definition text,

   THEN the text should be modified and the resulting memo proposed for
   consensus and advancement along the standards track.

   Finally, all the findings MUST be documented in a report that can
   support advancement on the standards track, similar to those
   described in [RFC5657].  The list of measurement devices used in
   testing satisfies the implementation requirement, while the test
   results provide information on the quality of each specification in
   the metric RFC (the surrogate for feature interoperability).

   The figure below illustrates this process:

3.  Lab test results to check metric definitions

   This section describes some results from lab tests with test devices
   and a network emulator to create relevant conditions and determine
   whether the metric definitions were interpreted consistently by
   implementors.  The procedures are slightly modified from the original
   procedures contained in Appendix A.1 of
   [draft-ippm-metrictest-00.txt].  The principle modification the use
   of the mean statistic for comparisons.

   The metric implementation used was NetProbe version 5.8.5, (an
   earlier version is used in the WIPM system and deployed world-wide).
   Accuracy of NetProbe measurements is usually limited by NTP
   synchronization performance (~1ms error or greater), although this
   lab environment often exhibits errors much less than typical for NTP.

   The network emulator is a host running Fedora Core Linux
   [http://fedoraproject.org/] with IP forwarding enabled and the NIST
   Net emulator 2.0.12b [http://snad.ncsl.nist.gov/nistnet/] loaded and
   operating.

   The links between NetProbe hosts and the NIST Net emulator host were
   100baseTx-FD (100Mbps full duplex) as reported by "mii-tool", except
   as noted below.

   For these tests, a stream of at least 30 packets were sent from
   Source to Destination in each implementation.  Periodic streams (as
   per [RFC3432]) with 1 second spacing were used, except as noted.

   These examples do not entirely avoid the problem of declaring
   equivalence with a statistical test, but the lab conditions should
   simplify the problem by removing as much variability as possible.

   Note that there are only five instances of the requirement term
   "MUST" in [RFC2679] outside of the boilerplate and [RFC2119]
   reference.

3.1.  One-way Delay, Loss threshold, RFC 2679

   This test determines if implementations use the same configured
   maximum waiting time delay from one measurement to another under
   different delay conditions, and correctly declare packets arriving in
   excess of the waiting time threshold as lost.

   See Section 3.5 of [RFC2679], 3rd bullet point and also Section 3.8.2
   of [RFC2679].

   1.  configure a path with 1 sec one-way constant delay

   2.  measure (average) one-way delay with 2 or more implementations,
       using identical waiting time thresholds for loss set at 2 seconds

   3.  configure the path with 3 sec one-way delay (or change the path
       delay while test is in progress, when there are sufficient
       packets at the first delay setting)

   4.  repeat/continue measurements

   5.  observe that the increase measured in step 4 caused all packets
       with 3 sec delay to be declared lost, and that all packets that
       arrive successfully in step 2 are assigned a valid one-way delay.

3.1.1.  NetProbe Lab results for Loss Threshold

   In NetProbe, the Loss Threshold is implemented uniformly over all
   packets as a post-processing routine.  With the Loss Threshold set at
   2 seconds, all packets with one-way delay >2 seconds are marked
   "Lost" and included in the Lost Packet list with their transmission
   time (as required in Section 3.3 of [RFC2680]). 22 of 38 packets were
   declared lost.

3.1.3.  Conclusions on Lab Results for Loss Threshold

   >>> Comment: this section is a placeholder

3.2.  One-way Delay, First-bit to Last bit, RFC 2679

   This test determines if implementations register the same relative
   increase in delay from one measurement to another under different
   delay conditions.  This test tends to cancel the sources of error
   which may be present in an implementation.

   See Section 3.7.2 of [RFC2679], and Section 10.2 of [RFC2330].

   1.  configure a path with X ms one-way constant delay, and ideally
       including a low-speed link

   2.  measure (average) one-way delay with 2 or more implementations,
       using identical options and equal size small packets (e.g., 100
       octet IP payload)

   3.  maintain the same path with X ms one-way delay

   4.  measure (average) one-way delay with 2 or more implementations,
       using identical options and equal size large packets (e.g., 1500
       octet IP payload)

   5.  observe that the increase measured in steps 2 and 4 is equivalent
       to the increase in ms expected due to the larger serialization
       time for each implementation.  Most of the measurement errors in
       each system should cancel, if they are stationary.

3.2.1.  NetProbe Lab results for Serialization

   For this test only, the link between the NetProbe Source host and the
   NIST Net emulator host was changed to 10baseT-FD (10Mbps full duplex)
   as configured by "mii-tool".

   The value of X = 1000 ms was used in the NIST Net emulator.

   When the UDP payload size was increased from 32 octets to 1400
   octets, the NIST Net emulator exhibited a bi-modal delay
   distribution.  Investigation confirmed that the NetProbe
   implementations tested did not exhibit bi-modal delay on an alternate
   (network management) path.

   Average Delay over 60 packets for different payload sizes with Delay
      computations and comparison with expected delay difference for
                              serialization.

   For the lower-delay mode, the Delay Difference between payload sizes
   is about 170 microseconds higher than expected.  However, it is clear
   that delay increased with a larger payload as expected when the
   measurement is conducted First-bit to Last-bit and includes
   serialization time.

   The higher mode appears on almost every other packet in the stream,
   and comments are sought on possible configuration changes that would
   remove this bi-modal behavior without significant sacrifices in other
   dimensions of performance.

3.3.  One-way Delay, Sample Metric

   This test determines if implementations register the same relative
   increase in delay from one measurement to another under different
   delay conditions.  This test tends to cancel the sources of error
   which may be present in an implementation.

   This test is intended to evaluate measurements in sections 3 and 4 of
   [RFC2679].

   1.  configure a path with X ms one-way constant delay

   2.  measure (average) one-way delay with 2 or more implementations,
       using identical options

   3.  configure the path with X+Y ms one-way delay

   4.  repeat measurements

   5.  observe that the (average) increase measured in steps 2 and 4 is
       ~Y ms for each implementation.  Most of the measurement errors in
       each system should cancel, if they are stationary.

   The NetProbe implementation exhibited a 2 second increase with a 6
   microsecond error (assuming that the NIST Net emulated delay
   difference is exact).

3.4.  Error Calibration, RFC 2679

   This is a simple check to determine if an implementation reports the
   error calibration as required in Section 4.8 of [RFC2679].  Note that
   the context (Type-P) must also be reported.

3.4.1.  Net Probe Error and Type-P

   NetProbe error is dependent on the specific version and installation
   details, and was discussed briefly above.

   Type-P for this test was IP-UDP with Best Effort DCSP.


4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security issues raised by discussing the topic of metric
   RFC advancement along the standards track.

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and
   [RFC5357].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests of IANA, and hopes that IANA will leave
   it alone, as well.
