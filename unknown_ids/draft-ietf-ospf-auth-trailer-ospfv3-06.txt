              Supporting Authentication Trailer for OSPFv3
                 draft-ietf-ospf-auth-trailer-ospfv3-06

Abstract

   Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating protocol packets.
   However, there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks
   (MANETs), where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and
   this mechanism cannot be used.  This draft proposes an alternative
   mechanism that can be used so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon IPsec
   for authentication.

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3                Aug 2011


1.  Introduction

   Unlike Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) [RFC2328], OSPF
   for IPv6 (OSPFv3) [RFC5340], does not include the AuType and
   Authentication fields in its headers for authenticating protocol
   packets.  Instead, OSPFv3 relies on the IPv6 Authentication Header
   (AH)[RFC4302] and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303]
   to provide integrity, authentication, and/or confidentiality.

   [RFC4552] describes how IPv6 AH and ESP extension headers can be used
   to provide authentication and/or confidentiality to OSPFv3.

   However, there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks
   (MANETs), where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and
   this mechanism cannot be used.  There is also an issue with IPsec not
   being available on some platforms.

   [RFC4552] discusses, at length, the reasoning behind using manually
   configured keys, rather than some automated key management protocol
   such as IKEv2 [RFC5996].  The primary problem is the lack of suitable
   key management mechanism, as OSPFv3 adjacencies are formed on a one-
   to-many basis and most key management mechanisms are designed for a
   one-to-one communication model.  This forces the system administrator
   to use manually configured security associations (SAs) and
   cryptographic keys to provide the authentication and, if desired,
   confidentiality services.

   Regarding replay protection [RFC4552] states that:

   "As it is not possible as per the current standards to provide
   complete replay protection while using manual keying, the proposed
   solution will not provide protection against replay attacks."

   Since there is no replay protection provided there are a number of
   vulnerabilities in OSPFv3 that have been discussed in [RFC6039].

   Since there is no deterministic way to differentiate between
   encrypted and unencrypted ESP packets by simply examining the packet,
   it could become tricky for some implementations to prioritize certain
   OSPFv3 packets (Hellos for example) over the others.

   This draft proposes a new mechanism that works similar to OSPFv2
   [RFC5709]for providing authentication to the OSPFv3 packets and
   attempts to solve the problems described above for OSPFv3.

   Additionally this document describes how HMAC-SHA authentication can
   be used for OSPFv3.

   By definition, HMAC ([RFC2104] , [FIPS-198]) requires a cryptographic
   hash function.  This document proposes to use any one of SHA-1, SHA-
   256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 [FIPS-180-3] to authenticate the OSPFv3
   packets.

   It is believed that [RFC2104] is mathematically identical to
   [FIPS-198] and it is also believed that algorithms in [RFC4634] are
   mathematically identical to [FIPS-180-3].

2.  Proposed Solution

   To perform non-IPsec cryptographic authentication, OSPFv3 routers
   append a special data block, henceforth referred to as, the
   authentication trailer to the end of the OSPFv3 packets.  The length
   of the authentication trailer is not included into the length of the
   OSPFv3 packet, but is included in the IPv6 payload length.

                Figure 1: Authentication Trailer in OSPFv3

   The presence of the Link Local Signaling (LLS) [RFC5613] block, is
   determined by the L-bit setting in OSPFv3 options field in OSPFv3
   Hello and Database Description packets.  If present, the LLS block is
   included along with the OSPFv3 packet in the cryptographic
   authentication computation.

2.1.  AT-Bit in Options Field

   A new AT-bit (AT stands for Authentication Trailer) is introduced
   into the OSPFv3 Options field.  OSPFv3 routers MUST set the AT-bit in
   OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description packets to indicate that the
   OSPFv3 router will include the authentication trailer in all OSPFv3
   packets on the link.  For OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description
   packets, the AT-bit indicates the AT is present.  For other OSPFv3

   packet types, the OSPFv3 AT bit setting is preserved from the OSPFv3
   Hello/Database Description setting.

                      Figure 2: OSPFv3 Options Field

   The AT-bit must be set in all OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description
   packets that contain an authentication trailer.

2.2.  Basic Operation

   The procedure followed for computing the Authentication Trailer is
   much same as described in [RFC5709] and [RFC2328].  One difference is
   that the LLS block, if present, is included in the cryptographic
   authentication computation.

   The way the authentication data is carried in the Authentication
   Trailer is very similar to how it is done in case of [RFC2328].  The
   only difference between the OSPFv2 authentication trailer and the
   OSPFv3 authentication trailer is that information in addition to the
   message digest is included.  The additional information in the OSPFv3
   Authentication Trailer is included in the message digest computation
   and, therefore, protected by OSPFv3 cryptographic authentication as
   described herein.

   Consistent with OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication [RFC2328], both
   OSPFv3 header checksum calculation and verification are omitted when
   the OSPFv3 authentication mechanisms described in this specification
   are used.

2.3.  IPv6 Source Address Protection

   While OSPFv3 always uses the Router ID to identify OSPFv3 neighbors,
   the IPv6 source address is learned from OSPFv3 hello packets and
   copied into the neighbor data structure [RFC5340].  Hence, OSPFv3 is
   susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks where the IPv6 source
   address has been modified.  To thwart such attacks, the IPv6 source
   address will be included in the message digest calculation and
   protected by OSPFv3 authentication.  Refer to Section 4.4 for
   details.  This is different than the procedure specified in [RFC5709]
   but consistent with [I-D.ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying].

3.  OSPFv3 Security Association

   An OSPFv3 Security Association (SA) contains a set of parameters
   shared between any two legitimate OSPFv3 speakers.

   Parameters associated with an OSPFv3 SA:

   o  Security Association Identifier (SA ID)

      This is a 32-bit unsigned integer used to uniquely identify an
      OSPFv3 SA, as manually configured by the network operator.

      The receiver determines the active SA by looking at the SA ID
      field in the incoming protocol packet.

      The sender, based on the active configuration, selects an SA to
      use and puts the correct Key ID value associated with the SA in
      the OSPFv3 protocol packet.  If multiple valid and active OSPFv3
      SAs exist for a given interface, the sender may use any of those
      SAs to protect the packet.

      Using SA IDs makes changing keys while maintaining protocol
      operation convenient.  Each SA ID specifies two independent parts,
      the authentication protocol and the authentication key, as
      explained below.

      Normally, an implementation would allow the network operator to
      configure a set of keys in a key chain, with each key in the chain
      having fixed lifetime.  The actual operation of these mechanisms
      is outside the scope of this document.

      Note that each SA ID can indicate a key with a different
      authentication protocol.  This allows the introduction of new
      authentication mechanisms without disrupting existing OSPFv3
      adjacencies.

   o  Authentication Algorithm

      This signifies the authentication algorithm to be used with the
      OSPFv3 SA.  This information is never sent in clear text over the
      wire.  Because this information is not sent on the wire, the
      implementer chooses an implementation specific representation for
      this information.

      Currently, the following algorithms are supported:

      HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3                Aug 2011


   o  Authentication Key

      This value denotes the cryptographic authentication key associated
      with the OSPFv3 SA.  The length of this key is variable and
      depends upon the authentication algorithm specified by the OSPFv3
      SA.

   o  Key Start Accept

      The time that this OSPFv3 router will accept packets that have
      been created with this OSPFv3 Security Association.

   o  Key Start Generate

      The time that this OSPFv3 router will begin using this OSPFv3
      Security Association for OSPFv3 packet generation.

   o  Key Stop Generate

      The time that this OSPFv3 router will stop using this OSPFv3
      Security Association for OSPFv3 packet generation.

   o  Key Stop Accept

      The time that this OSPFv3 router will stop accepting packets
      generated with this OSPFv3 Security Association.

   In order to achieve smooth key transition, KeyStartAccept SHOULD be
   less than KeyStartGenerate and KeyStopGenerate SHOULD be less than
   KeyStopAccept.  If KeyStopGenerate and KeyStopAccept are left
   unspecified, the key's lifetime is infinite.  When a new key replaces
   an old, the KeyStartGenerate time for the new key MUST be less than
   or equal to the KeyStopGenerate time of the old key.

   Key storage SHOULD persist across a system restart, warm or cold, to
   avoid operational issues.  In the event that the last key associated
   with an interface expires, it is unacceptable to revert to an
   unauthenticated condition, and not advisable to disrupt routing.
   Therefore, the router should send a "last Authentication Key
   expiration" notification to the network manager and treat the key as
   having an infinite lifetime until the lifetime is extended, the key
   is deleted by network management, or a new key is configured

                  Figure 3: Authentication Trailer Format

   The various fields in the Authentication trailer are:

   o  Auth Type

      16-bit field identifying the type of authentication.  The
      following values are defined in this specification:

         0 - Reserved.
         1 - Cryptographic Authentication as described herein.

   o  Auth Data Len

      The length in octet of the Authentication Trailer (AT) including
      both the 16 octet fixed header and the variable length message
      digest.

   o  Security Association Identifier (SA ID)

      32-bit field that identifies the algorithm and the secret key used

      to create the message digest appended to the OSPFv3 protocol
      packet.  Security Association Identifiers are unique per-
      interface.

   o  Cryptographic Sequence Number

      64-bit strictly increasing sequence number that is used to guard
      against replay attacks.  The 64-bit sequence number MUST be
      incremented for every OSPFv3 packet sent by the OSPFv3 router.
      Upon reception, the sequence number MUST be greater than the
      sequence number in the last OSPFv3 packet accepted from the
      sending OSPFv3 neighbor.  Otherwise, the OSPFv3 packet is
      considered a replayed packet and dropped.

      OSPFv3 routers implementing this specification SHOULD use
      available mechanisms to preserve the sequence number's strictly
      increasing property for the deployed life of the OSPFv3 router
      (including cold restarts).  One mechanism for accomplishing this
      would be to use the high order 32 bits of the sequence number as a
      wrap/boot count that is incremented anytime the OSPFv3 router
      loses its sequence number state.  Sequence number wrap is
      described in Section 4.1.1.

   o  Authentication Data

      Variable data that is carrying the digest for the protocol packet
      and optional LLS block.

4.1.1.  Sequence Number Wrap

   When incrementing the sequence number for each transmitted OSPFv3
   packet, the sequence number should be treated as an unsigned 64-bit
   value.  If the lower order 32-bit value wraps, the high order 64-bit
   value should be saved in non-volatile storage.  If by some chance the
   OSPFv3 router is deployed long enough that there is a possibility
   that the 64-bit sequence number may wrap, all keys, independent of
   key distribution mechanism, MUST be reset to avoid the possibility of
   replay attacks.  Once the keys have been changes, the higher order
   sequence number can be reset to 0 and saved to non-volatile storage.

4.2.  OSPFv3 Header Checksum

   Both OSPFv3 header checksum calculation and verification are omitted
   when the OSPFv3 authentication mechanisms described in this
   specification are used.  This implies:

   o  For OSPFv3 packets to be transmitted, the OSPFv3 header checksum
      computation is omitted and the OSPFv3 header checksum SHOULD be

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3                Aug 2011


      set to 0 prior to computation of the OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer
      message digest.

   o  For received OSPFv3 packets including an OSPFv3 Authentication
      Trailer, OSPFv3 header checksum verification MUST be omitted.

4.3.  Cryptographic Authentication Procedure

   As noted earlier, the SA ID implicitly specifies the algorithms used
   to generate and verify the message digest.  This specification
   discusses the computation of OSPFv3 Cryptographic Authentication data
   when any of the NIST SHS family of algorithms is used in the Hashed
   Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mode.

   The currently valid algorithms (including mode) for OSPFv3
   Cryptographic Authentication include:

   HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512

   Of the above, implementations of this specification MUST include
   support for at least HMAC-SHA-1 and SHOULD include support for HMAC-
   SHA-256 and MAY also include support for HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-
   512.

4.4.  Cryptographic Aspects

   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which
   is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used:

   H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g.  SHA-256).

   K is the Authentication Key for the OSPFv3 security association.

   Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.

   B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits.

   Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size.

      For SHA-1 and SHA-256: B == 64

      For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128

   L is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits.

   XOR is the exclusive-or operation.

   Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times.



Bhatia, et al.          Expires February 23, 2012              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3                Aug 2011


   Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times.

   Apad is a value which is the same length as the hash output or
   message digest.  The first 16 octets contain the IPv6 source address
   followed by the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L-16)/4 times.
   This implies that hash output is always a length of at least 16
   octets.


   1.  Preparation of the Key

       In this application, Ko is always L octets long.

       If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal
       to K. If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long,
       then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less
       than L octets long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K)
       with zeros appended to the end of the Authentication Key (K) such
       that Ko is L octets long.

   2.  First Hash

       First, the OSPFv3 packet's Authentication Data field in the
       Authentication Trailer (which is very similar to the appendage
       described in RFC 2328, Section D.4.3, Page 233, items(6)(a) and
       (6)(d)) is filled with the value Apad.

       Then, a First-Hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed as
       follows:

          First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (OSPFv3 Packet))

       Implementation Notes:

          Note that the First-Hash above includes the Authentication
          Trailer, as well as the OSPFv3 packet, as per RFC 2328,
          Section D.4.3 and, if present, the LLS block[RFC5613].

       The definition of Apad (above) ensures it is always the same
       length as the hash output.  This is consistent with RFC 2328.
       The "(OSPFv3 Packet)" mentioned in the First-Hash (above) does
       include both the optional LLS block and the OSPFv3 Authentication
       Trailer.

       The digest length for SHA-1 is 20 octets; for SHA-256, 32 octets;
       for SHA-384, 48 octets; and for SHA-512, 64 octets.

   3.  Second Hash

       Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is computed as
       follows:


          Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash)

   4.  Result

       The resulting Second-Hash becomes the authentication data that is
       sent in the Authentication Trailer of the OSPFv3 packet.  The
       length of the authentication data is always identical to the
       message digest size of the specific hash function H that is being
       used.

       This also means that the use of hash functions with larger output
       sizes will also increase the size of the OSPFv3 packet as
       transmitted on the wire.

       Implementation Note:

          RFC 2328, Appendix D specifies that the Authentication Trailer
          is not counted in the OSPF packet's own Length field, but is
          included in the packet's IP Length field.  Similar to this,
          the Authentication Trailer is not included in OSPFv3's own
          Length field, but is included in IPv6's payload length.

4.5.  Message Verification

   A router would determine that OSPFv3 is using an Authentication
   trailer by examining the AT-bit in the Options field in the OSPFv3
   header for Hello and Database Description packets.  The specification
   in the Hello and Database description options indicates that other
   OSPFv3 packets will include the authentication trailer.

   The Authentication Trailer (AT) is accessed using the OSPFv3 packet
   header length to access the data after the OSPFv3 packet and, if an
   LLS Data Block [RFC5613] is present, using the LLS Data Block Length
   to access the data after the LLS Data Block.  The L-bit in the OSPFv3
   options in Hello and Database Description packets is examined to
   determine if an LLS Data Block is present.  If an LLS block is
   present (as specified by the L-bit), it is included along with the
   OSPFv3 Hello or Database Description packet in the cryptographic
   authentication computation.

   Due to the placement of the AT following the LLS block and the fact
   that the LLS block is included in the cryptographic authentication



Bhatia, et al.          Expires February 23, 2012              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           Auth Trailer for OSPFv3                Aug 2011


   computation, OSPFv3 routers supporting this specification MUST
   minimally support examining the L-bit in the OSPFv3 options and using
   the length in the LLS block to access the AT.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   OSPFv3 routers supporting this specification fully support OSPFv3
   Link Local Signaling, [RFC5613].

   If usage of the Authentication Trailer (AT), as specified herein, is
   configured for an OSPFv3 link, OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description
   packets with the AT-bit clear in the options will be dropped.  All
   OSPFv3 packet types will be dropped if AT is configured for the link
   and the IPv6 header length is less than the amount necessary to
   include an authentication trailer.

   If the cryptographic sequence number in the AT is less than or equal
   to the last sequence number successfully received from the neighbor,
   the OSPFv3 packet MUST be dropped.

   Authentication algorithm dependent processing needs to be performed,
   using the algorithm specified by the appropriate OSPFv3 SA for the
   received packet.

   Before an implementation performs any processing it needs to save the
   values of the Authentication data field from the Authentication
   Trailer appended to the OSPFv3 packet.

   It should then set the Authentication Data field with Apad before the
   authentication data is computed.  The calculated data is compared
   with the received authentication data in the Authentication trailer
   and the packet MUST be discarded if the two do not match.  In such a
   case, an error event SHOULD be logged.

5.  Migration and Backward Compatibility

   In general, all OSPFv3 routers participating on a link should be
   migrated to OSPFv3 Authentication at the same time.  As with OSPFv2
   authentication, a mismatch in the SA ID, Authentication Type, or
   message digest will result in failure to form an adjacency.  For
   multi-access links, communities of OSPFv3 routers could be migrated
   using different interface instance IDs.  However, at least one router
   would need to form adjacencies between both the OSPFv3 routers
   including and not including the authentication trailer.  This would
   result in sub-optimal routing, as well as, added complexity and is
   only recommended in cases where authentication is desired on the link
   and it isn't feasible to migrate all the routers on the link at the
   same time.

   An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it includes the
   Authentication Trailer in the packets but does not verify this
   information.  This is provided as a transition aid for networks in
   the process of migrating to the mechanism described in this draft.

6.  Security Considerations

   The document proposes extensions to OSPFv3 that would make it more
   secure than [RFC5340].  It does not provide confidentiality as a
   routing protocol contains information that does not need to be kept
   secret.  It does, however, provide means to authenticate the sender
   of the packets which is of interest to us.

   It should be noted that authentication method described in this
   document is not being used to authenticate the specific originator of
   a packet, but is rather being used to confirm that the packet has
   indeed been issued by a router which had access to the password.

   The mechanism described here is not perfect and does not need to be
   perfect.  Instead, this mechanism represents a significant increase
   in the work function of an adversary attacking the OSPFv3 protocol,
   while not causing undue implementation, deployment, or operational
   complexity.
