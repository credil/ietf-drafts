Internet-Draft     DS-lite on Pt-to-Pt Access Network          June 2010


1.  Introduction

   GI-DS-lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-gateway-init-ds-lite] describes the use
   of Gateway-Initiated softwire tunnels operating between the Gateway
   and the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) to conserve IPv4
   addresses.  Flows from multiple access devices (CPEs) can be
   distinguished through use of Context Identifiers (CID).  GI-DS-lite
   describes an architecture where each CPE is a single device.  It does
   not cover the case where each CPE manages multiple hosts.  This is
   common in fixed network deployment and home network deployment over
   air.

   GI-DS-lite proposes few tunnel modes used for CID.  One option is to
   use Plain IP-in-IP.  In this mode, a unique IPv4 address must be
   assigned for each CPE from the gateway.  As such, it does not support
   CPEs using overlapped address.  To support overlapped address space,
   stateful tunnel (eg.  GRE) is required between gateway and AFTR.  It
   is expensive to create one stateful tunnel per CPE especially in
   fixed network non-mobility deployment.

   DS-Extra-lite [I-D.arkko-dual-stack-extra-lite] describes that when
   the CPE is connected to the gateway by point-to-point link rather
   than shared media connection, it is unnecessary for the CID to be an
   IP address.  If another identifier with the required uniqueness
   properties can be found (eg.  VLAN and ATM PVC), the gateway can use
   the per-interface identity to uniquely identify the CPE.  This
   relaxes the contraint of using CPE's IPv4 address for uniqueness.

   This memo describes a framework to use the point-to-point identifier
   and the IPv6 Flow Label [RFC3697] to create a unique binding in the
   AFTR for CPEs using overlapped address space in the point-to-point
   access network.


2.  Scope and Requirements

   This specification focuses on the point-to-point access network
   deployment using GI-DS-lite.  Other deployment scenarios are out of
   scope.  These are the assumptions of the network:

   1.  The access network is point-to-point.

   2.  The access network is not yet IPv6 enabled.

   3.  Avoid double-NAT.

   4.  Edge router does not perform NAT.

   6.  Extend the point-to-point mapping to AFTR.


3.  Overview

3.1.  Current Deployment

   Many operators use point-to-point (eg.  PPP) to connect to their
   customers.  The operators give each customer a public IPv4 address.
   Many customers also have a gateway (managed or unmanaged) which is a
   NAT device managing the customer's internal network.  Figure 1 shows
   a common deployment architecture.

3.2.  DS-lite in Point-to-Point Access Network

   When IPv4 addresses are scarce, operators may want to increase the
   IPv4 address utilization by sharing a single IPv4 address to multiple
   users.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] describes a framework to
   implement B4 element in the CPE and tunnel the IPv4-in-IPv6 packets
   to AFTR element in the operator network for NAT-ing.  The AFTR uses
   the unique IPv6 address of the B4 to identify the CPE.  This
   framework works well for both shared media network and point-to-point
   access network, but it requires the operator to upgrade the access
   network to IPv6.

   In point-to-point access network, each CPE has a unique point-to-
   point link.  The operator can use this information to identify the
   CPE.  In this specification, the ER does not give any IPv4 address to
   the CPE.  Instead, each point-to-point interface is an unnumbered
   interface.  The CPE is still an IPv4 DHCP server for the LAN, it
   continues to offer [RFC1918] addresses to its managed hosts.  In this
   memo, the CPE does not NAT the packets coming from its hosts.
   Instead, the CPE simply puts the packets to the point-to-point link
   and forward to the ER.  When ER receives the packet, it maps the
   point-to-point identifier to the IPv6 Flow Label [RFC3697] and send
   to the AFTR for NAT.  Figure 2 shows the architecture.

   In Figure 2, H1 and H3, and H2 and H4 use duplicate IP addresses.
   Since CPE A and B do not have IP address, the ER cannot use the IP
   address to returned packets to the hosts behind CPE A and B.
   Alternatively, ER creates a binding table to map the point-to-point
   identifier to the CPEs.  Then, ER uses the IPv6 Flow Label [RFC3697]
   as the Context Identifier for the GI-DS-lite tunnel.  No stateful
   tunnel is required between AFTR and ER.


4.  Requirements Language

   This document uses no requirements language.


5.  Proposed Alternative Context Identifier

   This memo proposes that an additional type of context identifier be
   added to the set identified in GI-DS-lite.  Where the tunnel between
   the Gateway and the AFTR is IP-in-IPv6, it is proposed to use the
   IPv6 Flow Label as the context identifier.

   The Flow Label is 20 bits, where the Context ID in GI-DS-lite is 32
   bits.  Use of the Flow Label as the Context ID is therefore suitable
   only for deployments not requiring the larger scale.  To some extent
   this limitation can be overcome by using multiple tunnels between the
   Gateway and the AFTR.


6.  Conclusion

   We present a framework to deploy GI-DS-lite in point-to-point access
   network.  This framework promotes IPv6 deployment from the core to
   the edge.  When IPv6 is ready in the access network, the operators
   can either upgrade the CPE to B4 element and migrate to classic DS-
   lite deployment or provision dual-stack to the CPE and continue to
   use GI-DS-lite.
