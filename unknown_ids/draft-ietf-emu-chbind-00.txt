1.  Introduction

   The so-called "lying NAS" problem is a well-documented problem with
   the current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) architecture
   [RFC3748] when used in pass-through authenticator mode.  Here, a
   Network Access Server (NAS), or pass-through authenticator, may
   represent one set of information (e.g. network identity,
   capabilities, configuration, etc) to the backend Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure, while
   representing contrary information to EAP clients.  Another
   possibility is that the same false information could be provided to
   both the EAP client and EAP server by the NAS.

   A concrete example of this may be an IEEE 802.11 access point with a
   security association to a particular AAA server.  While there may be
   some identity tied to that security association, there's no reason
   the access point needs to advertise a consistent identity to clients.
   In fact, it may include whatever information in its beacons (e.g.
   different SSID or security properties) it desires.  This could lead
   to situations where, for example, a client joins one network that is
   masquerading as another.

   Another current limitation of EAP is its minimal ability to perform
   authorization.  Currently EAP servers can only make authorization
   decisions about network access based on information they know about
   peers.  If the same EAP server controls access to multiple networks,
   it has little information about the NAS to which the peer is
   connecting, and does not know what information the NAS may be
   claiming about the network to the peer.  A mechanism is needed that
   allows the EAP server to apply more detailed policies to
   authorization.

   This document defines and implements EAP channel bindings to solve
   these two problems, using a process in which the EAP client provides
   information about the characteristics of the service provided by the
   authenticator to the AAA server protected within the EAP method.
   This allows the server to verify the authenticator is providing
   information to the peer consistent with the defined network policy,
   and that the peer is authorized to access the network in the manner
   described by the NAS.  "AAA Payloads" defined in
   [I-D.clancy-emu-aaapay] proposes a mechanism to carry this
   information.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key

   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   In a [RFC4017]-compliant EAP authentication, the EAP client and EAP
   server mutually authenticate each other, and derive keying material.
   However, when operating in pass-through mode, the EAP server can be
   far removed from the authenticator.  A malicious or compromised
   authenticator may represent incorrect information about the network
   to the client in an effort to affect its operation in some way.
   Additionally, while an authenticator may not be compromised, other
   compromised elements in the network could provide false information
   to the authenticator that it could simply be relaying to EAP clients.
   Our goal is to ensure that the authenticator is providing correct
   information to the EAP client during the initial network discovery,
   selection, and authentication.

   There are two different types of networks to consider: enterprise
   networks and service provider networks.  In enterprise networks, we
   assume a single administrative domain, making it feasible for an EAP
   server to have information about all the authenticators in the
   network.  In service provider networks, global knowledge is
   infeasible due to indirection via roaming.  When a client is outside
   its home administrative domain, the goal is to ensure that the level
   of service received by the client is consistent with the contractual
   agreement between the two service providers.

   The following are a couple example attacks possible by presenting
   false network information to clients.

   o  Enterprise Network: A corporate network may have multiple virtual
      LANs (VLANs) running throughout their campus network, and have
      IEEE 802.11 access points connected to each VLAN.  Assume one VLAN
      connects users to the firewalled corporate network, while the
      other connects users to a public guest network.  The corporate
      network is assumed to be free of adversarial elements, while the
      guest network is assumed to possibly have malicious elements.
      Access Points on both VLANs are serviced by the same EAP server,
      but broadcast different SSIDs to differentiate.  A compromised
      access point connected to the guest network could advertise the
      SSID of the corporate network in an effort to lure clients to
      connect to a network with a false sense of security regarding
      their traffic.  Conditions and further details of this attack can
      be found in the Appendix.

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


   o  Service Provider Network: An EAP-enabled mobile phone provider
      operating along a geo-political boundary could boost their cell
      towers' transmission power and advertise the network identity of
      the neighboring country's indigenous provider.  This would cause
      unknowing handsets to associate with an unintended operator, and
      consequently be subject to high roaming fees without realizing
      they had roamed off their home provider's network.  This scenario
      can be considered as "lying provider" problem, because here the
      provider tampers with the transmission power and then configures
      its NAS to broadcast another network's identity.  For the purpose
      of channel bindings as defined in this draft, it does not matter
      which local entity (or entities) is "lying" in a service provider
      network (local NAS, local authentication server and/or local
      proxies), because the only information received from the visited
      network that is verified by channel bindings is the information
      the home authentication server received from the last hop in the
      communication chain.  In other words, channel bindings enable the
      detection of inconsistencies in the information from a visited
      network, but cannot determine which entity is lying.  Naturally,
      channel bindings for EAP methods can only verify the endpoints
      and, if desirable, intermediate hops need to be protected by the
      employed AAA protocol.

   To address these problems, a mechanism is required to validate
   unauthenticated information advertised by EAP authenticators.


4.  Channel Bindings

   EAP channel bindings seek to authenticate previously unauthenticated
   information provided by the authenticator to the EAP peer, by
   allowing the client and server to compare their perception of network
   properties in a secure channel.

   It should be noted that the definition of EAP channel bindings
   differs somewhat from channel bindings documented in [RFC5056], which
   seek to securely bind together the end points of a multi-layer
   protocol, allowing lower layers to protect data from higher layers.
   Unlike [RFC5056], EAP channel bindings do not ensure the binding
   different layers of a session but rather the information advertised
   to EAP client by an authenticator acting as pass-through device
   during an EAP execution.

   There are two main approaches to EAP channel bindings:

   o  After keys have been derived during an EAP execution, the peer and
      server can, in an integrity-protected channel, exchange plaintext
      information about the network with each other, and verify



Clancy & Hoeper           Expires May 23, 2009                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


      consistency and correctness.

   o  Network information can be uniquely encoded into an opaque blob
      that can be included directly into the derivation of the EAP
      session keys.

   Both approaches are only applicable to key deriving EAP methods and
   both have advantages and disadvantages.  Advantages of exchanging
   plaintext information include:

   o  It allows for policy-based comparisons of network properties,
      rather than requiring precise matches for every field, which
      achieves a policy-defined consistency, rather than bitwise
      equality.  This allows network operators to define which
      properties are important and even verifiable in their network.

   o  EAP methods that support extensible, integrity-protected channels
      can easily include support for exchanging this network
      information.  In contrast, direct inclusion into the key
      derivation would require revisions to existing EAP methods or a
      wrapper EAP method.

   o  Given it doesn't affect the key derivation, this approach
      facilitates debugging, incremental deployment, backward
      compatibility and a logging mode in which verification results are
      recorded but do not have an affect on the remainder of the EAP
      execution.  The exact use of the verification results can be
      subject to the network policy.  Additionally, consistent
      information canonicalization and formatting for the key derivation
      approach would likely cause significant deployment problems.

   The following are advantages of directly including channel binding
   information in the key derivation:

   o  EAP methods not supporting extensible, integrity-protected
      channels could still be supported, either by revising their key
      derivation, revising EAP, or wrapping them in a universal method
      that supports channel binding.

   o  It can guarantee proper channel information, since subsequent
      communication would be impossible if differences in channel
      information yielded different session keys on the EAP client and
      server.

   The scope of EAP channel bindings differs somewhat depending on the
   type of deployment in which they are being used.  In enterprise
   networks, they can be used to authenticate very specific properties
   of the authenticator (e.g.  MAC address, supported link types and



Clancy & Hoeper           Expires May 23, 2009                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


   data rates, etc), while in service provider networks they can
   generally only authenticate broader information about a roaming
   partner's network (e.g. network name, roaming information, link
   security requirements, etc).  The reason for the difference has to do
   with the amount of information you expect your home EAP server to
   know about the authenticator and/or network to which the peer is
   connected.  In roaming cases, the home server is likely to only know
   information contained in their roaming agreements.

   With any multi-hop AAA infrastructure, many of the specific NAS
   properties are obscured by the AAA proxy that's decrypting,
   reframing, and retransmitting the underlying AAA messages.
   Especially service provider networks are affected by this and the
   information received from the last hop may not contain much
   verifiable information any longer.  For example, information such as
   the NAS IP address may not be known to the EAP server.  This affects
   the ability of the EAP server to verify specific NAS properties.
   However, often verification of the MAC or IP address of the NAS is
   not useful for improving the overall security posture of a network.
   More often it is useful to make policy decisions about services being
   offered to peers.  For example, in an IEEE 802.11 network, the EAP
   server may wish to ensure that clients connecting to the corporate
   intranet are using secure link- layer encryption, while link-layer
   security requirements for clients connecting to the guest network
   could be less stringent.  These types of policy decisions can be made
   without knowing or being able to verify the IP address of the NAS
   through which the peer is connecting.  Furthermore, as described in
   the next section, channel bindings also verify the information
   provided by peer and a local policy database, where both pieces of
   information are unaffected by the processing of intermediate hops.
   Consequently, even if some information got lost in transition and
   thus may not be known to the EAP server, the server is still able to
   carry out the channel binding verification.

   Also, a peer's expectations of a network may also differ.  In a
   mobile phone network, peers generally don't care what the name of the
   network is, as long as they can make their phone call and are charged
   the expected amount for the call.  However, in an enterprise network
   a peer may be more concerned with specifics of where their network
   traffic is being routed.

   Any deployment of channel bindings should take into consideration
   both what information the EAP server is likely to know, and also what
   type of network information the peer would want and need
   authenticated.

5.  Channel Binding Protocol

   This section defines a protocol for verifying channel binding
   information during an EAP authentication.  The protocol uses the
   approach where plaintext data is exchanged, since it allows channel
   bindings to be used more flexibly in varied deployment models.

                   Figure 1: Overview of Channel Binding

   Channel bindings are always provided between two communication
   endpoints, here the EAP client and server, who communicate through an
   authenticator in pass-trough mode.  During network advertisement,
   selection, and authentication, the authenticator presents
   unauthenticated information, labeled i1 for convenience, about the
   network to the peer.  This information, i1, could include an
   authenticator identifier and the identity of the network it
   represents, in addition to advertised network information such as
   offered services and roaming information.  As there is no established
   trust relationship between the peer and authenticator, there is no
   way for the peer to validate this information.

   Additionally, during the transaction the authenticator presents a
   number of information properties about itself to the AAA
   infrastructure which may or may not be valid.  We label this
   information i2.  Note that i2 is the information the EAP server
   receives from the last hop in the communication chain which is not
   necessarily the authenticator.  In those cases i2 may be different
   from the original information sent by the authenticator because of en
   route processing or malicious modifications.  As a result, in the
   service provider model, typically the EAP server is able to verify
   only the last-hop portion of i2, or values propagated by proxy
   servers.

   Our goal is to transport i1 from the peer to the server, and allow
   the server to verify the consistency of i1 from the peer and i2 from



Clancy & Hoeper           Expires May 23, 2009                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


   the authenticator against the information stored in its local policy
   database.

   By doing this, we allow the EAP server the opportunity to make
   informed decisions about authorization.  The EAP server can
   authenticate the authenticator via the AAA security association, and
   using this channel bindings mechanism it can now authorize the
   circumstances under which a peer connects to the authenticator.

   This information, i1, could include an authenticator identifier and
   the identity of the network it represents, in addition to advertised
   network information such as offered services and roaming information.
   To prevent attacks by a lying NAS or lying provider, the EAP server
   must be able to verify that i1 either matches its knowledge of the
   network (enterprise model) or is consistent with the contractual
   agreement between itself and the roaming partner network to which the
   client is connected (service provider model).  Additionally, it
   should verify that this information is consistent with i2.

   The protocol defined in this document is a single round trip between
   the EAP peer and server that can be piggybacked to the EAP method
   execution, and formats data elements as Diameter AVPs.  We provide
   requirements for a transport protocol.


6.  System Requirements

   The channel binding protocol defined in this document must be
   transported after keying material has been derived between the EAP
   peer and server, and before the peer would suffer adverse affects
   from joining an adversarial network.  To satisfy this requirement, it
   should occur either during the EAP method execution or during the EAP
   lower layer's secure association protocol.

   The transport protocol for carrying channel binding information MUST
   support end-to-end (i.e. between the EAP peer and server) message
   integrity protection to prevent the adversarial NAS or AAA device
   from manipulating the transported data.  The transport protocol
   SHOULD provide confidentiality.  The motivation for this that the
   channel bindings could contain private information, including peer
   identities, which SHOULD be protected.

   If transporting data directly within an EAP method, it MUST be able
   to carry integrity protected data from the EAP peer to server.  EAP
   methods SHOULD provide a mechanism to carry protected data from
   server to peer.  EAP methods MUST export channel binding data to the
   AAA subsystem on the EAP server.  EAP methods MUST be able to import
   channel binding data from the lower layer on the EAP peer.

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


   One way to transport the single round-trip exchange is as a series of
   Diameter AVPs formatted and encapsulated in EAP methods per
   [I-D.clancy-emu-aaapay].  For each lower layer, this document defines
   the parameters of interest, and the appropriate Diameter AVPs for
   transporting them.  Additionally, guidance on how to perform
   consistency checks on those values will be provided.

   Any transport needs to be careful not to exceed the MTU for its
   lower-layer medium.  In particular, if channel binding information is
   exchanged within protected EAP method channels, these methods may or
   may not support fragmentation.  In order to work with all methods,
   the channel binding messages must fit within the available payload.
   For example, if the EAP MTU is 1020 octets, and EAP-GPSK is used as
   the authentication method, and maximal-length identities are used, a
   maximum of 384 octets are available for conveying channel binding
   information.  Other methods, such as EAP-TTLS, support fragmentation
   and could carry significantly longer payloads.

   In order to minimize data formatting inconsistencies, parameters
   useful for channel binding MUST be allocated from the standard RADIUS
   space.  Two AVPs are considered equivalent for the purpose of channel
   binding if they have the same AVP Code, Vendor-Specific Bit, AVP
   Length, Vendor-ID (if Vendor-Specific Bit is set), and data.


7.  Lower-Layer Bindings

   This section discusses AVPs of some EAP-employing lower layer link
   protocols that seem appropriate for providing channel bindings (i.e.
   data from "i1" in Section Section 5).  The discussion is limited to
   protocols that establish fresh authentic keying material because such
   keying material is necessary to protect the integrity of all AVPs
   that are exchanged as part of the channel binding.  For each
   protocol, a variety of network information that can be encapsulated
   in AVPs is of interest for server and peer to ensure channel binding.
   The respective appropriate AVPs depend on the lower layer protocol as
   well as on the network type (i.e. enterprise network or service
   provider network) of an application.

   For each EAP lower layer, a variety of AAA properties may be of
   interest to the server.  These values may already be known by the
   server, or may be transported to the server via an existing RADIUS or
   Diameter connection.

   As part of the channel binding protocol, the EAP peer sends
   encapsulated AVPs to the server.  The server then validates the
   received information by comparing it to information stored in a local
   database.  If the received information is unsatisfactory given some

   validation policy, the server SHOULD respond by halting the EAP
   authentication and returning an EAP-Failure.

   If validation is successful, the server SHOULD send a message
   indicating the success to the client.  In addition, the server MAY
   respond back to the EAP peer with information encapsulated in AVPs
   that can be of use to the peer, and information the peer may not have
   any way of otherwise knowing.

7.1.  General Attributes

   This section lists AVPs useful to all link-layers.

   NAS-Port-Type:  Indicates the underlying link-layer technology used
      to connect (e.g.  IEEE 802.11, PPP, etc), and MUST be included by
      the EAP client, and SHOULD be verified against the database and
      NAS-Port-Type received from the NAS.

   Cost-Information:  AVP from the Diameter Credit-Control Application
      [RFC4006] to the peer indicating how much peers will be billed for
      service and MAY be included by the EAP client and verified against
      roaming profiles stored in the database.

7.2.  IEEE 802.11

   The client SHOULD transmit to the server the following fields,
   encapsulated within the appropriate Diameter AVPs:

   Called-Station-Id:  contains BSSID and SSID and MUST be included by
      the EAP client, and SHOULD be verified against the database and
      Called-Station-Id received from the NAS


   [TODO: Need a way to transport the RSN-IE.]

7.2.1.  IEEE 802.11r

   In addition to the AVPs for IEEE 802.11, an IEEE 802.11r client
   SHOULD transmit the following additional fields:

   Mobility-Domain-Id:  Identity of the mobility domain and MUST be
      included by the EAP client, and SHOULD be verified against the
      database and Mobility-Domain-Id received from the NAS
      [I-D.aboba-radext-wlan]

7.2.2.  IEEE 802.11s

   In addition to the AVPs for IEEE 802.11, an IEEE 802.11s client
   SHOULD transmit the following additional fields:

   Mesh-Key-Distributor-Domain-Id:  Identity of the Mesh Key Distributor
      Domain and MUST be included by the EAP client, and SHOULD be
      verified against the database and Mesh-Key-Distributor-Domain-Id
      received from the NAS [I-D.aboba-radext-wlan]

8.  AAA-Layer Bindings

   This section discusses which AAA attributes in RADIUS Accept-Request
   messages can and should be validated by a AAA server (i.e. data from
   "i2" in Section Section 5).  As noted before, this data can be
   manipulated by AAA proxies either to enable functionality (e.g.
   removing realm information after messages have been proxied) or
   maliciously (e.g. in the case of a lying provider).  As such, this
   data cannot always be easily validated.  However as thorough of a
   validation as possible should be conducted in an effort to detect
   possible attacks.

   User-Name:  This value should be checked for consistency with the
      database and any method-specific user information.  If EAP method
      identity protection is employed, this value typically contains a
      pseudonym or keyword.

   NAS-IP-Address:  This value is typically the IP address of the
      authenticator, but in a proxied connection it likely will not
      match the source IP address of an Access-Request.  A consistency
      check MAY verify the subnet of the IP address was correct based on
      the last-hop proxy.

   NAS-IPv6-Address:  This value is typically the IPv6 address of the
      authenticator, but in a proxied connection it likely will not
      match the source IPv6 address of an Access-Request.  A consistency
      check MAY verify the subnet of the IPv6 address was correct based
      on the last-hop proxy.

   Called-Station-Id:  This is typically the MAC address of the NAS.  On
      an enterprise network, it MAY be validated against the MAC address
      is one that has been provisioned on the network.

   Calling-Station-Id:  This is typically the MAC address of the EAP
      Client, and verification of this is likely difficult, unless EAP
      credentials have been provisioned on a per-host basis to specific
      L2 addresses.  It SHOULD be validated against the database in an
      enterprise deployment.

   NAS-Identifier:  This is an identifier populated by the NAS, and
      could be related to the MAC address, and should be validated
      similarly to the Called-Station-Id.

   NAS-Port-Type:  This specifies the underlying link technology.  It
      SHOULD be validated against the value received from the client in
      the information exchange, and against a database of authorized
      link-layer technologies.


9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Trust Model

   We consider a trust model in which the peer and server trust each
   other.  This is not unreasonable, considering they already have a
   trust relationship.  In this trust model, client and authentication
   server are honest while the authenticator is maliciously sending
   false information to client and/or server.  The following are the
   trust relationships:




Clancy & Hoeper           Expires May 23, 2009                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


   o  The server trusts that the channel binding information received
      from the client is the information that the client received from
      the authenticator.
   o  The client trusts the channel binding result received from the
      server.
   o  The server trusts the information contained within its local
      database.

   In order to establish the first two trust relationships during an EAP
   execution, an EAP method SHOULD provide the following:

   o  mutual authentication between client and server
   o  derivation of keying material including a key for integrity
      protection of channel binding messages
   o  sending i1 from client to server over an integrity-protected
      channel
   o  sending the result and optionally i2 from server to client over an
      integrity-protected channel

9.2.  Consequences of Trust Violation

   If any of the trust relationships listed in Section 7.1 are violated,
   channel binding cannot be provided.  In other words, if mutual
   authentication with key establishment as part of the EAP method as
   well as protected database access are not provided, then achieving
   channel binding is not feasible.

   Dishonest peers can only manipulate the first message i1 of the
   channel binding protocol.  In this scenario, a peer sends i1' to the
   server.  If i1' is invalid, the channel binding validation will fail
   and the server will abort the EAP authentication.  On the other hand
   if i1' passes the validation, either the original i1 was wrong and
   i1' corrected the problem or both i1 and i1' constitute valid
   information.  All cases do not seem to be of any benefit to a peer
   and do no pose a security risk.

   Dishonest servers can send EAP-Failure messages and abort the EAP
   authentication even if the received i1 is valid.  However, servers
   can always abort any EAP session independent of whether channel
   binding is offered or not.  On the other hand, dishonest servers can
   claim a successful validation even for an invalid i1.  This can be
   seen as collaboration of authenticator and server.  Channel binding
   can neither prevent nor detect such attacks.  In general such attacks
   cannot be prevented by cryptographic means and should be addressed
   using policies making servers liable for their provided information
   and services.

   Additional network entities (such as proxies) might be on the



Clancy & Hoeper           Expires May 23, 2009                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


   communication path between peer and server and may attempt to
   manipulate the channel binding protocol.  If these entities do not
   possess the keying material used for integrity protection of the
   channel binding messages, the same threat analysis applies as for the
   dishonest authenticators.  Hence, such entities can neither
   manipulate single channel binding messages nor the outcome.  On the
   other hand, entities with access to the keying material must be
   treated like a server in a threat analysis.  Hence such entities are
   able to manipulate the channel binding protocol without being
   detected.  However, the required knowledge of keying material is
   unlikely since channel binding is executed before the EAP method is
   completed, and thus before keying material is typically transported
   to other entities.

9.3.  Privacy Violations

   While the channel binding information exchanged between EAP peer and
   EAP server (i.e. i1 and the optional result message) must always be
   integrity-protected it may not be encrypted.  In the case that these
   messages contain identifiers of peer and/or network entities, the
   privacy property of the executed EAP method may be violated.  Hence,
   in order to maintain the privacy of an EAP method, the exchanged
   channel binding information must be encrypted.


10.  Operations and Management Considerations

   This section analyzes the impact of channel bindings on existing
   deployments of EAP.

10.1.  System Impact

   As with any extension to existing protocols, there will be an impact
   on existing systems.  Typically the goal is to develop an extension
   that minimizes the impact on both development and deployment of the
   new system, subject to the system requirements.  In this section we
   discuss the impact on existing devices that currently utilize EAP,
   assuming the channel binding information is transported within the
   EAP method execution.

   The EAP peer will need an API between the EAP lower layer and the EAP
   method that exposes the necessary information from the NAS to be
   validated to the EAP peer, which can then feed that information into
   the EAP methods for transport.  For example, an IEEE 802.11 system
   would need to make available the various information elements that
   require validation to the EAP peer which would properly format them
   and pass them to the EAP method.  Additionally, the EAP peer will
   require updated EAP methods that support transporting channel binding



Clancy & Hoeper           Expires May 23, 2009                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


   information.  While most method documents are written modularly to
   allow incorporating arbitrary protected information, implementations
   of those methods would need to be revised to support these
   extensions.  Driver updates are also required so methods can access
   the required information.

   No changes to the pass-through authenticator would be required.

   The EAP server would need an API between the database storing NAS
   information and the individual EAP server.  The EAP methods need to
   be able to export received channel binding information to the EAP
   server so it can be validated.

   Additionally, an interface is necessary for populating the EAP server
   database with the appropriate parameters.  In the enterprise case,
   when a NAS is provisioned, information about what it should be
   advertising to peers needs to be entered into the database.  In the
   service provider case, there should be a mechanism for entering
   contractual information about roaming partners.

   While populating the database can be a complex task initially, it is
   a one-time cost.  In fact, some providers may already have an entity
   similar to the policy database, e.g. [80211U-D4.01].  To ease
   operator burden it is highly recommended that there be a mechanism
   for automatically populating the EAP server policy database.  Channel
   bindings could be enabled to allow peers to transmit the NAS
   information to the EAP server, but the policy could be configured to
   allow all connections.  The obtained information could be used to
   auto-generate policy information for the database, assuming there are
   no adversarial elements in the network during the auto-population
   phase.

   Channel binding validation can also be implemented incrementally.  An
   initial database may be empty, and all channel bindings are
   automatically approved.  Operators can then incrementally add
   parameters to the database regarding specific authenticators or
   groups of authenticators that must be validated.  Additionally, a
   network could also self-form this database by putting the network
   into a "learning" mode, and could then recognize inconsistencies in
   the future.

Appendix A.  Attacks Prevented by Channel Bindings

   In the following it is demonstrated how the presented channel
   bindings can prevent attacks by malicious authenticators
   (representing the lying NAS problem) as well as malicious visited
   networks (representing the lying provider problem).

A.1.  Enterprise Subnetwork Masquerading

   As outlined in Section 3, an enterprise network may have multiple
   VLANs providing different levels of security.  In an attack, a
   malicious NAS connecting to a guest network with lesser security
   protection could broadcast the SSID of a subnetwork with higher
   protection.  This could lead clients to believe that they are
   accessing the network over secure connections, and, e.g., transmit
   confidential information that they normally would not send over a
   weakly protected connection.  This attack works under the conditions
   that clients use the same set of credentials to authenticate to the
   different kinds of VLANs and that the VLANs support at least one
   common EAP method.  If these conditions are not met, the EAP server
   would not authorize the clients to connect to the guest network,
   because the clients used credentials and/or an EAP method that is
   associated with the corporate network.

A.2.  Forced Roaming

   Mobile phone providers boosting their cell tower's transmission power
   to get more users to use their networks have occurred in the past.
   The increased transmission range combined with a NAS sending a false
   network identity lures users to connect to the network without being
   aware of that they are roaming.

   Channel bindings would detect the bogus network identifier because
   the network identifier send to the authentication server in i1 will
   neither match information i2 nor the stored data.  The verification
   fails because the info in i1 claims to come from the peer's home
   network while the home authentication server knows that the
   connection is through a visited network outside the home domain.  In
   the same context, channel bindings can be utilized to provide a "home
   zone" feature that notifies users every time they are about to
   connect to a NAS outside their home domain.

Internet-Draft                 EAP-CHBIND                  November 2008


A.3.  Downgrading attacks

   A malicious authenticator could modify the set of offered EAP methods
   in its Beacon to force the peer to choose from only the weakest EAP
   method(s) accepted by the authentication server.  For instance,
   instead of having a choice between EAP-MD5-CHAP, EAP-FAST and some
   other methods, the authenticator reduces the choice for the peer to
   the weaker EAP-MD5-CHAP method.  Assuming that weak EAP methods are
   supported by the authentication server, such a downgrading attack can
   enable the authenticator to attack the integrity and confidentiality
   of the remaining EAP execution and/or break the authentication and
   key exchange.  The presented channel bindings prevent such
   downgrading attacks, because peers submit the offered EAP method
   selection that they have received in the beacon as part of i1 to the
   authentication server.  As a result, the authentication server
   recognizes the modification when comparing the information to the
   respective information in its policy database.

A.4.  Bogus Beacons in IEEE 802.11r

   In IEEE 802.11r, the SSID is bound to the TSK calculations, so that
   the TSK needs to be consistent with the SSID advertised in an
   authenticator's Beacon.  While this prevents outsiders from spoofing
   a Beacon it does not stop a "lying NAS" from sending a bogus Beacon
   and calculating the TSK accordingly.

   By implementing channel bindings, as described in this draft, in IEEE
   802.11r, the verification by the authentication server would detect
   the inconsistencies between the information the authenticator has
   sent to the peer and the information the server received from the
   authenticator and stores in the policy database.

A.5.  Forcing false authorization in IEEE 802.11i

   In IEEE 802.11i a malicious NAS can modify the beacon to make the
   client believe it is connected to a network different from the on the
   client is actually connected to.

   In addition, a malicious NAS can force an authentication server into
   authorizing access by sending an incorrect Called-Station-ID that
   belongs to an authorized NAS in the network.  This could cause the
   authentication server to believe it had granted access to a different
   network or even provider than the one the client got access to.

   Both attacks can be prevented by implementing channel bindings,
   because the server can compare the information that was sent to the
   client, with information it received from the authenticator during
   the AAA communication as well as the information stored in the policy
