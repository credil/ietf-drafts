        <t> 
        The IETF 6LoWPAN working group defines IPv6 for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) such as IEEE 802.15.4. This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation. In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-transitive wireless links. The traditional IPv6 link concept and heavy use of multicast make the protocol inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low power and lossy network. This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, addressing mechanisms and duplicate address detection for 6LoWPAN and similar networks.

	<section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

	  <t>
	  The IPv6-over-IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="RFC4944"/> document specifies how IPv6 is carried over an IEEE 802.15.4 network with the help of an adaptation layer which sits between the MAC layer and the IP network layer.
	  A link in a LoWPAN is characterized as lossy, low-power, low bit-rate, short range, with many nodes saving energy with long sleep periods. Multicast as used in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> is not desirable in such a wireless low-power and lossy network. Moreover, LoWPAN links are asymmetric and non-transitive in nature. A LoWPAN is potentially composed of a large number of overlapping radio ranges. Although a given radio range has broadcast capabilities, the aggregation of these is a complex Non-Broadcast MultiAccess (NBMA, <xref target="RFC2491"/>) structure with generally no LoWPAN-wide multicast capabilities. Link-local scope is in reality defined by reachability and radio strength. Thus we can consider a LoWPAN to be made up of links with undetermined connectivity properties as in <xref target="I-D.ietf-autoconf-adhoc-addr-model"/>, along with the corresponding address model assumptions defined therein.</t>

	  <t>This specification introduces the following optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> specifically aimed at low-power and lossy networks such as LoWPANs:
	    <list style="symbols">
	  	 <t>Host-initiated interactions to allow for sleeping hosts.</t>
	  	 <t>Elimination of multicast-based address resolution.</t>
	  	 <t>Elimination of redirects since they are problematic on links with non-transitive connectivity.</t>
	  	 <t>A host address registration feature using a new option
in unicast Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages.</t>
	  	 <t>A new Neighbor Discovery option to distribute 6LoWPAN header compression context to hosts.</t>
	  	 <t>Optional multihop distribution of prefix and 6LoWPAN header compression context.</t>
	  	 <t>Optional multihop duplicate address detection.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>The document defines three new ICMPv6 message options: the required Address Registration option and the optional Authoritative Border Router and 6LoWPAN Context options.</t>


	  <section anchor='nd_problems' title="The Shortcomings of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery">

	  <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> provides several
	  important mechanisms used for Router Discovery, Address Resolution, Duplicate
	  Address Detection, Redirect, along with Prefix and Parameter Discovery.</t>

    	  <t>Following power-on and initialization of the network in IPv6 Ethernet
    	  networks, a node joins the solicited-node multicast address on the interface
    	  and then performs Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for the acquired
    	  link-local address by sending a solicited-node multicast message to the link.
    	  After that it sends multicast messages to the all-router address to solicit
    	  router advertisements. If the host receives a valid Router Advertisement
    	  with the "A" flag, it autoconfigures the IPv6 address with the advertised
    	  prefix in the Router Advertisement (RA) message. Besides this, the IPv6 routers
    	  usually send router advertisements periodically on the network. RAs are sent to the all-node multicast address. Nodes send Neighbor Solicitation/Neighbor
    	  Advertisement messages to resolve the IPv6 address of the destination
    	  on the link. The Neighbor Solicitation messages used for address resolution are multicast. The Duplicate Address Detection procedure and the use of periodic Router Advertisement messages assumes that the nodes are powered on
and reachable most of the time.</t>
	 
<t>In Neighbor Discovery the routers find the hosts by assuming that a subnet
prefix maps to one broadcast domain, and then multicast Neighbor Solicitation
messages to find the host and its link-layer address.
Furthermore, the DAD of use multicast assumes that all hosts that autoconfigure
IPv6 addresses from the same prefix can be used using link-local multicast
messages.</t>

<t>Note that the 'L' (on-link) bit in the Prefix Information option can
be set to zero in Neighbor Discovery, which makes the host not use
multicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages for address resolution of other hosts, but routers still
use multicast NS messages to find the hosts.</t>

	<t>
	In a LoWPAN, primarily two types of network topologies are found - star networks and mesh networks. A star network is similar to a regular IPv6 subnet with a router and a set of nodes connected to it via the same non-transitive link. But in Mesh networks, the nodes are capable of routing and forwarding packets. Due to the lossy nature of wireless communication and a changing radio environment, the IPv6-link node-set may change due to external physical factors. Thus the link is often unstable and the nodes appear to be moving without moving physically.
	</t>

<t>
A LoWPAN can use two types of link-layer addresses; 16-bit short addresses and 64-bit unique addresses as defined in <xref target="RFC4944"/>.  Moreover, the available link-layer payload size is on the order of less than 100 bytes thus header compression is very useful.</t>

<t>Considering the above characteristics in a LoWPAN, and the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> protocol design center, some optimizations and extensions to Neighbor Discovery are useful for the wide deployment of IPv6 over low-powered and lossy networks such as 6LoWPANs.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor='mu_ro' title="Mesh-under and Route-over Concepts">

<t>
	In the 6LoWPAN context, often a link-layer mesh routing mechanism is referred to as "mesh-under" while routing/forwarding packets using IP-layer addresses is referred to as "route-over". The difference between mesh-under and route-over is similar to a bridged-network versus IP-routing using Ethernet. In a mesh-under network all nodes are on the same link which is served by one or more routers, which we call 6LoWPAN Border Routers (6LBR).
In a route-over network, there are multiple links in the 6LoWPAN. Unlike fixed IP links, these link's members may be changing due to the nature of the low-power and lossy behavior of wireless technology. Thus a route-over network is made up of a flexible set of links interconnected by interior routers, which we call 6LoWPAN Routers (6LR). 
	</t>
	<t>
	This specification is applicable to both mesh-under and route-over networks. However, in route-over networks, we have two types of routers - 6LBRs and 6LRs. 6LoWPAN Border Routers sit at the boundary of the 6LoWPAN and the rest of the network while 6LoWPAN Routers are inside the LoWPAN. 6LoWPAN Routers are assumed to be running a routing protocol.
	</t>
	<t>
	In a mesh-under configuration a 6LBR is acting as the IPv6 router where all the hosts in the LoWPAN are on the same link, thus they are only one IP hop away. No 6LoWPAN Routers exist in this topology as forwarding is handled by a link-layer mesh routing protocol.
	</t>
	<t>
	In a route-over configuration, Neighbor Discovery operations take place between hosts and 6LRs or 6LBRs. The 6LR nodes are able to send and receive Router Advertisements, Router Solicitations as well as forward and route IPv6 packets. Here packet forwarding happens at the routing layer.
	</t> 
<t>In both types of configurations, hosts do not take part in routing and forwarding packets and they act as simple IPv6 hosts.</t>
	
	  </section>

	  <section anchor='goals' title="Applicability, Goals and Assumptions">

	  <t>
	  The optimizations described in this document are most useful for route-over and mesh-under configurations in Mesh topologies. However, Star topology configurations will also benefit from the optimizations due to minimized signaling, robust handling of the non-transitive link, and header compression context information. </t>

<t>The document has the following main goals and assumptions
	  </t>

	  <t>Goals:
	    <list style="symbols">
	     <t>Optimize Neighbor Discovery with a mechanism that is minimal yet sufficient for the operation in both mesh-under and route-over configurations.</t>
         <t>Make the host to router interaction the same whether mesh-under or
route-over is used.</t>
	  	 
         <t>Minimize signaling by avoiding the use of multicast flooding and reducing the use of link-scope multicast messages.</t>
	  	 <t>Optimize the interfaces between hosts and their default routers.</t>
	  	 <t>Support for sleeping hosts.</t>
	  	 <t>Minimize the complexity of nodes.</t>
	  	 <t>Disseminate context information to hosts as needed by <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc"/>.</t>
	  	 <t>Optionally disseminate context information and prefix information from the border to all routers in a LoWPAN.</t>
  	     <t>Optional duplicate address detection mechanism suitable for route-over LoWPANs.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>Assumptions:
	    <list style="symbols">
	  	 <t>EUI-64s are globally unique.</t>
		 <t>All nodes in the LLN have an EUI-64 interface identifier in order to do address auto-configuration and detect duplicate addresses.</t>

	  	 
		 <t>The link layer technology is assumed to be low-power and lossy, exhibiting undetermined connectivity, such as IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="RFC4944"/>. However, the Address Registration mechanism might be useful
for other link layer technologies.</t>


		 <t>A 6LoWPAN is configured with one or more global IPv6 address prefixes
to enable hosts to move between routers in the 6LoWPAN without changing their
IPv6 addresses.</t>
		 <t>When using the optional DAD mechanism of <xref target="optional_dad"/> 6LRs either register with all the 6LBRs, or the network uses some out-of-scope mechanism to keep the 6LBRs synchronized.</t>

	
		 <t>If IEEE 802.15.4 16-bit short addresses are used, then some technique is
used to ensure uniqueness of those link-layer addresses. That could be done using 
DHCPv6 or other techniques outside of the scope of this document. Optionally
it can be done using the Address Registration Option based duplicate address detection (Specified in <xref target="optional_dad"/>).
</t>

		 
		 <t>In order to preserve the uniqueness of addresses not derived from an EUI-64, they must be either assigned or checked for duplicates in the same way throughout the LoWPAN. This can be done using DHCPv6 for assignment and/or using the duplicate address detection mechanism Specified in <xref target="optional_dad"/> (or any other protocol developed for that purpose).</t>
		 <t>In order for <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc"/> to operate correctly, the compression context must match for all the hosts, 6LRs, and 6LBRs that can send, receive, or forward a given packet. If <xref target='optional_dist'/> is used to distribute context information this implies that all the 6LBRs must coordinate the context information they distribute.</t>
		 <t>This specification describes the operation of ND within a single LoWPAN. The participation of a node in multiple LoWPANs simultaneously may be possible, but is out of scope of this document.</t>

	<section anchor='overview' title="Protocol Overview">

<t>The Neighbor Discovery optimizations for LLNs are applicable to both 
mesh-under and route-over configurations. In a mesh-under configuration 
only 6LoWPAN Border Routers and hosts exist; there are no 6LoWPAN routers in
mesh-under topologies.</t>



<t>The most important part of the optizations is the evolved host-to-router
interaction that allows for sleeping nodes and avoids using multicast Neighbor
Discovery messages except
for the case of a host finding an initial set of default routers, and
redoing such determination when those set of routers have become unreachable.
</t>



<t>The protocol also provides for header compression 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc"/> by carrying header compression information
in a new option in Router Advertisement messages.</t>



<t>In addition, there are optional and separate mechanisms that can be used between 6LRs and
6LBRs to perform multihop Duplicate Address Detection and distribution
of the Prefix and compression Context information from the 6LBRs to all the 6LRs, which in turn use normal Neighbor Discovery mechanisms to convey this information
to the hosts.</t>



<t>The protocol is designed so that the host-to-router interaction is not affected by the configuration of the 6LoWPAN; the host-to-router
interaction is the same in a mesh-under and route-over configuration.</t>




<section anchor="Optimization" title="Extensions to RFC4861">



<t>This document specifies the following optimizations and extensions
to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/>:


<list style="symbols">

	

<t>Host initiated refresh of Router Advertisement information. This 
removes	the need for periodic or unsolicited Router Advertisements from 
routers to hosts.</t>

	

<t>No Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is required if EUI-64 based
IPv6 addresses are used.</t>

	

<t>DAD is optional if DHCPv6 is used to assign addresses.</t>

	

<t>A New Address Registration mechanism using new Address Registration
option between hosts and routers. This removes the need for Routers to
use multicast Neighbor Solicitations to find hosts, and supports sleeping
hosts. This also enables the same IPv6 address prefix(es) to be 
used across a route-over 6LoWPAN. It provides the host-to-router interface 
for Duplicate Address Detection. </t>

	

<t>A new optional Router Advertisement option for Context information used by
6LoWPAN header compression.</t>

	

<t>A new optional mechanism to perform Duplicate Address Detection
across a route-over 6LoWPAN reusing the above Address Registration option.</t>

	

<t>New optional mechanisms to distribute Prefixes and Context
information across a route-over network which uses a new Authoritative Border
Router option to control the flooding of configuration changes.</t>

	

<t>A few new default protocol constants are introduced and some
existing Neighbor Discovery protocol constants are tuned for LLN usage.</t>


</list>

</t>



</section>




<section anchor="Addr-assign" title="Address Assignment">



<t>Hosts in a 6LoWPAN configure their IPv6 address as specified in
<xref target="RFC4861"/> and <xref target="RFC4862"/> based on the information
received in Router Advertisement messages. The use of the M flag in this optimization is however more restrictive than in <xref target="RFC4861"/>. When the M flag is set a host is required to use DHCPv6 to assign any non-EUI-64 addresses. When the M flag is not set, the LoWPAN is required to support duplicate address detection, thus a host can then safely use the address registration mechanism to check non-EUI-64 addresses for uniqueness.</t>



<t>Optionally, 6LRs can use the same mechanisms to configure their IPv6 
addresses.</t>



<t>The 6LBRs are responsible for managing the prefix(es) assigned to the
6LoWPAN, using manual configuration, DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation 
<xref target="RFC3633"/>, or other mechanisms. 
In an isolated LoWPAN a ULA <xref target="RFC4193"/> prefix SHOULD
be generated by the 6LBR.</t>



</section>



<section anchor='overview_hr' title="Host-to-Router Interaction">

<t>A host sends Router Solicitation messages at startup and
also when it suspects that one of its default routers have become
unreachable (after Neighbor Unreachability Detection towards the router fails).
</t>



<t>Hosts receive Router Advertisement messages typically containing the Authoritative Border Router option
(ABRO) and may optionally contain one or more 6LoWPAN Context options (6CO) 
in addition to the existing Prefix Information options (PIO) as described 
in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>



<t>When a host has configured a non-link-local IPv6 address, it registers
that address with one or more of its default routers using the Address Registration option (ARO) in an NS message. The host chooses a lifetime of the registration
and repeats the ARO option periodically (before the lifetime runs out) to maintain the registration, even while the host
is sleeping.</t>



<t>The registration can fail (an ARO option returned to the host with a non-zero
Status) if the router determines that the IPv6 address is already used
by another hosts, that is, is used by a host with a different EUI-64.
This can be used to support non-EUI-64 based addresses such as temporary
IPv6 addresses <xref target="RFC4941"/> or addresses based on an Interface ID
that is a IEEE 802.15.4 16-bit short addresses.
Failure can also occur if the Neighbor Cache on that router is full.</t>



<t>The re-registration of a address can be combined with Neighbor
Unreachability Detection (NUD) of the router since both use unicast Neighbor 
Solicitation messages. This makes things efficient when a host wakes up
to send a packet and both need to perform NUD to check that the router
is still reachable, and refresh its registration with the router.</t>



<t>The response to an address registration might not be immediate since
in route-over configurations the 6LR might perform Duplicate Address Detection
against the 6LBR. A host retransmits the Address Registration option
until it is
acknowledged by the receipt of a Address Registration option.</t>



<t>As part of the optimizations, Address Resolution is not performed by 
multicasting Neighbor Solicitation messages as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
Instead, the routers maintain Neighbor Cache entries for all registered 
IPv6 addresses. If the address is not in the Neighbor Cache in the router, then
the address either doesn't exist, or is assigned a host attached to some other router
in the 6LoWPAN, or is external to the 6LoWPAN. In a route-over configuration 
the routing protocol is used to route such packets toward the destination.</t>

<section anchor='overview_rr' title="Router-to-Router Interaction">



<t>The optional new router-to-router interaction is only for the route-over
configuration where 6LRs are present. It is optional in this protocol since the
functions it provides might be better provided by other protocol mechanisms,
be it DHCPv6, link-layer mechanisms, the routing protocol, or something else.
Some mechanisms from this protocol might be used for router-to-router, while
others are provided by other protocols. For instance, context information
and/or prefix information might be disseminated using this protocol, while
Duplicate Address Detection is done using some other protocol.</t>



<t>6LRs can act like a host during system startup and prefix configuration
by sending Router Solicitation messages and autoconfiguring their IPv6 addresses unlike routers in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>



<t>When multihop prefix or context dissemination is used then the 6LRs
store the ABRO, 6CO and Prefix Information received (directly or indirectly)
from the 6LBRs
and redistribute this information in the Router
Advertisement they send to other 6LRs or send to hosts in response to a
Router Solicitations. There is a version number field in the ABRO which
is used to limit the flooding of updated information between the 6LRs.</t>



<t>Optionally the 6LRs can perform Duplicate Address Detection
against one or more 6LBRs using a special form of the Address Registration
option. In this case, the Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement messages will be forwarded between the 6LR and
6LBRs and the <xref target="RFC4861"/> rule for checking hop-limit=255 is relaxed. Such multihop DAD messages MUST NOT modify any Neighbor Cache 
entries on the routers since we do not have the security benefits provided
by the hop-limit=255 check.</t>

	<section anchor='message_options' title="New Neighbor Discovery Options">

	<t>This section defines new Neighbor Discovery message options used by this specification. The Address Registration Option is mandatory, whereas the Authoritative Border Router Option and 6LoWPAN Context Option are optional.</t>

	<section anchor="ARO" title="Address Registration Option">
	
	<t>
	The routers need to know the set of host IP addresses that are directly reachable and their corresponding link-layer addresses. This
	needs to be maintained as the radio reachability changes. For this purpose an Address Registration Option (ARO) is introduced, which can be included in unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages sent by
	hosts. Thus it can be included in the unicast NS messages that a host
	sends as part of Neighbor Unreachability Detection to determine that it can still reach a default router.
	The ARO is used by the receiving router to reliably maintain its Neighbor Cache. The same option is included in corresponding Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages with a Status field indicating the success or failure of the registration. This option is always host initiated.</t>

<t>The ARO is reused for the optional multihop Duplicate Address Detection
from 6LRs to 6LBRs, in which case it has a different Length. In that case one 
or more AROs can be included in an NS.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	The ARO is required for reliability and power saving. The lifetime field provides flexibility to the host to register an address which should be usable (continue to be advertised by the 6LR in the routing protocol etc.) during its intended sleep schedule.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	The sender of the NS also includes the EUI-64 of the interface it is registering an address from. This is used as a unique ID for the detection of duplicate addresses. It is used to tell the difference between the same node re-registering its address and a different node (with a different EUI-64) registering an address that is already in use by someone else.
	
	</t>

	<t>
	When the ARO is used by hosts the address that is registered MUST be the IPv6 source
address for the Neighbor Solicitation message. Thus the Registered Address field
is omitted and the Length field MUST be two. When the ARO is used for the optional multihop DAD
between a 6LR and a 6LBR then the Registered Address field is included and the Length field MUST be four.
	</t>
	
	
	<t>
	 When sent in NS messages the ARO MUST be accompanied by an SLLA
option containing the link-layer address of the 6LN that is registering the
address. </t>

<t>The optional Authoritative Border Router Option (ABRO) is needed when Router
Advertisement (RA) messages are used to disseminate prefixes and context information across
a route-over topology.
In this case 6LRs receive Prefix Information options from other 6LRs.
	This implies that a 6LR can't just let the most recently received RA win. 
	In order to be able to reliably add and remove prefixes from the 6LoWPAN we 
	need to carry information from the authoritative 6LBR. 
	This is done by introducing a version number which the 6LBR sets and 6LRs propagate as they propagate the prefix and context information with this Authoritative Border Router Option. When there are multiple 6LBRs they would have 
	separate version number spaces. Thus this option needs to carry the IP address of
	the 6LBR that originated that set of information.
	</t>
	<t>
	The Authoritative Border Router option MUST be included in all Router Advertisement
	messages in the case when Router Advertisements are used to propagate
information between routers (as described in <xref target="optional_dad"/>.

	<section anchor='host' title="Host Behavior">

	
	
	<t>Hosts in a LoWPAN use the Address Registration option in the Neighbor Solicitation messages they send as a way to maintain the Neighbor Cache in the routers
thereby removing the need for multicast Neighbor Solicitations to do address resolution. Unlike in <xref target="RFC4861"/> the hosts initiate updating
the information they receive in Router Advertisements by sending Router
Solicitations before the information expires. Finally, when Neighbor Unreachability
Detection indicates that one or all default routers have become unreachable, then
the host uses Router Solicitations to find a new set of default routers.</t>


		
		<section title="Forbidden Actions">


		
		<t>A host in a 6LoWPAN MUST NOT accept a Redirect message. Redirect
messages are problematic on a link with non-transitive reachability.</t>

<t>A host would never multicast a Neighbor Solicitation message.</t>

		
		</section>


		
		<section anchor='host_interface' title="Interface Initialization">


		
		<t>When the interface on a host is initialized it follows the specification in
<xref target="RFC4861"/>. A link-local address is formed based on the EUI-64 assigned
to the interface, and then the host sends Router Solicitation messages as described in <xref target="RFC4861"/> Section 6.3.7.</t>

		
		<t>There is no need to join the Solicited-Node multicast address since nobody
multicasts Neighbor Solicitations in this type of network. A host MUST join the all-nodes multicast address.</t>
		
		</section>


		
		<section anchor='host_sending_rs'
 title="Sending a Router Solicitation">


		
		<t>The Router Solicitation is formatted as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/> and
sent to the IPv6 All-Routers multicast address (see <xref target="RFC4861"/> Section 6.3.7 for details). A SLLA option MUST be included to enable unicast Router Advertisements in response. An unspecified source address MUST NOT be used in RS messages.</t>

<t>If the link layer supports a way
to send packets to some kind of all-routers anycast link-layer address, then that MAY be
used to convey theses packets to a router.</t>

<t>Since hosts do not depend on multicast Router Advertisements to discover
routers, the hosts need to intelligently retransmit Router Solicitations 
whenever the default router list is empty, default routers are unreachable,
or the lifetime of the prefixes and contexts in the previous RA are about to
expire. The RECOMMENDED retransmissions it to initially send up to 3 (MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS) RS messages separated by at
least 10 seconds (RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL) as specified in
<xref target="RFC4861"/>, and then switch to slower retransmissions. After the
initial retransmissions the host SHOULD do binary exponential backoff of the
retransmission timer for each subsequent retransmission. However, it is
useful to have a maximum retransmission timer of 60 seconds 
(MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL). In all cases the RS retransmissions are
terminated when a RA is received.</t>

		
		</section>


		
		<section title="Processing a Router Advertisement">


		
		<t>The processing of Router Advertisements is as in <xref target="RFC4861"/> with
the addition of handling the 6LoWPAN Context option and triggering address registration when a new address has been configured. Furthermore, the SLLA option MUST be included in the RA. Unlike in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, the maximum value of the RA Router Lifetime field MAY be up to 0xFFFF (18 hours).</t>


		
		<t>Should the host erroneously receive a Prefix Information option with the 'L' 
(on-link) flag set, then that Prefix Information Option (PIO) MUST be ignored.</t>


		
		<section title="Address configuration">


		
		<t>Address configuration follows <xref target="RFC4862"/>. For an address not derived from an EUI-64, the M flag of the RA determines how the address can be configured. If the M flag is set in the RA, then DHCPv6 MUST be used to assign the address. If the M flag is not set, then the address can be configured by any other means (and duplicate detection is performed as part of the registration process).</t>
		
		<t>Once an address has been
configured it will be registered by unicasting a Neighbor Solicitation with the Address
Registration option to one or more routers.</t>
		
		</section>



		
		<section title="Storing Contexts">

 
		
		<t>The host maintains a conceptual data structure for the context information
it receives from the routers, which is called the Context Table. 
This includes the Context ID, the prefix (from the 
Context Prefix field in the 6CO), the Compression bit, and the Valid Lifetime.
A Context Table entry
that has the Compression bit clear is used for decompression when receiving
packets, but MUST NOT be used for compression when sending packets.</t>


		
		<t>When a 6CO option is received in a Router Advertisement it is used to add or
update the information in the Context Table. If the Context ID field in the
6CO matches an existing Context Table entry, then that entry is updated with the
information in the 6CO. If the Valid Lifetime field in the 6CO is zero, then the 
entry is immediately deleted.</t>

		
		<t>If there is no matching entry in the Context Table, and the Valid Lifetime
field is non-zero, then a new context is added to the Context Table. The 6CO is used
to update the created entry.</t>


		
		<t>
		When the 6LBR changes the context information a host might not immediately
notice. And in the worst case a host might have stale context information. For this reason 6LBRs use the recommendations in <xref target="context_management"/> for carefully managing the context lifecycle.
		</t>
		
		</section>


		
		<section title="Maintaining Prefix and Context Information">


		
		<t>The prefix information is timed out as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
When the Valid Lifetime for a Context Table entry expires the entry is deleted.</t>


		
		<t>A host should inspect the various lifetimes to determine when it should next initiate sending a Router Solicitation to ask for any updates to the information. The
lifetimes that matter are the Default Router lifetime, the Valid Lifetime in the
Prefix Information options, and the Valid Lifetime in the 6CO. The host SHOULD unicast
one or more Router Solicitations to the router well before the minimum of those lifetimes (across all the prefixes
and all the contexts) expire, and switch to multicast RS messages if there
is no response to the unicasts. The retransmission behavior for the Router Solicitations is specified in section <xref target='host_sending_rs'/>.</t>

title="Registration and Neighbor Unreachability Detection">


	
	<t>Unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages are sent by hosts to register their
IPv6 addresses, and also to do NUD to verify that its default routers
are still reachable. The registration is performed by the host including
an ARO in the Neighbor Solicitation it sends. Even if the host doesn't have 
data to send, but is
expecting others to try to send packets to the host, the host needs to maintain
its Neighbor Cache entries in the routers. This is done by sending NS messages with the ARO to the router well in advance of the registration lifetime expiring. NS messages are retransmitted up to MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT times using a minimum timeout of RETRANS_TIMER until the host receives an Neighbor Advertisement message with an ARO option. </t>



	<t>Hosts that receive Router Advertisement messages from multiple default routers
SHOULD attempt to register with more than one of them in order to increase the robustness
of the network.</t>


	
	<t>Note that Neighbor Unreachability Detection probes can be suppressed if 
by Reachability Confirmations from transport protocols or applications
as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>

		
	
	<section anchor='host_ns' title="Sending a Neighbor Solicitation">


		
		<t>The host triggers sending Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages containing an ARO when a new address is configured, when it discovers a new default router, or well before
the Registration Lifetime expires. Such an NS MUST include a Source Link-Layer Address (SLLA) option, since
the router needs to record the link-layer address of the host. An unspecified source address MUST NOT be used in NS messages.</t>


		
		</section>



		
		<section title="Processing a Neighbor Advertisement">


		
		<t>A host handles Neighbor Advertisement messages as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, with added logic described in this section for handling the Address Registration option.</t>
		
		<t>
		In addition to the normal validation of a Neighbor Advertisement and its options, the Address Registration option is verified as follows (if present). If the Length field is not two, the option is silently ignored. If the EUI-64 field does not match the EUI-64 of the interface, the option is silently ignored. 
		</t>
		<t>
		If the status field is zero, then the address registration was successful. The host saves the Registration Lifetime from the Address Registration option for use to trigger a new NS well before the lifetime expires. If the Status field is not equal to zero, the address registration has failed.
		</t>

		
		</section>



		
		<section title="Recovering from Failures">


		
		<t>The procedure for maintaining reachability information about a neighbor is the same as in <xref target="RFC4861"/> Section 7.3 with the exception that address resolution is not performed. </t>

		
		<t>The address registration procedure may fail for two reasons: no response to Neighbor Solicitations is received (NUD failure), or an Address Registration option with a failure Status (Status > 0) is received. In the case of NUD failure the entry for that router will be removed thus address registration is no longer of importance. When an Address Registration option with a non-zero Status field is received this indicates that registration for that address has failed. A failure Status of one indicates that a duplicate address was detected and the procedure described in <xref target="RFC4862"/> Section 5.4.5 is followed. The host MUST NOT use the address it tried to register. If the host has valid registrations with other routers, these MUST be removed by registering with each using a zero ARO lifetime. </t>
		
		<t>
		A Status code of two indicated that the Neighbor Cache of that router is full. In this case the host SHOULD remove this router from its default router list and attempt to register with another router. If the host has no
more default routers it needs to revert to sending Router Solicitations as specified in section <xref target='host_sending_rs'/>.</t>
		
		<t>
		Other failure codes may be defined in future documents.

	<section title="Next-hop Determination">

	
	  <t>
	  The IP address of the next-hop for a destination is determined as follows. Destinations to the link-local prefix (FE80::) are always sent on the link to that destination. All other prefixes are assumed to be off-link <xref target="I-D.ietf-autoconf-adhoc-addr-model"/>. Anycast addresses are always considered to be off-link. They are therefore sent to one of the routers in the Default Router List.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  Multicast addresses are considered to be on-link and are resolved as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/> or the appropriate IP-over-foo document.</t>

<t>A LoWPAN Node is not required to maintain a minimum of one buffer per neighbor as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, since packets are never queued while waiting for address resolution. </t>
	
	</section>



	
	<section title="Address Resolution">

	
	  <t>
	  The address registration mechanism and the SLLA option in Router Advertisement messages provide sufficient a priori state in routers and hosts to resolve an IPv6 address to its associated link-layer address. As all prefixes but the link-local prefix are always assumed to be off-link, multicast-based address resolution between neighbors is not needed.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  Link-layer addresses for neighbors are stored in Neighbor Cache entries <xref target="RFC4861"/>
In order to achieve LoWPAN compression, most global addresses are formed using 
a link-layer address. Thus a host can minimize memory usage by optimizing
for this case and only storing link-layer address information if it differs
from the link-layer address corresponding to the Interface ID of the
 IPv6 address (i.e., differs in more than the on-link/global bit being inverted).
	  </t>
	
	</section>



	
	<section title="Sleeping">


	
	<t>It is often advantageous for battery-powered hosts in LoWPANs to keep a low duty cycle. The optimizations described in this document enable hosts to sleep as described further in this section. Routers may want to cache traffic destined to a host which is sleeping, but such functionality is out of the scope of this document.</t>


	
		<section title="Picking an Appropriate Registration Lifetime">

		
		<t>As all Neighbor Discovery messages are initiated by the hosts, this allows a host to sleep or otherwise be unreachable between NS messages. The Address Registration option attached to NS messages indicates to a router to keep the Neighbor Cache entry for that address valid for the period in the Registration Lifetime field. A host should choose a sleep time appropriate for its energy characteristics, and set a registration lifetime larger than the sleep time to ensure the registration is renewed successfully (considering e.g. clock drift). A host should also consider the stability of the network (how quickly the topology changes) when choosing its sleep time (and thus registration lifetime). A dynamic network may require a shorter sleep time. </t>


		
		</section>



		
		<section title="Behavior on Wakeup">

		
		<t>When a host wakes up from a sleep period it SHOULD maintain its current address registrations that will timeout before the next wakeup. This is done by sending Neighbor Solicitation messages with the Address Registration option as described in <xref target="host_ns"/>. The host may also need to refresh its prefix and context information by sending new unicast Router Solicitation (the maximum Router Lifetime is 18 hours whereas the maximum Registration lifetime is 7 days). If after wakeup the host (using NUD) determines that some or all previous default routers have become unreachable, then the host will restart doing multicast Router Solicitations to discover new default router(s) and restart the address registration process.</t>

	<section anchor='router' title="Router Behavior for 6LR and 6LBR">


	
	<t>Both 6LRs and 6LBRs maintain the Neighbor Cache <xref target="RFC4861"/>
based on the Address Registration Options they receive in Neighbor Advertisement
messages from hosts. Note that the handling of ARO from other routers (with Length=4)
is specified in <xref target="optional"/>.</t>


	
	<t>The routers SHOULD NOT garbage collect the Neighbor Cache entries since
they need to retain them until the Registration Lifetime expires. Similarly,
if Neighbor Unreachability Detection on the router determines that the
a host is UNREACHABLE (based on the logic in <xref target="RFC4861"/>), the
Neighbor Cache entry SHOULD NOT be deleted but be retained until the 
Registration Lifetime expires. A renewed ARO should mark the cache entry as
STALE. Thus for 6LoWPAN Routers the Neighbor Cache doesn't behave like a
cache. Instead it behaves as a registry of all the host addresses that are
attached to the Router.</t>


	
	<t>Routers MAY implement the Default Router Preferences <xref target="RFC4191"/> and
use that to indicate to the host whether the router is a 6LBR or a 6LR. If this is
implemented then 6LRs with no route to a border router MUST set Prf to (11) for
low preference, other 6LRs MUST set Prf to (00) for normal preference, and 6LBRs MUST
set Prf to (01) for high preference.</t>


	
	<section title="Forbidden Actions">


	
	<t>A router SHOULD NOT send Redirect messages. Since the link has non-transitive
reachability the router has no way to determine that the recipient of a Redirect
message can reach the link-layer address.</t>


	
	<t>A router MUST NOT set the 'L' (on-link) flag in the Prefix Information options, 
since that might trigger hosts to send multicast Neighbor Solicitations.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Interface Initialization">


	
	<t>A router initializes its interface more or less as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
However, a 6LR might want to wait to make its interfaces advertising (implicitly 
keeping the AdvSendAdvertisements flag clear) until it has received the prefix(es)
and context information from its 6LBR. That is independent of whether prefixes and 
context information is disseminated using the methods specified in this document,
or using some other method.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Processing a Router Solicitation">


	
	<t>A router processes Router Solicitation messages as specified in
<xref target="RFC4861"/>. The differences relate to the inclusion of Authoritative
Border Router options in the Router Advertisement (RA) messages, and the exclusive use of unicast Router Advertisements. If a 6LR has received an ABRO
from a 6LBR, then it will include that option unmodified in the
Router Advertisement messages it sends.  And if the 6LR has received RAs, whether with the same prefixes and
context information or different, from different 6LBR, then it will
need to keep those prefixes and context information separately so
that the RAs the 6LR sends will maintain the association between the
ABRO and the prefixes and context information. The router can tell
which 6LBR originated the prefixes and context information from the
6LBR Address field in the ABRO. When a router has 
information tied to multiple ABROs, a single RS will result in multiple RAs each containing a different ABRO.</t>

<t>A Router Solicitation might be received from a host that has not yet registered its address with the router. Thus the router MUST NOT modify its Neighbor Cache with the SLLA option from the Router Solicitation. The SLLA option is only
used to form the link-layer address to which the router sends the Router Advertisement.</t>


	
	<t>A 6LR or 6LBR MUST include a Source Link-layer address option in the Router Advertisements it sends. That is required so that the hosts will know the
link-layer address of the router. Unlike in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, the maximum value of the RA Router Lifetime field MAY be up to 0xFFFF (18 hours).</t>


	
	<t>
	Unlike <xref target="RFC4861"/> which suggests multicast Router Advertisements, this specification optimizes the exchange by always unicasting RAs in response to RSs. This is possible since the RS always includes a SLLA option, which is used by the router to unicast the RA. 
	</t>
	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Periodic Router Advertisements">


	
	<t>A router does not need to send any periodic Router Advertisement messages
since the hosts will solicit updated information by sending Router Solicitations
before the lifetimes expire.</t>

<t>However, if the routers use Router Advertisements to optionally
distribute prefix and/or context information across a route-over topology, 
that might require periodic Router Advertisement messages. Such RAs are sent using the configurable MinRtrAdvInterval and MaxRtrAdvInterval as per <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section anchor='router_ns' title="Processing a Neighbor Solicitation">


	
	<t>A router handles Neighbor Solicitation messages as specified in 
<xref target="RFC4861"/>, with added logic described in this section for handling
the Address Registration option.</t>


	
	<t>In addition to the normal validation of a Neighbor Solicitation and its options,
the Address Registration option is verified as follows (if present). If the Length field is not 
two, or if the Status field is not zero, then the Neighbor Solicitation is silently ignored. Note that
<xref target="optional_dad"/> specify optional behavior for a 6LBR for other Length field
values.</t>


	
	<t>If the source address of the NS is the unspecified address, or if no SLLA option is included, then any included ARO
is ignored, that is, the NS is processed as if it did not contain an ARO.</t>

	
	<section title="Checking for Duplicates">


	
	<t>If the NS contains a valid ARO, then the router inspects its Neighbor Cache
on the arriving interface to see if it is a duplicate. If there is no Neighbor Cache
entry for the IPv6 source address of the NS, then it isn't a duplicate. If there is such a Neighbor Cache entry
and the EUI-64 is the same, then it isn't a duplicate either. Otherwise it is a duplicate address.</t>


	
	<t>In the case it is a duplicate address then the router responds with a unicast
Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message sent to the source link-layer address (from the Source Link-Layer Address (SLLA) option) of the NS. The NA is formatted with a copy of the ARO from the NS, but with the Status
field set to one to indicate it was a duplicate. In this case there is no modification
to the Neighbor Cache.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Updating the Neighbor Cache">


	
	<t>If ARO did not result in a duplicate address being detected as above, then
if the Registration Lifetime is non-zero
the router creates (if it didn't exist) or updates (otherwise) a Neighbor Cache entry
for the IPv6 source address of the NS. If the Neighbor Cache is full and a new entry needs to be created, then the router responds with a unicast NA sent to source link-layer address (from the Source Link-Layer Address (SLLA) option) of the NS. The NA is formatted with a copy of the ARO from the NS, but with the Status
field set to two to indicate the router's Neighbor Cache is full. </t>	
	
	<t>
	The Registration Lifetime and the EUI-64 are
recorded in the Neighbor Cache entry. A unicast Neighbor Advertisement (NA) is then sent
in response to the NS. This NA SHOULD include a copy of the ARO, with the Status
field set to zero. A TLLA option is not required in the NA, since the host already knows the router's link-layer address from Router Advertisements.</t>


	
	<t>If the ARO contains a zero Registration Lifetime then any existing Neighbor
Cache entry for the IPv6 source address of the NS MUST be deleted, and a NA sent as above.</t>

<t>Should the Registration Lifetime in a Neighbor Cache entry expire, then the router
MUST delete the cache entry. This might result in notifying the routing protocol.
	</t>

<t>Note: If the optional multihop DAD (section <xref target="optional_dad"/>)
is used, the a 6LR MUST NOT create a Neighbor Cache entry until the multihop
DAD is completed.</t>

	</section>


	
	
	<section title="Address Resolution between Routers">

<t>There needs to be a mechanism somewhere for the routers to discover
each other's link-layer addresses. If the routing protocol used between the routers provides this, then there is no need for the routers to use the Address Registration option between each other. Otherwise, the routers MAY use the ARO. When routers use ARO to register with each other and the optional DAD to the 6LBR <xref target="optional_dad"/> is in use, then care should be taken to ensure that
there isn't a flood of ARO-carrying messages send to the 6LBR as each router
hears an ARO from their neighboring routers. The details for this is out of
scope of this document.</t>

	<section title="Neighbor Unreachability Detection">

<t>Just like in <xref target="RFC4861"/> the use of NUD from routers to hosts

also be used between routers, but is not required if an equivalent
mechanism is available, for example, as part of the routing

	<section anchor='border_router' title="Border Router Behavior">

	
	
	<t>A 6LBR handles sending of Router Advertisements and processing of
Neighbor Solicitations from hosts as specified above in section
<xref target="router"/>. A 6LBR SHOULD always include an Authoritative Border
Router option in the Router Advertisements it sends, listing itself as the 6LBR
Address. That requires that the 6LBR maintain the version number in stable 
storage, and increases the version number when some information in its 
Router Advertisements change. The information whose change affects the version
are in the Prefix Information options (the prefixes or their lifetimes) 
and in the 6CO option (the prefixes, Context IDs, or lifetimes.)</t>
	
	<t>In addition, a 6LBR is somehow configured with the prefix or
prefixes that are assigned to the LoWPAN, and advertises those in Router Advertisements as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
Optionally, in the case of route-over, those prefixes can be disseminated
to all the 6LRs using the technique in <xref target="optional_dist"/>. However,
there might be mechanisms outside of the scope of this document that can be used instead
for prefix dissemination with route-over.</t>


	
	<t>If the 6LoWPAN uses Header Compression <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc"/>
then the 6LBR needs to manage the context IDs, and advertise those in Router
Advertisements by including 6CO options in its Router Advertisements so that
directly attached hosts are informed about the context IDs. Below we specify things
to consider when the 6LBR needs to add, remove, or change the context information.
Optionally, in the case of route-over, the context information can be disseminated
to all the 6LRs using the technique in <xref target="optional"/>. However,
there might be mechanisms outside of the scope of this document that can be used instead
for disseminating context information with route-over.</t>

	<section anchor='border_router_prefix' title="Prefix Determination">

<t>
The prefix or prefixes used in a LoWPAN can be manually configured, or can be
acquired using DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation <xref target="RFC3633"/>. For a LoWPAN
that is isolated from the network, either permanently or occasionally, the 6LBR
can assign a ULA prefix using <xref target="RFC4193"/>. The ULA prefix should be
stored in stable storage so that the same prefix is used after a failure of the 6LBR.
If the LoWPAN has multiple 6LBRs, then they should be configured with the same
set of prefixes. The set of prefixes are included in the Router Advertisement
messages as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
</t>

	</section>


	
	<section anchor='context_management' title="Context Configuration and Management">


	
	<t>If the LoWPAN uses Header Compression <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc"/>
then the 6LBR may be configured with context information and related context
IDs. If the LoWPAN has multiple 6LBRs, then they MUST be configured with the same
context information and context IDs.</t>

	    
	<t>The context information carried in Router
	    Advertisement (RA) messages originate at 6LBRs and must be
	    disseminated to all the routers and hosts within the
	    LoWPAN. RAs include one 6CO for each context. </t>
	     
	    
	    <t>
	     For the dissemination of context information using the 6CO, a
	     strict lifecycle SHOULD be used in order to ensure
	     the context information stays synchronized throughout
	     the LoWPAN.  New context information SHOULD be
	     introduced into the LoWPAN with C=0, to
	     ensure it is known by all nodes that may have to
	     decompress based on this context information.  Only
	     when it is reasonable to assume that this information was
	     successfully disseminated SHOULD an option with
	     C=1 be sent, enabling the actual use of the
	     context information for compression.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	     Conversely, to avoid that nodes send packets making use
	     of previous values of contexts, resulting in
	     ambiguity when receiving a packet that uses a
	     recently changed context, old values of a context
	     SHOULD be taken out of use for a while before new
	     values are assigned to this specific context.  That is,
	     in preparation for a change of context information,
	     its dissemination SHOULD continue for at least MIN_CONTEXT_CHANGE_DELAY with
	     C=0.  Only when it is reasonable to assume
	     that the fact that the context is now invalid was
	     successfully disseminated, should the context ID be
	     taken out of dissemination or reused with a different
	     Context Prefix field.  In the latter case, dissemination of
	     the new value again SHOULD start with C=0, as above.

	<section anchor='optional' title="Optional Behavior">




	
	<t>Optionally the Router Advertisement messages can be used to disseminate prefixes
to all the 6LRs in a route-over topology. This is optional because there are likely
to be other mechanisms for such information distribution.</t>


	
	<t>There is also the option to reuse the Address Registration option as a way for
a 6LR to perform DAD (for non-EUI-64 derived IPv6 addresses) against a 6LBR in a
 route-over topology. This is optional because there might be other ways to either 
allocate unique address, such as DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"/>, or other future 
mechanisms for DAD.</t>


	
	<section anchor='optional_dist' title="Multihop Prefix and Context Distribution">


	
	<t>The multihop distribution relies on Router Solicitation messages and Router
Advertisement (RA) messages sent between routers, and using the ABRO version number to control
the propagation of the information (prefixes and context information) that is
being sent in the RAs.</t>

<t>This multihop distribution mechanism can handle arbitrary information from
an arbitrary number of 6LBRs. However, the semantics of the context information
requires that all the 6LNs use the same information, whether they send,
forward, or receive compressed packets. Thus the manager of the 6LBRs need to
somehow ensure that the context information is in synchrony across the 6LBRs. 
This can be handled in different ways. One possible
way to ensure it is to treat the context and prefix information as originating
from some logical or virtual source, which in essence means that it
looks like the information is distributed from a single source.</t>

<t>If a set of 6LBRs behave as a single one (using mechanisms out of scope 
of this document) so that the prefixes and contexts and ABRO version
number will be the same from all the 6LBRs, then those 6LBRs can pick a 
single IP address to use in the ABRO option.</t>



	<section title="6LBRs Sending Router Advertisements">


	
	<t>6LBRs supporting multihop prefix and context distribution MUST include an ABRO in each of its RAs. The ABRO Version Number field is used to keep prefix and context information consistent throughout the LoWPAN along with the guidelines in <xref target="context_management"/>. Each time any information in the set of PIO or 6CO options change, the ABRO Version is increased by one. </t>

<t>This requires that the 6LBR maintain the PIO, 6CO, and ABRO Version Number in
stable storage, since an old version number will be silently ignored by
the 6LRs.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Routers Sending Router Solicitations">


	
	<t>If multihop distribution is done using Router Advertisement (RA) messages, then on interface initialization
a router SHOULD send some Router Solicitation messages similarly to how hosts do this in
<xref target="RFC4861"/>. That will cause the routers to respond with RA messages
which then can be used to initially seed the prefix and context information.
</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Routers Processing Router Advertisements">


	
	<t>If multihop distribution is not done using RA messages, then the routers 
follow <xref target="RFC4861"/> which states that they merely do some consistency
checks and nothing in Section 8.1 applies. Otherwise the routers will check and record the prefix and context information
from the receive RAs, and use that information as follows.</t>


	
	<t>If a received RA does not contain a Authoritative Border Router option, then
the RA MUST be silently ignored.</t>


	
	<t>The router uses the 6LBR Address field in the ABRO to check if it has previously
received information from the 6LBR. If it finds no such information, then it just
records the 6LBR Address and Version and the associated prefixes and context 
information. If the 6LBR is previously known, then the Version number field MUST be compared
against the recorded version number for that 6LBR. The comparison MUST be done the
same way as TCP sequence number comparisons to handle the case when the version
number wraps around. if the version number received in the packet is greater than the stored version number (following <xref target="RFC1982"/> Section 3.2), then the information in the RA is silently ignored. Otherwise
the recorded information and version number are updated.</t>

<t>By TCP sequence number comparison we mean that half of the version number 
space is "old" and half is "new". For example, if the current version number
is 0x2, then anything between 0x80000003 (0x2-0x7fffffff) and 0x1 is old, 
and anything between 0x3 and 0x80000002 (0x2+0x8000000) is new.</t>

	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Storing the Information">


	
	<t>The router keeps state for each 6LBR that it sees with an ABRO. 
	This includes the
version number, and the complete set of Prefix Information options and 6LoWPAN Context
options. The prefixes are timed out based on the Valid lifetime in the
Prefix Information Option. The Context Prefix is timed out based on the Valid
lifetime in the 6LoWPAN Context option.</t>


	
	<t>While the prefixes and context information are stored in the router their valid
and preferred lifetimes are decremented as time passes. This ensures that when
the router is in turn later advertising that information in the Router Advertisements
it sends, the 'expiry time' doesn't accidentally move further into the future. For 
example, if a 6CO with a Valid lifetime of 10 minutes is received at time T, and
the router includes this in a RA it sends at time T+5 minutes, the Valid lifetime
in the 6CO it sends will be only 5 minutes.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Sending Router Advertisements">


	
	<t>If multihop distribution is performed using RA messages, then the routers MUST
ensure that the ABRO always stay together with the prefixes and context
information received with that ABRO. Thus if the router has received prefix P1 with
ABRO saying it is from one 6LBR, and prefix P2 from another 6LBR, then the router
MUST NOT include the two prefixes in the same RA message. Prefix P1 MUST be in a RA
that include a ABRO from the first 6LBR etc. Note that multiple 6LBRs might advertise the same prefix and context information, but they still need to be associated with the 6LBRs that advertised them.</t>


	
	<t>The routers periodically send Router Advertisements as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
This is for the benefit of the other routers receiving the prefixes and context
information. And the routers also respond to Router Solicitations by unicasting RA
messages. In both cases the above constraint of keeping the ABRO together with 'its'
prefixes and context information apply.</t>


	
	<t>When a router receives new information from a 6LBR, that is, either it hears from
a new 6LBR (a new 6LBR Address in the ABRO) or the ABRO version number of an existing 6LBR has increased, then
it is useful to send out a few triggered updates. The recommendation is to behave the
same as when an interface has become an advertising interface in 
<xref target="RFC4861"/>, that is, send up to three RA messages. This ensures
rapid propagation of new information to all the 6LRs.</t>

	<section anchor='optional_dad' title="Duplicate Address Detection">
	
	<t>The ARO can be used, in addition to registering an address
in a 6LR, to have the 6LR verify that the address isn't used by some other host.
However, that isn't sufficient in a route-over topology (or any LoWPAN with multiple 6LBRs) since some host attached to
another 6LR could be using the same address. There might be different ways for the 6LRs
to coordinate such Duplicate Address Detection in the future, or addresses
could be assigned using a DHCPv6 server that verifies uniqueness as part of the
assignment. </t>
	
	<t>
	This specification offers an optional and simple technique for 6LRs and
6LBRs to perform Duplicate Address Detection that reuses the Address Registration
option. This technique is not needed when the Interface ID in the address
is based on an EUI-64, since those are assumed to be globally unique. The technique assumes that the 6LRs either register with all the 6LBRs, or that the network uses some out-of-scope mechanism to keep the DAD tables in the 6LBRs synchronized.</t>


	
<t>The multihop DAD mechanism is used synchronously the first time an
address is registered. That is, the ARO option is not returned to the host
until multihop DAD has been completed against the 6LBRs. For existing 
registrations in the 6LR the multihop DAD needs to be repeated agains the 6LBRs to
ensure that the entry for the address in the 6LBRs does not time out, but that
can be done asynchronously with the response to the hosts. For instance,
by tracking how much is left of the lifetime the 6LR registered with the
6LBRs.</t>

<t>For the synchronous multihop DAD the 6LR MUST NOT add a Neighbor Cache or any routing state entry
for the address until it receives a successful ARO option from the 6LBRs.
Otherwise a duplicate could end up being registered in the 6LRs Neighbor Cache
which would cause a registration from the original host with this 6LR to fail.
The system "remembers" the link-layer address of the host by carrying the 
host's SLLA option in the multihop DAD messages, and that is used to later
deliver the NA with the ARO back to the host.</t>

<t>When a 6LR receives a Neighbor Solicitation containing an Address
Registration option with a non-zero Registration Lifetime and is has
no existing Neighbor Cache entry, then with this mechanism it will
invoke synchronous multihop DAD.</t>

<t>The 6LR will unicast a new Neighbor Solicitation message to one 
or more 6LBRs, where the NS
contains an ARO with the host's address in the Registered Address field, and
the SLLA option that the host included in its NS.
This NS will be forwarded by 6LRs until it reaches the 6LBR, hence its IPv6 hop
limit field might be less than 255 when received by the 6LBR. The 6LBR 
will respond with a Neighbor Advertisement message containing an ARO, which 
might have a hop limit less than 255 when it reaches the 6LR.</t>

	
<t>When the 6LR receives the NA from the 6LBR containing a successful ARO, 
it will create or update the Neighbor Cache entry for the host and then 
respond to the host with an NA, copying the Status field from the ARO it
received from the 6LBR. Note that the 6LR does not create a Neighbor Cache
entry until it receives a successful ARO back from a 6LBR. Instead it uses
the SLLA option of the NA from the 6LBR to reach the host. Thus both the NS and NA MUST carry an SLLA option. </t>


	
	<section title="Special Message Validation">


	
	<t>Due to the forwarding of the above special NS/NA between the 6LR and 6LBR the
hop limit check on receipt MUST be bypassed for such messages that contain a ARO
with a Length field of 4. The receipt of such messages MUST NOT modify any state
on the router with the exception of the DAD table below.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="Conceptual Data Structures">


	
	<t>A 6LBR implementing the optional multi-hop DAD needs to maintain some state
separate from the Neighbor Cache. We call this conceptual data structure the DAD table. It is indexed by the IPv6 address - the Registered Address in the ARO - and
contains the EUI-64 of the host that is using that address.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="6LR Sending a special Neighbor Solicitation">


	
	<t>When a 6LR that implements the optional multihop DAD receives an NS from a host
(the ARO has Length = 2) and the 6LR does not already have a Neighbor Cache entry
for the host's IPv6 address, then the 6LR forms and sends an NS to at least one 6LBR.
The NS contains the following information:
    
	
	<list style="symbols">
	
	<t>In the IPv6 source address, a global address of the 6LR.</t>
	
	<t>In the IPv6 destination address, the address of the 6LBR.</t>
	<t>In the IPv6 hop limit, 255 or a smaller number.</t>
	
	<t>In the NS Target Address, the address of the 6LBR.</t>
	
	<t>An SLLA option copied from the NS received from the host.</t>
	
	<t>In the ARO the Status field MUST be set to zero</t>
	
	<t>In the ARO the EUI-64 and Registration lifetime are copied from the ARO
received from the host.</t>
	
	<t>In the ARO and the Registered Address set to the IPv6 address of the host,
that is, the sender of the triggering NS.</t>
    
	</list>
</t>


	
	<t>When a 6LR receives an NS from a host with a zero Registration Lifetime then,
in addition to removing the Neighbor Cache entry for the host as specified in 
section <xref target="router"/>, an NS is sent to the 6LBRs as above.</t>

<t>A router MUST NOT modify the Neighbor Cache as a result of receiving
a Neighbor Solicitation with an ARO of Length=4.</t>


	
	</section>


	
	<section title="6LBR Receiving a special Neighbor Solicitation">


	
	<t>When a 6LBR that implements the optional multihop DAD receives an NS from a 6LR,
that is an NS that contains an ARO with Length = 4, then it MUST NOT verify that the
hop limit is 255 as specified above. Then it proceeds to look for the Registration
Address in the DAD Table. If an entry is found and the recorded EUI-64 is different
than the EUI-64 in the ARO, then it returns an NA with the ARO Status set to 1 ('Duplicate
Address'). Otherwise it returns an NA with ARO Status set to zero. The SLLA option is copied from the NS to the NA, since the 6LR needs this to
be able to respond to the host.</t>


	
	<t>If no entry is found in the DAD Table and the Registration Lifetime is non-zero,
then an entry is created and the EUI-64 and Registered Address from the ARO are stored in that entry.</t>

<t>If an entry is found in the DAD Table, the EUI-64 matches, and the Registration Lifetime is zero
then the entry is deleted from the table.</t>

<t>In both of the above cases the ARO Status code is set to zero, and
the 6LBR forms an NA with the ARO and with the SLLA
option copied from the NS to the NA. The NA is sent back to the 6LR i.e.,
back to the source of the NS. </t>

	<section title="Processing a special Neighbor Advertisement">


	
	<t>When a 6LR that implements the optional multihop DAD receives an NA from a 6LBR,
that is an NS that contains an ARO with Length = 4, then it MUST NOT verify that the
hop limit is 255 as specified above. If there is no pending ARO from a host for
the Registered Address, then NA is silently ignored. Otherwise,
the information from the 6LBR is used to form an NA to
send to the host. The Status code is copied from the ARO received from the 6LBR to
the ARO that is sent to the host.</t>


	
	<t>If the Status is non-zero indicating an error, then the Neighbor Cache entry
for the Registered Address is removed.</t>

<t>A router MUST NOT modify the Neighbor Cache as a result of
receiving a Neighbor Advertisement with an ARO of Length=4, unless there

	<section title="Recovering from Failures">


	
	<t>If there is no response from a 6LBR after RETRANS_TIMER <xref target="RFC4861"/>
then the 6LR would retransmit the NS to the 6LBR up to MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT

	<section anchor='examples_boot' title="Bootstrapping Example">
	
	<t>The following example describes the address bootstrapping scenarios using the optimized ND mechanisms specified in this document. It is assumed that the 6LN first performs a sequence of operations in order to get secure access at the link-layer of the LoWPAN and obtain a key for link-layer security. The methods of how to establish the link-layer security is out of scope of this document. In this example an IEEE 802.15.4 6LN forms a 16-bit short-address based IPv6 addresses without using DHCPv6 (i.e., the M flag is not set in the Router Advertisements).</t>
	
	<t>1. After obtaining link-level security, a 6LN assigns a link-local IPv6 address to itself. A link-local IPv6 address is configured based on the 6LN's EUI-64 link-layer address formed as per <xref target="RFC4944"/>.</t>

	<t>2. Next the 6LN determines one or more default routers in the network by sending an RS to the all-routers multicast address with the SLLA Option set to its EUI-64 link-local address. If the 6LN was able to obtain the link-layer address of a router through its link-layer operations then the 6LN may form a link-local destination IPv6 address for the router and send it a unicast RS. The 6LR responds with a unicast RA to the IP source using the SLLAO from the RS. </t>
	
	<t>3. In order to communicate more than one IP hop away the 6LN configures a global IPv6 address. In order to save overhead, this 6LN wishes to configure its IPv6 address based on a 16-bit short address as per <xref target="RFC4944"/>. As the network is unmanaged (M flag not set in RA), the 6LN randomly chooses a 16-bit link-layer address and forms a tentative IPv6 address from it.
	</t>
	
	<t>4. Next the 6LN registers that address with one or more of its default routers by sending a unicast NS message with an ARO containing its tentative global IPv6 address to register, the registration lifetime and its EUI-64. An SLLAO is also included with the link-layer address corresponding to the address being registered. If a successful (status 0) NA message is received the address can then be used and the 6LN assumes it has been successfully checked for duplicates. If a duplicate address (status 1) NA message is received, the 6LN then removes the temporary IPv6 address and 16-bit link-layer address and goes back to step 3. If a neighbor cache full (status 2) message is received, the 6LN attempts to register with another default router, or if none, goes back to step 2.  
	</t>
	
	<t>5. The 6LN now performs maintenance by sending a new NS address registration before the lifetime expires.  
	</t>
	

<t>If multihop DAD and multihop prefix and context distribution is used, the
effect of the 6LRs and hosts following the above bootstrapping is a "wavefront"
of 6LRs and host being configured spreading from the 6LBRs. First the hosts and 6LRs
that can directly reach a 6LBR would receive one or more RAs and configure and
register their IPv6 addresses. Once that is done they would enable the routing
protocol and start sending out Router Advertisements. That would result in a
new set of 6LRs and hosts to receive responses to their Router Solicitations,
form and register their addresses, etc. That repeats until all of the 6LRs
and hosts have been configured.</t>

	<section title="Security Considerations">

	<t>
	   The security considerations of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/>
	   apply. Additional considerations can be found in <xref target="RFC3756"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	   This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently
	   protected, for instance using MAC sublayer cryptography.  In other words, model
	   1 from <xref target="RFC3756"/> applies.  In particular, it is expected that the
	   LoWPAN MAC provides secure unicast to/from Routers and secure
	   broadcast from the Routers in a way that prevents tampering with or
	   replaying the Router Advertisement messages.  However, any future 6LoWPAN security
	   protocol that applies to Neighbor Discovery for 6LoWPAN protocol,
	   is out of scope of this document.
	</t>


<t>The multihop DAD mechanisms rely on Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor
Advertisement messages that are forwarded by 6LRs, and as a result the
hop_limit=255 check on the receiver is disabled for such messages. This implies
that any node on the Internet could successfully send such messages. We avoid
any additional security issues due to this by requiring that the routers
never modify the Neighbor Cache entry due to such messages, and that they 
reject them unless they are received on an interface that has been explicitly
configured to use these LLN optimizations.</t>
 
<t>In some future deployments one might want to use SEcure Neighbor Discovery
<xref target="RFC3971"/> <xref target="RFC3972"/>. This is possible with the Address
Registration option as sent between hosts and routers, since the address that
is being registered is the IPv6 source address of the Neighbor Solicitation and
SeND verifies the IPv6 source address of the packet. Applying SeND to the optional
router-to-router communication in this document is out of scope.</t>

	  <t>Changes from -02 to -03:
	    <list>
	    	<t>o Updated terminology, with RFC4861 non-transitive link model.</t>
		<t>o 6LoWPAN and ND terminology separated.</t>
		<t>o Protocol overview explains RFC4861 diff in detail.</t>
		<t>o RR/RC is now Node Registration/Confirmation (NR/NC).</t>
		<t>o Added NR failure codes.</t>
		<t>o ER Metric now included in 6LoWPAN Summary Option for use in default router determination by hosts.</t>
		<t>o Examples of host data structures, and the Whiteboard given.</t>
		<t>o Whiteboard is supported by all Edge Routers for option simplicity.</t>
		<t>o Edge Router Specification chapter re-structured, clarifying optional Extended LoWPAN operation.</t>
		<t>o NS/NA now completely optional for nodes. No address resolution or NS/NA NUD required.</t>
		<t>o link-local operation now compatible with oDAD (was broken).</t>
		<t>o Exception to hop limit = 255 for NR/NC messages.</t>
		<t>o Security considerations improved.</t>
