Internet-Draft               BAP IANA Rules               September 2009


Abstract

   This document specifies the IANA guidelines for allocating new values
   in the PPP Bandwidth Allocation and Bandwidth Allocation Control
   Protocols.


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the IANA guidelines [RFC5226] for allocating
   new values for various fields in the PPP Bandwidth Allocation
   Protocol (BAP) and Bandwidth Allocation Control Protocol (BACP)
   [RFC2125].  BACP is the control protocol for BAP, and is used to
   manage the dynamic bandwidth allocation of implementations supporting
   the PPP multilink protocol [RFC1990].

   The IANA guidelines are given in Section 2.  Previously, no IANA
   guidance existed for such allocations either in [RFC2125] or
   [RFC3818].  The purpose of this document is to allow IANA to manage
   number assignments based on these guidelines in a consistent manner.
   This document also points to [RFC2153] which allows the construction
   of vendor-specific packets and options.


2.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is instructed to create the following registries.  For all
   the registries, new values can be allocated through RFC Required
   [RFC5226].

   IANA is instructed to create a registry for the BACP option values.
   The initial contents of the registry should be as follows:

   Registry Name: PPP BACP Configuration Option Types
   Reference: [RFC2125 and XXX THIS RFC]
   Registration Procedures: RFC Required

   Type     Configuration Option     Reference
   ----     --------------------     ---------
   0        Vendor-Specific          [RFC2153]
   1        Favored-Peer             [RFC2125]
   2-255    Unassigned

   IANA is also instructed to create a registry for the BAP Type field.
   The initial contents of the registry should be as follows:

   2        Call-Response            [RFC 2125]
   3        Callback-Request         [RFC 2125]

   5        Link-Drop-Query-Request  [RFC 2125]

   8        Call-Status-Response     [RFC 2125]
   9-255    Unassigned

   IANA is also instructed to create a registry for the BAP Response
   Code field.  The initial contents of the registry should be as
   follows:

   Registry Name: PPP BAP Response Code
   Reference: [RFC2125 and XXX THIS RFC]
   Registration Procedures: RFC Required

   Value    Response Code            Reference
   ----     --------------------     ---------
   0        Request-Ack              [RFC 2125]
   1        Request-Nak              [RFC 2125]
   2        Request-Rej              [RFC 2125]
   3        Request-Full-Nak         [RFC 2125]
   4-255    Unassigned

   IANA is also instructed to create a registry for the BAP Datagram
   Option Type field.  The initial contents of the registry should be as
   follows:

   7-255    Unassigned

   IANA is also instructed to create a registry for the BAP Link Type
   field.  The initial contents of the registry should be as follows:

   Registry Name: PPP BAP Link Type
   Reference: [RFC2125 and XXX THIS RFC]
   Registration Procedures: RFC Required

   Bit      Link Type                   Reference
   ----     --------------------        ---------
   0        ISDN                        [RFC 2125]
   1        X.25                        [RFC 2125]
   2        analog                      [RFC 2125]
   3        switched digital (non-ISDN) [RFC 2125]
   4        ISDN data over voice        [RFC 2125]
   5-7      Unassigned

   Note the order of bits in this field as specified in Section 6.1 of
   [RFC2125]: bit 0 of the Link Type field corresponds to bit 39 of the
   Link-Type BAP Option.  Also note that bits 5-7 were originally marked
   reserved [RFC2125], but this RFC makes them in principle available
   for allocation.  New allocations are discouraged, however, as it
   would be difficult to assess the impacts new bits might have on
   interoperability with existing implementations.

   IANA is also instructed to create a registry for the BAP Phone-Delta
   Sub-Option Type field.  The initial contents of the registry should
   be as follows:

   3        Phone-Number-Sub-Address [RFC 2125]
   4-255    Unassigned

   IANA is also instructed to create a registry for the BAP Call Status
   field.  The initial contents of the registry should be as follows:

   Registry Name: PPP BAP Call Status
   Reference: [RFC2125 and XXX THIS RFC]
   Registration Procedures: RFC Required

   Value    Call Status              Reference
   -----    --------------------     ---------
   0        Success                  [RFC 2125]

   255      Non-specific failure     [RFC 2125]

   IANA is also instructed to create a registry for the BAP Call Action
   field.  The initial contents of the registry should be as follows:

   Registry Name: PPP BAP Call Action
   Reference: [RFC2125 and XXX THIS RFC]
   Registration Procedures: RFC Required

   Value    Action                   Reference

   1        Retry                    [RFC 2125]
   2-255    Unassigned


3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not change the security properties of BAP or
   BACP.
