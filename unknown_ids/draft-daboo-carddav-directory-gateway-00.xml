                This document defines and extension to the vCard Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV) protocol that allows a server to expose a directory as a read-only address book collection.
            </t>

        <section title="Introduction and Overview">
            <t>
                The <xref target='I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav'>CardDAV</xref> protocol defines a standard way of accessing, managing, and sharing contact information based on the <xref target='RFC2426'>vCard</xref> format. Often, in an enterprise or service provider environment, a directory of all users hosted on the server (or elsewhere) is available. It would be convenient for CardDAV clients if this directory were exposed as a "global" address book on the CardDAV server so it could be searched just as personal address books are. This specification defines a "directory gateway" feature extension to CardDAV to enable this.
            </t>
            <t>
                This specification adds one new WebDAV property to principal resources that contains the URI to the directory gateway address book collection resource.
            </t>
            <t>
            	Note that this feature is in no way intended to replace full directory access - it is meant to simply provide a convenient way for CardDAV clients to query contact-related attributes in directory records.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Conventions" anchor="conventions">
            <t>
                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
            </t>
            <t>
                The term "protected" is used in the Conformance field of property definitions as defined in Section 15 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>.
            </t>
              <t>
                This document uses XML DTD fragments (<xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/>, Section 3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility rules defined in SectionÂ 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name "DAV:".  In particular:
                <list style='numbers'>
                    <t>element names use the "DAV:" namespace,</t>
                    <t>element ordering is irrelevant unless explicitly stated,</t>
                    <t>extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise,</t>
                    <t>extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise.</t>
                </list>
              </t>
              <t>
                When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:carddav" are referenced in this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the strings "DAV:" and "CARDDAV:" will be prefixed to the element types, respectively.

        <section title="Client Guidelines">
			<t>
				Clients wishing to make use of the directory gateway address book can request the CARDDAV:directory-gateway property when examining other properties on the principal resource for the user. If the property is not present, then the directory gateway feature is not supported by the server at that time.
			</t>
			<t>
				Since the directory being exposed via the directory gateway address book collection could be large, clients SHOULD use the feature to limit the number of results returned in an CARDDAV:addressbook-query REPORT as defined in Section 8.6.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav'/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				Clients MUST treat the directory gateway address book collection as a read-only collection, so HTTP methods that modify resource data or properties in the address book collection MUST NOT be used.
			</t>
			<t>
				Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to cache the entire contents of the directory gateway address book collection resource by retrieving all resources. Instead, CARDDAV:addressbook-query REPORTs are used to search for specific address book object resources.
			</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Server Guidelines">
			<t>
				Servers wishing to expose a directory gateway as an address book collection MUST include the CARDDAV:directory-gateway property on all principal resources of users expected to use the feature.
			</t>
			<t>
				Since the directory being exposed via the directory gateway address book collection could be large, servers SHOULD use the feature to truncate the number of results returned in an CARDDAV:addressbook-query REPORT as defined in Section 8.6.2 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav'/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				Since the directory being exposed via the directory gateway address book collection could be large, servers SHOULD use the feature to truncate the number of results returned in an CARDDAV:addressbook-query REPORT as defined in Section 8.6.2 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav'/>. In addition, servers SHOULD disallow requests that effectively enumerate the collection contents (e.g., PROPFIND Depth:1, trivial CARDDAV:addressbook-query, DAV:sync-collection REPORT).
			</t>
			<t>
				Servers need to expose the directory information as a set of address book object resources in the directory gateway address book collection resource. To do that, a mapping between the directory record format and the vCard data has to be applied. In general, only directory record attributes that have a direct equivalent in vCard SHOULD be mapped. It is up to individual implementations to determine which attributes to map. But in all cases servers MUST generate valid vCard data as returned to the client.
			</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
              Servers MUST ensure that client requests against the directory gateway address book collection cannot use excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth etc), given that the directory could be large.
            </t>
            <t>
              Servers MUST take care not to expose sensitive directory record attributes in the vCard data via the directory gateway address book. In general only those properties that have direct correspondence in vCard SHOULD be exposed.
            </t>
            <t>
              Servers need to determine whether it is appropriate for the directory information to be available via CardDAV to unauthenticated users. If not, servers MUST ensure that unauthenticated users do not have access to the directory gateway address book object resource and its contents. If unauthenticated access is allowed, servers MAY choose to limit the set of vCard properties that are searchable or returned in the address book object resources when unauthenticated requests are made.
            </t>
