      <t>
      CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
      networks. This specification provides a simple extension for 
      CoAP, to inform a CoAP server of the maximum time that a CoAP client 
      will wait a response to its request. A CoAP server can use this header
      to ensure that a timely response is generated.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This specification adds a new option Request-Timeout to CoAP. 
        The main purpose is for the client to indicate the maximum time
        that a CoAP client will wait for a response to its request.          
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="just" title="Justification">
        <t>
          It is useful for the client to indicate that the response is required
          to be returned within a certain amount of time. 
          For example, the client could require a response within 2 seconds. 
          This applies to both a Piggy-backed Response and a Separate Response.
          With this indication of the response timeout, 
          the client knows how long it should wait for the response, and it 
          needs to keep the state of the request only for the indicated 
          time. After this period, the request will be given up. In this way, the 
          transmission resource can be saved to avoid the retransmission of requests.
          Also it can avoid that the server wastes resources by sending a 
          response which already exceeds the set timeout of the client.

      Request-Timeout    = 2^T milliseconds
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The value of the Request-Timeout option is 2^T milliseconds. 
      [TBD: keep the spec open on whether the base is milliseconds 
      or 1024s of a second -- the clocks are not going to be that 
      precise anyway, and this might help some implementations 
      that count in 1024s ("mibiseconds") or in whole seconds.]
      </t> 
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="Usage" title="Using the Request-Timeout Option">
      <t>
      This option is used to indicate the maximum time that a client
      is prepared to wait for a response. 
      </t> 
      
      <t>
   The client adds the Request-Timeout option to any request for which it is 
   prepared to wait for a response.  
   The client sets the option to the maximum time that it is prepared to wait.
      </t>

    <t>
   The server interprets this option as the time between receipt
   of the complete request and the time that it generates and begins
   sending the response.  
   The client will observe a longer time interval
   between request and response, as network transit and processing by
   proxies add delays.
   If timing is critical, 
   the client SHOULD consider the possible delays and choose the value
    for the option accordingly.
   </t>

   <t>
   The server MAY apply a lower value to the timeout based on
   local policy.  A server MAY choose to take longer to produce
   a response, at the risk that the client is no longer able to use the
   response.
   </t>
 
   <t>
   In case that the CoAP message is transmitted through a proxy, the Proxy
    MAY reduce the value of a Request-Timeout option
   based on a local policy.  A Proxy MAY add a Request-Timeout
   option if none is present.  The value in the Request-Timeout option
   MUST NOT be increased or removed.
   </t>

      <t>
      If the client does not receive a response within the indicated response
       time, the client MAY consider the request as failed.    
      </t>
      
      <t>
      If the server can't provide response within the required time, a 5.XX
       (Can't provide the data in time) [TBD] MUST be returned. Note that 
       the client cannot rely on getting the response code, because the 
       server might have failed in the meantime.   
      </t>
      <t>
      This option is not used in a response. 
      </t>
      <t>
      This option is "elective".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.
      </t>
      </section>
   </section>
      
   <section anchor="example" title="Example">
      <t>
        This section gives a short example with a message flow that 
        illustrates the use of the Request-Timeout option in a GET request.
      </t>
      <t>
         The first example (<xref target="TimeOutExample"/>) shows that the client wants to get 
         a response within 2048 milliseconds. 
      </t>
