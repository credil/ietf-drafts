Internet-Draft                  punyplus                  September 2009

1.  Introduction
   
   According to the current WG-IDNABIS proposal, which is based on the
   punycode support algorithm, the entries in domain name locations
   should be subjected to a systematic preceding lowercasing without
   later restoration.
   
   This means that uppercases are not supported on an end-to-end basis
   and that uppercased domain names are resolved as if they were their
   lowercase equivalent. Therefore, half of all the characters of the
   world's alphabets are thereby ignored by the IDNA. The WG-IDNABIS
   considers this to be perfectly acceptable. The WG-IDNABIS also
   believes that this does not significantly affect the overall
   "internationalized" domain name usage.
   
   The resulting semantic loss by orthotypographic limitation makes IDNA
   unfit for:
   
   *  a good steganographic use of the namespace (mnemonics, encryption,
      etc.)
      
   *  a direct support of the Semantic Addressing System (SAS) that the
      IUCG is exploring.
   
   This memo documents a punyplus algorithm that fully supports the SAS
   and offers a strictly compliant IDNA option.
   
2.  Discussion list
   
   This proposition can be discussed on the iucg@ietf.org.
   
3.  The Interplus approach
   
   The Interplus is an Internet "better use" architecture. It deploys
   additional layers on the user side in a manner that is transparent
   to the Internet layers' operations. It is in this way that it can
   support extended
   network functions and additional services.
   
   The Interplus architecture includes an ML-DNS (multi-layers domain
   name system) pile. This pile comprises three naming layers:
   
   *  User Domain Names (UDNs) that can be case sensitive full UTF-8
      
   *  Application Domain Names (ADNs) that can be case sensitive NFC
      
   *  Internet Domain Names (IDNs) that comprise alphadecimal (0-Z)
      labels (case insensitive by nature) in using strong (".")
      separators, and a weak ("-") separator between the sub-labels.

   *  empty sub-labels (resulting in a "--" separation) are understood
      as the operationally validated way to support the Internet
      Presentation layer, in which they separate a presentation prefix
      (or suffix) from the naming payload. "xn--" is understood as the
      "extended names presentation" prefix.
   
4.  Punyplus algorithm
   
   The punyplus algorithm is used to convert (back and forth) ADNs into
   IDNs. An option of punyplus conforms to the punycode algorithm and
   does not support uppercases.
   
   To reliably obtain this, punyplus is a strict punycode copy with the
   following optionally removable addition (optional) :
   
   *  it includes the lowercasing. It then accepts or inserts "^" as a
   prefix to the uppercase. It then deals with this insert as a regular
   character.
   
   *  when executing the punycode algorithm itself, it converts "^" as a
   non-ASCII (UMI) upper-case metadata indicator and then handles
   its code point in the regular way.
   
   *  when converting back to non-ASCII, it restores the UMI as "^", or
   deletes it if the next character is restored as an uppercase.
   
5.  Value of the UMI codepoint
   
   There are four possibilities for the choice of the UMI code point:
   
5.1.  To use a DISALLOWED codepoint
   
   This will be transparent to IDNA unaware applications and uncertain
   with
   IDNA2003 applications, but blocked by IDNA2008 compliant
   applications. There is no risk of confusion with a lowercase
   described destination.
   
5.2.  To use an UNASSIGNED codepoint
   
   This will be transparent to IDNA unaware applications and uncertain
   with
   IDNA2003 applications, but blocked by IDNA2008 compliant
   applications. A conflict may result from a further edition of ISO
   10646. Otherwise, there is no risk of confusion with a lowercase
   described destination.
   
5.3.  To use a PVALID codepoint

Internet-Draft                  punyplus                  September 2009


   The code point would be out of regular use sequence, therefore
   signaling a special use. This will
   be transparent to IDNA unaware applications and accepted, but not
   necessarily understood, by IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 compatible
   applications. There is no risk of confusion with a lowercase
   described destination.
   
5.4.  To register a dedicated codepoint
   
   This will be transparent to IDNA unaware applications and uncertain
   with
   IDNA2003 applications, but blocked by IDNA2008 compliant
   applications. There is no risk of confusion with a lowercase
   described destination. A further IDNA update could make that code
   point PVALID and extend IDNAPLUS to all the IDNA users.
   
5.5.  Solution
   
   These possibilities will be submitted to tests and discussion with
   users.
   
6.  Further extensions
   
   The punyplus algorithm will progressively be extended to support DNS
   related security projects, linguistic mail addresses, DNS class
   selection, semantic addressing and Netix (interplus explored
   interapplication system) commands.
   
7.  Multilinguistics section
   
   Multilinguistics is understood as the cybernetics of linguistic
   diversity. This memo enables improved Internet multilinguistic
   support.
   
8.  Security section
   
   The ability to use a larger number of code points that are denied; or
   an additional alphadecimal character in naming (corresponding to the
   "power" sign) that is blocked by all the naming functions, which in
   turn should not
   create security issues for those applications that are properly
   written or
   those interfaced by properly written applications.
   
   The inability to use uppercases dramatically reduces the interest of
   randomly generated or encrypted domain names in access protection
   strategies.
   
9.  IANA section
