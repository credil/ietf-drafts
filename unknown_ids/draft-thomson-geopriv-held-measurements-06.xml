    <abstract>
      <t>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location-related measurement data to a LIS within a request for location information.  Location-related measurement information are observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  When a LIS generates location information for a Device, information from the Device can improve the accuracy of the location estimate.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A location configuration protocol (LCP) provides a means for a Device to request information about its physical location from an access network.  A location information server (LIS) is the server that provides location information; information that is available due to the knowledge about the network and physical environment that is available to the LIS.
      </t>

      <t>As a part of the access network, the LIS is able to acquire measurement results from network Devices within the network that are related to Device location.  The LIS also has access to information about the network topology that can be used to turn measurement data into location information.  However, this information can be enhanced with information acquired from the Device itself.
      </t>

      <t>A Device is able to make observations about its network attachment, or its physical environment.  The location-related measurement data might be unavailable to the LIS; alternatively, the LIS might be able to acquire the data, but at a higher cost in time or otherwise.  Providing measurement data gives the LIS more options in determining location, which could improve the quality of the service provided by the LIS.  Improvements in accuracy are one potential gain, but improved response times and lower error rates are also possible.
      </t>

      <t>This document describes a means for a Device to report location-related measurement data to the LIS.  Examples based on the <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">HELD</xref> location configuration protocol are provided.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="conventions" title="Conventions used in this document">
      <t>The terms LIS and Device are used in this document in a manner consistent with the usage in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>.
      </t>
      <t>This document also uses the following definitions:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Location Measurement:">An observation about the physical properties of a particular Device's network access.  The result of a location measurement&mdash;"location-related measurement data", or simply "measurement data" given sufficient context&mdash;can be used to determine the location of a Device.  Location-related measurement data does not identify a Device; measurement data can change with time if the location of the Device also changes.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Location-related measurement data does not necessarily contain location information directly, but it can be used in combination with contextual knowledge of the network, or algorithms to derive location information.  Examples of location-related measurement data are: radio signal strength or timing measurements, Ethernet switch and port identifiers.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Location-related measurement data can be considered sighting information, based on the definition in <xref target="RFC3693"/>.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Location Estimate:">The result of location determination, a location estimate is an approximation of where the Device is located.  Location estimates are subject to uncertainty, which arise from errors in measurement results.
          </t>

          <t hangText="GNSS:">Global Navigation Satellite System.  A satellite-based system that provides positioning and time information.  For example, the US Global Positioning System (GPS) or the European Galileo system.

      </t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Location-Related Measurements in LCPs">
      <t>This document defines a standard container for the conveyance of location-related measurement parameters in location configuration protocols.  This is an XML container that identifies parameters by type and allows the Device to provide the results of any measurement it is able to perform.  A set of measurement schemas are also defined that can be carried in the generic container.
      </t>

      <t>The simplest example of measurement data conveyance is illustrated by the example message in <xref target="ex-basic"/>.  This shows a HELD location request message with an Ethernet switch and port measurement taken using <xref target="IEEE.8021AB">LLDP</xref>.

      <t>Measurement data that the LIS does not support or understand can be ignored.  The measurements defined in this document follow this rule; extensions that could result in backward incompatibility MUST be added as new measurement definitions rather than extensions to existing types.
      </t>

      <t>Multiple sets of measurement data, either of the same type or from different sources can be included in the <spanx style="verb">measurements</spanx> element.  See <xref target="time"/> for details on repetition of this element.
      </t>

      <t>Use of location-related measurement data is at the discretion of the LIS, but the <spanx style="verb">method</spanx> parameter in the PIDF-LO SHOULD be adjusted to reflect the method used.
      </t>

      <t>Location-related measurement data need not be provided exclusively by Devices.  A third party location requester can request location information using measurement data, if they are able and authorized.  There are privacy considerations relating to the use of measurements by third parties, which are discussed in <xref target="thirdp"/>.
      </t>

      <t>Location-related measurement data and its use presents a number of security challenges.  These are described in more detail in <xref target="security"/>.

    <section title="Location-Related Measurement Data Types">
      <t>A common container is defined for the expression of location measurement data, as well as a simple means of identifying specific types of measurement data for the purposes of requesting them.

      <section anchor="container" title="Measurement Container">
        <t>The <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element is used to encapsulate measurement data that is collected at a certain point in time.  It contains time-based attributes that are common to all forms of measurement data, and permits the inclusion of arbitrary measurement data.
        </t>

        <t>This container can be added to any request for location information, such as a <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">HELD location request</xref>.
        </t>

        <section anchor="time" title="Time of Measurement">
          <t>The <spanx style="verb">time</spanx> attribute records the time that the measurement or observation was made.  This time can be different to the time that the measurement information was reported.  Time information can be used to populate a timestamp on the location result, or to determine if the measurement information is used.
          </t>

          <t>The <spanx style="verb">time</spanx> attribute is optional to avoid forcing an arbitrary choice of timestamp for relatively static types of measurement (for instance, the DSL measurements in <xref target="dsl"/>) and for legacy Devices that don't record time information (such as the Home Location Register/Home Subscriber Server for cellular).  However, time SHOULD be provided whenever possible.
          </t>

          <t>The <spanx style="verb">time</spanx> attribute is attached to the root <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element.  If it is necessary to provide multiple sets of measurement data with different times, multiple <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> elements SHOULD be provided.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="expires" title="Expiry Time on Location-Related Measurement Data">
          <t>A Device is able to indicate an expiry time in the location measurement using the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> attribute.  Nominally, this attribute indicates how long information is expected to be valid for, but it can also indicate a time limit on the retention and use of the measurement data.  A Device can use this attribute to prevent the LIS from retaining measurement data or limit the time that a LIS retains this information.
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Note:">Movement of a Device might result in the measurement data being invalidated before the expiry time.
            </t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t>The LIS MUST NOT keep location-related measurement data beyond the time indicated in the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> attribute.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="RMS Error and Number of Samples">
        <t>Often a measurement is taken more than once over a period of time.  Reporting the average of a number of measurement results mitigates the effects of random errors that occur in the measurement process.  Typically, a mean value is reported at the end of the measurement interval, but additional information about the distribution of the results can be useful in determining location uncertainty.
        </t>

        <t>Two optional attributes are provided for certain measurement values:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="rmsError:">The root-mean-squared (RMS) error of the set of measurement values used in calculating the result.  RMS error is expressed in the same units as the measurement, unless otherwise stated.  If an accurate value for RMS error is not known, this value can be used to indicate an upper bound for the RMS error.
          </t>

          <t hangText="samples:">The number of samples that were taken in determining the measurement value.  If omitted, this value can be assumed to be a very large value, so that the RMS error is an indication of the standard deviation of the sample set.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>For some measurement techniques, measurement error is largely dependent on the measurement technique employed.  In these cases, measurement error is largely a product of the measurement technique and not the specific circumstances, so RMS error does not need to be actively measured.  A fixed value MAY be provided for RMS error where appropriate.
        </t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">rmsError</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">samples</spanx> elements are added as attributes of specific measurement data types.
        </t>

        <section title="Time RMS Error">
          <t>Measurement of time can be significant in certain circumstances.  The GNSS measurements included in this document are one such case where a small error in time can result in a large error in location.  Factors such as clock drift and errors in time sychronization can result in small, but significant, time errors.  Including an indication of the quality of the time can be helpful.
          </t>

          <t>An optional <spanx style="verb">timeError</spanx> attribute can be added to the <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element to indicate the RMS error in time.  <spanx style="verb">timeError</spanx> indicates an upper bound on the time RMS error in seconds.
          </t>

          <t>The <spanx style="verb">timeError</spanx> attribute does not apply where multiple samples of a measurement is taken over time.  If multiple samples are taken, each SHOULD be included in a different <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="mr" title="Measurement Request">
        <t>A measurement request is used by a protocol peer to describe a set of measurement data that it desires.  A <spanx style="verb">measurementRequest</spanx> element is defined that can be included in a protocol exchange.
        </t>

        <t>For instance, a LIS can use a measurement request in HELD responses.  If the LIS is unable to provide location information, but it believes that a particular measurement type would enable it to provide a location, it can include a measurement request in an error response.
        </t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element of the measurement request identifies the type of measurement that is requested.  The <spanx style="verb">type</spanx> attribute of this element indicates the type of measurement, as identified by an XML qualified name.  An optional <spanx style="verb">samples</spanx> attribute indicates how many samples of the identified measurement are requested.
        </t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">measurement</spanx> element can be repeated to request multiple (or alternative) measurement types.
        </t>

        <t>Additional XML content might be defined for a particular measurement type that is used to further refine a request.  These elements either constrain what is requested or specify optional components of the measurement data that are needed.  These are defined along with the specific measurement type.
        </t>

        <t>In the HELD protocol, the inclusion of a measurement request in a error response with a code of <spanx style="verb">locationUnknown</spanx> indicates that the LIS believes that providing the indicated measurements would increase the likelihood of a subsequent request being successful.

        <figure anchor="ex-mr">

        <t>An extension is made to the <xref target="RFC4119">PIDF-LO</xref> that allows a location recipient to identify the source (or sources) of location information and the measurement data that was used to determine that location information.

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">source</spanx> element is added to the <spanx style="verb">geopriv</spanx> element of the PIDF-LO.  This element does not identify specific entities.  Instead, it identifies the type of source.

        <t>The following types of measurement source are identified:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="lis:">Location information is based on measurement data that the LIS or sources that it trusts have acquired.  This label might be used if measurement data provided by the Device has been completely validated by the LIS.

        No assertion is made about the veracity of the measurement data from sources other than the LIS.  A combination of tags MAY be included to indicate that measurement data from both sources was used.

        <t>LLDP messages are sent between adjacent nodes in an IEEE 802 network (e.g. wired Ethernet, WiFi, 802.16).  These messages all contain identification information for the sending node, which can be used to determine location information.

Cellular network also provide overlap between neighbouring sites, so a mobile Device can hear more than one cell.  The measurement schema supports sending both the serving cell and any other cells that the mobile might be able to hear.  In some cases, the Device may simply be listening to cell information without actually attaching to the network, mobiles without a SIM are an example of this. In this case the Device may simply report cells it can hear without flagging one as a serving cell.  An example of this is shown in <xref target="ex-obs-only"/>.

However, the infrastructure provider has no knowledge of Device identifiers, it can only identify a stream of data that is sent to the ISP.  This is resolved by passing measurement data relating to the Device to a LIS operated by the infrastructure provider.

        <section anchor="dsl-l2tp" title="L2TP Measurements">
          <t>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a common means of linking the infrastructure provider and the ISP.  The infrastructure provider LIS requires measurement data that identifies a single L2TP tunnel, from which it can generate location information.  <xref target="ex-dsl-l2tp"/> shows an example L2TP measurement.

          <t>When authenticating network access, the infrastructure provider might employ a <xref target="RFC2865">RADIUS</xref> proxy at the DSL Access Module (DSLAM) or Access Node (AN).  These messages provide the ISP RADIUS server with an identifier for the DSLAM or AN, plus the slot and port that the Device is attached on.  These data can be provided as a measurement, which allows the infrastructure provider LIS to generate location information.

          <t>The format of the AN, slot and port identifiers are not defined in the RADIUS protocol.  Slot and port together identify a circuit on the AN, analogous to the circuit identifier in <xref target="RFC3046"/>.  These items are provided directly, as they were in the RADIUS message.  An example is shown in <xref target="ex-dsl-radius"/>.

          <t>For Ethernet-based DSL access networks, the DSL Access Module (DSLAM) or Access Node (AN) provide two VLAN tags on packets.  A C-TAG is used to identify the incoming residential circuit, while the S-TAG is used to identify the DSLAM or AN.  The C-TAG and S-TAG together can be used to identify a single point of network attachment.  An example is shown in <xref target="ex-dsl-vlan"/>.

    <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>Location-related measurement data can be as privacy sensitive as location information.
      </t>

      <t>Measurement data is effectively equivalent to location information if the contextual knowledge necessary to generate one from the other is readily accessible.  Even where contextual knowledge is difficult to acquire, there can be no assurance that an authorized recipient of the contextual knowledge is also authorized to receive location information.
      </t>

      <t>In order to protect the privacy of the subject of location-related measurement data, this implies that measurement data is protected with the same degree of protection as location information.
      </t>

      <section title="Measurement Data Privacy Model">
        <t>It is less desirable to distribute measurement data in the same fashion as location information.  Measurement data is less useful to location recipients than location information.  Therefore, a simple distribution model is desirable.
        </t>

        <t>In this simple model, the Device is the only entity that is able to distribute measurement data.  To use an analogy from the GEOPRIV architecture, the Device - as the Location Generator (or the Measurement Data Generator) - is the sole entity that can assume the roles of Rule Maker and Location Server.
        </t>

        <t>No entity can redistribute measurement data.  The Device directs other entities in how measurement data is used and retained.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="LIS Privacy Requirements">
        <t>A LIS MUST NOT reveal location-related measurement data or location information based on measurement data to any other entity unless directed to do so by the Device.
        </t>

        <t>By adding measurement data to a request for location information, the Device implicitly grants permission for the LIS to generate the requested location information using the measurement data.  Permission to use this data for any other purpose is not implied.
        </t>

        <t>As long as measurement data is only used in serving the request that contains it, rules regarding data retention are not necessary.  A LIS MUST discard location-related measurement data after servicing a request, unless the Device grants permission to use that information for other purposes.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Measurement Data and Location URIs">
        <t>A LIS MAY use measurement data provided by the Device to serve requests to location URIs, if the Device permits it.  A Device permits this by including measurement data in a request that explcitly requests a location URI.  By requesting a location URI, the Device grants permission for the LIS to use the measurement data in serving requests to that URI.
        </t>

        <t><list style="hanging"><t hangText="Note:">In HELD, the <spanx style="verb">any</spanx> type is not an explicit request for a location URI, though a location URI might be provided.
        </t></list></t>

        <t>The usefulness of measurement data that is provided in this fashion is limited.  The measurement data is only valid at the time that it was acquired by the Device.  At the time that a request is made to a location URI, the Device might have moved, rendering the measurement data incorrect.
        </t>

        <t>A Device is able to explicitly limit the time that a LIS retains measurement data by adding an expiry time to the measurement data, see <xref target="expires"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="thirdp" title="Third-Party-Provided Measurement Data">
        <t>An authorized third-party request for the location of a Device (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-identity-extensions"/>) can include location-related measurement data.  This is possible where the third-party is able to make observations about the Device.
        </t>

        <t>A third-party that provides measurement data MUST be authorized to provide the specific measurement for the identified device.  A third-party MUST either be trusted by the LIS for the purposes of providing measurement data of the provided type, or the measurement data MUST be validated (see <xref target="validate"/>) before being used.
        </t>

        <t>How a third-party authenticates its identity or gains authorization to use measurement data is not covered by this document.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Use of location-related measurement data has privacy considerations that are discussed in <xref target="privacy"></xref>.
      </t>

      <section title="Threat Model">
        <t>The threat model for location-related measurement data concentrates on the Device providing falsified, stolen or incorrect measurement data.
        </t>

        <t>A Device that provides location location-related measurement data might use data to:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>acquire the location of another Device, without authorization;
          </t>

          <t>extract information about network topology; or
          </t>

          <t>coerce the LIS into providing falsified location information based on the measurement data.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <section anchor="unauth" title="Acquiring Location Information Without Authorization">
          <t>Requiring authorization for location requests is an important part of privacy protections of a location protocol.  A location configuration protocol usually operates under a restricted policy that allows a requester to obtain their own location.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-identity-extensions">HELD identity extensions</xref> allows other entities to be authorized, conditional on a Rule Maker providing sufficient authorization.
          </t>

          <t>The intent of these protections is to ensure that a location recipient is authorized to acquire location information.  Location-related measurement data could be used by an attacker to circumvent such authorization checks if the association between measurement data and Target Device is not validated by a LIS.
          </t>

          <t>A LIS can be coerced into providing location information for a Device that a location recipient is not authorized to receive.  A request identifies one Device (implicitly or explicitly), but measurement data is provided for another Device.  If the LIS does not check that the measurement data is for the identified Device, it could incorrectly authorize the request.
          </t>

          <t>By using unvalidated measurement data to generate a response, the LIS provides information about a Device without appropriate authorization.
          </t>

          <t>The feasibility of this attack depends on the availability of information that links a Device with measurement data.  In some cases, measurement data that is correlated with a target is readily available.  For instance, <xref target="lldp">LLDP measurements</xref> are broadcast to all nodes on the same network segment.  An attacker on that network segment can easily gain measurement data that relates a Device with measurements.
          </t>

          <!-- A recent attack on a GSM network shows that an entity posing as an MVNO can gain location information or measurement data from the HLR with relative ease; this information is correlated with the identity of the victim. -->

          <t>For some types of measurement data, it's necessary for an attacker to know the location of the target in order to determine what measurements to use.  This attack is meaningless for types of measurement data that require that the attacker first know the location of the target before measurement data can be acquired or fabricated.  <xref target="gnss">GNSS measurements</xref> share this trait with many wireless location determination methods.

        <section anchor="topomap" title="Extracting Network Topology Data">
          <t>Allowing requests with measurements might be used to collect information about a network topology.  This is possible if requests containing measurements are permitted.
          </t>

          <t>Network topology can be considered sensitive information by a network operator for commercial or security reasons.  While it is impossible to completely prevent a Device from acquiring some knowledge of network topology if a location service is provided, a network operator might desire to limit how much of this information is made available.
          </t>

          <t>Mapping a network topology does not require that an attacker be able to associate measurement data with a particular Device.  If a requester is able to try a number of measurements, it is possible to acquire information about network topology.
          </t>

          <t>It is not even necessary that the measurements are valid; random guesses are sufficient, provided that there is no penalty or cost associated with attempting to use the measurements.

        <section anchor="lying" title="Lying By Proxy">
          <t>Location information is a function of its inputs, which includes measurement data.  Thus, falsified measurement data can be used to alter the location information that is provided by a LIS.
          </t>

          <t>Some types of measurement data are relatively easy to falsify in a way that the resulting location information to be selected with little or no error.  For instance, GNSS measurements are easy to use for this purpose because all the contextual information necessary to calculate a position using measurements is broadcast by the satellites <xref target="HARPER"/>.
          </t>

          <t>An attacker that falsifies measurement data gains little if they are the only recipients of the result.  The attacker knows that the location information is bad.  The attacker only gains if the information can somehow be attributed to the LIS by another location recipient.
          </t>

          <t>A recipient might evaluate the trustworthiness of the location information based on the credibility of its source.  By coercing the LIS into providing falsified location information, any credibility that the LIS might have - that the attacker does not - is gained by the attacker.
          </t>

          <t>A third-party that is reliant on the integrity of the location information might base an evaluation of the credibility of the information on the source of the information.  If that third party is able to attribute location information to the LIS, then an attacker might gain.
          </t>

          <!-- For instance, a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) might prioritize emergency calls that contain location from the LIS when there are too many calls to handle.  An attacker could use falsified measurements to gain -->

          <t>Location information that is provided to the Device without any means to identify the LIS as its source is not subject to this attack.  The Device is identified as the source of the data when it distributes the location information to location recipients.
          </t>

          <t>An attacker gains if they are able to coerce the LIS into providing location information based on falsified measurement data and that information can be attributed to the LIS.
          </t>

          <t>Location information is attributed to the LIS either through the use of digital signatures or by having the location recipient directly interact with the LIS.  A LIS that digitally signs location information becomes identifiable as the source of the data.  Similarly, the LIS is identified as a source of data if a location recipient acquires information directly from a LIS using a location URI.

        <section anchor="replay" title="Measurement Replay">
          <t>The value of some measured properties do not change over time for a single location.  This allows for simple replay attacks, where an attacker acquires measurements that can later be used without being detected as being invalid.
          </t>

          <t>Measurement data is frequently an observation of an time-invariant property of the environment at the subject location.  For measurements of this nature, nothing in the measurement itself is sufficient proof that the Device is present at the resulting location.  Measurement data might have been previously acquired and reused.
          </t>

          <t>For instance, the identity of a radio transmitter, if broadcast by that transmitter, can be collected and stored.  An attacker that wishes it known that they exist at a particular location, can claim to observe this transmitter at any time.  Nothing inherent in the claim reveals it to be false.
          </t>

          <t>For properties of a network, time-invariance is often directly as a result of the practicalities of operating the network.  Limiting the changes to a network ensures greater consistency of service.  A largely static network also greatly simplifies the data management tasks involved with providing a location service.

      <section title="Mitigation">
        <t>The following measures can be applied to limit or prevent attacks.  The effectiveness of each depends on the type of measurement data and how that measurement data is acquired.
        </t>

        <t>Two general approaches are identified for dealing with untrusted measurement data:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Require independent validation of measurement data or the location information that is produced.
          </t>
          <t>Identify the types of sources that provided the measurement data that location information was derived from.
          </t>
        </list>
        This section goes into more detail on the different forms of validation in <xref target="validate"/>, <xref target="locvalidate"/>, and <xref target="corroborate"/>.  The impact of attributing location information to sources is discussed in more detail in <xref target="attribution"/>.
        </t>

        <section anchor="validate" title="Measurement Validation">
           <t>Detecting that measurement data has been falsified is difficult in the absence of integrity mechanisms.
          </t>

         <t>Independent confirmation of the veracity of measurement data ensures that the measurement is accurate and that it applies to the correct Device.  By gathering the same measurement data from a trusted and independent source, the LIS is able to check that the measurement data is correct.
          </t>

          <t>Measurement information might contain no inherent indication that it is falsified.  On the contrary, it can be difficult to obtain information that would provide any degree of assurance that the measurement device is physically at any particular location.  Measurements that are difficult to verify require other forms of assurance before they can be used.
          </t>

          <section title="Effectiveness">
            <t>Measurement validation MUST be used if measurement data for a particular Device can be easily acquired by unauthorized location recipients, as described in <xref target="unauth"/>.  This prevents unauthorized access to location information using measurement data.
            </t>

            <t>Validation of measurement data can be significantly more effective than independent acquisition of the same.  For instance, a Device in a large Ethernet network could provide a measurement indicating its point of attachment using LLDP measurements.  For a LIS, acquiring the same measurement data might require a request to all switches in that network.  With the measurement data, validation can target the identified switch with a specific query.
            </t>

            <t>Validation is effective in identifying <xref target="lying">falsified measurement data</xref>, including attacks involving <xref target="replay">replay of measurement data</xref>.  Validation also limits the amount of <xref target="topomap">network topology information</xref> made available to Devices to that portion of the network topology that they are directly attached.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="uniqueobs" title="Limitations (Unique Observer)">
            <t>A Device is often in a unique position to make a measurement.  It alone occupies the point in space-time that the location determination process seeks to determine.  The Device becomes a unique observer for a particular property.
            </t>

            <t>The ability of the Device to become a unique observer makes the Device invaluable to the location determination process.  As a unique observer, it also makes the claims of a Device difficult to validate and easily to spoof.
            </t>

            <t>As long as no other entity is capable of making the same measurements, there is also no other entity that can independently check that the measurements are correct and applicable to the Device.  A LIS might be unable to validate all or part of the measurement data it receives from a unique observer.  For instance, a signal strength measurement of the signal from a radio tower cannot be validated directly.
            </t>

            <t>Some portion of the measurement data might still be independently verified, even if all information cannot.  In the previous example, the radio tower might be able to provide verification that the Device is present if it is able to observe a radio signal sent by the Device.
            </t>

            <t>If measurement data can only be partially validated, the extent to which it can be validated determines the effectiveness of validation against these attacks.
            </t>

            <t>The advantage of having the Device as a unique observer is that it makes it difficult for an attacker to acquire measurements without the assistance of the Device.  Attempts to use measurements to gain <xref target="unauth">unauthorized access to measurement data</xref> are largely ineffectual against a unique observer.
            </t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section anchor="locvalidate" title="Location Validation">
          <t>Location information that is derived from location-related measurement data can also be verified against trusted location information.  Rather than validating inputs to the location determination process, suspect locations are identified at the output of the process.
          </t>

          <t>Trusted location information is acquired using sources of measurement data that are trusted.  Untrusted location information is acquired using measurement data provided from untrusted sources, which might include the Device.  These two locations are compared.  If the untrusted location agrees with the trusted location, the untrusted location information is used.
          </t>

          <t>Algorithms for the comparison of location information are not included in this document.  However, a simple comparison for agreement might require that the untrusted location be entirely contained within the uncertainty region of the trusted location.
          </t>

          <t>There is little point in using a less accurate, less trusted location.  Untrusted location information that has worse accuracy than trusted information can be immediately discarded.  There are multiple factors that affect accuracy, uncertainty and currency being the most important.  How location information is compared for accuracy is not defined in this document.
          </t>

          <section title="Effectiveness">
            <t>Location validation limits the extent to which falsified - or erroneous - measurement data can cause an incorrect location to be reported.
            </t>

            <t>Location validation can be more efficient than validation of inputs, particularly for a <xref target="uniqueobs">unique observer</xref>.
            </t>

            <t>Validating location ensures that the Device is at or near the resulting location.  Location validation can be used to limit or prevent all of the attacks identified in this document.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Limitations">
            <t>The trusted location that is used for validation is always less accurate than the location that is being checked.  The amount by which the untrusted location is more accurate, is the same amount that an attacker can exploit.
            </t>

            <t>For example, a trusted location might indicate a five kilometer radius uncertainty region.  An untrusted location that describes a 100 meter uncertainty within the larger region might be accepted as more accurate.  An attacker might still falsify measurement data to select any location within the larger uncertainty region.  While the 100 meter uncertainty that is reported seems more accurate, a falsified location could be anywhere in the five kilometer region.
            </t>

            <t>Where measurement data might have been falsified, the actual uncertainty is effectively much higher.  Local policy might allow differing degrees of trust to location information derived from untrusted measurement data.  This might not be a boolean operation with only two possible outcomes: untrusted location information might be used entirely or not at all, or it could be combined with trusted location information with the degree to which each contributes based on a value set in local policy.

        <section anchor="corroborate" title="Supporting Observations">
          <t>Replay attacks using previously acquired measurement data are particularly hard to detect without independent validation.  Rather than validate the measurement data directly, supplementary data might be used to validate measurements or the location information derived from those measurements.
          </t>

          <t>These supporting observations could be used to convey information that provides additional assurance that the Device was acquired at a specific time and place.  In effect, the Device is requested to provide proof of its presence at the resulting location.
          </t>

          <t>For instance, a Device that measures attributes of a radio signal could also be asked to provide a sample of the measured radio signal.  If the LIS is able to observe the same signal, the two observations could be compared.  Providing that the signal cannot be predicted in advance by the Device, this could be used to support the claim that the Device is able to receive the signal.  Thus, the Device is likely to be within the range that the signal is transmitted.  A LIS could use this to attribute a higher level of trust in the associated measurement data or resulting location.
          </t>

          <section title="Effectiveness">
            <t>The use of supporting observations is limited by the ability of the LIS to acquire and validate these observations.  The advantage of selecting observations independent of measurement data is that observations can be selected based on how readily available the data is for both LIS and Device.  The amount and quality of the data can be selected based on the degree of assurance that is desired.
            </t>

            <t>Use of supporting observations is similar to both measurement validation and location validation.  All three methods rely on independent validation of one or more properties.  Applicability of each method is similar.
            </t>

            <t>Use of supporting observations can be used to limit or prevent all of the attacks identified in this document.
            </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Limitations">
            <t>The effectiveness of the validation method depends on the quality of the supporting observation: how hard it is to obtain at a different time or place, how difficult it is to guess and what other costs might be involved in acquiring this data.
            </t>

            <t>In the example of an observed radio signal, requesting a sample of the signal only provides an assurance that the Device is able to receive the signal transmitted by the measured radio transmitter.  This only provides some assurance that the Device is within range of the transmitter.
            </t>

            <t>As with location validation, a Device might still be able to provide falsified measurements that could alter the value of the location information as long as the result is within this region.
            </t>

            <t>Requesting additional supporting observations can reduce the size of the region over which location information can be altered by an attacker, or increase trust in the result, but each additional has a cost.  Supporting observations contribute little or nothing toward the primary goal of determining the location of the Device.  Any costs in acquiring supporting observations are balanced against the degree of integrity desired of the resulting location information.

          <t>This requires an extension to the location object that explicitly identifies the source (or sources) of each item of location information.

          <t>Rather than relying on a process that seeks to ensure that location information is accurate, this approach instead provides a location recipient with the information necessary to reach their own conclusion about the trustworthiness of the location information.
          </t>

          <t>Including an authenticated identity for all sources of measurement data is presents a number of technical and operational challenges.  It is possible that the LIS has a transient relationship with a Device.  A Device is not expected to share authentication information with a LIS.  There is no assurance that Device identification is usable by a potential location recipient.  Privacy concerns might also prevent the sharing identification information, even if it were available and usable.
          </t>

          <t>Identifying the type of measurement source allows a location recipient to make a decision about the trustworthiness of location information without depending on having authenticated identity information for each source.  An element for this purpose is defined in <xref target="source"/>.
          </t>

          <t>When including location information that is based on measurement data from sources that might be untrusted, a LIS SHOULD include alternative location information that is derived from trusted sources of measurement data.  Each item of location information can then be labelled with the source of that data.
          </t>

          <t>A location recipient that is able to identify a specific source of measurement data (whether it be LIS or Device) can use this information to attribute location information to either or both entity.  The location recipient is then better able to make decisions about trustworthiness based on the source of the data.

          <t>A location recipient that does not understand the <spanx style="verb">source</spanx> element is unable to make this distinction.

          <abstract>
            <t>This Technical Report outlines how an ATM aggregation network can be migrated to an Ethernet based aggregation network in the context of TR-25 and TR-59 based architectures. This document provides an architectural/topological model of such an Ethernet based aggregation network that supports the business requirements in TR-058. In doing so it describes requirements for protocol translation and interworking, QoS, multicast, security, and OAM for a DSL aggregation network.

          <abstract>
            <t>A Location Server (LS) is a node in a wireless network that provides GPS assistance data to an Assisted-GPS (A-GPS) capable handset. The handset uses the assistance data to lock onto satellites much faster than if it had no assistance. The assistance data also allows the handset to lock onto significantly weaker signals. That is, it significantly reduces the Time-To- First-Fix (TTFF) and increases the yield. In handset-assisted mode, the LS also calculates the location of the handset using measurements from the handset and the network.
            </t>

            <t>The LS requires the handset to provide true and accurate measurements (and not false ones) in order to calculate an accurate location. The integrity of the resulting location is critical because it may be used by emergency services operators to find an injured person, or to provide value-added services. One example is when the attacker fraudulently gains access to a broadcast that is limited to a particular set of geographically located users. This paper describes a spoofer that deliberately manipulates the measurements in order to deceive the LS into producing its desired location.
