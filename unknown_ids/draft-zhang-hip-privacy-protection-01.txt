 1. Introduction  

    The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [RFC5201] was proposed as a 
    complete solution to address multiple critical issues (e.g., 
    mobility, multi-homing, and security) which the current Internet 
    infrastructure suffers from. In order to achieve this objective, HIP 
    separates the semantics of host identifier from IP addresses by 
    intercepting an " ID "  layer in the middle of the network layer and 
    the transport layer.  

    Compared to other ID/Locator separating solutions (e.g., LISP, GSE, 
    ILNP, etc.), HIP is security-inherent. Each HIP host has a public 
    key pair; the public key is used as the Host Identifier (HI) 
    transported over the Internet while the private key is maintained 
    locally.  

    Additionally, a HIP host also needs to generate a 128-bits long Host 
    Identity Tag (HIT) by hashing its HI. HITs are transported in the 
    common parts of HIP headers and regarded by upper layer protocols 
    (e.g., TCP) as ordinary IPv6 addresses.  

    Before two HIP hosts communicate with each other, they use the HIP 
    Base Exchange protocol (HIP BEX) to verify each other's identity and 
    create shared keying material for subsequent communications. 
    Normally, the HIT and HI of a host are steadier than its locator 
    (i.e., IP address). Therefore, the changes in the location of a host 
    will not be detected by upper layer protocols. 

    In the current version of HIP BEX, the identities (i.e., HITs and 
    HIs) of communicating partners are transported in plaintexts. This 
    caused an identity privacy issue. In many scenarios, a user may want 
    to keep its identity confidential to other unrelated entities. 
    However, by eavesdropping HIP BEXs, it is possible for a third party 
    to identify a HIP host even when the host is attached to different 
    locations in the network. As a consequence, it is easier for an 
    attacker to combine the host's activities to reason additional 
    useful information.  

    The identity privacy issue mentioned here is closely related with 
    the location privacy issues. As illustrated in [RFC4882], the

 Internet-Draft      An Extension of HIP Base Exchange      July 2010 
                       to Support Identity Privacy                       
  
    movement of a mobile host can be detected if any constant 
    information related with the host is detected by a third party. Such 
    information can be a Security Parameter Index (SPI) in an IPsec 
    [RFC4301] header, an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC2462] in an IPv6 
    address that remains unchanged across networks, the home address of 
    a host supporting mobile IP, the MAC address of a mobile host, an 
    identifier of a mobile host adopted in a upper layer protocol, and 
    so on. Therefore, in order to protect the privacy of a mobile HIP 
    host, a comprehensive solution which cover multiple layers must be 
    provided. However, we argue the identity privacy is the most 
    important issue which needs to be addressed in such a solution. In 
    the current HIP BEX, HIs and HITs are the only permanent information 
    transported in plaintext in different HIP BEXs. Although SPIs are 
    also transported in plaintext, the valid period of a SPI is no 
    longer than the associated IPsec SA. Therefore, without tracing the 
    permanent identity of a host, SPIs mean much less for attackers.  

    Based on above concerns, instead of attempting to address the 
    overall privacy problem, the solution specified in this document is 
    focused on addressing the identity privacy issue with HIP, that is, 
    the solution provides protection against the attempts to track HIP 
    hosts by inspecting the HITs and HIs transported in HIP BEXs.

 3. Overview of the Protocol  

    The proposed solution is an extension of BLIND, a framework for 
    protecting the identity privacy of hosts that are identified with 
    their public keys. In our solution, if an initiator of a HIP base 
    exchange intends to protect its identity privacy, it will not 
    transport its HI and HIT in plaintexts over the network. Instead, it 
    generates a scramble HIT, called the blinded HIT, for itself. If the 
    initiator intends to protect the identity privacy of its 
    communicating partner, it also needs to generate a blinded HIT for 
    the partner as well. A blinded HIT is generated by hashing the 
    concatenation of a nonce and the associated HIT.

 4. Protocol Description 

    In order to benefit the discussion, assume there is a HIP host 
    called Initiator which intends to communicate with a HIP host called 
    Responder. The HITs of Initiator are referred to as HIT-Is, and the 
    HITs of Responder are referred to as HIT-Rs. Additionally, the 
    blinded HITs of Initiator and Responder are referred to as B-HIT-Is 
    and B-HIT-Rs respectively. In the discussion of this section, it is 
    assumed that Initiator has got a HIT-R through an out-of-band method 
    before initiating a BEX. Otherwise, it needs to communicate with 
    Responder in an opportunistic mode. The related issues with the 
    opportunistic mode are discussed in section 6.1. Additionally, in 
    this work, Initiator and Responder do not need to know each other's 
    HI beforehand. Such information will be transported in the BEX in an 
    encrypted way.  

 4.1. Base Exchange Extensions  

    In order to distinguish the proposed approach from the ordinary BEX 
    protocol, two control header bits, I and R are introduced. In the 
    HIP packet, I indicates that the HI and HIT of the initiator of an 
    HIP BEX transported in the HIP header are scrambled, and R indicates 
    that the HI and HIT of the responder of an HIP BEX transported in 
    the HIP header are scrambled.  

 4.1.1. Blind Initiator and Responder 

    In the scenarios where the identity privacy of both communicating 
    partners needs to be protected, Initiator needs to generate a blind 
    HIT (i.e., B-HIT-I) for itself and a blind HIT (i.e., B-HIT-R) for 
    Responder before initiating a BEX.  

    In order to achieve this, Initiator first selects a random number 
    nonce, N. Then, Initiator generates a B-HIT-I by SHA-1 hashing the 
    concatenation of N and HIT-I, that is, B-HIT-I=SHA-1(N, HIT-I). In 
    the same way, Initiator generates a B-HIT-R for Responder. B-HIT-
    R=SHA-1(N, HIT-R). 

    An extended BEX handshake is illustrated in Figure 1. In the I1 
    packet transported in the step 1, the blinded HITs of Initiator and 
    Responder, and the nonce, N, are transported in plaintexts.  

    After receiving the I1 packet, Responder needs to calculate an SHA-1 
    hash value from the concatenation of N and HIT-R, and compare it 
    with the B-HIT-R transported in the I1 packet. Note that if the 
    Responder has multiple HITs, this process may need to be performed

                       to Support Identity Privacy                       
  
    repeatedly. If there is no hash identical to the B-HIT-R, I1 packet 
    will be discarded. If a hash value matches the B-HIT-R, Responder 
    sends a pre-generated R1 packet of the associated HI to Initiator 
    (see step 2 in Figure 1). In order to avoid Deny of Service attacks, 
    Responder should not maintain any state information at this step. 
    However, in practice, although it is not recommended, Responder can 
    also select to maintain the mapping from the pseudonym and the 
    associated HI in order to simplify the process of the I2 packet.  

    If Initiator has already got the HI of Responder, it can use the HI 
    to assess the validity of the signature of the R1 packet. Otherwise, 
    Initiator cannot verify the signature of the R1 packet until it 
    gains the HI from the R2 packet. No matter whether Initiator can 
    assess the signature, Initiator generates a symmetric key, KDH, 
    using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and adopts the key to calculate 
    the keying material with the HIT-R and B-HIT-I: 

    Key1=SHA1 (KDH, HIT-R, B-HIT-I, 1), ?

    Keyn=SHA1 (KDH, HIT-R, B-HIT-I, n), 

    Keying material=Key1 XOR ?XOR Keyn. 

    The keying material is then used to generate a symmetric key to 
    encrypt the HI of Initiator. The encrypted information is sent to 
    Responder in an I2 packet (see step 3). Additionally, the I2 packet 
    also contains the nonce which was transported in I1 and the 
    pseudonym which was transported in R1. After receiving the I2 packet, 
    Responder computes a key in the same way as the Initiator. Using the 
    key, Responder decrypts the HIT and HI information of Initiator, and 
    verifies the correctness of B-HIT-I. Moreover, Responder encrypts 
    its HI using the obtained symmetric key and transports the encrypted 
    HI to Initiator in a R2 packet (see step 4). After Initiator 
    receives the R2 packets, it decrypts the Responder's HI. If 
    Initiator does not know the HI of Responder, Initiator can assess 
    its correctness against HIT-R and then verify the validity of the R1 
    packet.  

    Finally, the whole BEX handshake completes successfully. In the 
    packets transported in the exchange, both R and S are set.

                   Figure 1 an extended HIP base exchange 

 4.1.2. Blind Initiator 

    In the many circumstances, only the identity privacy of Initiator 
    needs to be protected. For instance, a client may want to keep its 
    identity untraceable to any third party while the server which the 
    client tries to communicate with intends to eliminate the overhead 
    introduced by encrypting its HIT and HI. In this case, the client 
    only needs to generate a blind HIT for itself before initiating a 
    BEX. The process of generating B-HIT-I is as same as what is 
    illustrated in section 4.1.1. Then Initiator sends an I1 packet to 
    Responder (see step 1 in Figure 2). The packet consists of B-HIT-I, 
    the actual HIT of Responder (HIT-R), and the nonce used in 
    generating B-HIT-I. After receiving I1, Responder sends back 
    Initiator a R1 packet (see step 2). The process of generating the R1 
    packet is identical to the ordinary BEX. Upon receiving R1, 
    Initiator verifies the validity of R1 and calculates the keying 
    material in the same way illustrated in section 4.1.1. In addition, 
    Initiator encrypts its HI using a key derived from the keying 
    material and transports the encrypted information in I2 (see step 3). 
    Therefore, after receiving I2, Responder can compute a symmetric key 
    to verify the correctness of B-HIT-I. The symmetric key is also used 
    to calculate the HMAC of the R2 packet. Therefore, by verifying the 
    HMAC of R2, Initiator can prove that Responder has shared a 
    symmetric key with it. In this exchange, only the control flag I is 
    set.

                   Figure 2 an extended HIP base exchange 

    Typically, an Initiator can decide whether to protect its identity 
    privacy according to its local policy. Before initiating a HIP 
    exchange, the Initiator can also attempt to learn whether the 
    responder intends to protect its identity privacy (e.g., from 
    resolution systems or referrers). However, if there is no trustable 
    method for an initiator to learn the privacy protecting policies of 
    its communicating partner in advance, the initiator should carry out 
    BEX in the way described in section 4.1.1. Otherwise, if the 
    initiator uncovers the HIT or HI of Responder in I1, there is no 
    opportunity left for the responder to decide whether to protect its 
    identity privacy. When receiving such an I1 packet, the responder 
    can select to 1) drop the packet directly if it does not support the 
    extended HIP BEX, 2) carry out the handshake with the initiator in 
    the way illustrated in the above section if it supports the extended 
    HIP BEX and prefers to protect its identity privacy, or 3) send a 
    notify back if it supports the extended HIP BEX and does not intend 
    to protect its identity privacy. In the third case, the notify 
    packet is used to illustrate its identity privacy protecting 
    policies. In the notify packet, the responder can proactively 
    disclose its HIT. Therefore, after receiving the notify packet, the 
    initiator can decide whether to restart a new HIP BEX. 

 4.1.3. Blind Responder  

    In the circumstance where an initiator which does not intend to 
    protect its identity privacy attempts to contact another host which 
    intends to protect its identity privacy, the initiator can only 
    scramble the HIT of the responder and transport its own HIT in 
    plaintext.  

    Figure 3 illustrates such a HIP BEX between Initiator and Responder. 
    In the first step, Initiator sends HIT-I, B-HIT-R, and the nonce 
    used to generate B-HIT-R in R1 to Responder. After receiving I1, 
    Responder tries to find out the associated HI using the method 
    indicated in section 4.1.1. If the HI is found, Responder then sends 
    a pre-generated R1 packet of the associated HI back to Initiator 
    (see step 2). In R1, B-HIT-R is encapsulated. After calculating the 
    puzzle, Initiator sends an I2 packet back to Responder (see step 3). 
    In step 4, responder sends its HI in the encapsulated part of R2 
    packet to Initiator.

 4.2. UPDATE Extensions 

    After two hosts achieve a HIP BEX, they may also need to change 
    their SPIs or HITs for certain reasons. Such information can be 
    transported in update packets. Because the confidentiality of SPIs 
    and HITs needs to be protected, such information should be 
    transported in an encrypted way. 

    Additionally, according to different security requirement, the hosts 
    changing its IP address also needs to select a new nonce to generate 
    new scramble HIT(s). The nonce and scrambled are used in the HIP 
    header. The associated flags are set as well. For instance, if the 
    identity privacy of both communicating parties needs to be protected, 
    a new pair of scramble HITs need to be generated. The new pair of 
    scrambled HITs and the nonce are transported within the packet 
    header. After receiving the packet, the receiver needs to first find 
    out the associate private HITs and then locate the proper keys to 
    verify the signature and decrypt the SPIs.  

 4.3. CLOSE 

    When an existing HIP association is no longer needed, it can be closed 
    using closing mechanism defined in [RFC5201].

 5. Packet Formats 

 5.1. Control Header Flags 

    In order to distinguish the packets in extended BEX from those in 
    ordinary BEX, two control header flags are defined here: 

          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

          | | | | | | | | | | | | | |I|R| | 

          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

    I: if this bit is set to 1, the initiator's HIT transported in the 
    packet is scrambled, and the HI in this packet is encrypted. 
    Otherwise, the initiator's HIT and HI are transported within the 
    common part of the packet header in an unencrypted way. 

    R: if this bit is set to 1, the responder's HIT transported in the 
    packet is scrambled, and the HI in this packet is encrypted. 
    Otherwise, the responder's HIT and HI are transported without 
    encryption. Note that in opportunistic mode, this flag in an I1 
    packet only indicate the initiator support scrambled HITs.   

 6. Applicability Consideration 

 6.1. Opportunistic Base Exchange 

    When an Initiator does not know the HIT of its communicating partner 
    beforehand, it can try to initiate the handshaking in the 
    opportunistic mode. 

    If the initiator intends to protect its identity privacy, it can 
    send its blind HIT and the associated nonce in an I1 packet to the 
    responder. Both the I and R flag in the I1 packet are set. If the 
    responder would like to protect its identity privacy, it can use the 
    nonce to generate a blind HIT and send it back in a R1 packet. The 
    operations of both communicating partner in the rest of the 
    handshaking is identical to what is described in section 4.1.1. 

    If the initiator does not want to protect its identity privacy, it 
    can send its plain HIT in an I1 packet to the responder. The R flag 
    in the I1 packet can be set to indicate that the initiator supports 
    scrambled HITs. If the responder would like to protect its identity 
    privacy, it can choose a nonce and use it to generate a blind HIT 
    for itself. Both the blind HIT and the nonce are sent back in a R1

    packet. The operations of both communicating partner in the rest of 
    the handshaking is identical to what is described in section 4.1.3. 

    In the both cases above, if the responder supports scrambled HITs 
    but does not want to protect its identity privacy, it can just send 
    its plain HIT in the R1 packet and unset the R flag. 

 6.2. Comparison of Disposable Identities vs. Blind 

    During the design of the proposed approach, the solutions using 
    ephemeral identities are also considered. A host can attempt to 
    prevent itself from being tracked by using different HIs in 
    different BEXs. However, some upper layer server applications may 
    use HIs or HITs to identify hosts. When a host uses ephemeral HI, it 
    may be difficult for the applications to find proper state to 
    provide service correctly.  

    Additionally, it is difficult for a responder to use ephemeral HI to 
    protect its identity, as the initiator normally need to know the 
    responder's HIT to initiate a HIP BEX. 

 6.3. HIP-based Middleboxes 

    Currently, there is only a type of middlebox (RVS) specified in the 
    HIP architecture. Our solution introduces additional overheads to a 
    RVS but will not damage its functionality. When a RVS received an I1 
    packet containing a blind HIT of the responder, the RVS has to use 
    the nonce to find out the associated HIT. Considering the large 
    number of the HITs that a RVS may hold, an Initiator can select to 
    disclose some bites of the plain HIT of the responder to reduce the 
    overhead imposed on the RVS.  

 6.4. Immediate Carriage and Conveyance of Upper-layer Protocol 

    If a host receives a hiccups based packet, it must respond with an 
    R1 as described in [CAM10]. 

 7. Security Considerations 

    Our solution should be a component of a multi-layer privacy 
    protection solution. Although the confidentiality of consistent 
    information transported in higher layer protocol can be protected by 
    the key derived from HIP BEX, one still have to carefully avoid the 
    consistent information transported below HIP layer to be disclosed 
    to adversaries. For instance, an attacker may identify the FQDN of a

    host.  

    In addition, our privacy extension may be incompatible with HIP 
    based firewalls [RFC5207], relay servers [RFC5770], and other 
    authentication service provided by middle boxes [HEE09]. 

 8. IANA Considerations 

    No such considerations.
