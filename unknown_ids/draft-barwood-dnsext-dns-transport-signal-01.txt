1.  Introduction

DNS clients are currently unable to efficiently determine which
DNS transport protocols a DNS server supports.

DNS clients may try each protocol in turn, but this is an undesirable
waste of resources and time, especially as multiple probes have to be
sent to take account of packet loss.

Even for the current protocols, TCP and UDP, a client may prefer to use
TCP for security reasons, but may not be willing to wait for the TCP
connection to fail where the server does not support TCP.

It is expected that new optional protocols may be added in
future, for example SCTP or a new special purpose protocol.

Therefore a new resource record type, TPORT is proposed.

Note: throughout this document, "protocol" refers to a means by which
DNS messages are conveyed, not the underlying protocol, although the
distinction is subtle for the current protocols. New DNS transport
protocols should have names that make this distinction clear, and
there may be distinct DNS transport protocls operating over the same
underlying protocol, for example over UDP.

2. TPORT Resource record format

The RDATA wire format is a list of one or more 8-bit numbers that
identify DNS transport protocols.

The RDATA presentation format is a list of one or more protocol
mnenomics. If the mnemonic is not known, the decimal number for the
DNS transport protocol may be used instead, as specified in the IANA
considerations, section 5.

Example:

NS1.EXAMPLE.NET.  3600 TPORT UDP TCP

3. Protocol

The TPORT record for a domain, if it exists, SHOULD be added to the
Additional Section of a DNS response whenever an A or AAAA record for
the domain is sent.

In particular, a parent zone with a glue A or AAAA record may also have
a glue TPORT record. If the parent zone does not support the TPORT
record, or there is no facility for the domain owner to upload a TPORT
record to the parent zone, the method described in Appendix A may be
used instead.

The TPORT, A and AAAA records SHOULD have the same TTL, and can be
considered to form a single logical, consistent RRset that is divided
into distinct RRtypes for historical reasons.

DNS clients SHOULD use the TPORT information to select the most suitable
protocol to use. Clients MAY fall back to another protocol if an
advertised protocol fails, but should take account of the security

implications, if the fallback protocol is less secure.

The absence of a protocol indicates that clients SHOULD NOT use a
protocol for that name server, however if no TPORT record is available,
no inferences can be made.

The order in which the protocols are listed has no significance.

4.  Security Considerations

Until server support for a new DNS transport protocol is universal,
there is a risk that a server may be downgraded after a protocol has
been advertised, resulting in a lame server. The risk is higher where
in-zone secondary servers are used that are not under the direct control
of the domain owner, and no reliable change notification mechanism is in
place. Domain owners may avoid this risk by using out-of-zone name
server names where they do not have direct control of the servers,
however this is not desirable in some cases. Domain owners should
carefully weigh the advantages of a new protocol against this risk.
Domain owners should conduct regular checks for lameness to mitigate the
risk.

New transport protocols may have different or unforseen security risks.
Otherwise, this specification is not believed to directly cause any
new security problems.

5.  IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to The TPORT resource record type, and a sub-registry
for DNS transport protocols, initialized to

TCP                1     [RFC1035]
UDP                2     [RFC1035]

Numbers 250 to 255 are reserved for private use.

Appendix A. Name server name encoding

It may take some time for the TPORT record to be universally supported.
In the interim period, TPORT information may be encoded into a name
server name.

The convention is that the name server name contains a label starting
with 'TPORT-', followed by a list of one or more protocol mnemomics
separated by '-'.  

For example

EXAMPLE.COM. 3600 NS A.TPORT-TCP-UDP.EXAMPLE.NET.

indicates that the name server for EXAMPLE.COM has support for
TCP and UDP.

This method is far from ideal, and is intended mainly for early adopters
to experiment with this technology. It does however offer the potential
for better security. Operators are reminded that correct procedures need
to be followed when changing the name servers for a domain.
