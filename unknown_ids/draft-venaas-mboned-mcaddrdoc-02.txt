                 Multicast Addresses for Documentation
                  draft-venaas-mboned-mcaddrdoc-02.txt

Abstract

   This document discusses which multicast addresses should be used for
   documentation purposes and reserves IPv6 multicast addresses for such
   use.  Some multicast addresses are derived from AS numbers or unicast
   addresses.  This document also explains how these can be used for
   documentation purposes by deriving them from AS numbers and unicast
   addresses that are reserved for such purposes.

1.  Introduction

   It is often useful in documentation, IETF documents, etc., to provide
   examples containing IP multicast addresses.  To prevent conflicts or
   confusion, one should avoid using multicast addresses that may be in
   actual use.  For unicast there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   reserved for this purpose, see [RFC5737] and [RFC3849] respectively.
   There are IPv4 multicast addresses reserved for this purpose, and
   this document reserves such IPv6 multicast addresses.

   There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
   numbers or unicast addresses.  For examples where such addresses are
   desired, one should derive them from the AS numbers and unicast
   addresses reserved for documentation purposes.  This document also
   discusses the use of these.

2.  Documentation IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses

   For documentation where examples of general purpose multicast
   addresses are needed, one should use multicast addresses that never
   will be assigned or in actual use.  There is a risk that addresses
   used in examples may accidentally be used.  It is then important that
   the same addresses are not used by other multicast applications or
   services.  It may also be beneficial to filter out such addresses
   from multicast signalling and multicast data sent to such addresses.

   The IPv4 multicast addresses allocated for documentation purposes are
   233.252.0.0 - 233.252.0.255 (233.252.0.0/24).  The IPv6 multicast
   addresses allocated for documentation purposes are TBD.

3.  Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses

   Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses [RFC2365] are
   reserved for scoped multicast.  They can be used within a site or an
   organization.  Apart from a small set of scope relative addresses,
   these addresses are not assigned.  There are no specific scoped
   addresses available for documentation purposes.  Except for examples
   detailing the use of scoped multicast, one should avoid using them.

4.  GLOP multicast addresses

   GLOP [RFC3180] is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast group
   addresses from 16 bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP addresses
   are desired, the addresses should be derived from the AS numbers
   reserved for documentation use.  See [RFC5398].

5.  Unicast prefix based multicast addresses

   IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes.
   The two ways currently defined are unicast-prefix based addresses
   [RFC3306] and Embedded-RP addresses [RFC3956].  There is also a
   proposal for doing this with IPv4
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-ipv4-uni-based-mcast].  For examples where these
   types of addresses are desired, the addresses should be derived from
   the unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes.  For IPv4,
   see [RFC5737].  For IPv6, see [RFC3849].

6.  Security Considerations

   The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes
   has no impact on security.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a set of IPv6 multicast addresses of
   "variable scope" for documentation purposes.  The set should be a /96
   prefix of the form FF0X:...
