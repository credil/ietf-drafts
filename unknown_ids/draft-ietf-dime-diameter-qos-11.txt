Abstract

   This document describes the framework, messages and procedures for
   the Diameter Quality of Service (QoS) application.  The Diameter QoS
   application allows network elements to interact with Diameter servers
   when allocating QoS resources in the network.  In particular, two
   modes of operation -- Pull and Push -- are defined.

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the framework, messages and procedures for
   the Diameter Quality of Service (QoS) Application.  The Diameter QoS
   Application allows Network Elements (NEs) to interact with Diameter
   servers when allocating QoS resources in the network.

   Two modes of operation are defined.  In the first, called "Pull"
   mode, the network element requests QoS authorization from the
   Diameter server based on some trigger (such as a QoS signaling
   protocol) that arrives along the data path.  In the second, called
   "Push" mode, the Diameter server pro-actively sends a command to the
   network element(s) to install QoS authorization state.  This could be
   triggered, for instance, by off-path signaling such as Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] call control.

   A set of command codes is specified that allows a single Diameter QoS
   application server to support both Pull and Push modes based on the
   requirements of network technologies, deployment scenarios and end-
   host capabilities.  In conjunction with parameters defined in the
   documents "Quality of Service Attributes for Diameter"
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes] and "Quality of Service Parameters for
   Usage with the AAA Framework" [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters], this
   note depicts the basic call flow procedures used to establish, modify
   and terminate a Diameter QoS application session.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used in this document:

   AAA Cloud
      An infrastructure of AAA entities (clients, agents, servers)
      communicating via a AAA protocol over trusted, secure connections.
      It offers authentication, authorization and accounting services to
      applications in flexible local and roaming scenarios.  Diameter
      [RFC3588] and RADIUS [RFC2865] are both widely deployed AAA
      protocols.

   Application Endpoint (AppE)
      An Application Endpoint is an entity in an end-user device that
      exchanges signaling messages with Application Servers (see below)
      or directly with other Application Endpoints.  Based on the result
      of this signaling, the Endpoint may make a request for QoS from
      the network.  For example, a SIP User Agent is one kind of
      Application Endpoint.

   Application Server (AppS)
      An Application Server is an entity that exchanges signaling
      messages with an Application Endpoint (see above).  It may be a
      source of authorization for QoS-enhanced application flows.  For
      example, a SIP server is one kind of Application Server.

   Authorizing Entity (AE)
      The Authorizing Entity is a Diameter server that supports the QoS
      application.  It is responsible for authorizing QoS requests for a
      particular application flow or aggregate.  The Authorizing Entity
      may be a standalone entity or may be integrated with an
      Application Server and may be co-located with a subscriber
      database.  This entity corresponds to the Policy Decision Point
      (PDP) [RFC2753].

   Network Element (NE)
      A QoS aware router that acts as a Diameter client for the QoS
      application.  This entity triggers the protocol interaction for
      the Pull mode, and it is the recipient of QoS information in the
      Push mode.  The Network Element corresponds to the Policy
      Enforcement Point (PEP) [RFC2753].

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


   Pull Mode
      In this mode, the QoS authorization process is invoked by the QoS
      reservation request received from the Application Endpoint.  The
      Network Element then requests the QoS authorization decision from
      the Authorizing Entity.

   Push Mode
      In this mode, the QoS authorization process is invoked by the
      request from Application Server or local policies in the
      Authorizing Entity.  The Authorizing Entity then installs the QoS
      authorization decision to the Network Element directly.

   Resource Requesting Entity (RRE)
      A Resource Requesting Entity is a logical entity that supports the
      protocol interaction for QoS resources.  The RRE resides in the
      end-host and is able to communicate with peer logical entities in
      an Authorizing Entity or a Network Element to trigger the QoS
      authorization process.

3.  Framework

   The Diameter QoS application runs between a NE (acting as a Diameter
   client) and the resource AE (acting as a Diameter server).  A high-
   level picture of the resulting architecture is shown in Figure 1.

       |      |   |  Client) |   |      |    Flow
       +------+   +----------+   +------+

               Figure 1: An Architecture Supporting QoS-AAA

   Figure 1 depicts NEs through which media flows need to pass, a cloud
   of AAA servers, and an AE.  Note that there may be more than one
   router that needs to interact with the AAA cloud along the path of a
   given application flow, although the figure only depicts one for
   clarity.

   In some deployment scenarios, NEs may request authorization through
   the AAA cloud based on an incoming QoS reservation request.  The NE
   will route the request to a designated AE.  The AE will return the
   result of the authorization decision.  In other deployment scenarios,
   the authorization will be initiated upon dynamic application state,
   so that the request must be authenticated and authorized based on
   information from one or more AppSs.  After receiving the
   authorization request from the AppS or the NE, the AE decides the
   appropriate mode (i.e.  Push or Pull).  The usage Push or Pull mode
   can be determined by the authorizing entity either statically or
   dynamically.  Static determination might be based on a configurable
   defined policy in the authorizing entity, while dynamic determination



Sun, et al.             Expires February 6, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


   might be based on information received from an application server.
   For Push mode, the authorizing entity needs to identify the
   appropriate NE(s) to which QoS authorization information needs to be
   pushed.  It might determine this based on information received from
   the AppS, such as the IP addresses of media flows.

   In some deployment scenarios, there is a mapping between access
   network type and the service logic (e.g. selection of the Push or
   Pull mode, and other differentiated handling of the resource
   admission and control).  The access network type might be derived
   from the authorization request from the AppS or the NE, and in this
   case, the authorizing entity can identify the corresponding service
   logic based on the mapping.

   If defined properly, the interface between the NEs and AAA cloud
   would be identical whether the AE communicates with an AppS or not.
   Routers are therefore insulated from the details of particular
   applications and need not know that Application Servers are involved
   at all.  Also, the AAA cloud would naturally encompass business
   relationships such as those between network operators and third-party
   application providers, enabling flexible intra- or inter-domain
   authorization, accounting, and settlement.

   resources and determines whether there are enough resources to
   fulfill the request.  Authorization is performed by the Diameter
   client, which involves contacting an authorization entity through the
   AAA cloud shown in Section 3.  If both checks are successful, the
   authorized QoS parameters are set in the packet classifier and the
   packet scheduler.  Note that the parameters passed to the Traffic
   Control function may be different from the ones requested QoS
   (depending on the authorization decision).  Once the requested
   resource is granted, the Resource Management function provides
   accounting information to the AE via the Diameter client.

3.2.  Implications of Endpoint QoS Capabilities

3.2.1.  Endpoint Categories

   The QoS capabilities of Application Endpoints are varied, and can be
   categorized as follows:

   Category 1
      A Category 1 Application Endpoint has no QoS capability at either
      the application or the network level.  This type of AppE may set
      up a connection through application signaling, but it is incapable
      of specifying resource/QoS requirements through either application
      or network-level signaling.

   Category 2
      A Category 2 Application Endpoint only has QoS capability at the
      application level.  This type of AppE is able to set up a
      connection through application signaling with certain resource/QoS
      requirements (e.g., application attributes), but it is unable to
      signal any resource/QoS requirements at the network level.

   Category 3
      A Category 3 Application Endpoint has QoS capability at the
      network level.  This type of AppE may set up a connection through
      application signaling, translate service characteristics into
      network resource/QoS requirements (e.g., network QoS class)
      locally, and request the resources through network signaling,
      e.g., Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] or NSIS
      [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].

3.2.2.  Interaction Modes Between the Authorizing Entity and Network
        Element

   Different QoS mechanisms are employed in packet networks.  Those QoS
   mechanisms can be categorized into two schemes: IntServ [RFC2211],
   [RFC2212] and DiffServ [RFC2474].  In the IntServ scheme, network
   signaling (e.g., RSVP, NSIS, or link specific signaling) is commonly



Sun, et al.             Expires February 6, 2010               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


   used to initiate a request from an AppE for the desired QoS resource.
   In the DiffServ scheme, QoS resources are provisioned based upon some
   predefined QoS service classes rather than AppE-initiated, flow-based
   QoS requests.

   It is obvious that the eligible QoS scheme is correlated to the
   AppE's capability in the context of QoS authorization.  Since
   Category 1 and 2 AppEs cannot initiate the QoS resource requests by
   means of network signaling, using the current mechanism of IntServ
   model to signal QoS information across the network is not applicable
   to them in general.  Depending on network technology and operator
   requirements, a Category 3 AppE may either make use of network
   signaling for resource requests or not.

   The diversity of QoS capabilities of endpoints and QoS schemes of
   network technology leads to the distinction on the interaction mode
   between QoS authorization system and underlying NEs.  When the
   IntServ scheme is employed by a Category 3 endpoint, the
   authorization process is typically initiated by a NE when a trigger
   is received from the endpoint such as network QoS signaling.  In the
   DiffServ scheme, since the NE is unable to request the resource
   authorization on its own initiative, the authorization process is
   typically triggered by either the request of AppSs or policies
   defined by the operator.

   As a consequence, two interaction modes are needed in support of
   different combinations of QoS schemes and endpoint's QoS
   capabilities: Push mode and Pull mode.

   Push mode
      The QoS authorization process is triggered by AppSs or local
      network conditions (e.g., time of day on resource usage and QoS
      classes), and the authorization decisions are installed by the AE
      to the network element on its own initiative without explicit
      request.  In order to support the push mode, the AE (i.e.,
      Diameter server) should be able to initiate a Diameter
      authorization session to communicate with the NE (i.e., Diameter
      client) without any pre-established connection from the network
      element.

   Pull mode
      The QoS authorization process is triggered by the network
      signaling received from end-user equipment or by a local event in
      the NE according to pre-configured policies, and authorization
      decisions are produced upon the request of the NE.  In order to
      support the pull mode, the NE (i.e., Diameter client) will
      initiate a Diameter authorization session to communicate with the
      authorizing entity (i.e., Diameter server).

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


   For Category 1 and 2 Application Endpoints, Push mode is required.
   For a Category 3 AppE, either Push mode or Pull mode MAY be used.

   Push mode is applicable to certain networks, for example, Cable
   network, DSL, Ethernet, and Diffserv-enabled IP/MPLS as defined by
   other SDOs (e.g., ETSI TISPAN and ITU-T}.  The Pull mode is more
   appropriate to IntServ-enabled IP networks or certain wireless
   networks such as the GPRS networks defined by 3GPP.  Some networks
   (for example, WiMAX) may require both Push and Pull modes.

3.3.  Authorization Schemes

3.3.1.  Pull Mode Schemes

   Three types of basic authorization schemes for Pull mode exist: one
   type of two-party scheme and two types of three-party schemes.  The
   notation adopted here is in respect to the entity that performs the
   QoS authorization (QoS Authz).  The authentication of the QoS
   requesting entity might be done at the NE as part of the QoS
   signaling protocol, or by an off-path protocol (on the application
   layer or for network access authentication) or the AE might be
   contacted with request for authentication and authorization of the
   QoS requesting entity.  From the Diameter QoS application's point of
   view these schemes differ in type of information that need to be
   carried.  Here we focus on the 'Basic Three Party Scheme' (see
   Figure 3) and the 'Token-based Three Party Scheme' (see Figure 4).
   In the 'Two Party Scheme', the QoS RRE is authenticated by the NE and
   the authorization decision is made either locally at the NE itself or
   offloaded to a trusted entity (most likely within the same
   administrative domain).  In the two-party case no Diameter QoS
   protocol interaction is REQUIRED.

   In the 'Basic Three Party Scheme' a QoS reservation request that
   arrives at the NE is forwarded to the Authorizing Entity (e.g., in
   the user's home network), where the authorization decision is made.
   A business relationship, such as a roaming agreement, between the
   visited network and the home network ensures that the visited network
   is compensated for the resources consumed by the user via the home
   network.

                 Figure 4: Token-based Three Party Scheme

   The 'Token-based Three Party Scheme' is applicable to environments
   where a previous protocol interaction is used to request
   authorization tokens to assist the authorization process at the NE or
   the AE [RFC3521].

   The QoS RRE may be involved in an application layer protocol
   interaction, for example using SIP [RFC3313], with the AE.  As part
   of this interaction, authentication and authorization at the
   application layer might take place.  As a result of a successful
   authorization decision, which might involve the user's home AAA
   server, an authorization token is generated by the AE (e.g., the SIP
   proxy and an entity trusted by the SIP proxy) and returned to the end
   host for inclusion into the QoS signaling protocol.  The
   authorization token will be used by a NE that receives the QoS
   signaling message to authorize the QoS request.  Alternatively, the
   Diameter QoS application will be used to forward the authorization
   token to the user's home network.  The authorization token allows the
   authorization decision performed at the application layer can be
   associated with a corresponding QoS signaling session.  Note that the
   authorization token might either refer to established state
   concerning the authorization decision or the token might itself carry
   the authorized parameters (protected by a digital signature or a
   keyed message digest to prevent tampering).  In the latter case the



Sun, et al.             Expires February 6, 2010               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


   authorization token may contain several pieces of information
   pertaining to the authorized application session, but at minimum it
   should contain:
   o  An identifier for the AE (for example, an AppS) that issued the
      authorization token
   o  An identifier referring to a specific application protocol session
      for which the token was issued and
   o  A keyed message digest or digital signature protecting the content
      of the authorization token

   A possible structure for the authorization token and the policy
   element carrying it are proposed in context of RSVP [RFC3520].

   In the scenario mentioned above, where the QoS resource requesting
   entity is involved in an application layer protocol interaction with
   the AE, it may be worthwhile to consider a token-less binding
   mechanism also.  The application layer protocol interaction may have
   indicated the transport port numbers at the QoS RRE where it might
   receive media streams (for example in SIP/SDP [RFC4566] signalling,
   these port numbers are advertised).  The QoS RRE may also use these
   port numbers in some IP filter indications to the NE performing QoS
   reservation so that it may properly tunnel the inbound packets.  The
   NE performing QoS reservation will forward the QoS resource
   requesting entity's IP address and the IP filter indications to the
   AE in the QoS authorization request.  The AE will use the QoS RRE's
   IP address and the port numbers in the IP filter indication, which
   will match the port numbers advertised in the earlier application
   layer protocol interaction, to identify the right piece of policy
   information to be sent to the NE performing the QoS reservation in
   the QoS Authorization. response.

3.3.2.  Push Mode Schemes

   The push mode can be further divided into two types: endpoint-
   initiated and network-initiated.  In the former case, the
   authorization process is triggered by AppS in response to an explicit
   QoS request from an endpoint through application signaling, e.g.
   SIP; in the latter case, the authorization process is triggered by
   the AppS without an explicit QoS request from an endpoint.

   In the endpoint-initiated scheme, the QoS RRE (i.e., the AppE)
   determines the required application level QoS and sends a QoS request
   through an application signaling message.  The AppS will extract
   application-level QoS information and trigger the authorization
   process to the AE.  In the network-initiated scheme, the AE and/or
   AppS should derive and determine the QoS requirements according to
   application attribute, subscription and endpoint's capability when
   the endpoint does not explicitly indicate the QoS attributes.  The AE

   makes an authorization decision based on application level QoS
   information, network policies, end-user subscription, network
   resource availability, etc., and installs the decision to NE
   directly.

   A Category 1 AppE requires network-initiated Push mode and a Category
   2 AppE may use either type of Push Mode.

3.4.  QoS Application Requirements

   A QoS application must meet a number of requirements applicable to a
   diverse set of networking environments and services.  It should be
   compatible with different deployment scenarios having specific QoS
   signaling models and security issues.  Satisfying the requirements
   listed below while interworking with QoS signaling protocols, a
   Diameter QoS application should accommodate the capabilities of the
   QoS signaling protocols rather than introducing functional
   requirements on them.  A list of requirements for a QoS authorization
   application is provided here:






Sun, et al.             Expires February 6, 2010               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


   Inter-domain support
      In particular, users may roam outside their home network, leading
      to a situation where the NE and AE are in different administrative
      domains.

   Identity-based Routing
      The Diameter QoS application MUST route AAA requests to the
      Authorizing Entity, based on the provided identity of the QoS
      requesting entity or the identity of the AE encoded in the
      provided authorization token.

   Flexible Authentication Support
      The Diameter QoS application MUST support a variety of different
      authentication protocols for verification of authentication
      information present in QoS signaling messages.  The support for
      these protocols MAY be provided indirectly by tying the signaling
      communication for QoS to a previous authentication protocol
      exchange (e.g., using network access authentication).

   Making an Authorization Decision
      The Diameter QoS application MUST exchange sufficient information
      between the AE and the enforcing entity (and vice versa) to
      compute an authorization decision and to execute this decision.

   Triggering an Authorization Process
      The Diameter QoS application MUST allow periodic and event
      triggered execution of the authorization process, originated at
      the enforcing entity or even at the AE.

   Associating QoS Reservations and Application State
      The Diameter QoS application MUST carry information sufficient for
      an AppS to identify the appropriate application session and
      associate it with a particular QoS reservation.

   Dynamic Authorization
      It MUST be possible for the Diameter QoS application to push
      updates towards the NE(s) from authorizing entities.

   Bearer Gating
      The Diameter QoS application MUST allow the AE to gate (i.e.,
      enable/disable) authorized application flows based on, e.g.,
      application state transitions.

   Accounting Records
      The Diameter QoS application may define QoS accounting records
      containing duration, volume (byte count) usage information and
      description of the QoS attributes (e.g., bandwidth, delay, loss
      rate) that were supported for the flow.



Sun, et al.             Expires February 6, 2010               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application             August 2009


   Sending Accounting Records
      The NE SHOULD be able to send accounting records for a particular
      QoS reservation state to an accounting entity.

   Failure Notification
      The Diameter QoS application MUST allow the NE to report failures,
      such as loss of connectivity due to movement of a mobile node or
      other reasons for packet loss, to the authorizing entity.

   Accounting Correlation
      The Diameter QoS application may support the exchange of
      sufficient information to allow for correlation between accounting
      records generated by the NEs and accounting records generated by
      an AppS.

   Interaction with other AAA Applications
      Interaction with other AAA applications such as Diameter Network
      Access (NASREQ) application [RFC4005] is required for exchange of
      authorization, authentication and accounting information.


   In deployment scenarios where authentication of the QoS reservation
   requesting entity (e.g., the user) is done by means outside the
   Diameter QoS application protocol interaction, the AE is contacted
   only with a request for QoS authorization.  Authentication might have
   taken place already via the interaction with the Diameter NASREQ
   application or as part of the QoS signaling protocol (e.g., Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] in the General Internet Signaling
   Transport (GIST) protocol [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp]).

   Authentication of the QoS reservation requesting entity to the AE is
   necessary if a particular Diameter QoS application protocol cannot be
   related (or if there is no intention to relate it) to a prior
   authentication.  In this case the AE MUST authenticate the QoS
   reservation requesting entity in order to authorize the QoS request
   as part of the Diameter QoS protocol interaction.

   The document refers to three types of sessions that need to be
   properly correlated.

   QoS Signaling Session
      The time period during which a QoS signaling protocol establishes,
      maintains and deletes a QoS reservation state at the QoS network
      element is referred to as QoS signaling session.  Different QoS
      signaling protocols use different ways to identify QoS signaling
      sessions.  The same applies to different usage environments.
      Currently, this document supports three types of QoS session
      identifiers, namely a signaling session id (e.g., the Session

      Identifier used by the NSIS protocol suite), a flow id (e.g.,
      identifier assigned by an application to a certain flow as used in
      the 3GPP) and a flow description based on the IP parameters of the
      flow's end points.

   Diameter Authorization Session
      The time period, for which a Diameter server authorizes a
      requested service (i.e., QoS resource reservation) is referred to
      as a Diameter authorization session.  It is identified by a
      Session-Id included in all Diameter messages used for management
      of the authorized service (initial authorization, re-
      authorization, termination), see [RFC3588].

   Application-layer Session
      The application layer session identifies the duration of an
      application layer service which requires provision of certain QoS.
      An application layer session identifier is provided by the QoS
      requesting entity in the QoS signaling messages, for example as
      part of the authorization token.  In general, the application
      session identifier is opaque to the QoS aware NEs.  It is included
      in the authorization request message sent to the AE and helps it
      to correlate the QoS authorization request to the application
      session state information.


   Correlating these sessions is done at each of the three involved
   entities: The QoS requesting entity correlates the application with
   the QoS signaling sessions.  The QoS NE correlates the QoS signaling
   session with the Diameter authorization sessions.  The AE SHOULD bind
   the information about the three sessions together.  Note that in
   certain scenarios not all of the sessions are present.  For example,
   the application session might not be visible to QoS signaling
   protocol directly if there is no binding between the application
   session and the QoS requesting entity using the QoS signaling
   protocol.

4.  QoS Application Session Establishment and Management

4.1.  Parties Involved

   Authorization models supported by this application include three
   parties:
   o  Resource Requesting Entity
   o  Network Elements (Diameter QoS application (DQA) client)
   o  Authorizing Entity (Diameter QoS application (DQA) server)

   Note that the QoS RRE is only indirectly involved in the message
   exchange.  This entity provides the trigger to initiate the Diameter
   QoS protocol interaction by transmitting QoS signaling messages.  The
   Diameter QoS application is only executed between the Network Element
   (i.e., DQA client) and the Authorizing Entity (i.e., DQA server).

   The QoS RRE may communicate with the AE using application layer
   signaling for negotiation of service parameters.  As part of this
   application layer protocol interaction, for example using SIP,
   authentication and authorization might take place.  This message
   exchange is, however, outside the scope of this document.  The
   protocol communication between the QoS resource requesting entity and
   the QoS NE might be accomplished using the NSIS protocol suite, RSVP
   or a link layer signaling protocol.  A description of these protocols
   is also outside the scope of this document.

4.2.  Session Establishment

   The Pull and Push modes use a different set of command codes for
   session establishment.  For other operations, such as session
   modification and termination, they use the same set of command codes.

   The selection of Pull mode or Push mode operation is based on the
   trigger of the QoS Authorization session.  When a QoS-Authorization-
   Request (QAR, see Section 5.1) message with a new session ID is
   received, the AE operates in the Pull mode; when other triggers are
   received, the AE operates in the Push mode.  Similarly, when a QoS-
   Install-Request (QIR, see Section 5.3} with a new session ID is
   received, the NE operates in the Push mode; when other triggers are
   received, the NE operation in the Pull mode.

   The QoS authorization session is typically established per subscriber
   base (i.e.all requests with the same user ID), but it is also
   possible to be established on per node or per request base.  The
   concurrent sessions between an NE and an AE are identified by
   different Session-ID.

4.2.1.  Session Establishment for Pull Mode

   A request for a QoS reservation or local events received by a NE can
   trigger the initiation of a Diameter QoS authorization session.  The
   NE converts the required objects from the QoS signaling message to
   Diameter AVPs and generates a QAR message.

   Figure 6 shows the protocol interaction between a Resource Requesting
   Entity, a Network Element and the Authorizing Entity.

   The AE's identity, information about the application session and/or
   identity and credentials of the QoS RRE, requested QoS parameters,
   signaling session identifier and/or QoS enabled data flows
   identifiers MAY be encapsulated into respective Diameter AVPs and
   included in the Diameter message sent to the AE.  The QAR is sent to
   a Diameter server that can either be the home server of the QoS
   requesting entity or an AppS.

            Table 1: Mapping Input Data to QoS AVPs--Pull Mode

   Authorization processing starts at the Diameter QoS server when it
   receives the QAR.  Based on the information in the QoS-
   Authentication-Data, User-Name and QoS-Resources AVPs the server
   determines the authorized QoS resources and flow state (enabled/
   disabled) from locally available information (e.g., policy
   information that may be previously established as part of an
   application layer signaling exchange, or the user's subscription
   profile).  The QoS-Resources AVP is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes].  The authorization decision is then
   reflected in the response returned to the Diameter client with the
   QoS-Authorization-Answer message (QAA).

         Figure 6: Initial QoS Request Authorization for Pull Mode

   The Authorizing Entity keeps authorization session state and SHOULD
   save additional information for management of the session (e.g.,
   Signaling-Session-Id, authentication data) as part of the session
   state information.

   The final result of the authorization request is provided in the

   In case of successful authorization (i.e., Result-Code =
   DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS, (see Section 7.1)), information about the
   authorized QoS resources and the status of the authorized flow
   (enabled/disabled) is provided in the QoS-Resources AVP of the QAA
   message.  The QoS information provided via the QAA is installed by
   the QoS Traffic Control function of the NE.  The value
   DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS indicates that the AE expects confirmation
   via another QAR message for successful QoS resource reservation and

   for final reserved QoS resources (see below).

   One important piece of information returned from the Authorizing
   Entity is the authorization lifetime (carried inside the QAA).  The
   authorization lifetime allows the NE to determine how long the
   authorization decision is valid for this particular QoS reservation.
   A number of factors may influence the authorized session duration,
   such as the user's subscription plan or currently available credits
   at the user's account (see Section 8).  The authorization duration is
   time-based as specified in [RFC3588].  For an extension of the
   authorization period, a new QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer message
   exchange SHOULD be initiated.  Further aspects of QoS authorization
   session maintenance is discussed in Section 4.3, Section 4.4 and
   Section 8.

   The indication of a successful QoS reservation and activation of the
   data flow is provided by the transmission of a QAR message, which
   reports the parameters of the established QoS state: reserved
   resources, duration of the reservation, and identification of the QoS
   enabled flow/QoS signaling session.  The Diameter QoS server
   acknowledges the reserved QoS resources with the QA Answer (QAA)
   message where the Result-Code is set to 'DIAMETER_SUCCESS'.  Note
   that the reserved QoS resources reported in this QAR message MAY be
   different than those authorized with the initial QAA message, due to
   the QoS signaling specific behavior (e.g., receiver-initiated
   reservations with One-Path-With-Advertisements) or specific process
   of QoS negotiation along the data path.

4.2.2.  Session Establishment for Push Mode

   The Diameter QoS server in the AE initiates a Diameter QoS
   authorization session upon the request for QoS reservation triggered
   by application layer signaling or by local events, and generates a
   QoS-Install-Request (QIR) message to Diameter QoS client in the NE in
   which it maps required objects to Diameter payload objects.

   Figure 7 shows the protocol interaction between the AE, a Network
   Element and a RRE.

   The NE's identity, information about the application session and/or
   identity and credentials of the QoS resource requesting entity,
   requested QoS parameters, signaling session identifier and/or QoS
   enabled data flows identifiers MAY be encapsulated into respective
   Diameter AVPs and included into the Diameter message sent from a
   Diameter QoS server in the Authorizing Entity to a Diameter QoS
   client in the NE.  This requires that the AE has knowledge of
   specific information for allocating and identifying the NE that
   should be contacted and the data flow for which the QoS reservation

   Authorization processing starts at the Diameter QoS server when it
   receives a request from a RRE through an AppS (e.g., SIP Invite) or
   is triggered by a local event (e.g., pre-configured timer).  Based on
   the received information the server determines the authorized QoS
   resources and flow state (enabled/disabled) from locally available
   information (e.g., policy information that may be previously
   established as part of an application layer signaling exchange, or
   the user's subscription profile).  The authorization decision is then
   reflected in the QoS-Install-Request message (QIR) to the Diameter
   QoS client.

   One important piece of information from the AE is the authorization
   lifetime (carried inside the QIR).  The authorization lifetime allows
   the NE to determine how long the authorization decision is valid for
   this particular QoS reservation.  A number of factors may influence
   the authorized session duration, such as the user's subscription plan
   or currently available credits at the user's account (see Section 8).
   The authorization duration is time-based as specified in [RFC3588].
   For an extension of the authorization period, a new QoS-Install-
   Request/Answer message or QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer message
   exchange SHOULD be initiated.  Further aspects of QoS authorization
   session maintenance is discussed in Section 4.3, Section 4.4 and
   Section 8.

   The indication of QoS reservation and activation of the data flow can
   be provided by the QoS-Install-Answer message immediately.  In the
   case of successful enforcement, the Result-Code (= DIAMETER_SUCCESS,
   (see Section 7.1)) information is provided in the QIA message.  Note
   that the reserved QoS resources reported in the QIA message may be
   different than those initially authorized with the QIR message, due
   to the QoS signaling specific behavior (e.g., receiver-initiated
   reservations with One-Path-With-Advertisements) or specific process
   of QoS negotiation along the data path.  In the case Multiple AEs
   control the same NE, the NE should make the selection on the
   authorization decision to be enforced based on the priority of the
   request.

4.2.3.  Discovery and Selection of Peer Diameter QoS Application Node

   Discovery of Diameter QoS application nodes

   The Diameter QoS application node may obtain information of its peer
   nodes (e.g., FQDN, IP address) through static configuration or
   dynamic discovery as described in section 5.2 of [RFC3588].  In
   particular, the NE shall perform the relevant operation for Pull
   mode; the AE shall perform the relevant operations for Push mode.

   Selection of peer Diameter QoS application node

   Upon receipt of a trigger to initiate a new Diameter QoS
   authorization session, the Diameter QoS application node selects and
   retrieves the location information of the peer node that is
   associated with the affected user based on some index information
   provided by the RRE.  For instance, it can be the Authorization
   Entity's ID stored in the authorization token, the end-user's
   identity (e.g., NAI [RFC4282]) or a globally routable IP address.

4.3.  Session Re-authorization

   Client and server-side initiated re-authorizations are considered in
   the design of the Diameter QoS application.  Whether the re-
   authorization events are transparent for the resource requesting
   entity or result in specific actions in the QoS signaling protocol is
   outside the scope of the Diameter QoS application.  It is directly
   dependent on the capabilities of the QoS signaling protocol.

   There are a number of options for policy rules according to which the
   NE (AAA client) contacts the AE for re-authorization.  These rules
   depend on the semantics and contents of the QAA message sent by the
   AE:

   a.  The QAA message contains the authorized parameters of the flow
       and its QoS and sets their limits (presumably upper).  With these
       parameters the AE specifies the services that the NE can provide
       and will be financially compensated for.  Therefore, any change
       or request for change of the parameters of the flow and its QoS
       that do not conform to the authorized limits requires contacting
       the AE for authorization.
   b.  The QAA message contains authorized parameters of the flow and
       its QoS.  The rules that determine whether parameters' changes
       require re-authorization are agreed out of band, based on a
       Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the domains of the NE and
       the AE.
   c.  The QAA message contains the authorized parameters of the flow
       and its QoS.  Any change or request for change of these
       parameters requires contacting the AE for re-authorization.
   d.  In addition to the authorized parameters of the flow and its QoS,
       the QAA message contains policy rules that determine the NEs
       actions in case of change or request for change in authorized
       parameters.

   Provided options are not exhaustive.  Elaborating on any of the
   listed approaches is deployment /solution specific and is not
   considered in the current document.

   In addition, the AE may use a RAR to perform re-authorization with
   the authorized parameters directly when the re-authorization is
   triggered by service request or local events/policy rules.

4.3.1.  Client-Side Initiated Re-Authorization

   The AE provides the duration of the authorization session as part of
   the QoS-Authorization-Answer message (QAA).  At any time before
   expiration of this period, a new QoS-Authorization-Request message
   (QAR) MAY be sent to the AE.  The transmission of the QAR MAY be

   [RFC3588], which may include the parameters of the re-authorized QoS
   state: reserved resources, duration of the reservation,

   function of the NE.

   A NE that receives such a RAR message with Session-Id matching a
   currently active QoS session acknowledges the request by sending the
   Re-Auth-Answer (RAA) message towards the AE.

   If RAR does not include any parameters of the re-authorized QoS
   state, the NE MUST initiate a QoS re-authorization by sending a QoS-
   Authorization-Request (QAR) message towards the AE.

4.4.  Session Termination

4.4.1.  Client-Side Initiated Session Termination

   The authorization session for an installed QoS reservation state MAY
   be terminated by the Diameter client by sending a Session-
   Termination-Request message (STR) to the Diameter server.  This is a
   Diameter base protocol function and it is defined in [RFC3588].
   Session termination can be caused by a QoS signaling messaging
   requesting deletion of the existing QoS reservation state or it can
   be caused as a result of a soft-state expiration of the QoS
   reservation state.

   and it is defined in [RFC3588].  Possible reasons for initiating the

   at the application layer.  The ASR message results in termination of
   the authorized session, release of the reserved resources at the NE

5.  QoS Application Messages

   The Diameter QoS Application requires the definition of new mandatory
   AVPs and Command-codes (see Section 3 of [RFC3588]).  Four new
   Diameter messages are defined along with Command-Codes whose values
   MUST be supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to
   this specification.

                      Table 4: Diameter Base Commands

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification MAY advertise support
   for the Diameter QoS Application by including the value of [TBD5] in
   the Auth-Application-Id or the Acct-Application-Id AVP of the
   Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
   commands, see [RFC3588].

   The value of {TBD5] MUST be used as the Application-Id in all QAR/QAA
   and QIR/QIA commands.

   The value of zero (0) SHOULD be used as the Application-Id in all
   STR/STA, ASR/ASA, and RAR/RAA commands, because these commands are
   defined in the Diameter base protocol and no additional mandatory
   AVPs for those commands are defined in this document.

5.1.  QoS-Authorization Request (QAR)

   The QoS-Authorization-Request message (QAR) indicated by the Command-
   Code field (see Section 3 of [RFC3588]) set to [TBD1] and 'R' bit set
   in the Command Flags field is used by NEs to request quality of
   service related resource authorization for a given flow.

   The QAR message MUST carry information for signaling session
   identification, AE identification, information about the requested
   QoS, and the identity of the QoS requesting entity.  In addition,
   depending on the deployment scenario, an authorization token and
   credentials of the QoS requesting entity SHOULD be included.

   The message format, presented in ABNF form [RFC4234], is defined as
   follows:


    <QoS-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: [TBD1], REQ, PXY >
                         < Session-Id >
                         { Auth-Application-Id }
                         { Origin-Host }
                         { Origin-Realm }
                         { Destination-Realm }
                         { Auth-Request-Type }
                         [ Destination-Host ]
                         [ User-Name ]

                      *  [ AVP ]

5.2.  QoS-Authorization Answer (QAA)

   The QoS-Authorization-Answer message (QAA), indicated by the Command-
   Code field set to [TBD2] and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags
   field is sent in response to the QoS-Authorization-Request message
   (QAR).  If the QoS authorization request is successfully authorized,
   the response will include the AVPs to allow authorization of the QoS
   resources and transport plane gating information.

5.3.  QoS-Install Request (QIR)

   The QoS-Install Request message (QIR), indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to [TBD3] and 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field is
   used by AE to install or update the QoS parameters and the flow state
   of an authorized flow at the transport plane element.

   The message MUST carry information for signaling session
   identification or identification of the flow to which the provided
   QoS rules apply, identity of the transport plane element, description
   of provided QoS parameters, flow state and duration of the provided
   authorization.

5.4.  QoS-Install Answer (QIA)

   The QoS-Install Answer message (QIA), indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to [TBD4] and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field is
   sent in response to the QoS-Install Request message (QIR) for
   confirmation of the result of the installation of the provided QoS
   reservation instructions.

   The message format is defined as follows:


     <QoS-Install-Answer> ::= < Diameter Header: [TBD4], PXY >
                              < Session-Id >

                           *  [ AVP ]

5.5.  Re-Auth-Request (RAR)

   The Re-Auth-Request message (RAR), indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to 258 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field, is
   sent by the AE to the NE in order to initiate the QoS re-
   authorization from DQA server side.

   If the RAR command is received by the NE without any parameters of
   the re-authorized QoS state, the NE MUST initiate a QoS re-
   authorization by sending a QoS-Authorization-Request (QAR) message
   towards the AE.

   The message format is defined as follows:


    <Re-Auth-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: 258, REQ, PXY >
                              < Session-Id >
                              { Auth-Application-Id }

6.  QoS Application State Machine

   The QoS application defines its own state machine that is based on
   the authorization state machine defined in Section 8.1 of the Base
   Protocol ([RFC3588]).  The Qos state machine uses own messages as
   defined in Section 5 and QoS AVPs as defined in Section 7.

6.1.  Supplemented States for Push Mode

   Using the Base Protocol state machine as a basis, the following
   states are supplemented to first 2 state machines in which the
   session state is maintained on the Server.  These MUST be supported
   in any QoS application implementations in support of server initiated
   push mode (see (Section 4.2.2)).

   The following states are supplemented to the state machine on the
   Server when state is maintained on the client as defined in Section
   8.1 of the Base Protocol [RFC3588]:

                                 SERVER, STATEFUL

7.  QoS Application AVPs

   Each of the AVPs identified in the QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer
   and QoS-Install-Request/Answer messages and the assignment of their
   value(s) is given in this section.

7.1.  Reused Base Protocol AVPs

   The QoS application uses a number of session management AVPs, defined
   in the Base Protocol ([RFC3588]).


   Attribute Name                AVP Code     Reference [RFC3588]
   Origin-Host                   264             Section 6.3
   Origin-Realm                  296             Section 6.4
   Destination-Host              293             Section 6.5
   Destination-Realm             283             Section 6.6
   Auth-Application-Id           258             Section 6.8
   Result-Code                   268             Section 7.1
   Auth-Request-Type             274             Section 8.7
   Session-Id                    263             Section 8.8
   Authorization-Lifetime        291             Section 8.9
   Authorization-Grace-Period    276             Section 8.10
   Session-Timeout                27             Section 8.13
   User-Name                       1             Section 8.14

   The Auth-Application-Id AVP (AVP Code 258) is assigned by IANA to
   Diameter applications.  The value of the Auth-Application-Id for the
   Diameter QoS application is TBD.

7.2.  QoS Application Defined AVPs

   This document reuses the AVPs defined in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes].

   This section lists the AVPs that are introduced specifically for the
   QoS application.  The following new AVPs are defined: Bound-Auth-
   Session-Id and the QoS-Authorization-Data AVP.

   The following table describes the Diameter AVPs newly defined in this
   document for usage with the QoS Application, their AVP code values,
   types, possible flag values, and whether the AVP may be encrypted.

   |V - Vendor specific bit that indicates whether the AVP belongs to |
   |    a address space.                                              |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------+

   QoS-Authorization-Data
      The QoS-Authorization-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type
      OctetString.  It is a container that carries application session
      or user specific data that has to be supplied to the AE as input
      to the computation of the authorization decision.

   Bound-Authentication-Session-Id
      The Bound-Authentication-Session AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type
      UTF8String.  It carries the id of the Diameter authentication
      session that is used for the network access authentication (NASREQ
      authentication session).  It is used to tie the QoS authorization
      request to a prior authentication of the end host done by a co-
      located application for network access authentication (Diameter
      NASREQ) at the QoS NE.

8.  Accounting

   A NE MAY start an accounting session by sending an Accounting-Request
   message (ACR) after successful QoS reservation and activation of the
   data flow (see Figure 6 and Figure 7).  After every successful re-
   authorization procedure (see Figure 8 and Figure 9), the NE MAY
   initiate an interim accounting message exchange.  After successful
   session termination (see Figure 10 and Figure 11), the NE may
   initiate a final exchange of accounting messages for terminating of
   the accounting session and reporting final records for the usage of
   the QoS resources reserved.  It should be noted that the two sessions
   (authorization and accounting) have independent management by the
   Diameter base protocol, which allows for finalizing the accounting
   session after the end of the authorization session.

   The detailed QoS accounting procedures are out of scope in this
   document.

9.  Examples

9.1.  Example Call Flow for Pull Mode

   This section presents an example of the interaction between the end
   host and Diameter QoS application entities using Pull mode.  The
   application layer signaling is, in this example, provided using SIP.
   Signaling for a QoS resource reservation is done using the QoS NSLP.
   The authorization of the QoS reservation request is done by the
   Diameter QoS application (DQA).

   The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two end
   points and the SIP server for negotiation and authorization of the
   requested service and its parameters (see Figure 12).  As a part of
   the process, the SIP server verifies whether the user at Host A is
   authorized to use the requested service (and potentially the ability

   to be charged for the service usage).  Negotiated session parameters
   are provided to the end host.

   Subsequently, Host A initiates a QoS signaling message towards Host
   B. It sends a QoS NSLP Reserve message, in which it includes
   description of the required QoS (QSPEC object) and authorization data
   for negotiated service session (part of the POLICY_DATA object).
   Authorization data includes, as a minimum, the identity of the AE
   (e.g., the SIP server) and an identifier of the application service
   session for which QoS resources are requested.

   A QoS NSLP Reserve message is intercepted and processed by the first
   QoS aware Network Element.  The NE uses the Diameter QoS application
   to request authorization for the received QoS reservation request.
   The identity of the AE (in this case the SIP server that is co-
   located with a Diameter server) is put into the Destination-Host AVP,
   any additional session authorization data is encapsulated into the
   QoS-Authorization-Data AVP and the description of the QoS resources
   is included into QoS-Resources AVP.  These AVPs are included into a
   QoS Authorization Request message, which is sent to the AE.

   A QAR message will be routed through the AAA network to the AE.  The
   AE verifies the requested QoS against the QoS resources negotiated
   for the service session and replies with QoS-Authorization answer
   (QAA) message.  It carries the authorization result (Result-Code AVP)
   and the description of the authorized QoS parameters (QoS-Resources
   AVP), as well as duration of the authorization session
   (Authorization-Lifetime AVP).

   The NE interacts with the traffic control function and installs the
   authorized QoS resources and forwards the QoS NSLP Reserve message
   further along the data path.  Moreover, the NE may serve as a
   signaling proxy and process the QoS signaling (e.g. initiation or
   termination of QoS signaling) based on the QoS decision received from
   the authorizing entity.

9.2.  Example Call Flow for Push Mode

   This section presents an example of the interaction between the end-
   host and Diameter QoS application entities using Push mode.  The
   application layer signaling is, in this example, provided using SIP.
   Signaling for a QoS resource reservation is done using the QoS NSLP.
   The authorization of the QoS reservation request is done by the
   Diameter QoS application (DQA).

             Figure 13: QoS Authorization Example - Push Mode

   The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two end
   points and the SIP server for negotiation and authorization of the
   requested service and its parameters (see Figure 13).  As a part of
   the process, the SIP server verifies whether the user at Host A is
   authorized to use the requested service (and potentially the ability
   to be charged for the service usage).  The DQA server is triggered to
   authorize the QoS request based on session parameters (i.e., SDP
   offer), initiate a Diameter QoS authorization session and install
   authorized QoS state to the Network Element via QIR message.

   The DQA server may obtain the info of peer DQA client from pre-
   configured information or query the DNS based on Host A's identity or
   IP address (In this case a DQA server is co-located with a SIP server
   and a DQA client is co-located with a NE).  The identity of Network
   Element is put into the Destination-Host AVP, the description of the
   QoS resources is included into QoS-Resources AVP, as well as duration
   of the authorization session (Authorization-Lifetime AVP).  The NE
   interacts with the traffic control function and reserves the
   authorized QoS resources accordingly, for instance, the NE may serve
   as a signaling proxy and process the QoS signaling (e.g. initiation
   or termination of QoS signaling) based on the QoS decision received
   from the authorizing entity.

   With successful QoS authorization, the SDP offer in SIP Invite is
   forwarded to Host B. Host B sends back a 18x (ringing) message
   towards Host A and processes the SDP.  Once Host B accepts the call,
   it sends back a 200 OK, in which it includes description of the
   accepted session parameters (i.e.  SDP answer).

   The DQA server may verify the accepted QoS against the pre-authorized
   QoS resources, and sends a Diameter RAR message to the DQA client in
   the NE for activating the installed policies and commit the resource
   allocation.  With successful QoS enforcement, the 200 OK is forwarded
   towards Host A.

   Note that the examples above show a sender-initiated reservation from
   the end host towards the corresponding node and a receiver-initiated
   reservation from the correspondent node towards the end host.

   QoS reservation at a third party entity.  Therefore, sufficient
   information needs to be made available to the Authorizing Entity to
   can make such an authorization decision.  Information may come from
   various sources, including the application layer signaling, the
   Diameter protocol (with its security mechanisms), from policy
   information stored available with a AAA server and from a QoS
   signaling protocol.

   Below there is a discussion about considerations for the Diameter QoS
   interaction between an Authorizing Entity and a Network Element.
   Security between the Authorizing Entity and the Network Element has a
   number of components: authentication, authorization, integrity and
   confidentiality.

   Authentication refers to confirming the identity of an originator for
   all datagrams received from the originator.  Lack of authentication
   of Diameter messages between the Authorizing Entity and the Network
   Element can seriously jeopardize the fundamental service rendered by
   the Network Element.  A consequence of not authenticating the message
   sender by the Network Element would be that an attacker could spoof
   the identity of a "legitimate" Authorizing Entity in order to
   allocate resources, change resource assignments or free resources.
   The adversary can also manipulate the state at the Network Element in
   such a way that it leads to a denial of service attack by, for
   example, setting the allowed bandwidth to zero or allocating the
   entire bandwidth available to a single flow.

   A consequence of not authenticating the Network Element to an
   Authorizing Entity is that an attacker could impact the policy based
   admission control procedure operated by the Authorizing Entity that
   provides a wrong view of the resources used in the network.  Failing
   to provide the required credentials should be subject to logging.

   Authorization refers to whether a particular Authorizing Entity is
   authorized to signal a Network Element with requests for one or more
   applications, adhering to a certain policy profile.  Failing the
   authorization process might indicate a resource theft attempt or
   failure due to administrative and/or credential deficiencies.  In
   either case, the Network Element should take the proper measures to
   log such attempts.

   Integrity is required to ensure that a Diameter message has not been
   maliciously altered.  The result of a lack of data integrity
   enforcement in an untrusted environment could be that an imposter
   will alter the messages exchanged between a Network Entity and an

   Authorizing Entity potentially causing a denial of service.

   Confidentiality protection of Diameter messages ensures that the
   signaling data is accessible only to the authorized entities.  When
   signaling messages from the Application Server, via the Authorizing
   Entity towards the Network Element traverse untrusted networks, lack
   of confidentiality will allow eavesdropping and traffic analysis.
   Additionally, Diamater QoS messages may carry authorization tokens
   that require confidentiality protection.

   Diameter offers security mechanisms to deal with the functionality
   demanded in the paragraphs above.  In particular, Diameter offers
   communication security between neighboring Diameter peers using
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec.  Authorization capabilities
   are application specific and part of the overal implementation.
