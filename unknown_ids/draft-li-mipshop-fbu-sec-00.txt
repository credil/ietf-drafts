Abstract

   This specification introduces an alternate, low-consumption mechanism
   for protecting signaling messages between the Mobile Node and
   previous Access Router for Fast Mobile IPv6.  The alternate method
   defined here utilizes the Master Session Key(MSK) generated from EAP
   authentication to derive a fast handover key between the Mobile Node
   and the Access Router in order to avoid certain attacks.  This
   mechanism also adds the Mobile Node Identifier option and the
   mobility message authentication option to the FMIPv6 signaling
   messages.

1.  Introduction

   In order to reduce the handover latency, Fast Mobile IPv6(FMIPv6)
   RFC4068 [2], proposes a fast handover mechanism for IPv6 Mobile
   Nodes.  It requires a tunnel between the previous Access Router and
   the Mobile Node.  The MN sends a "Fast Binding Update" message to its
   previous Access Router to establish this tunnel.  Without
   corresponding verification of FBU, an attacker can redirect a victim
   node's traffic at will.  To avoid certain attacks, the FMIPv6
   signaling messages between the mobile node and the access router must
   be secured to ensure FMIPv6 support for a legitimate mobile node that
   has been authorized to obtain such services.

   The extensible authentication protocol (EAP)RFC3748 [3] is a generic
   framework supporting multiple types of authentication methods.
   According to the document RFC3748 [3],after successful
   authentication, the authentication server transports the Master
   Session Key(MSK) to the authenticator.  The underlying L2 or L3
   protocol can uses the MSK to derive additional keys.  Generally, the
   MSK is used for bootstrapping the security associations for the
   access link between the mobile node and the network.

   Fast Mobile IPv6 requires that a Fast Binding Update is secured using
   a security association between an Access Router and a Mobile Node.
   In this document, a method for establishing a shared secret key
   between the Access Router and the Mobile Node is defined to protect
   this signaling.  The mechanism utilizes the MSK to derive a fast
   handover key shared between the Mobile Node and previous Access
   Router.

   The access authentication is to authorize the Mobile Node to obtain
   the access link's network services; and FMIPv6 denotes that MN still
   continues to use the network services provided by the previous link,
   therefore, from the authorization view, applied the access
   authentication key to protect the FMIPv6 signaling is appropriate.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

3.  Applicability Statement

   This mechanism is useful in scenarios where the following conditions
   are all met:

   -The authenticator is co-located with the access router, furthermore,
   the previous access router acted as the authenticator of the mobile
   node.

   -After successful authentication, the MSK was generated,so the EAP
   method used by mobile node should support the generation of MSK.

4.  Messages Flow

   The figure below describes the sequence of messages sent and received
   between the MN and pAR in the registration process.  Fast Binding
   Update (FBU) and Fast Binding Acknowledgement (FBack) messages are
   used in the registration process.

          MN                                           pAR/Authenticator
          |                   FBU to pAR                         |
    (a)   |----------------------------------------------------->|
          |         (including MN-ID option,                     |
          |          mobility message authentication option)     |
          |                                                      |
          |                            AR/Authenticator authenticates MN
          |                                                      |
          |                   FBack to MN                        |
    (b)   |<-----------------------------------------------------|
          |         (including MN-ID option,                     |
          |          mobility message authentication option)     |
          |                                                      |

                      Figure 1:  Fast Binding Update to AR

   The MN needs to signal the pervious AR by FBU message during the
   MIPv6 fast handover procedure, the MN utilizes the fast handover key
   dervied from MSK and corresponding authentication algorithm to
   generate the message authentication code of FBU.  The Mobile Node
   MUST use the Mobile Node Identifier option, specifically the MN-NAI
   mobility option as defined in RFC4283 [4] to identify itself while
   authenticating with the previous AR.  As specified by FMIPv6, the MN
   MUST include the old care-of address in a Home Address Option.

   Upon receiving FBU message containing authentication code and MN-NAI
   option, according to the MN-NAI, the pAR figured out the MSK,
   utilized the same method with mobile node to derive the fast handover
   key, and then applied this key to verify the authentication code
   included in the mobility message authentication option.  The FMIPv6
   document provides more detail on how the previous AR processes an FBU
   containing an authentication code.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a shared key establishing method for FMIPv6
   protocol.  The key establishing method utilizes the MSK to derive a
   child key to protect the FMIPv6 signaling.  This mechanism can defend
   against the other malicious node to impersonate a legal Mobile Node
   to send faked FBU messages.  However, lack of verification the
   ownership of care-of addresses, a malicious node can send a FBU
   message to redirect traffic to an incorrect address or to steal
   another node's traffic with the genuine security association.
   Obviously, owing to the security association established from the
   successful authentication, according to the MN-NAI in the FBU
   messages, the AR can track the malicious node.  From the
   administrative view, this can limit the attacks from the nodes with
   the genuine security association.

   For other FMIPv6 security considerations, please see the FMIPv6
   document RFC4068 [2].
