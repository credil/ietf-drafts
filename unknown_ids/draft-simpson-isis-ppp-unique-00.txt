             Generation of Unique IS-IS System Identifiers
                   draft-simpson-isis-ppp-unique-00


Abstract

   The IS-IS routing protocol (Intermediate System to Intermediate
   System, ISO 10589) requires unique System Identifiers at the link
   layer.  A common practice has been to use an existing IEEE 802 MAC
   link-layer interface identifier.  When no unique MAC is available,
   this document specifies automatic generation of identifiers.  It is
   fully interoperable with systems that do not support this extension.

   Additionally, the extension automatically resolves conflicts between
   System Identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   The System Identifier is 6 octets for OSI end systems, and 7 octets
   for IS-IS routers or pseudonodes.  This identifier is not required to
   be the Destination or Source of any packet.  (See [ISO10589],
   [RFC1195], and [RFC5342] for further details.)

   Typically, IS-IS implementations base the identifier on an existing
   Media Access Control (MAC) link-layer interface identifier.  The
   48-bit MAC is usually composed of a 24-bit Organizationally Unique
   Identifier (OUI) followed by a 24-bit Network Interface Controller
   (NIC) specific number.

   Other systems have a configured identifier that is independent of the
   interfaces.


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL", "RECOMMENDED",
   "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2.  Random Generation

   Some systems have only point-to-point or other links without any
   conveniently available MAC, and do not have a configured identifier.
   This status might change dynamically, as hot swap interfaces are
   added or removed.

   In this case, a 48-bit System Identifier MUST be randomly generated.
   (See [RFC4086] for requirements.)

   To mitigate against potential assignment conflicts, this System
   Identifier (considered as a pseudo-MAC) MUST have both the "locally-
   assigned" and "broadcast/multicast" (group) bits set; that is, the
   least significant two bits of the most significant octet are equal to
   0x3.

   The probability of conflict is reduced to a birthday attack of the
   order N/2**23; where N is the number of systems in the same IS-IS
   area.  This is considerably less likely than a duplicate MAC (see
   below), or operating facility destruction by meteor, or an operator's
   death by lightning strike.  [Schneier]

2.1.  PPP Links

   PPP [RFC1661] links (such as [RFC1377]) already specify negotiation
   of a unique 32-bit Magic Number.  Although only a single interface
   negotiation is described in the base document, it has long been
   understood [RFC1220] [Simpson1992] [Baker1992] that the term "unique"
   applies across all local system interfaces.  This protects against
   patch-panel errors in addition to looped-back modems, to detect
   unexpected loopbacks of a link from an endpoint to itself.
   [Simpson1993] [RFC1663] [RFC1717]

   An implementation conforming with this specification MUST have
   different Magic Numbers for every link in a single system, and each
   end of every link between two peers MUST have Magic Numbers which are
   unique to those peers.  That is, the Magic Number MUST be unique for
   all visible interfaces.

   Whenever such a Magic Number has been successfully negotiated, only
   the most significant 2 octets of a pseudo-OUI are randomly generated.
   The selected Magic Number is appended after the pseudo-OUI.

   To mitigate against potential assignment conflicts, this System
   Identifier (considered as a pseudo-OUI) MUST have both the "locally-
   assigned" and "broadcast/multicast" (group) bits set; that is, the
   least significant two bits of the most significant octet are equal to
   0x3.

   The probability of conflict is considerably less than the wholly
   generated pseudo-MAC (above), as the Magic Number has already been
   determined to be locally unique.  The pseudo-OUI differentiates among
   such PPP-only systems.


3.  Resolving Conflicts

   Field experience has shown that IEEE 802 MAC identifiers are
   frequently not unique.  Companies that manufacture more than
   16,777,214 devices will often reuse the same MAC.

   Also, many companies reuse the same MAC for different product lines,
   or different speeds or types of media.  Some implementations failed
   to correctly convert the MAC to canonical form [RFC2469], resulting
   unintentional conflicts through multi-media bridges.

   If a duplicated MAC is used as a System Identifier within an IS-IS
   area, this leads to the condition colloquially called "LSR War".
   Currently, IS-IS has no method to detect or resolve such conflicts.

DRAFT                          ISIS Unique                 29 March 2011


   After detecting a conflicting System Identifier in a neighbor, or
   receiving 3 or more IS-IS Hellos and failing to resolve participation
   in an area within 10 seconds, an implementation conforming with this
   specification MUST generate a replacement System Identifier using one
   of the techniques specified above.

   The system SHOULD delay generation and transmission of this
   replacement System Identifier for a random amount of time between 0
   and MAX_GENERATION_DELAY.  Although the randomization range is
   specified in units of seconds, the actual randomly-chosen value
   SHOULD NOT be in units of whole seconds, but rather in units of the
   highest available timer resolution.

   This reduces the probability of synchronization with advertisements
   from other systems in the same IS-IS area.  If a message is received
   during the delay indicating the conflict was resolved by another
   system, the existing local System Identifier remains unchanged.

Operational Considerations


   MAX_GENERATION_DELAY
      Default: 1 second.  This is based on an anticipated IS-IS Hello
      interval of no more than 4 seconds.

      When Hellos are sent at a greater time interval, this MUST NOT be
      greater than interval/2, and SHOULD NOT be greater than
      interval/4.

   Configurable System Identifier
      Default 0 (off).  Although the probability of conflict with
      another System Identifier is minuscule, some implementations might
      not have a sufficient source of randomness, and could repeatedly
      select conflicting values.  An implementation conforming with this
      specification MUST have an option to statically configure the
      System Identifier.

      To mitigate against potential assignment conflicts, this System
      Identifier (considered as a pseudo-MAC) MUST have the "locally-
      assigned" bit set and "broadcast/multicast" (group) bit clear;
      that is, the least significant two bits of the most significant
      octet are equal to 0x2.



Security Considerations

   These mechanisms provide protection against compromised,
   malfunctioning, or misconfigured systems [RFC4593]; spoofing attacks
   are thwarted by quickly renegotiating a replacement System
   Identifier.

   Never-the-less, [RFC5304] increases protection against maliciously
   configured conflicting System Identifiers.
