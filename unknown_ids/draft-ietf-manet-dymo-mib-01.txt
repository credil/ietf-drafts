1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo] process.
   The DYMO MIB also reports state information, performance metrics, and
   notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state
   and performance information is useful to management stations
   troubleshooting routing problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing protocol
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo] is intended for use by mobile nodes in
   wireless, multihop networks.  DYMO determines unicast routes among
   DYMO routers within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering
   improved convergence in dynamic topologies.

   A DYMO routers' MIB contains DYMO process configuration parameters
   (e.g. interfaces), state information (e.g. sequence number),
   performance counters (e.g. number of control messages), and
   notifications.

4.1.  DYMO Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the DYMO routing
   protocol.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the DYMO protocol.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the DYMO protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Statistics Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      DYMO protocol process on the router and the overall routing
      performance within the DYMO routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the DYMO MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  dymoMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the DYMO MIB.  These are currently limited to notifications of
      interface state changes.

   o  dymoMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the
      DYMO MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the DYMO objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall
         performance and operation of the routing protocol for the
         router device and its interfaces.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the DYMO process such as the DYMO routing table.

      *  Statistics Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the DYMO process, typically statistics

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 November 2008


         counters.  There are two types of DYMO statistics: global
         counters and per interface counters.

   o  dymoMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this DYMO MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the DYMO MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus textual convention is imported from RFC 2579 [RFC2579].
   The DymoInterfaceOperStatus is defined within the DYMO MIB.  This
   contains the current operational status of the DYMO interface.

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The DYMO device is configured with a set of controls.  The list of
   configuration controls for the DYMO device follow.

   Protocol Tuning Configuration Parameters:

   o  MSG_HOPLIMIT

   o  ROUTE_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_AGE_MIN_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_AGE_MAX_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_USED_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_DELETE_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_RREQ_WAIT_TIME

   o  RREQ_RETRIES

   o  UNICAST_MESSAGE_SENT_TIMEOUT

   Protocol Configuration Tables:

   o  Interfaces - If DYMO_INTERFACES is set to other than all, then the
      DYMO router must be told which interfaces to run the DYMO protocol
      over.  This is a table containing the interfaces and associated
      information.

   o  Responsible Hosts - If RESPONSIBLE_ADDRESSES is set to other than
      self address, then the DYMO router must be configured with the set
      of host addresses for which it is to generate RREP messages.

5.3.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information.  State
   information from the DYMO-MIB is contained in the 'Peers' Table.

5.3.1.  Peers Table

   The DYMO peers table contains a list of recently known DYMO peer
   nodes participating in the rotuing within the DYMO MANET.  These
   entries age out after a preset time.

5.3.2.  Routing Table

   The DYMO routing table contains DYMO specific information related to
   IP forwarding entries found in the node's IP forwarding table MIB.
   DYMO additional information includes the sequence number associated
   with the DYMO message which generated the forwarding table entry.

5.4.  The Statistics Group

   The Statisctics subtree reports primarily counters that relate to
   DYMO protocol activity.  The DYMO performance statistics consists of
   per node and per interface objects:

   o  OwnSequenceNumber

   o  RREQ initiated

   o  RREQ sent

   o  RREQ received

   o  RREP initiated

   o  RREP sent

   o  RREP received

   o  RRER initiated

   o  RRER sent

   o  RRER received

   o  Per interface statistics table with the following entries:

      *  RREQ initiated

      *  RRER sent

      *  RRER received

5.5.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the DYMO-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.
   This group is currently contains a single notification object related
   to status changes in DYMO interfaces.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The DYMO-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following DYMO-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network



Harnedy, et al.            Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 November 2008


   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writeable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive
      if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unathorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.



Harnedy, et al.            Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 30]

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 November 2008


   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove

Internet-Draft                The DYMO MIB                 November 2008


   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIb Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   The following changes have been made from
   draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-00 .

   Not applicable to draft 00

   1.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the DYMO-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.   Agree on set of configuration options to be supported, e.g.,
        Gateway config, local hosts, responsible addresses, etc.

   2.   Will DYMO require an MANET_ID (Instance ID) for running multiple
        DYMO processes over the same interfaces?

   3.   Incorporate MIB-II IfGroup interworking with DymoIfTable.

   4.   Incorporate MIB-II IpGroup interworking with DymoIfTable.

   5.   Incorporate MIB-II IpForwardingGroup interworking with
        DymoRoutingTable.

   6.   What performance objects are of interest and utility?

   7.   What notifications are of interest and utility?

   8.   Work on the Security Section.  This MIB does have settable
        objects, but not sensitive objects (true?).
