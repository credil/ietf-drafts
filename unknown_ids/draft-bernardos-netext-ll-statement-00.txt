 Applicability Statement on Link Layer implementation/Logical Interface
                   over Multiple Physical Interfaces
                 draft-bernardos-netext-ll-statement-00

Abstract

   The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6
   enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across
   gateways without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides
   limited multi-homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.

   Proxy mobility is based on the assumption that changes in host IP
   stacks are undesirable.  However, link layer implementations can hide
   the actually used physical interfaces from the IP stack.  These
   techniques can be used to achieve inter-access handovers or flow
   mobility, i.e., the movement of selected flows from one access
   technology to another.  It is assumed that an IP layer interface can
   simultaneously and/or sequentially attach to multiple MAGs (possibly
   over multiple media).  This document provides an informational
   applicability statement that analyzes the issues involved with this
   approach and characterizes the contexts in which such use is or is
   not appropriate.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provides network
   based mobility management to hosts connecting to a PMIPv6 domain.
   PMIPv6 introduces two new functional entities, the Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) and the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).  The MAG is the
   first layer three hop detecting Mobile Node's (MN) attachment and
   providing IP connectivity.  The LMA is the entity assigning one or
   more Home Network Prefixes (HNPs) to the MN and is the topological
   anchor for all traffic from/to the MN.

   Proxy mobility is based on the assumption that changes in host IP
   stacks are undesirable.  However, link layer implementations can hide
   the actually used physical interfaces from the IP stack.  These
   techniques can be used to achieve inter-access handovers or flow
   mobility, i.e., the movement of selected flows from one access
   technology to another.  It is assumed that an IP layer interface can
   simultaneously and/or sequentially attach to multiple MAGs (possibly
   over multiple media).  This document provides an informational
   applicability statement that analyzes the issues involved with this
   approach and characterizes the contexts in which such use is or is
   not appropriate.


2.  Hiding access technology changes

   TO BE COMPLETED

   There are several techniques/mechanisms that allow to hide access
   technology changes from host IP layer.  This section classifies these
   existing techniques into a set of generic approaches, according to
   their most representative characteristics.  This would allow to refer
   to these generic mechanisms later in the document, when analyzing
   their applicability to inter-tech and flow mobility purposes in
   PMIPv6.

   So far, we have identified the following generic mechanisms to hide
   access technology changes from host IP layer:

   o  Link layer support: certain link layer technologies are able to
      hide physical media changes from the upper layers.  For example,
      IEEE 802.11 is able to seamlessly change between IEEE 802.11abg
      physical modulations without the IP stack even being aware, as the
      IEEE 802.11 MAC layer takes care of it, making the mecia change
      transparent to the upper layers.  Another example ies IEEE 802.3,
      that support changing the rate from 10Mbps to 100Mbps and to
      1000Mbps. (e.g.  EPS solution, IEEE 802.11).  While the previous
      two changes might seem simple, as they "just" involve physical

      media changes (mainly modulation schemes) between the same two
      communication nodes (e.g., STA and AP in IEEE 802.11), there are
      other examples, with a more complicated architecture.  As an
      example of those, we can refer to 3GPP Rel-8.  A UE can move
      (inter-RAT handover) between GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, being this
      movement transparent to the IP layer at the UE, and also to the
      LMA logical component at the PGW.  The link layer stack at the UE
      (i.e.  PDCP and RLC layers), and the GTP between the RAN and the
      SGW (which plays the role of inter-3GPP AN mobility anchor) hide
      this kind of mobility, which is not visible to the IP layer of the
      UE.

   o  Logical interface: by this name we can group the solutions than
      logically group/bond several physical interfaces so they appear to
      the upper layers (i.e.  IP) as one single interface (where
      application sockets bind).  Depending on the OS support, it might
      be possible to use more than one physical interface at a time --
      so the node is simultaneously attached to different media -- or
      just to provide a fail-over mode.  Controlling the way the
      different media is used (simultaneous, sequential attachment, etc)
      is not trivial and requires additional intelligence and/or
      configuration at the logical interface device driver.  An example
      of this type of solution is the virtual interface or the bonding
      driver.

   o  Layer 2.5 solution: another potential solution is to add a layer
      2.5 on top of the multiple L2 media, that takes care of making
      inter-media support transparent.
