Abstract

   This document presents a performance evaluation of RPL in a single
   DAG scenario, and comparison of the same with shortest path routing
   in a LLN.  Metrics to capture the significant performance aspects are
   identified and detailed simulations are carried out on a set of real-
   life scenarios.

1.  Terminology

      DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph.

      LBR - Low power and lossy network Border Router

      RA-DIO - Router Advertisement DAG Information Option message

      DAO - Destination Advertisement Option

      PDR - Packet Delivery Ratio

   Please refer to additional terminology in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology].


2.  Introduction

   Designing routing in low power devices and lossy link networks
   imposes great challenges, mainly due to low data rates, high
   probability of packet delivery failure, and strict energy constraint
   in nodes.  The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified RPL in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   RPL is designed to meet the core requirements specified in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs],[I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-req
   s],[I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs] and [RFC5548].

   This document's contributions are:

   * To provide a simulation study of RPL in various real-life
   deployment scenarios;

   * To include preliminary evaluation metrics that will be enriched in
   further revision.  Metrics of interest will be of various nature:
   Path quality metrics; Control place overhead; Ability to cope with
   unstable situations (link churns, node dying); Required resource
   constraints on nodes (routing table size, etc.).

   It is to be noted that while simulation cannot prove formally that a
   protocol operates properly in all situations, it could give a good
   level of confidence in protocol behavior in highly stressful
   conditions, if and only if real data are used, as opposed to
   theoretical models that may not be applicable to such networks/
   scenarios.  Therefore, we used real deployed network data to create
   our link model.

3.  Method

   RPL was simulated using OMNET++, a well known event based simulator
   written in C++ and NED.  We also used the Castalia-2.2 Wireless
   Sensor Network Simulator framework within OMNET++.  OMNET++ is freely
   available for academic research use.  The output and events in the
   simulating are visualized with the help of the Network AniMator or
   NAM, which is distributed with NS(Network Simulator).  Note that NS
   or any of its versions were not used in this simulation study.  Only
   the visualization tool was borrowed for verification purposes.  As
   noted, real link layer data gathered from networks deployed on the
   field were used to compute the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) for each
   of the links in the network.  We do not use theoretical models but
   real-life data for two aspects of the simulations:

   * Link failure model: Time varying real network traces containing
   packet delivery probability for each link and over all channels for
   both indoor network deployment and outdoor network deployment were
   used.  Thus, different types of link characteristics are used in the
   study.

   * Topology: The topologies are gathered from real-life deployment
   (traces mentioned above) as opposed to random topology simulations.
   are repeated here:


4.  Simulation Set-up

   We simulate RPL for a given 23 node topology, shown in Figure 1.
   This topology is here repeated for the sake of completeness.  It is
   the topology shown in Figure 8 in Appendix B of [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   Figure 1: Network topology for preliminary simulation results.

   Note that this is just a start to validate the simulation before
   using large scale networks.

   A database of time varying link quality data, gathered from real
   network deployment, was created.  Each link in the topology randomly
   'picks up' a link model from the database, and the link's PDR varies
   according to the gathered data.  Packets are dropped randomly from
   that link with probability (1 - PDR).

   In simulating RPL, the LBR first initiates sending out RA-DIO, and
   gradually the DAG is constructed.  The trickle time interval for
   emitting the RA-DIO assumes the initial value of 1s, and then changes
   over simulation time as mentioned in the draft [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   I_max and I_doubling are initially taken as 1 second and 6 seconds,
   respectively, so that maximum time between two consecutive RA-DIO
   emissions by a node (under a steady network condition) is 1 minute.
   Another objective of this study is to give insight to the network
   administrator on how to tweak the trickle values.  We plan to run
   simulations for large scale networks with varied parameters and show
   how quickly the network will stabilize, comparing data/control
   traffic and studying the tradeoff between reactivity and lifetime.

   Each node in the network, other than the LBR, also emits NA-DAO, to
   initially set up the routing table for all the nodes in the network.

   We assume that each node is capable of storing route information for
   other nodes in the network.  In the next revision we will incorporate
   nodes without storage capability and see the influence of extra
   states on the nodes and the additional control plane overhead to
   propagate the route records.

   In this simulation study, RPL is compared to an ideal shortest path
   routing, where each node has the forwarding information for every
   destination in the network.  The shortest path refers to a path where
   either the number of hops or ETX of packet delivery (depending on the
   OCP used) along the path is minimum for any given source and
   destination pair.  To be noted, this comparison aims at giving an
   insight on how worse the Point-to-Point path may be compared to the
   ideal path.

   For nodes implementing RPL, the routing table memory requirement
   varies depending on the position in the DAG.  We make the worst-case
   assumption that there is no route summarization in the network.  Thus
   a node closer to the DAG will have to store more routing entries.
   Further revision of this document will explore the influence of
   performing route summarization along the DAG, which could be
   performed thanks to a newly defined Objective Function.  Also,
   initially we assume that all nodes have equal capacity to store the
   routing states of nodes in its sub-DAG.

   Each node also periodically (a few packets per hour)sends CBR
   (Constant Bit Rate) traffic to all other nodes in the network over
   the simulation period.

   The packets are routed through the DAG as mentioned in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   We do not make any assumption on the link layer, thus potential gains
   in terms of header compression provided by 6loWPAN is not under
   consideration [draft-iphc].


5.  Metrics to evaluate RPL

   Routing Table Size: As the NA-DAO messages help to construct the
   routing table in the node, we record the routing table size for each
   node in the network.  Currently, the routing table size is not in
   exact Kb of memory usage, but we measure it in terms of number of
   entries for each node.  Each entry has next hop node and distance
   associated with the destination node.  In further revision we will
   use a single full 128-bit address per leaf plus a few bits to store
   other information and flags.

Internet-Draft      draft-tripathi-rpl-simulation-00        October 2009


   Hops to destination: We record the number of hops each packet
   travels.  The aim of this metric is to determine how optimal is the
   path computed by the DAG compared to an optimal path computed by an
   "ideal" shortest path routing protocol.  This allows for evaluating
   if the path cost is good enough, in particular for applications
   involving point-to-point traffic.

   Although simulations have been run on different and realistic
   topologies showing consistent results, the metrics discussed here may
   vary with the network topology.

5.1.  Simulation Results

   Routing Table Size :

   Number of Hops:

   We currently concentrate on hop counts, but further revision will
   address several metrics as in [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics], such
   as reliability, energy, etc., with the objective of evaluating RPL's
   path quality for new metrics, combination of metrics and constraints.
