      <abstract>

         <t>Over time, Web browsers have adapted how they use HTTP based upon
         common server configurations and behaviours. While this is necessary
         in the common case, it can be detrimental for performance and
         interoperability.</t>

         <t>This document establishes a mechanism whereby origin servers can make
         available hints for browsers about their preferences and
         capabilities, without imposing overhead on their interactions or
         requiring support for them.</t>

         <t>This is intended to allow browsers to safely optimise connections
         to servers.</t>

      <section title="Introduction">

        <t>HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> clients -- especially browsers --
        typically use hardcoded values or heuristics to determine how many TCP
        connections to use to a server, based on common-case server behaviours
        and limitations.</t>

        <t>Likewise, they often send voluminous request headers (e.g., in
        User-Agent and Allow) because they fear that changing those headers'
        values will break some sites that depend upon specific values.</t>

        <t>These are just two examples of common, conservative behaviour by
          browsers that is good for interoperability, but potentially bad
          for performance in certain circumstances.</t>

        <t>This memo proposes a mechanism whereby a HTTP server can advertise
        hints for browsers (and other clients), so that communication with
        them can be optimised.</t>

        <t>It does so by defining a file format for such Browser Hints <xref
        target="format"/>, and defining how clients can discover it for a
        given Web site <xref target="discover"/>. Finally, an extensible
        vocabulary of hints is defined <xref target="hints"/>.</t>

        <t>Feedback for this draft should take place on the
        apps-discuss@ietf.org mailing list 
				<eref target="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss"/>.

      <section title="Requirements">
         <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
         NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
         this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
         target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="A file format for Browser Hints" anchor="format">

        <t>Browser hints are indicating using a JSON <xref target="RFC4627"/>
        formatted file, containing a single object whose member's names are
        browser hints, as defined by the registry <xref
        target="registry"/>.</t>

        <t>For example;</t>
        
        <figure><artwork>
          {
          "max-conns": 5,
          "small-hdrs": true
          }
        </artwork></figure>

        <t>By their nature, all browser hints are optional; i.e., browsers are
        free to ignore them.</t>

				<section title="The 'prefixlist' Value Type">
					
					<t>Each browser hint is defined to have a JSON-derived value type;
          e.g., 'string' or 'array'. This section defines a special value
          type, 'prefixlist' that is an array containing one or more arrays,
          each containing a path prefix followed by either 'true' or 'false'
          to indicate whether the hint applies to that path.</t>

					<t>Prefixlists are evaluated in order, with the first
          case-sensitive, character-by-character prefix match for a given
          URI's path determining whether the hint applies.</t>

					<t>For example, given the following hint document:</t>
					
        	<figure><artwork>
{
  "omit-cookies": [
    ["/images/users/", false],
    ["/images/", true]
  ]
}
</artwork></figure>

					<t>We can tell that "omit-cookies" applies to resources under the
						"/images/" path (such as "/images/123.jpg"), except for those 
						under "/images/users/" (such as "/images/users/bob.jpg").</t>

					<t>If a value specified to be a prefixlist is either 'true' or
						'false' that indicates that the hint applies to the whole site,
						or does not apply to the whole site, respectively.</t>
						
					<t>For example,</t>

        	<figure><artwork>
{
  "omit-cookies": true
}
</artwork></figure>

					<t>Indicates that the "omit-cookies" hint applies to the entire
						site.</t>
					
					<t>Prefixlists can only be used when the browser hint's registration
						nominates their use.</t>

      <section title="Discovering Browser Hints for a Web site" anchor="discover">

        <t>The hints relevant to a given site can be determined by fetching
        the URI path "/.well-known/browser-hints" for that site.</t>

        <t>Typically, clients (especially browsers) will not block other 
          requests to a site while fetching the browser hints (because 
          they're optional); instead, it will usually be done concurrently
          with other requests, or on idle connections for future use.</t>

        <t>In this specification, "site" is scoped by the URI scheme and
        authority. As such, all of the following are considered to be
        different sites, and therefore have different browser hints:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>http://foo.com/</t>
          <t>https://foo.com/</t>
          <t>http://foo.com:8000/</t>
          <t>http://www.foo.com/</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Clients SHOULD follow HTTP 3xx redirects when retrieving
        hints.</t>

        <t>A successful response is valid for its associated site for as long
        as it can be cached in HTTP.</t>

        <t>If the response has a 200 status code but no explicit freshness
        (e.g., a Cache-Control: max-age or Expires: header), clients SHOULD
        cache the response heuristically for a generous fixed period (e.g., 14
        days).</t>

				<t>If the response has a 404 status code but no explicit freshness,
					clients SHOULD cache the response heuristically for a generous
					fixed period (e.g., 14 days).</t>

              <t>Browser Hint Name: max-conns</t>

              <t>Browser Hint Name: pconn-ip</t>
              <t>Description: When true, this hint indicates that the site
              allows clients to reuse persistent connections keyed by IP
              address, rather than by hostname. Note that all sites that are 
              sharing the connection MUST declare this hint for it to be
              used, and if a transport-layer certificate is in use 
              (e.g., for TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>), it MUST be valid 
              for all sites.</t>

          </t>

          <t>In other words, if both www.example.com and foo.example.org resolve
            to the address 192.0.2.5, and indicate this hint, then clients
            can send a request to www.example.com and then a request to 
            foo.example.org on the same TCP connection to that address.</t>
            
          <t>If any of the sites grouped together for the purposes of
            pconn-ip declare a max-conns hint, the max-conns value for that 
            address is considered to be the maximum of the declared 
            max-conn hints present.</t>

       <t>New hints are registered First Come First Served (see 
         <xref target="RFC5226"/>), by sending e-mail to <eref 
         target="mailto:iana@iana.org"/> (or using other mechanisms, as
         established by IANA).</t>
         
       <t>Registration requests MUST use the following template:</t>
       
       <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Browser Hint Name: [name of hint]</t>
            <t>Description: [description of hint]</t>

       <t>New hints MUST be optional; they cannot place requirements upon

       <t>Likewise, new hints MUST be relevant to browser use
       cases; other non-browsing hints and metadata would make the hints
       response undesirably large. However, note that non-browser clients
       MAY use them.</t>
       
       <t>Finally, new hints MUST NOT make communication non-conformant with
         HTTP itself; i.e., this is not a mechanism for changing the HTTP
         protocol in incompatible ways. For example, if a hint indicates
         that browsers can compress request headers using GZIP, intermediaries
         that are interposed are likely to fail.</t>
      
       <t>The initial contents of the registry are defined in
