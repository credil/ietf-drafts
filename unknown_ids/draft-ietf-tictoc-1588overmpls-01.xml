      <t> This document defines the method for transporting PTP messages (PDUs)
   over an MPLS network to enable a proper handling of these
   packets (e.g. implementation of Transparent Clocks (TC)) in LSRs.
 	</t>

        <t>The basic idea is to transport PTP messages inside dedicated MPLS
   LSPs. These LSPs only carry PTP messages and possibly Control and
   Management packets, but they do not carry customer traffic.
	</t>

	<t>Two methods for transporting 1588 over MPLS are defined. The first
   method is to transport PTP messages directly over the dedicated MPLS
   LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which is suitable for IP/MPLS networks.
   The second method is to transport PTP messages inside a PW via
   Ethernet encapsulation, which is more suitable for MPLS-TP networks.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> The objective of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is to synchronize
			 independent clocks running on separate nodes of a distributed system. 
		     <xref target="IEEE"></xref> defines PTP messages for clock and time 
			synchronization. The PTP messages include PTP PDUs over UDP/IP 
			(Annex D & E of <xref target="IEEE"></xref>) and PTP PDUs over Ethernet 
			(Annex F of <xref target="IEEE"></xref>). This document defines mapping and transport 
			of the PTP messages defined in <xref target="IEEE"></xref> over MPLS networks.
	</t>

	<t>PTP defines intermediate clock functions (called transparent clocks) 
		between the source of time (Master) and the Slave clocks. Boundary 
		Clocks (BC) form Master-Slave hierarchy with the Master clock as root. 
		The messages related to synchronization, establishing the Master-Slave hierarchy, 
		and signaling, terminate in the protocol engine of a boundary clock and are not forwarded. 
		Management messages however, are forwarded to other ports on the boundary clock.
   </t> 
	<t>Transparent clocks modify a "correction field" (CF) within the synchronization 
		messages to compensate for residence and propagation delays. 
		Transparent clocks do not terminate synchronization, Master-Slave hierarchy 
		control messages or signaling messages.
	</t>
	 <t>There is a need to transport PTP messages over MPLS networks. 
		The MPLS network could be a transit network between 1588 Masters and Slaves. 
		The accuracy of the recovered clock improves and the Slave logic simplifies when
		 intermediate nodes (e.g. LSRs) properly handle PTP messages (e.g. perform TC), 
		otherwise the jitter at the 1588 Slave may be excessive and therefore the Slave 
		may not be able to properly recover the clock and time of day.
	  </t>

		<t> This document defines a "1588-aware LSR" that is able to identify 1588 timing flows
		   carried over MPLS.

		</t>
		<t> Transparent Clock (TC) function requires a 1588-aware LSR in the middle of an LSP to identify 
				the PTP messages and perform proper update of the CF, via a 1-step or 2-step process. </t>

		<t> More generally this document requires that an LSR should be able 
			to properly handle the PTP messages. For instance for those cases when
			the TC function is not viable (e.g. due to layer violation) as an alternative 
			it should be possible to instead control the delay for these messages on 
			both directions across the node. </t>

		<t> In the above cases it is beneficial that PTP packets can be easily 
			identified when carried over MPLS. </t>

		<t> This document provides two methods for transporting PTP messages over MPLS. 
				The main objectives are for LSRs to be able to deterministically detect and 
				identify the PTP messages.

 </t>

  </section>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
	<t> When PTP messages are transported over MPLS networks, there is a need
			for intermediate LSRs to detect such messages and perform proper
			processing (e.g. Transparent Clock (TC)). Note the TC processing could be in
			the form of 1-Step or 2-Step time stamping. </t>

	<t> PTP messages over Ethernet or IP can always be tunneled over MPLS.  
			However the 1588 over MPLS mapping defined in this document is applicable 
			whenever MPLS LSRs are 1588-aware and the intention is for those LSRs to 
			perform proper processing on these packets. </t>

	<t> When 1588-awareness is needed, PTP messages should not be
		 transported over LSPs or PWs that are carrying customer traffic because 
		LSRs perform Label switching based on the top label in the stack. To detect PTP
		 messages inside such LSPs require special Hardware (HW) to do deep packet
		inspection at line rate. Even if one assumes a deep packet inspection HW at line 
		rate exists, the payload can't be deterministically identified by LSRs because the 
		payload type is a context of the PW label and the PW label and its context are only 
		known to the Edge routers (PEs) and LSRs don't know what is a PW's payload 
		(Ethernet, ATM, FR, CES, etc). Even if one assumes only Ethernet PWs are permitted 
		in an LSP, the LSRs don't have the knowledge of whether PW Control Word (CW)
		 is present or not and   therefore can't deterministically identify the payload. </t>

	<t> Therefore a generic method is defined in this document that does not require 
		deep packet inspection at line rate, and can deterministically identify PTP messages. 
		The defined method is applicable to both MPLS and MPLS-TP networks. </t>
    </section>

<section title="Dedicated LSPs for PTP messages">
	<t> Many methods were considered for identifying the 1588 
		messages when they are encapsulated in MPLS such as by using GAL/ACH 
		or a new reserved label. These methods were not attractive since they 
		either required deep packet inspection and snooping at line rate or they 
		required use of scarce new reserved label. Also one of the goals was to
		reuse existing OAM and protection mechanisms. </t>

	<t> The method defined in this document can be used by LSRs to identify 
		PTP messages in MPLS tunnels by using dedicated LSPs to carry PTP messages. </t>

	<t> Compliant implementations MUST use dedicated LSPs to carry PTP messages 
		over MPLS. Let's call these LSPs as the "PTP LSPs" and the labels associated 
		with these LSPs as "PTP labels". These LSPs could be P2P or P2MP LSPs. 
		The PTP LSP between Master and Slaves MAY be P2MP or P2P LSP while the 
		PTP LSP between each Slave and Master SHOULD be P2P LSP. The PTP LSP 
		between a Master and a Slave and the PTP LSP between the same Slave and 
		Master MUST be co-routed. Alternatively, a single bidirectional co-routed LSP
		 can be used. The PTP LSP MAY be MPLS LSP or MPLS-TP LSP. </t>

	<t> The PTP LSPs could be configured or signaled via RSVP-TE/GMPLS. New   
		RSVP-TE/GMPLS TLVs and objects are defined in this document to indicate
		 that these LSPs are PTP LSPs. </t>

	<t> We should be selective about the kind of traffic that flows over PTP LSPs 
as these will be handled as a special case by the LSR. The only LSP user 
plane traffic MUST be PTP, but the LSP MAY also carry essential 
MPLS/MPLS-TP control plane traffic such as BFD and LSP-Ping.</t>

 <section anchor="1588oMPLS" title="1588 over MPLS Encapsulation">
 <t>
	This document defines two methods for carrying PTP messages over 
	MPLS.  The first method is carrying IP encapsulated PTP messages 
	over PTP LSPs and the second method is to carry PTP messages 
	over dedicated Ethernet PWs (called PTP PWs) inside PTP LSPs.
	</t>
	<section anchor="1588oLSP" title="1588 over LSP Encapsulation">
	<t> The simplest method of transporting PTP messages over MPLS is
		 to encapsulate PTP PDUs in UDP/IP and then encapsulate them in PTP LSP.  
		The 1588 over LSP format is shown in Figure 1. </t>

	<t> In order for an LSR to process PTP messages, the PTP Label must 
		 be the top label of the label stack. </t>

	<t> The UDP/IP encapsulation of PTP MUST follow Annex D and E of <xref target="IEEE"></xref>.

<section anchor="1588oPW" title="1588 over PW Encapsulation">
	<t> Another method of transporting 1588 over MPLS networks is by
     	 encapsulating PTP PDUs in Ethernet and then transporting them over
		Ethernet PW (PTP PW) as defined in <xref target="RFC4448" />, which in turn is
		transported over PTP LSPs. Alternatively PTP PDUs MAY be encapsulated
		in UDP/IP/Ethernet and then transported over Ethernet PW. </t>

	<t> Both Raw and Tagged modes for Ethernet PW are permitted. 
		The 1588 over PW format is shown in Figure 2. </t>

<t> The Control Word (CW) as specified in <xref target="RFC4448" />
	 SHOULD be used to ensure a more robust detection of PTP messages 
	inside the MPLS packet. If CW is used, the use of Sequence number is optional. </t>

<t> The use of VLAN and UDP/IP are optional. Note that 1 or 2 VLANs MAY exist in the PW payload.</t>

<t> In order for an LSR to process PTP messages, the top label of the label stack 
	(the Tunnel Label) MUST be from PTP label range. However in some applications the 
	PW label may be the top label in the stack, such as cases where there is only 
	one-hop between PEs or in case of PHP. In such cases, the PW label 
	SHOULD be chosen from the PTP Label range. </t>

<t> An Entropy label <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-fat-pw" /> MAY be present at the bottom of stack.</t>

<t> The Ethernet encapsulation of PTP MUST follow Annex F of <xref target="IEEE"></xref>
	and the UDP/IP encapsulation of PTP MUST follow Annex D and E of <xref target="IEEE"></xref>.
</t>

<t>For 1588 over MPLS encapsulations that are PW based,
	 there are some cases in which the 
	PTP LSP label may not be present: </t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t> When PHP is applied to the PTP LSP, and the packet is received 
	   without PTP LSP label at PW termination point .</t>
<t>When the PW is established between two routers directly connected 
      to each other and no PTP LSP is needed.</t>
 </list></t>
<t>In such cases it is required for a router to identify these packets as PTP packets.  
	 This would require the PW label to also be a label that is distributed specifically for carrying 
      PTP traffic (aka PTP PW label).  Therefore there is a need to add extension to LDP/BGP 
      PW label distribution protocol to indicate that a PW label is a PTP PW labels.</t>

<section anchor="1588oMPLSW" title="1588 over pure MPLS mode">
<t> Editor Note: The encapsulation is general enough and can support transporting
       1588 in a pure MPLS mode (i.e., without any IP/UDP or Ethernet headers).
       Should the WG pursue this?
</t>
</section>
 </section>

    <section anchor="MessageTransport" title="1588 Message Transport">
	<t> 1588 protocol comprises of the following message types: 	</t>
	<t><list style="symbols">
	<t> Announce </t>
	<t> SYNC</t>
<t> FOLLOW UP</t>
<t> DELAY REQ (Delay Request)</t>

<t> PDELAY RESP FOLLOW UP (Peer Delay Response Follow up)</t>
<t> Management </t>
<t> Signaling </t>
 </list></t>

<t>A subset of PTP message types that require TC processing are called Event messages: </t>
	<t><list style="symbols">
<t> SYNC</t>
<t> DELAY REQ (Delay Request)</t>
<t> PDELAY REQ (Peer Delay Request)</t>
<t> PDELAY RESP (Peer Delay Response)</t>
 </list></t>

<t> SYNC and DELAY_REQ are exchanged between Master and 
	Slave and MUST be transported over PTP LSPs. PDELAY_REQ and 
	PDELAY_RESP are exchanged between adjacent routers and MAY be 
	transported over single hop PTP LSPs. If Two Step Transparent clocks are present, 
   then the FOLLOW_UP and DELAY_RESP messages must also be transported over the PTP LSPs.
</t>

	<t> For a given instance of 1588 protocol, SYNC and DELAY_REQ MUST 
	be transported over two PTP LSPs that are in opposite directions. 
These PTP LSPs, which are in opposite directions MUST be congruent and co-routed. 
	Alternatively, a single bidirectional co-routed LSP can be used. </t>

	<t> Except as indicated above for the two-step Transparent clocks, 
     Non-Event PTP message types don't need to be processed by
	 intermediate routers. These message types MAY be carried in PTP Tunnel LSPs. 
</t>
     </section>
<section anchor="Protection" title="Protection and Redundancy">
<t>In order to ensure continuous uninterrupted operation of 1588 Slaves, 
	usually as a general practice, Redundant Masters are tracked by each 
	Slave. It is the responsibility of the network operator to ensure that physically 
	disjoint PTP tunnels that don't share any link are used between the redundant 
	Masters and a Slave. </t>

	<t> When redundant Masters are tracked by a Slave, any PTP LSP or PTP PW 
	failure will trigger the slave to switch to the Redundant Master.
However LSP/PW protection such as Linear Protection Switching (1:1,1+1), 
	Ring protection switching or MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) SHOULD still be used to 
ensure the LSP/PW is ready for a future failure. </t>

 <t> Note that any protection or reroute mechanism that adds additional 
	label to the label stack, such as Facility Backup Fast Reroute, MUST 
	ensure that the pushed label is a PTP Label to ensure proper processing of 
	PTP messages by LSRs in the backup path.
	</t>
</section>

    <section anchor="ECMP" title="ECMP">
      <t>To ensure the proper operation of 1588 Slaves, the physical path for 
	PTP messages from Master to Slave and vice versa must be the same for 
	all PTP messages listed in section 7 and must not change even in the 
	presence of ECMP in the MPLS network.</t>

	<t> To ensure the forward and reverse paths are the same PTP LSPs 
	and PWs MUST not be subject to ECMP.	</t>
     </section>
<section anchor="OAM" title="OAM, Control and Management">
      <t>In order to manage PTP LSPs and PTP PWs, they MAY carry OAM, 
		Control and Management messages. These control and management messages 
	can be   differentiated from PTP messages via already defined IETF methods. </t>

    <t>In particular BFD <xref target="RFC5880" />, <xref target="RFC5884" />
          and LSP-Ping <xref target="RFC4389" />MAY run over PTP LSPs via 
		UDP/IP encapsulation or via GAL/G-ACH. These Management protocols are 
	easily identified by the UDP Destination Port number or by GAL/ACH respectively.</t>

  <t> Also BFD, LSP-Ping and other Management messages MAY run over 
			PTP PW via one of the defined VCCVs (Type 1, 2 or 3) <xref target="RFC5085" />.
	 In this case G-ACH, Router Alert Label (RAL), or PW label (TTL=1) are used to identify such 
	management messages.
      </t>
</section>

<section anchor="QoS" title="QoS Considerations">
      <t>The PTP messages are time critical and must be treated with the highest priority. 
			Therefore 1588 over MPLS messages must be treated with the highest priority in 
		the routers. This can be achieved by proper setup of PTP tunnels. It is recommended that the PTP LSPs 
		are setup and marked properly to indicate EF-PHB for the CoS and Green for drop eligibility.

<section anchor="FCS" title="FCS Recalculation">
      <t>Ethernet FCS of the outer encapsulation MUST be recalculated

</section>

<section anchor="UDP" title="UDP Checksum Correction">
      <t>For UDP/IP encapsulation mode of 1588 over MPLS, the UDP checksum is optional
            when used for  IPv4 encapsulation and mandatory in case of IPv6.
            When IPv4/v6 UDP checksum is used each 1588-aware LSR must either incrementally 
            update the UDP checksum after the CF update or should verify the UDP checksum 
             on reception from upstream and recalculate the checksum completely  on
           transmission after CF update to downstream node.
      </t>
</section>

<section anchor="Routing" title="Routing extensions for 1588aware LSRs">
      <t>MPLS-TE routing relies on extensions to OSPF <xref target="RFC2328" /> <xref target="RFC5340"></xref>
            and IS-IS <xref target="ISO"></xref>  <xref target="RFC1195"></xref>  in order to advertise 
		Traffic Engineering (TE) link information used for constraint-based routing.</t>

	<t> Indeed, it is useful to advertise data plane TE router link capabilities, 
		such as the capability for a router to be 1588-aware.  
		This capability MUST then be taken into account during path 
		computation to prefer links that advertise themselves as 1588-aware, 
		so that the PTP LSPs can be properly handled.</t>

	<t> For this purpose, the following sections specify extensions to OSPF and IS-IS in order to 
		advertise 1588 aware capabilities of a link. 
      </t>

   <section anchor="OSPFCapability" title="1588aware Link Capability for OSPF">

	<t> OSPF uses the Link TLV  (Type 2)  that is itself carried within either the 
           Traffic Engineering LSA specified in <xref target="RFC3630" /> 
           or the OSPFv3 Intra-Area-TE LSA (function code 10) defined in  <xref target="RFC5329" />
          to advertise the TE related information for the locally attached router links. For an LSA Type 10, one
			LSA can contain one Link TLV information for a single link. This extension defines a 
            new 1588-aware capability sub-TLV that can be carried as part of the Link TLV.
	</t>

	<t> The 1588-aware capability sub-TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT appear more than
           once  within the Link TLV. If a second instance of the 1588-aware capability sub-TLV
            is present, the receiving system MUST only process the first instance of the sub-TLV.
			It  is defined as follows:</t>

		<xref target="RFC5305" /> to carry the per link TE-related information.
       This extension defines a new 1588-aware capability sub-TLV that can be

<t> The format of the IS-IS 1588-aware sub-TLV is identical to
   the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS-IS

<section title="Behavior of LER/LSR">
<section title="Behavior of 1588-aware LER">
      <t> A 1588-aware LER advertises it's 1588-awareness via the OSPF 
		procedure explained in earlier section of this specification. The 1588-aware LER
	 then signals PTP LSPs by including the 1588_PTP_LSP object in the RSVP-TE signaling. </t>

<t> When a 1588 message is received from a non-MPLS interface, the LER MUST 
	redirect them to a previously established PTP LSP. When a 1588 over MPLS message 
	is received from an MPLS interface, the processing is similar to 1588-aware LSR processing. </t>
</section>

<section title="Behavior of 1588-aware LSR">
      <t> 1588-aware LSRs are LSRs that understand the 1588_PTP_LSP RSVP 
	object and can perform 1588 processing (e.g. TC processing). </t>

<t> A 1588-aware LSR advertises it's 1588-awareness via the OSPF procedure 
	explained in earlier section of this specification.</t>

<t>When a 1588-aware LSR distributes a label for PTP LSP, 
	it maintains this information. When the 1588-aware LSR receives an 
	MPLS packet, it performs a label lookup and if the label lookup indicates it is a 
	PTP label then further parsing must be done to positively identify that the payload 
	is 1588 and not OAM, BFD or control and management.  Ruling out non-1588 
	messages can easily be done when parsing indicates the presence of GAL, ACH or 
	VCCV (Type 1, 2, 3) or when the UDP port number does not match one of the 1588 UDP port numbers.
</t>

<t>After a 1588 message is positively identified in a PTP LSP, the
	 PTP message type indicates what type of processing (TC) if any is 
	required. After 1588 processing the packet is forwarded as a normal MPLS packet
	 to downstream node.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Behavior of non-1588-aware LSR">
      <t> It is most beneficial that all LSRs in the path of a PTP LSP be
		 1588-aware LSRs. This would ensure the highest quality time and clock 
		synchronization by 1588 Slaves. However, this specification does not mandate 
		that all LSRs in path of a PTP LSP be 1588-aware. </t>

<t>Non-1588-aware LSRs are LSRs that either don't have the 
	capability to process 1588 packets (e.g. TC processing) or don't understand 
	the 1588_PTP_LSP RSVP object.</t>

<t>Non-1588-aware LSRs ignore the RSVP 1588_PTP_LSP object and
	 just switch the MPLS packets carrying 1588 messages as data packets 
	and don't perform any TC processing. However as explained in QoS section 
	the 1588 over MPLS packets MUST be still be treated with the highest priority.
</t>
</section>
</section>

    <section title="Other considerations">
      <t>The use of Explicit Null (Label= 0 or 2) is acceptable as long 
			as either the Explicit Null label is the bottom of stack label 
			(applicable only to UDP/IP encapsulation) or the label below the 
			Explicit Null label is a PTP label.
      </t>
	 <t>The use of Penultimate Hop Pop (PHP) is acceptable as long as 
			either the PHP label is the bottom of stack label (applicable only to UDP/IP 
			encapsulation) or the label below the PHP label is a PTP label.

     </section>
    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> MPLS PW security considerations in general are 
			discussed in <xref target="RFC3985" /> and <xref target="RFC4447" />,and those 
			considerations also apply to this document. </t>

	 <t> An experimental security protocol is defined in [IEEE]. The 
			PTP security extension and protocol provides group source authentication, 
			message integrity, and replay attack protection for PTP messages.</t>
