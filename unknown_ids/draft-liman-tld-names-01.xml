      <t>The precise syntax allowed in top-level domain name labels
	has been the subject to some debate. RFC 1123, for example,
	makes the statement that top-level domain names are
	"alphabetic".  This document updates the definition of
	allowable top-level domain names in order to support
	internationalized domain names (IDNs), as encoded by the IDNA
	protocols.  This document focuses narrowly on the issue of
	IDNs and does not make any other changes or clarifications to
	existing domain name syntax rules.

    <section title="Introduction">



      <t>The precise syntax allowed in top-level domain (TLD) name
	labels has been the subject to some debate.
	<xref target="RFC1123">RFC 1123</xref>, for example, states
	that TLD names must be "alphabetic", which is interpreted as
	excluding the hyphen (or dash) character. This document
	updates the definition of allowable top-level domain names to
	support internationalized domain names that consist of Unicode
	letters, as encoded by the IDNA protocols [RFCXXX]. In
	particular, this document clarifies that ASCII TLDs beginning
	with the IDN A-label prefix (currently "xn--"), as encoded by
	IDNA, are permissible as DNS TLD names as long as they are
	made from Unicode letters. This document focuses narrowly on
	the issue of allowable ASCII labels encoded by the IDNA
	protocols and does not (and is not intended to) make any other
	changes or clarifications to existing domain name syntax
	rules.

    <section title="Background">

      <t><xref target="RFC0952">RFC 0952</xref> states (among other
      things) that a host name is;
      </t>

      <t>
	<list style="empty">
	  <t>
	    ... a text string up to 24 characters drawn from the
	    alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus sign (-), and period
	    (.).  Note that periods are only allowed when they serve
	    to delimit components of "domain style names". (See
	    RFC-921, "Domain Name System Implementation Schedule", for
	    background).  No blank or space characters are permitted
	    as part of a name. No distinction is made between upper
	    and lower case.  The first character must be an alpha
	    character.  The last character must not be a minus sign or
	    period.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	<xref target="RFC1123">RFC 1123</xref> reaffirms this
	definition, making two additional changes to the syntax:
      </t>

      <t>
	<list style="empty">
	  <t>
	    The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified in
	    RFC-952 [DNS:4].  One aspect of host name syntax is hereby
	    changed: the restriction on the first character is relaxed
	    to allow either a letter or a digit.  Host software MUST
	    support this more liberal syntax.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	and
      </t>

      <t>
	<list style="empty">
	  <t>
            However, a valid host name can never have the
            dotted-decimal form #.#.#.#, since at least the
            highest-level component label will be alphabetic.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	The restrictions on host names and specifically TLD names
	have always been, at least in part, driven by human factors
	considerations.  Underscores in host names are avoided because
	they are indistinguishable from hyphens when seen on a page or
	written in longhand, and to some extent because of early
	internationalization issues.  The original "no leading digits"
	rule was driven by wanting to make sure that even imprecise
	programming or human thought errors didn't confuse addresses
	with names.
      </t>

      <t>The wish to express TLD names in other scripts than Latin
	makes it necessary to relax the the rules for TLD
	names. However, the old motivations for keeping the TLD names
	alphabetical still hold, and furthermore, certain
	characteristics of some IDN names with digits in them make
	them unsuitable as DNS labels. The problem is referred to as
	"jumping digits", and is described in draft-ietf-idnabis-bidi.
      </t>

      <t>
	In order to keep changes to existing specifications to a
	minimum but to still allow for IDN TLD names, this document
	hereby changes the existing specification to allow for IDN TLD
	names in the "A-label form" as specified by the IDNA-2008
	specifications, i.e., an ASCII-compatible-encoding, using
	reversible Punycode conversion from valid IDN labels, with
	IDN A-label prefix (currently "xn--"), but requiring that the
	native-character ("Unicode") form consist of letters only.
      </t>

      <figure>

        <preamble>Hence, the ABNF expression that matches a valid TLD
        label is as follows:</preamble>

        <artwork type="abnf">

          tldlabel = traditional-tld-label / idn-label

          traditional-tld-label = 1*63(ALPHA)

          idn-label = Restricted-A-label

          ALPHA    = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z

        </artwork>

      </figure>

      <t>
	Restricted-A-label is an A-label as defined in
	draft-ietf-idna-defs converted from (and convertible to) a
	U-label that is consistent with the definition in
	draft-ietf-idna-defs and that is further restricted to
	contain only Unicode characters of General Category "L".  Note
	that "L" contains several sub-categories.  The list is:
      </t>

      <figure>

        <artwork type="abnf">

          ; Letter
          L = Ll / Lm / Lo / Lt / Lu

          Ll = Lowercase-Letter

          Lm = Modifier-Letter

          Lo = Other-Letter

          Lt = Titlecase-Letter

          Lu = Uppercase-Letter

        </artwork>

      </figure>

      <t>
	although IDNA prohibits (categorizes as DISALLOWED) all
	characters in the last two categories and several of the
	characters that fall into the other categories.
      </t>

      <t>
	This new specification reflects current practice in
        registration of TLD names by the IANA, and allows for IDNs.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Other Limitations on Top Level Domain Labels">

      <t>
	It should be noted that there are many issues that must be
	considered in making any changes to current restrictions on
	DNS labels, especially at the top level. DNS software is
	widely deployed, and some of that software contains embedded
	assumptions that may not hold if DNS names are used at the top
	level that differ from the older rules. For example, when TLDs
	longer than 3 characters became available (e.g., .info,
	.museum, etc.), some deployed systems did not process such DNS
	names properly. This document does not take the position that
	no problems will result when IDN TLDs are created, but does
	recognize that relaxing the syntax of allowed TLDs is
	necessary in order to allow deployment of IDNs to happen.
      </t>

      <t>
	It is also carefully noted that the above specification is not
        the only limiting factor on TLD labels.  There may be other
        entities than the IETF that have influence over TLD names, and
        which may decide to restrict the names further.  The above
        technical specification is just one limiting factor.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">

      <t>
	This memo changes the specifications for TLD names registered
        by the IANA, and the IANA is requested to change its
        registration process to use the above specification.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>
	This document is believed to have limited security
	consequences.
      </t>

      <t>It may introduce stability issues where names registered
        under this new specification may inter-operate badly with old
        software written to enforce a strict interpretation of the old
        specification.  This might also open up attack vectors
        (e.g. form names being truncated). However, it is believed that
        such software is scarce on the Internet, and since TLD names
        that do not adhere to a strict interpretation of the old
        specification are already used (including test IDNs) without
        apparent problems, it is believed that this change of the
        specification will not create major stability or security
        problems on the Internet.
