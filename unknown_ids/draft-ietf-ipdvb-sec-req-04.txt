1. Introduction 

   The MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) has been widely accepted not 
   only for providing digital TV services, but also as a subnetwork 
   technology for building IP networks. RFC 4326 [RFC4326] describes 
   the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) mechanism for 
   the transport of IPv4 and IPv6 Datagrams and other network 
   protocol packets directly over the ISO MPEG-2 Transport Stream as 
   TS Private Data.  ULE specifies a base encapsulation format and 
   supports an extension format that allows it to carry additional 
   header information to assist in network/Receiver processing. The

   encapsulation satisfies the design and architectural requirement 
   for a lightweight encapsulation defined in RFC 4259 [RFC4259]. 

   Section 3.1 of RFC 4259 presents several topological scenarios 
   for MPEG-2 Transmission Networks. A summary of these scenarios 
   are presented below (for full detail, please refer to RFC 4259): 

   1. Broadcast TV and Radio Delivery.  

   2. Broadcast Networks used as an ISP. This resembles to scenario 
      1, but includes the provision of IP services providing access 
      to the public Internet.  

   3. Unidirectional Star IP Scenario. It utilizes a Hub station to 
      provide a data network delivering a common bit stream to 
      typically medium-sized groups of Receivers.  

   4. Datacast Overlay. It employs MPEG-2 physical and link layers 
      to provide additional connectivity such as unidirectional 
      multicast to supplement an existing IP-based Internet service.  

   5. Point-to-Point Links.  

   6. Two-Way IP Networks. This can be typically satellite-based and 
      star-based utilising a Hub station to deliver a common bit 
      stream to medium- sized groups of receivers. A bidirectional 
      service is provided over a common air-interface.  

   RFC 4259 states that ULE must be robust to errors and security 
   threats. Security must also consider both unidirectional as well 
   as bidirectional links for the scenarios mentioned above.  

   An initial analysis of the security requirements in MPEG-2 
   transmission networks is presented in the security considerations 
   section of RFC 4259. For example, when such networks are not 
   using a wireline network, the normal security issues relating to 
   the use of wireless links for transport of Internet traffic 
   should be considered [RFC3819].  

   The security considerations of RFC 4259 recommends that any new 
   encapsulation defined by the IETF should allow Transport Stream 
   encryption and should also support optional link-layer 
   authentication of the SNDU payload. In ULE [RFC4326], it is 
   suggested that this may be provided in a flexible way using 
   Extension Headers. This requires the definition of a mandatory 
   header extension, but has the advantage that it decouples 
   specification of the security functions from the encapsulation

   functions.  

   This document extends the above analysis and derives a detailed 
   the security requirements for ULE in MPEG-2 transmission 
   networks. 

   A security framework for deployment of secure ULE networks 
   describing the different building blocks and the interface 
   definitions is presented in Appendix A.  

2. Requirements notation 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

   Other terms used in this document are defined below: 

   ATSC: Advanced Television Systems Committee. A framework and a 
   set of associated standards for the transmission of video, audio, 
   and data using the ISO MPEG-2 standard. 

   DVB: Digital Video Broadcast. A framework and set of associated 
   standards published by the European Telecommunications Standards 
   Institute (ETSI) for the transmission of video, audio, and data 
   using the ISO MPEG-2 Standard [ISO-MPEG2]. 

   Encapsulator: A network device that receives PDUs and formats 
   these into Payload Units (known here as SNDUs) for output as a 
   stream of TS Packets.

   NPA: Network Point of Attachment.  In this document, refers to a 
   6-byte destination address (resembling an IEEE Medium Access 
   Control address) within the MPEG-2 transmission network that is 
   used to identify individual Receivers or groups of Receivers. 

   PDU: Protocol Data Unit.  Examples of a PDU include Ethernet 
   frames, IPv4 or IPv6 datagrams, and other network packets. 

   PID: Packet Identifier [ISO-MPEG2].  A 13-bit field carried in 
   the header of TS Packets.  This is used to identify the TS 
   Logical Channel to which a TS Packet belongs [ISO-MPEG2].  The TS 
   Packets forming the parts of a Table Section, PES, or other 
   Payload Unit must all carry the same PID value.  The all-zeros 
   PID 0x0000 as well as other PID values is reserved for specific 
   PSI/SI Tables [ISO-MPEG2]. The all-ones PID value 0x1FFF 
   indicates a Null TS Packet introduced to maintain a constant bit 
   rate of a TS Multiplex.  There is no required relationship 
   between the PID values used for TS Logical Channels transmitted 
   using different TS Multiplexes.

   and performs filtering and forwarding of encapsulated PDUs to the 
   network-layer service (or bridging module when operating at the 
   link layer). 

   SI Table: Service Information Table [ISO-MPEG2].  In this 
   document, this term describes a table that is defined by another 
   standards body to convey information about the services carried 
   in a TS Multiplex. A Table may consist of one or more Table 
   Sections; however, all sections of a particular SI Table must be 
   carried over a single TS Logical Channel [ISO-MPEG2]. 

   SNDU: SubNetwork Data Unit. An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2 
   Payload Unit. 

   TS: Transport Stream [ISO-MPEG2], a method of transmission at the 
   MPEG-2 layer using TS Packets; it represents layer 2 of the 
   ISO/OSI reference model.  See also TS Logical Channel and TS 
   Multiplex. 

   TS Multiplex: In this document, this term defines a set of MPEG-2 
   TS Logical Channels sent over a single lower-layer connection.  
   This may be a common physical link (i.e., a transmission at a 
   specified symbol rate, FEC setting, and transmission frequency) 
   or an encapsulation provided by another protocol layer (e.g., 
   Ethernet, or RTP over IP). The same TS Logical Channel may be 
   repeated over more than one TS Multiplex (possibly associated

   with a different PID value) [RFC4259]; for example, to 
   redistribute the same multicast content to two terrestrial TV 
   transmission cells. 

   TS Packet: A fixed-length 188B unit of data sent over a TS 
   Multiplex [ISO-MPEG2].  Each TS Packet carries a 4B header, plus 
   optional overhead including an Adaptation Field, encryption 
   details, and time stamp information to synchronise a set of 
   related TS Logical Channels.

   are several entities within the MPEG-2 transmission network 
   architecture. These include: 

   o  ULE Encapsulation Gateways (the Encapsulator or ULE source) 

   o  SI-Table signalling generator (input to the multiplexer) 

   o  Receivers (the end points for ULE streams) 

   o  TS multiplexers (including re-multiplexers) 

   o  Modulators 

   In a MPEG-2 TS transmission network, the originating source of TS 
   Packets is either a L2 interface device (media encoder, 
   encapsulation gateway, etc) or a L2 network device (TS 
   multiplexer, etc). These devices may, but do not necessarily, 
   have an associated IP address. In the case of an encapsulation 
   gateway (e.g. ULE sender), the device may operate at L2 or Layer 
   3 (L3), and is not normally the originator of an IP traffic flow, 
   and usually the IP source address of the packets that it forwards 
   do not correspond to an IP address associated with the device. 

   The TS Packets are carried to the Receiver over a physical layer 
   that usually includes Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding that 
   interleaves the bytes of several consecutive, but unrelated, TS 
   Packets. FEC-coding and synchronisation processing makes 
   injection of single TS Packets very difficult. Replacement of a 
   sequence of packets is also difficult, but possible (see section 
   3.2).  

   A Receiver in a MPEG-2 TS transmission network needs to identify 
   a TS Logical Channel (or MPEG-2 Elementary Stream) to reassemble 
   the fragments of PDUs sent by a L2 source [RFC4259]. In a MPEG-2 
   TS, this association is made via the Packet Identifier, PID [ISO-
   MPEG2]. At the sender, each source associates a locally unique 
   set of PID values with each stream it originates. However, there 
   is no required relationship between the PID value used at the 
   sender and that received at the Receiver. Network devices may re-
   number the PID values associated with one or more TS Logical 
   Channels (e.g. ULE Streams) to prevent clashes at a multiplexer 
   between input streams with the same PID carried on different 
   input multiplexes (updating entries in the PMT [ISO-MPEG2], and 
   other SI tables that reference the PID value). A device may also 
   modify and/or insert new SI data into the control plane (also 
   sent as TS Packets identified by their PID value). However there 
   is only one valid source of data for each MPEG-2 Elementary

   Stream, bound to a PID value. (This observation could simplify 
   the requirement for authentication of the source of a ULE 
   Stream.) 

   In an MPEG-2 network a set of signalling messages [ID-AR] may 
   need to be broadcast (e.g. by an Encapsulation Gateway or other 
   device) to form the Layer 2 (L2) control plane. Examples of 
   signalling messages include the Program Association Table (PAT), 
   Program Map Table (PMT) and Network Information Table (NIT). In 
   existing MPEG-2 transmission networks, these messages are 
   broadcast in the clear (no encryption or integrity checks). The 
   integrity as well as authenticity of these messages is important 
   for correct working of the ULE network, i.e. supporting its 
   security objectives in the area of availability, in addition to 
   confidentiality and integrity. One method recently proposed [ID-
   EXT] encapsulates these messages using ULE. In such cases all the 
   security requirements of this document apply in securing these 
   signalling messages.  

   ULE link security focuses only on the security between the ULE 
   Encapsulation Gateway (ULE source) and the Receiver. In many 
   deployment scenarios the user of a ULE Stream has to secure 
   communications beyond the link since other network links are 
   utilised in addition to the ULE link. Therefore, if 
   authentication of the end-point i.e. the IP Sources is required, 
   or users are concerned about loss of confidentiality, integrity 
   or authenticity of their communication data, they will have to 
   employ end-to-end network security mechanisms like IPSec or 
   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Governmental users may be forced 
   by regulations to employ specific, approved implementations of 
   those mechanisms. Hence for such cases the confidentiality and 
   integrity of the user data will already be taken care of by the 
   end-to-end security mechanism and the ULE security measures would 
   focus on either providing traffic flow confidentiality for user 
   data that has already been encrypted or for users who choose not 
   to implement end-to-end security mechanisms. 

   In contrast to the above, if a ULE Stream is used to directly 
   join networks which are considered physically secure, for example 
   branch offices to a central office, ULE link Security could be 
   the sole provider of confidentiality and integrity. In this 
   scenario, governmental users could still have to employ approved 
   cryptographic equipment at the network layer or above, unless a 
   manufacturer of ULE Link Security equipment obtains governmental 
   approval for their implementation.

   The simplest type of network threat is a passive threat. This 
   includes eavesdropping or monitoring of transmissions, with a 
   goal to obtain information that is being transmitted. In 
   broadcast networks (especially those utilising widely available 
   low-cost physical layer interfaces, such as DVB) passive threats 
   are considered the major threats. An example of such a threat is 
   an intruder monitoring the MPEG-2 transmission broadcast and then 
   extracting traffic information concerning the communication 
   between IP hosts using a link. Another example is of an intruder 
   trying to gain information about the communication parties by 
   monitoring their ULE Receiver NPA addresses; an intruder can gain 
   information by determining the layer 2 identity of the 
   communicating parties and the volume of their traffic. This is a 
   well-known issue in the security field; however it is more of a 
   problem in the case of broadcast networks such as MPEG-2 
   transmission networks because of the easy availability of 
   receiver hardware and the wide geographical span of the networks. 

   Active threats (or attacks) are, in general, more difficult to 
   implement successfully than passive threats, and usually require 
   more sophisticated resources and may require access to the 
   transmitter. Within the context of MPEG-2 transmission networks, 
   examples of active attacks are: 

   o  Masquerading: An entity pretends to be a different entity. 
      This includes masquerading other users and subnetwork control 
      plane messages.  

   o  Modification of messages in an unauthorised manner.  

   o  Replay attacks: When an intruder sends some old (authentic) 
      messages to the Receiver. In the case of a broadcast link, 
      access to previous broadcast data is easy.  

   o  Denial of Service attacks: When an entity fails to perform its 
      proper function or acts in a way that prevents other entities 
      from performing their proper functions. 

   The active threats mentioned above are major security concerns 
   for the Internet community [BELLOVIN]. Masquerading and 
   modification of IP packets are comparatively easy in an Internet 
   environment whereas such attacks are in fact much harder for 
   MPEG-2 broadcast links. This could for instance motivate the 
   mandatory use of sequence numbers in IPsec, but not for 
   synchronous links. This is further reflected in the security 
   requirements for Case 2 and 3 in section 4 below.

   As explained in section 3.1, the PID associated with an 
   Elementary Stream can be modified (e.g. in some systems by 
   reception of an updated SI table, or in other systems until the 
   next announcement/discovery data is received). An attacker that 
   is able to modify the content of the received multiplex (e.g. 
   replay data and/or control information) could inject data locally 
   into the received stream with an arbitrary PID value. 

3.3. Threat Scenarios 

   Analysing the topological scenarios for MPEG-2 Transmission 
   Networks in section 1, the security threat cases can be 
   abstracted into three cases: 

   o  Case 1: Monitoring (passive threat). Here the intruder 
      monitors the ULE broadcasts to gain information about the ULE 
      data and/or tracking the communicating parties identities (by 
      monitoring the destination NPA). In this scenario, measures 
      must be taken to protect the ULE data flow and the identity of 
      ULE Receivers. 

   o  Case 2: Locally conduct active attacks on the MPEG-TS 
      multiplex. Here an intruder is assumed to be sufficiently 
      sophisticated to over-ride the original transmission from the 
      ULE Encapsulation Gateway and deliver a modified version of 
      the MPEG-TS transmission to a single ULE Receiver or a small 
      group of Receivers (e.g. in a single company site). The MPEG-2 
      transmission network operator might not be aware of such 
      attacks. Measures must be taken to ensure ULE source 
      authentication and preventing replay of old messages. 

   o  Case 3: Globally conduct active attacks on the MPEG-TS 
      multiplex. Here we assume an intruder is very sophisticated 
      and able to over-ride the whole MPEG-2 transmission multiplex. 
      The requirements here are similar to scenario 2. The MPEG-2 
      transmission network operator can usually identify such 
      attacks and may resort to some means to restore the original 
      transmission. 

   For both cases 2 and 3, there can be two sub cases: 

   o  Insider attacks i.e. active attacks from adversaries in the 
   known of secret material. 

   o  Outsider attacks i.e. active attacks from outside of a virtual 
   private network.

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     October 2007 
    

   In terms of priority, case 1 is considered the major threat in 
   MPEG-2 transmission systems. Case 2 is likely to a lesser degree 
   within certain network configurations, especially when there are 
   insider attacks. Hence, protection against such active attacks 
   should be used only when such a threat is a real possibility. 
   Case 3 is envisaged to be less practical, because it will be very 
   difficult to pass unnoticed by the MPEG-2 transmission operator. 
   It will require restoration of the original transmission. The 
   assumption being here is that physical access to the network 
   components (multiplexers, etc) and/or connecting physical media 
   is secure. Therefore case 3 is not considered further in this 
   document. 

4. Security Requirements for IP over MPEG-2 TS 

   From the threat analysis in section 3, the following security 
   requirements can be derived: 

   o  Data flow confidentiality is the major requirement to mitigate 
      passive threats in MPEG-2 broadcast networks. 

   o  Protection of Layer 2 NPA address. In broadcast networks this 
      protection can be used to prevent an intruder tracking the 
      identity of ULE Receivers and the volume of their traffic. 

   o  Integrity protection and authentication of the ULE source is 
      required against active attacks described in section 3.2. 

   o  Protection against replay attacks. This is required for the 
      active attacks described in section 3.2. 

   o  Layer L2 ULE Source and Receiver authentication: This is 
      normally performed during the initial key exchange and 
      authentication phase, before the ULE Receiver can join a 
      secure session with the ULE Encapsulator (ULE source). This is 
      normally receiver to hub authentication and it could be either 
      unidirectional or bidirectional authentication based on the 
      underlying key management protocol. 

   Other general requirements are:  

   o  Decoupling of ULE key management functions from ULE security 
      services such as encryption and source authentication. This 
      allows the independent development of both systems. 

   o  Support for automated as well as manual insertion of keys and 
      policy into the relevant databases.

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     October 2007 
    

   o  Algorithm agility is needed. Changes in crypto algorithms, 
      hashes as they become obsolete should be updated without 
      affecting the overall security of the system. 

   o  Traceability: To monitor transmission network using log files 
      to record the activities in the network and detect any 
      intrusion. 

   o  Protection against loss of service (availability) through 
      malicious reconfiguration of system components (see Figure 1). 

   o  Compatibility with other networking functions such as NAT 
      Network Address Translation (NAT) [RFC3715] or TCP 
      acceleration can be used in a wireless broadcast networks. 

   o  Compatibility and operational with ULE extension headers i.e. 
      allow encryption of a compressed SNDU payload. 

   o  Where a ULE Stream carries a set of IP traffic flows to 
      different destinations with a range of properties (multicast, 
      unicast, etc), it is often not appropriate to provide IP 
      confidentiality services for the entire ULE Stream. For many 
      expected applications of ULE, a finer-grain control is 
      therefore required, at least permitting control of data 
      confidentiality/authorisation at the level of a single MAC/NPA 
      address. 

   Examining the threat cases in section 3.3, the security 
   requirements for each case can be summarised as: 

   o  Case 1: Data flow confidentiality MUST be provided to prevent 
      monitoring of the ULE data (such as user information and IP 
      addresses). Protection of NPA addresses MAY be provided to 
      prevent tracking ULE Receivers and their communications. 

   o  Case 2: In addition to case 1 requirements, new measures need 
      to be implemented such as authentication schemes using Message 
      Authentication Codes, digital signatures or TESLA [RFC4082] in 
      order to provide integrity protection and source 
      authentication, and using sequence numbers to protect against 
      replay attacks. In terms of outsider attacks, group 
      authentication using Message Authentication Codes should 
      provide the same level of security. This will significantly 
      reduce the ability of intruders to successfully inject their 
      own data into the MPEG-TS stream. However, scenario 2 threats 
      apply only in specific service cases, and therefore 
      authentication and protection against replay attacks are

      OPTIONAL. Such measures incur additional transmission as well 
      as processing overheads. Moreover, intrusion detection systems 
      may also be needed by the MPEG-2 network operator. These 
      should best be coupled with perimeter security policy to 
      monitor most denial-of-service attacks. 

   o  Case 3: As stated in section 3.3. The requirements here are 
      similar to Case 2 but since the MPEG-2 transmission network 
      operator can usually identify such attacks the constraints on 
      intrusion detections are less than in case 2. 

5. Motivation for ULE link-layer security 

   Examination of the threat analysis and security requirements in 
   sections 3 and 4 has shown that there is a need to provide 
   security in MPEG-2 transmission networks employing ULE. This 
   section compares the disadvantages when security functionalities 
   are present in different layers.   

5.1. Security at the IP layer (using IPSEC) 

   The security architecture for the Internet Protocol [RFC4301] 
   describes security services for traffic at the IP layer. This 
   architecture primarily defines services for the Internet Protocol 
   (IP) unicast packets, as well as manually configured IP multicast 
   packets.  

   It is possible to use IPsec to secure ULE links. The major 
   advantage of IPsec is its wide implementation in IP routers and 
   hosts. IPsec in transport mode can be used for end-to-end 
   security transparently over MPEG-2 transmission links with little 
   impact.  

   In the context of MPEG-2 transmission links, if IPsec is used to 
   secure a ULE link, then the ULE Encapsulator and Receivers are 
   equivalent to the security gateways in IPsec terminology. A 
   security gateway implementation of IPsec uses tunnel mode. Such 
   usage has the following disadvantages: 

   o  There is an extra transmission overhead associated with using 
      IPsec in tunnel mode, i.e. the extra IP header (IPv4 or IPv6). 

   o  There is a need to protect the identity (NPA) of ULE Receivers 
      over the ULE broadcast medium; IPsec is not suitable for 
      providing this service. In addition, the interfaces of these 
      devices do not necessarily have IP addresses (they can be L2 
      devices).

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     October 2007 
    

   o  Multicast is considered a major service over ULE links. The 
      current IPsec specifications [RFC4301] only define a pairwise 
      tunnel between two IPsec devices with manual keying. Work is 
      in progress in defining the extra detail needed for multicast 
      and to use the tunnel mode with address preservation to allow 
      efficient multicasting. For further details refer to [WEIS06]. 

5.2. Link security below the Encapsulation layer  

   Link layer security can be provided at the MPEG-2 TS layer (below 
   ULE). MPEG-2 TS encryption encrypts all TS Packets sent with a 
   specific PID value. However, an MPEG-2 TS may typically multiplex 
   several IP flows, belonging to different users, using a common 
   PID. Therefore all multiplexed traffic will share the same 
   security keys.  

   This has the following advantages: 

   o  The bit stream sent on the broadcast network does not expose 
      any L2 or L3 headers, specifically all addresses, type fields, 
      and length fields are encrypted prior to transmission.  

   o  This method does not preclude the use of IPsec, TLS, or any 
      other form of higher-layer security.  

   However it has the following disadvantages:  

   o  When a PID is shared between several users, each ULE Receiver 
      needs to decrypt all MPEG-2 TS Packets with a matching PID, 
      possibly including those that are not required to be 
      forwarded. Therefore it does not have the flexibility to 
      separately secure individual IP flows.  

   o  When a PID is shared between several users, the ULE Receivers 
      will have access to private traffic destined to other ULE 
      Receivers, since they share a common PID and key.  

   o  IETF-based key management is not used in existing systems. 
      Existing access control mechanisms have limited flexibility in 
      terms of controlling the use of key and rekeying. Therefore if 
      the key is compromised, then this will impact several ULE 
      Receivers.  

   Currently there are few deployed L2 security systems for MPEG-2 
   transmission networks. Conditional access for digital TV 
   broadcasting is one example. However, this approach is optimised 
   for TV services and is not well-suited to IP packet transmission.

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     October 2007 
    

   Some other systems are specified in standards such as MPE [ETSI-
   DAT], but there are currently no known implementations. 

5.3. Link security as a part of the encapsulation layer  

   Examining the threat analysis in section 3 has shown that 
   protection of ULE link from eavesdropping and ULE Receiver 
   identity are major requirements.  

   There are several major advantages in using ULE link layer 
   security: 

   o  The protection of the complete ULE Protocol Data Unit (PDU) 
      including IP addresses. The protection can be applied either 
      per IP flow or per Receiver NPA address.  

   o  Ability to protect the identity of the Receiver within the 
      MPEG-2 transmission network at the IP layer and also at L2. 

   o  Efficient protection of IP multicast over ULE links.  

   o  Transparency to the use of Network Address Translation (NATs) 
      [RFC3715] and TCP Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEP) 
      [RFC3135], which require the ability to inspect and modify the 
      packets sent over the ULE link.  

   This method does not preclude the use of IPsec at L3 (or TLS 
   [RFC4346] at L4). IPsec and TLS provide strong authentication of 
   the end-points in the communication.  

   L3 end-to-end security would partially deny the advantage listed 
   just above (use of PEP, compression etc), since those techniques 
   could only be applied to TCP packets bearing a TCP-encapsulated 
   IPsec packet exchange, but not the TCP packets of the original 
   applications, which in particular inhibits compression. 

   End-to-end security (IPsec, TLS, etc.) may be used independently 
   to provide strong authentication of the end-points in the 
   communication. This authentication is desirable in many scenarios 
   to ensure that the correct information is being exchanged between 
   the trusted parties, whereas Layer 2 methods cannot provide this 
   guarantee. 

6. Design recommendations for ULE Security Header Extension 

   Table 1 below shows the threats that are applicable to ULE 
   networks and the relevant security mechanism to mitigate those

   threats. This would help in the design of the ULE Security 
   extension header. For example this could help in the selection of 
   security fields in the ULE Security extension Header design. 
   Moreover the security services could also be grouped into 
   profiles based on different security requirements. One example is 
   to have a base profile which does payload encryption and identity 
   protection. The second profile could do the above as well as 
   source authentication.

   A modular design to ULE Security may allow it to use and benefit 
   from IETF key management protocols, such as GSAKMP [RFC4535] and 
   GDOI [RFC3547] protocols defined by the IETF Multicast Security 
   (MSEC) working group. This does not preclude the use of other key 
   management methods in scenarios where this is more appropriate. 

   IPsec or TLS also provide a proven security architecture defining 
   key exchange mechanisms and the ability to use a range of 
   cryptographic algorithms. ULE security can make use of these 
   established mechanisms and algorithms. 

7. Compatibility with Generic Stream Encapsulation 

   The [ID-EXT] document describes two new Header Extensions that 
   may be used with Unidirectional Link Encapsulation, ULE, 
   [RFC4326] and the Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) that has 
   been designed for the Generic Mode (also known as the Generic 
 
 
Cruickshank et.al.         Expires March 8, 2008           [Page 16]

   Stream (GS)), offered by second-generation DVB physical layers, 
   and specifically for DVB-S2 [ID-EXT]. 

   The security threats and requirement presented in this document 
   are applicable to ULE and GSE encapsulations. It might be 
   desirable to authenticate some/all of the headers; such decision 
   can be part of the security policy for the MPEG-2 transmission 
   network. 

8. Summary 

   This document analyses a set of threats and security 
   requirements. It also defines the requirements for ULE security 
   and states the motivation for link security as a part of the 
   Encapsulation layer.   

   ULE security includes a need to provide link-layer encryption and 
   ULE Receiver identity protection. There is an optional 
   requirement for link-layer authentication and integrity assurance 
   as well as protection against insertion of old (duplicated) data 
   into the ULE stream (i.e. replay protection). This is optional 
   because of the associated overheads for the extra features and 
   they are only required for specific service cases. 

   ULE link security (between a ULE Encapsulation Gateway to 
   Receivers) is considered as an additional security mechanism to 
   IPsec, TLS, and application layer end-to-end security, and not as 
   a replacement. It allows a network operator to provide similar 
   functions to that of IPsec, but in addition provides MPEG-2 
   transmission link confidentiality and protection of ULE Receiver 
   identity (NPA). End-to-end security mechanism may then be used 
   additionally and independently for providing strong 
   authentication of the end-points in the communication. 

   Annexe 1 describes a set of building blocks that may be used to 
   realise a framework that provides ULE security functions.

9. Security Considerations 

   Link-layer (L2) encryption of IP traffic is commonly used in 
   broadcast/radio links to supplement End-to-End security (e.g. 
   provided by TLS [RFC4346], SSH [RFC4251], IPsec [RFC4301). A 
   common objective is to provide the same level of privacy as wired 
   links. It is recommended that an ISP or user provide end-to-end 
   security services based on well known mechanisms such as IPsec or 
   TLS. 

   This document provides a threat analysis and derives the security 
   requirements to provide link encryption and optional link-layer 
   integrity / authentication of the SNDU payload. 

   There are some security issues that were raised in RFC 4326 
   [RFC4326] that are not addressed in this document (out of scope) 
   such as: 

   o  The security issue with un-initialised stuffing bytes.  In 
      ULE, these bytes are set to 0xFF (normal practice in MPEG-2). 

   o  Integrity issues related to the removal of the LAN FCS in a 
      bridged networking environment.  The removal for bridged 
      frames exposes the traffic to potentially undetected 
      corruption while being processed by the Encapsulator and/or 
      Receiver. 

   o  There is a potential security issue when a Receiver receives a 
      PDU with two Length fields:  The Receiver would need to 
      validate the actual length and the Length field and ensure 
      that inconsistent values are not propagated by the network.   

10. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not define any protocol and does not require 
   any IANA assignments but a subsequent document that defines a 
   layer 2 security extension to ULE will require IANA involvement.

Appendix A: ULE Security Framework 

   This section defines a security framework for the deployment of 
   secure ULE networks. 

A.1 Building Blocks 

   This ULE Security framework defines the following building blocks 
   as shown in figure 2 below: 

   o  The Key Management Block 

   o  The ULE Security Extension Header Block 

   o  The ULE Databases Block 

   Within the Key Management block the communication between the 
   Group Member entity and the Group Server entity happens in the

   control plane. The ULE Security header block applies security to 
   the ULE SNDU and this happens in the ULE data plane. The ULE 
   Security databases block acts as the interface between the Key 
   management block (control plane) and the ULE Security Header 
   block (ULE data plane) as shown in figure 2.

   A.1.1 Key Management Block 

   A key management framework is required to provide security at the 
   ULE level using extension headers. This key management framework 
   is responsible for user authentication, access control, and 
   Security Association negotiation (which include the negotiations 
   of the security algorithms to be used and the generation of the 
   different session keys as well as policy material). The Key

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     October 2007 
    

   management framework can be either automated or manual. Hence 
   this key management client entity (shown as the Key Management 
   Group Member block in figure 2) will be present in all ULE 
   receivers as well as at the ULE sources (encapsulation gateways). 
   The ULE source could also be the Key Management Group Server 
   Entity (shown as the Key Management Group Server block in figure 
   2. This happens when the ULE source also acts as the Key 
   Management Group Server. Deployment may use either automated key 
   management protocols (e.g. GSAKMP [RFC4535]) or manual insertion 
   of keying material.  

   A.1.2 ULE Extension Header Block 

   A new security extension header for the ULE protocol is required 
   to provide the security features of data confidentiality, data 
   integrity, data authentication and mechanisms to prevent replay 
   attacks. Security keying material will be used for the different 
   security algorithms (for encryption/decryption, MAC generation, 
   etc.), which are used to meet the security requirements, 
   described in detail in Section 4 of this document. 

   This block will use the keying material and policy information 
   from the ULE security database block on the ULE payload to 
   generate the secure ULE Extension Header or to decipher the 
   secure ULE extension header to get the ULE payload. An example 
   overview of the ULE Security extension header format along with 
   the ULE header and payload is shown in figure 3 below. There 
   could be other extension headers (either mandatory or optional) 
   but these will always be placed after the security extension 
   header. However, there is an exception: the timestamp extension 
   may be placed before the security extension header [ID-EXT]. When 
   applying the security services for example confidentiality, input 
   to the cipher algorithm will cover the fields from the end of the 
   security extension header to the end of the PDU.

   A.1.3 ULE Security Databases Block 

   There needs to be two databases i.e. similar to the IPSec 
   databases.  

   o  ULE-SAD: ULE Secure Association Database contains all the

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     October 2007 
    

      Security Associations that are currently established with 
      different ULE peers. 

   o  ULE-SPD: ULE Secure Policy Database contains the policies as 
      defined by the system manager. These policies describe the 
      security services that must be enforced 

   The design of these two databases will be based on IPSec 
   databases as defined in RFC4301 [RFC4301].  

   The exact details of the header patterns that the SPD and SAD 
   will have to support for all use cases will be defined in a 
   separate document. This document only highlights the need for 
   such interfaces between the ULE data plane and the Key Management 
   control plane. 

A.2 Interface definition 

   Two new interfaces have to be defined between the blocks as shown 
   in Figure 2 above. These interfaces are: 

   o  Key Management block <-> ULE Security databases block  

   o  ULE Security databases block  <-> ULE Security Header block 

   While the first interface is used by the Key Management Block to 
   insert keys, security associations and policies into the ULE 
   Database Block, the second interface is used by the ULE Security 
   Extension Header Block to get the keys and policy material for 
   generation of the security extension header. 

   A.2.1 Key Management <-> ULE Security databases 

   This interface is between the Key Management group member block 
   (GM client) and the ULE Security Database block (shown in figure 
   2). The Key Management GM entity will communicate with the GCKS 
   and then get the relevant security information (keys, cipher 
   mode, security service, ULE_Security_ID and other relevant keying 
   material as well as policy) and insert this data into the ULE 
   Security database block. The Key Management could be either 
   automated (e.g. GSAKMP [RFC4535] or GDOI [RFC3547]) or manually 
   inserted using this interface. The following three interface 
   functions are defined: 

  . Insert_record_database (char * Database, char * record, char * 
     Unique_ID); 
 
 
Cruickshank et.al.         Expires March 8, 2008           [Page 25] 

Internet-Draft      Security Requirements for ULE     October 2007 
    

  . Update_record_database (char * Database, char * record, char * 
     Unique_ID); 
  . Delete_record_database (char * Database, char * Unique_ID); 
    
   The definitions of the variables are as follows: 
    
     . Database - This is a pointer to the ULE Security databases 
     . record - This is the rows of security attributes to be 
        entered or modified in the above databases 
     . Unique_ID - This is the primary key to lookup records (rows 
        of security attributes) in the above databases 
    

   A.2.2 ULE Security Databases <-> ULE Security Header 

   This interface is between the ULE Security Database and the ULE 
   Security Extension Header block as shown in figure 2. To send 
   traffic, firstly the ULE encapsulator using the ULE_Security_ID, 
   Destination Address and possibly the PID, searches the ULE 
   Security Database for the relevant security record. It then uses 
   the data in the record to create the ULE security extension 
   header. For received traffic, the ULE decapsulator on receiving 
   the ULE SNDU will first get the record from the Security Database 
   using the ULE_Security_ID, the Destination Address and possibly 
   the PID. It then uses this information to decrypt the ULE 
   extension header. For both cases (either send or receive traffic) 
   only one interface is needed since the only difference between 
   the sender and receiver is the direction of the flow of traffic: 

  . Get_record_database (char * Database, char * record, char * 
     Unique_ID);
