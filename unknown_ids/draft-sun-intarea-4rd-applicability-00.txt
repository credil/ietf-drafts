Internet-Draft              4rd Applicability                 March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  The
   tremendous success of the Internet has strained the address space,
   which is no longer sufficient to support future growth.  The IANA
   free pool of IPv4 address have been depleted already.  With its
   increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a
   subnet, and improvement in address management, IPv6 is the only real
   option on the table.  During the long transition period from only
   IPv4 to IPv6, the networks of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will
   have to offer more than just IPv6 connectivity.  Both outgoing and
   incoming connections will have to be supported.

   IPv4 Residual Deployment (4rd) enables a service provider to share
   IPv4 addresses among its customers by combining the well-known
   technologies of stateless address mapping and tunneling, NAT44, and
   IPv4 in IPv6 encapsulation.

   This document discusses the applicability of the IPv4 Residual
   Deployment (4rd) protocol, and an address sharing mechanism, NAT44 on
   4rd CE side, and IPv6 addressing and routing in 4rd capable IPv6-only
   networks.

   The 4rd model is built on IPv4 over IPv6 stateless tunnels to reach
   4rd CEs where customers will share IPv4 addresses (Section 3.2).
   With 4rd, we need not worry that well-known IPv4 addresses (such as
   000/8) are generated, because all 4rd CEs generating IPv4 addresses
   are in the range of domain 4rd prefix.  (Section 3.1). 4rd differs
   from other solutions such as Dual-Stack-lite
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] since the 4rd CE is used to
   implement the NAT44 (Section 3.3). 4rd also can implement Routing
   Optimization to Provide IPv4 Connectivity while the 4rd CE
   communicates with other 4rd CE (Section 3.4).  Given its stateless
   tunnel nature, it is superior over a centralized NAT44 solution in
   its ability to easily offer redundancy, also in a multi vendor
   environment (Section 3.5).  Furthermore, 4rd does not require
   dedicated NAT44 logging requirements(Section 3.6).


2.  Overview of 4rd

   If 4rd [I-D.despres-softwire-4rd] is to be actually used across a
   IPv6-only network to offer IPv4 connectivity
   [I-D.arkko-ipv6-transition-guidelines], the network must have 4rd
   Border Relay Router (BR) and 4rd Customer Edge Router (CE).  Multiple
   CEs are set-up to share an IPv4 address using different port ranges,
   and the CE and BR share a 4rd address and port mapping rule.

   Figure 1 shows 4rd address mapping, which generates an CE 4rd prefix
   from CE IPv6 prefix.  As the prerequisite of 4rd, Domain IPv6 prefix
   and Domain 4rd prefix must be given to all 4rd CEs and 4rd BRs in a
   specified 4rd domain.  CE IPv6 prefix for all 4rd CEs in the
   specified 4rd domain must be in same Domain IPv6 prefix but must be
   unique for each 4rd CE.

                                              :         \/             :

                       Figure 1: 4rd address mapping

   4rd CEs obtain their shared IPv4 address and available port ranges by
   deriving this information from CE IPv6 prefix.

   According to 4rd [I-D.despres-softwire-4rd],each 4rd CE has its
   unique port-ranges which is calculated based on the 4rd mapping rule
   with their port-prefix.  The 4rd port mapping rule uses four port-
   range indexes, as shown in the Figure 2 below.  This allows 4rd CEs
   to avoid using well known (reserved) TCP/UDP ports 0-4095.

3.  Applicability

3.1.  IPv4 address assignment

   As Figure 1 shows that all 4rd CEs generating IPv4 addresses are in
   the range of domain 4rd prefix.  This means that it is not necessary
   for 4rd operators to pay attention to what IPv4 address is generated
   by 4rd CE.  In the case of all 32 bits of IPv4 address is mapped to
   IPv6 prefix, 4rd CE must not generate well-known IPv4 address (such
   as 0/8, 127/8, etc., for example) so that IPv6 prefix assignment
   should be taken careful to avoid it. 4rd is recommended to operators
   who do not want IPv6 prefix assignment of which takes into account
   what IPv4 address generated from IPv6 prefix.

3.2.  IPv4 Address Sharing

   The 4rd model is built on IPv4 over IPv6 stateless tunnels to reach
   4rd CEs where customers will share IPv4 addresses.  Figure 3 shows an
   example of one IPv4 address being shared by 256 customers.

   In the example given, the IPv6 address prefix of the ISP's IPv6
   access network is 2001:db8::/32, the delegated IPv6 prefix of each
   4rd CE is /56, distributed by DHCP-PD for example, the bit range of
   user unique part of IPv6 prefix is 24 bits.  According to the rule of

   4rd address mapping (Figure 1), the port prefix and the IPv4 address
   are derived from user unique part associated with the IPv6 address.
   In the example(Figure 3), the IPv4 address that can be shared by 4rd
   CEs is 10.255.0.205, '10.255/16' is the common IPv4 prefix for 4rd of
   this network, '0.205' is generated from ':00cd:'.  The port prefix
   that can be used for IPv4 address sharing is 8 bits (eg: AB, EF, A1
   is used by 4rd CE1, 4rd CE2, 4rd CEn ), so up to 256 customers can
   share the one IPv4 address (2 to 8th power).

3.3.  Distributing NAT function to CEs

   4rd technology uses the 4rd CE to implement NAT44.  This section
   describes 4rd CE Side NAT from the perspectives of management and
   cost.

Internet-Draft              4rd Applicability                 March 2011


   Since 4rd distributes NAT44 function to the 4rd CE, the CE side NAT44
   manages user's NATed session in general of each 4rd CE unit.
   According to their own infrastructure and management systems, if ISPs
   think 4rd CE Side NAT is easier to manage than gateway side NAT, they
   can adopt the 4rd technology.

   The capex and opex costs of an ISP very from network to network.  The
   4rd solution is an ideal fit for those where a CE based NAT solution
   is acceptable, and where investment in operating and managing of a
   centralized NAPT 44 gateway is not desired,

   For an CE IPv6 prefix of a given length, e.g. a /56 PD, as more and
   more bits are used to express the shared IPv4 address, the less bits
   are available to express the port range.  It is not 4rd specific
   issue, but a method that supports NAT Port Mapping needs to be
   devised.  For example, 256 ports can be used by 4rd CE, but access to
   host A, B, and C requires 100 ports each.  If the 4rd CE ports are
   distributed when A,B,C are accessed at the same time from the same
   4rd CE, Ports 0 - 99 are used to access host A, Ports 100 - 199 are
   used to access host B, but host C cannot be accessed because the
   remaining ports are not enough.  As Figure 4, 4rd can reuse the 4rd
   CE Port by terms of recognizing the destination addresses in order to
   reduce the aspect of this problem.  It is noted that the problem can
   not be solved if the multiple users under same 4rd CE access the same
   host (e.g. host A) exceed the number of ports.

   Figure 5 quantifies address sharing rates for different port range
   lengths, along with the overall number of ports available to a give
   CE.  The 4rd allows 16 bits to be used by NAPT.  In theory, one IPv4
   address can be shared by 65536 (2 to 16th power) customers.  However,
   at least 1 bit is needed for Port-range Index.  The greatest bit
   range that can be used to share address are 15 bits.

3.4.  Routing optimization to provide IPv4 connectivity

   Figure 6 shows that 4rd can implement IPv6 routing with direct IP
   forwarding between the two 4rd CEs.  In other words, 4rd allows
   direct packet forwarding between CEs that share a 4rd domain, without
   the need of forwarding such traffic through the gateway.

   When V4a under 4rd CE1 send packets to V4b under 4rd CE2, the packets
   need not go through the gateway (Hub&Spoke) before going to 4rd CE2,
   they can go to 4rd CE2 directly (mesh).  This section describes this
   in more detail from two perspectives: Network matching and Network
   Load.

                                 Figure 6

   Taking network matching into account, 4rd should be chosen if the
   ISP's IPv6 network allows direct CE-CE traffic forwarding (eg: IPv6
   Flat Routing Network).

   Compared to Hub & Spoke architecture solutions, mesh architecture
   solutions can achieve a smaller network load when the 4rd CE
   communicate frequently.  If the ISP thinks that its network has
   insufficient bandwidth or it wants to lower the load imposed by IPv4
   connections, they should choose a mesh architecture solution such as
   4rd.

   Note: Softwire mesh [RFC5565] is also a mesh architecture solution,
   but it does not provide the IPv4 sharing function.  Softwire mesh can
   be adopted if IPv4 address sharing is not needed.

3.5.  Gateway Redundancy Considerations

   Since in 4rd the BR side does not implement the NAT function, the BR
   can be easily replicated.  For instance, there can be N:1 redundant
   gateways in the network.  Reliable network operation can be
   guaranteed because a failed gateway can be immediately and easily
   replicated by any one of the N gateways.

   If the gateway side implements NAT, 1:1 gateway redundancy is the
   choice, and also upstream and downstream traffic from the same user
   must go through the same gateway. 4rd easily realizes load balancing
   because upstream and downstream traffic from the same user can go

   through different gateways.

3.6.  NAT Log Considerations

   4rd CE uses fixed NAT rules and IPv4 users can be directly identified
   by means of their IPv6 address, so the NAT log does not need to be
   left.  In other words, 4rd allows an operator to save on the need to
   perform NAT log collection and retention.  On the other hand, other
   solutions may achieve higher address sharing ratio than 4rd.  If
   operators want to reduce NAT log with these solutions, their NATs
   have to be configured with [I-D.tsou-behave-natx4-log-reduction], or
   allocate fixed port range for NAT rules regardless of the advantage.

   It is noted that another logging necessity coming from
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues] is described in
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-server-logging-recommendations] for Internet facing
   servers.


4.  Constraint Consideration

   This section describes the constraint on user number when addresses
   are shared.  As Section 3.3 stated, the maximum bit range that can be
   used by a public port is 15 bits.  In this case, 4rd CE is restricted
   to one private port.  In fact, it is not able to provide service.  So
   the customer numbers per IPv4 address that can be shared need to be
   considered along with the ports needed by 4rd CE.

   It is noted that deriving IPv4 addresses from CE IPv6 prefix
   generated by 4rd mapping rule may lead to a low rate of IPv4 address
   sharing because it does not allow for statistical multipexing gains.
   ISPs who feel that this is not desirable and want to achieve high
   sharing rates can select centralized gateway/NAPT solutions, which
   can have a high sharing rate because allow for such statistical
   multipexing gains.


5.  Security Considerations

   The sharing of IPv4 address reduces the port selection space per 4rd
   CE, so a blind attack can be performed easily.  An attack can be
   performed if the attacker is able to correctly guess the source
   address and source port.  Address and Port Dependent Filtering (APDF)
   need be implemented in order to counter blind attack.  In APDF, not
   only source address and source port but also destination address and
   destination port need to be checked.  Even so, a blind attack that
   can be performed against TCP relies on the attacker's ability to
   guess the 5-ruple (Protocol, Source address, Destination address,

   Source Port, Destination Port).  Shared address issues
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues] describes a method for
   the random selection of TCP Sequence Number, that reduces the ability
   of attacker to correctly guess the 5-ruple.

   DNS is one of the important protocols to use UDP.  In 4rd CE, all DNS
   reply packets should be discarded, expect for the packets from
   forward destinations.  If DNS implements Port Randomization, the
   attack success rate can be reduced.

   We describe here a method for reducing Spoofing Attack under 4rd CE.
   Using the 4rd mapping rule, the IPv4 address can be derived from IPv6
   address, so we can check the IPv4 address thus derived and the IPv4
   address in the header of received packet.  If they are same, the
   packet is forwarded, otherwise, it is dropped.


6.  Conclusions

   This document described the ability of 4rd to support the IPv6-only
   access network.  We conclude that the 4rd solution is a viable choice
   when the ISP desires a stateless IPv4 address sharing option, based
   on CE side NAT functionality, along with a high degree of freedom in
   terms of redundancy and optimal traffic forwarding. 4rd is also
   recommended to operators who do not want IPv6 prefix assignment of
   which takes into account what IPv4 address generated from IPv6
   prefix.  When only one 4rd applicable character is needed, 4rd may be
   used to only that purpose with other solutions.
