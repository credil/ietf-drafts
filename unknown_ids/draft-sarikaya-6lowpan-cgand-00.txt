 Lightweight Secure Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy Networks
                    draft-sarikaya-6lowpan-cgand-00

Abstract

   This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low-
   power and lossy networks.  The nodes generate a Cryptographically
   Generated Address using an Elliptic Curve Cryptography public key,
   register the Cryptographically Generated Address with a default
   router and periodically refresh the registration.  Modifications to
   6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are described for secure neighbor
   discovery for low-power and lossy networks.  Cryptographically
   generated address and digital signature are calculated using elliptic
   curve cryptography public key of the node.

1.  Introduction

   Neighbor discovery for IPv6 [RFC4861] and stateless address
   autoconfiguration [RFC4862] together referred to as neighbor
   discovery protocols (NDP) are defined for regular hosts operating in
   wired/wireless links.  These protocols are not suitable and require
   optimizations for resource constrained, low power hosts operating in
   lossy wireless links.  Neighbor discovery optimizations for 6lowpan
   networks include simple optimizations such as host address
   registration feature using the address registration option which is
   sent in unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement
   (NA) messages [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd].

   Neighbor discovery protocols (NDP) are not secure especially when
   physical security on the link is not assured and vulnerable to
   attacks.  Secure neighbor discovery protocol (SEND) is defined to
   secure NDP [RFC3971].  Cryptographically generated addresses (CGA)
   are used in SEND [RFC3972].  SEND mandates the use of RSA signature
   algorithm which is computationally heavy and not suitable to use for
   low-power and resource constrained nodes
   [I-D.cheneau-csi-send-sig-agility].  The use of RSA public key and
   signature leads to long message sizes not suitable to use in low-bit
   rate, short range, asymmetric and non-transitive links such as IEEE
   802.15.4.

   In this document we extend 6lowpan neighbor discovery protocol with
   cryptographically generated addresses.  The nodes generate CGAs and
   register them with the default router.  CGA generation is based on
   elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)and signature is calculated using
   elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) known to be
   lightweight and lead to much smaller packet sizes.  The resulting
   protocol is called Lightweight Secure Neighbor Discovery Protocol
   (LSEND).


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC3971], [RFC3972] in addition to the ones specified in
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd].

3.  Problem Statement

   In this section we state requirements on secure neighbor discovery
   protocol for low-power and lossy networks.

   The protocol MUST be based on Neighbor Discovery Optimization for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks protocol defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] due to the host-initiated interactions to allow
   for sleeping hosts, elimination of multicast-based address resolution
   for hosts, etc.

   New options to be added to neighbor solicitation messages MUST lead
   to minimal packet sizes.  Such packet sizes facilitate low-power
   transmission by resource constrained nodes on lossy links.

   CGA generation, signature and key hash calculation MUST avoid the use
   of SHA-1 which is known to have security flaws.  In this document, we
   use SHA-2 instead of SHA-1 and thus avoid SHA-1's flaws.

   Public key and signature sizes MUST be minimized and signature
   calculation MUST be lightweight.  In this document we adopt ECC and
   ECDSA with P-256 curve in order to meet this requirement.


4.  New Options

4.1.  CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option

   This option contains both CGA parameters and the digital signature.

   A summary of the CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option format

   Key Hash

      The Key Hash field is a 128-bit field containing the most
      significant (leftmost) 128 bits of a SHA-2 hash of the public key
      used for constructing the signature.  This is the same as in
      [RFC3971] except for SHA-1 which has been proved to be flawed in
      the light of recent attacks [NIST-ST].
   Digital Signature

      Same as in Section 4.1.
   Padding

      The Padding field contains a variable-length field containing as
      many bytes long as remain after the end of the signature.

4.3.  Calculation of Digital Signature and CGA Using ECC

   Due to the use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, the following
   modifications are needed to [RFC3971] and [RFC3972].

   Digital signature is constructed by using the sender's private key
   over the same sequence of octets specified in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC3971] up to all neighbor discovery protocol options preceding the
   Digital Signature option containing Elliptic Curve Cryptography
   digital signature.  The signature value is computed using the ECDSA
   signature algorithm as defined in [SEC1] and hash function SHA-256.

   Public Key is the most important parameter in CGA Parameters defined
   in Section 4.1.  Public Key MUST be DER-encoded ASN.1 structure of
   the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo formatted as ECC Public Key. The
   AlgorithmIdentifier, contained in ASN.1 structure of type
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo, MUST be the (unrestricted) id- ecPublicKey
   algorithm identifier, which is OID 1.2.840.10045.2.1, and the
   subjectPublicKey MUST be formatted as an ECC Public Key, specified in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].

   Note that the ECC key lengths are determined by the namedCurves
   parameter stored in ECParameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier.
   The named curve to use is secp256r1 corresponding to P-256 which is
   OID 1.2.840.10045.3.1.7.


5.  Protocol Interactions

   Lightweight Secure Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy
   Networks (LSEND for LLN) modifies Neighbor Discovery Optimization for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] as explained in
   this section.  Protocol interactions are shown in Figure 1.

   6LoWPAN Border Routers (6LBR) send router advertisements (RA).
   6LoWPAN Nodes (6LN) or nodes in short receive these RAs and generate
   their own cryptographically generated addresses using elliptic curve
   cryptography as explained in Section 4.3.  The node sends a neighbor
   solicitation (NS) message with address registration option (ARO) to
   6LBR.  Such a NS is called an address registration NS.

   A LSEND for LLN node MUST send an address registration NS message
   after adding CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option defined in
   Section 4.1.  Source address MUST be set to its crypotographically
   generated address.  A LSEND for LLN node MUST set the Owner Interface
   Identifier field (EUI-64) in ARO to the rightmost 64 bits of its
   crypotographically generated address.  Subnet Prefix field of CGA
   Parameters MUST be set to the leftmost 64 bits of its
   crypotographically generated address.  Public Key field of CGA
   Parameters MUST be set to the node's ECC Public Key.

   6LBR receives the address registration NS. 6LBR verifies the source
   address as described in Section 5.1.2. of [RFC3971] using the claimed
   source address and CGA Parameters field in the message.  After
   successfully verifying the address 6LBR next does a cryptographic
   check of the signature included in Digital Signature field in the
   message.  If all checks succeed then 6LBR performs a duplicate
   address detection procedure first on the address.  If that also
   succeeds 6LBR registers CGA in the neighbor cache. 6LBR also caches
   the node's public key.

   6LBR sends an address registration neighbor advertisement (NA) as a
   reply to confirm the node's registration.  Status is set to 0 to
   indicate success.  This completes initial address registration.  The
   address registration needs to be refreshed after the neighbor cache
   entry times out.

   the node's public key and MUST be set as described in Section 4.2.
   Digital Signature field MUST be set as described in Section 4.2.

   6LBR receives the address registration refresh NS. 6LBR uses the key
   hash field in Digital Signature Option to find the node's public key
   from the neighbor cache. 6LBR verifies the digital signature in the
   NS.  In case of successful verification, 6LBR sends back an address
   registration neighbor advertisement (NA) to the node and sets the
   status to 0 indicating successful refreshment of the CGA of the node.
   Similar refresh NS and NA exchanges happen afterwards as shown in
   Figure 1

5.1.  Packet Sizes

   Original address registration NS message contains 40 byte header and
   ARO is 16 octets.  DER-encoded ECC Public Key for P-256 curve is 88
   octets long.  Digital Signature field when using ECDSA for P-256
   curve is 71 octets long without padding
   [I-D.cheneau-csi-ecc-sig-agility].

   CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option's CGA Parameters include
   16 octet modifier, 8 octet prefix obtained from the router
   advertisement message sent from 6LBR, 1 octet collision count and 88
   octet Public Key. Digital Signature is 71 octets.  The option is 184
   octets with Padding 0 octets.  The total message size of an original
   LSEND address registration NS message is 240 octets and such a

   message can be encapsulated into three 802.15.4 frames.

   An address registration refresh NS message contains an ARO which is
   16 octets and digital signature option containing 16 octet key hash
   and 71 octet signature and 5 octet Padding.  The message is 152
   octets long with the header.  Such a message could be encapsulated in
   two 802.15.4 frames.


6.  Security Considerations

   Same considerations regarding the threats to the Local Link Not
   Covered as in [RFC3971] apply.

   The threats discussed in Section 9.2 of [RFC3971] are countered by
   the protocol described in this document as well.

   As to the attacks to the protocol itself, denial of service attacks
   that involve producing a very high number of packets are deemed
   unlikely because of the assumptions on the node capabilities in low-
   power and lossy networks.


7.  IANA considerations

   This document defines two new options to be used in neighbor
   discovery protocol messages and new type values for CGA Parameters
   and Digital Signature Option (TBA1) and Digital Signature Option
   (TBA2) need to be assigned by IANA.
