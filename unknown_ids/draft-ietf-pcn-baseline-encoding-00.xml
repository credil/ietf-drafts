   <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides information to support 
   admission control and flow termination in order to protect
   the Quality of Service of inelastic flows.  It does this by marking packets 
   when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a threshold
   below the physical link rate. This document specifies how such marks are to 
   be encoded into the IP header.  The baseline encoding described here provides 
   for only two PCN encoding states. It is designed to be easily extensible to
   provide more encoding states but such schemes will be described in other documents.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_intro" title="Introduction">
 <t>
   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides information to support admission 
   control and flow termination in order to protect the quality of service (QoS) 
   of inelastic flows.  This is achieved by marking packets according to the 
   level of pre-congestion at nodes within a PCN-domain. These 
   markings are evaluated by the egress nodes of the PCN-domain. <xref target="PCN-arch"></xref> 
   describes how PCN packet markings can be used to assure the QoS of inelastic 
   flows within a single DiffServ domain.</t> 
<t>
This document specifies how these PCN marks are encoded into the IP header. 
It also describes how packets are identified as belonging to a PCN flow.  Some 
deployment models require two PCN encoding states, others require more. The baseline 
encoding described here only provides for two PCN encoding states. An extension of the baseline 
   encoding described in <xref target="PCN-3-enc-state"></xref> provides for 
   three PCN encoding states. Other extensions have also been suggested all of which
   can build on the baseline encoding.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_IP" title="Encoding two PCN States in IP">

<t> 
   The PCN encoding states are defined using a combination of the DSCP and ECN 
   fields within the IP header. The baseline PCN encoding closely follows the semantics 
   of ECN [RFC3168]. It allows the encoding of two PCN states: Not-Marked and PCN-Marked. 
   It also allows for traffic that is not PCN capable to be marked as such (not-PCN). 
   Given the scarcity of codepoints within the IP header the baseline encoding leaves
   one codepoint free for experimental use. The following table defines 
   how to encode these states in IP:</t> 
<texttable anchor="pcn_enc_Tab_Default_coding" title="Encoding PCN in IP">
    <ttcol align="center">DSCP \ RFC3168 ECN codepoint</ttcol>
    <ttcol align="center">not-ECT (00)</ttcol>
    <ttcol align="center">ECT(0) (10)</ttcol>
    <ttcol align="center">ECT(1) (01)</ttcol>
    <ttcol align="center">CE (11)</ttcol>
    <c>DSCP n</c><c>not-PCN</c><c>NM</c><c>EXP</c><c>PM</c>
     <postamble>Where DSCP n is a PCN-enabled DiffServ codepoint (see <xref target="pcn_enc_DSCPs"></xref>) 
     and EXP means available for Experimental use.</postamble>
 </texttable>

 <t>
The following rules apply to all PCN traffic:
<list style="symbols">
      <t>PCN traffic MUST be marked with a PCN-compatible DiffServ Codepoint. That is a 
      DiffServ codepoint that indicates that PCN could be enabled by setting the 
      appropriate value in the ECN field. To conserve DSCPs, 
      DiffServ Codepoints SHOULD be chosen that are already defined for use with 
      admission controlled traffic, such as the Voice-Admit codepoint defined in 
      <xref target="voice-admit"></xref>.  </t>

      <t>Any packet that is not PCN-enabled (not-PCN) but which shares the same 
      DiffServ codepoint as PCN-enabled traffic MUST have the ECN field set to 00.  </t>

      </list> 
</t>

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<section anchor="pcn_enc_rationale" title="Rationale for Encoding">

<t> 
 The exact choice of encoding was dictated by the constraints imposed by existing 
 IETF RFCs, in particular <xref target="RFC3168"></xref> and 
 <xref target="RFC4774"></xref>. Full details are contained in 
 <xref target="pcn-enc-compare"></xref>. One of the tightest constraints was 
 the need for any PCN encoding to survive being tunnelled through either an 
 IP in IP tunnel or an IPSec Tunnel. <xref target="pcn_enc_app_tunnel"></xref> 
 explains this in detail. The main effect of this constraint is that any PCN 
 marking has to use the ECN field set to 11 (CE codepoint). If the packet is 
 being tunneled then only the CE codepoint gets copied into the inner header upon 
 decapsulation. An additional constraint is the need to minimise the use of DiffServ 
 codepoints as these are in increasingly short supply. 
 <xref target="pcn_enc_DSCPs"></xref> explains how we have minimised this still 
 further by reusing pre-existing Diffserv codepoint(s) such that non-PCN traffic 
 can still be distinguished from PCN traffic.
</t><t>
The encoding scheme (<xref target="pcn_enc_Tab_Default_coding"></xref>) that best 
addresses the above constraints ends up looking very similar to ECN. This is 
perhaps not surprising given the similarity in architectural intent between PCN and ECN. 

</t>

</section>
<!-- ================================================================ -->
<section anchor="pcn_enc_DSCPs" title="PCN-Compatible DiffServ Codepoints">

<t> 
 Equipment complying with the baseline PCN encoding MUST allow PCN to be enabled 
 for a certain Diffserv codepoint or codepoints. This document defines the term 
 "PCN-Compatible Diffserv Codepoint" for such a DSCP. Enabling PCN for a DSCP 
 switches on PCN marking behaviour for packets with that DSCP, but only if those 
 packets also have their ECN field set to indicate a codepoint other than not-PCN.
 </t> <t>
Enabling PCN marking behaviour disables any other marking behaviour (e.g. enabling 
PCN  disables the default ECN marking behaviour introduced in 
<xref target="RFC3168"></xref>). The scheduling behaviour is discussed in 
<xref target="pcn-marking-behaviour"></xref>.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_compat" title="Backwards Compatability">

<t>  BCP 124 <xref target="RFC4774"></xref> gives guidelines for specifying 
alternative semantics for the ECN field. It sets out a number of factors that 
must be taken into consideration. It also suggests various techniques to allow 
the co-existence of default ECN and alternative ECN semantics. The baseline encoding 
specified in this document defines PCN-compatible 
DiffServ Codepoints as no longer supporting the default ECN semantics. As such this
document is compatible with BCP 124.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_security" title="Security Considerations">
    <t>Packets claim entitlement to be PCN marked by carrying a PCN-enabled DSCP 
    and a PCN-Capable ECN codepoint. This encoding document is intended to stand 
    independently of the architecture used to determine whether specific packets 
    are authorised to be PCN marked, which will be described in a future separate 
    document on PCN edge-node behaviour (see <xref target="pcn_enc_app_behaviours"></xref>). 
    </t>
    <t>The PCN working group has initially been 
    chartered to only consider a PCN-domain to be entirely under the control of
    one operator, or a set of operators who trust each other 
    <xref target="PCN-charter"></xref>. However there is a requirement to 
    keep inter-domain scenarios in mind when defining the PCN encoding. One way to 
    extend to multiple domains would be to concatenate PCN-domains and use 
    PCN-boundary-nodes back to back at borders. Then any one domain's security 
    against its neighbours would be described as part of the edge-node behaviour document as above.
     </t>
    <t>One proposal on the table allows one to extend PCN across multiple domains without
    PCN-boundary-nodes back-to-back at borders <xref target="re-PCN"></xref>. It is 
    believed that the encoding described here would be compatible with the security 
    framework described there.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_Conclusions" title="Conclusions">

    <t>This document defines the baseline PCN encoding utilising a combination of a 
    PCN-enabled DSCP and the ECN field in the IP header. This baseline encoding 
    allows the existence of two PCN encoding states, not-Marked and PCN-Marked. 
    It also allows for the co-existence of traffic that is not PCN-capable within 
    the same DSCP so long as theat traffic doesn't require end-to-end ECN support.
    The encoding scheme is conformant with <xref target="RFC4774"></xref>.

<section anchor="pcn_enc_app_tunnel" title="Tunnelling Constraints">
    <t>
    The rules that govern the behaviour of the ECN field for IP-in-IP tunnels were 
    defined in <xref target="RFC3168"></xref>. This allowed for two tunnel modes.
    The limited functionality mode sets the outer header to not-ECT, 
    regardless of the value of the inner header, in other words disabling ECN 
    within the tunnel. The full functionality mode 
    copies the inner ECN field into the outer header if the inner header is not-ECT 
    or either of the 2 ECT codepoints. If the inner header is CE then the outer 
    header is set to ECT(0). On decapsulation, if the CE codepoint is set on the 
    outer header then this is copied into the inner header. Otherwise the inner 
    header is left unchanged. The stated reason for blocking CE from being 
    copied to the outer header was to prevent this from being used as a covert 
    channel through IPSec tunnels.
    </t>
    
    <t>
The IPSec protocol <xref target="RFC4301"></xref> changed the ECN tunnelling rule 
to allow IPSec tunnels to simply copy the inner header into the outer header. On 
decapsulation the outer header is discarded and the ECN field is only copied down 
if it is set to CE.</t>
<t>
Because of the possible existence of tunnels, only CE (11) can 
be used as a PCN marking as it is the only mark that will survive decapsulation.
However there is a need for caution with all tunneling within the PCN-domain.  
RFC3168 full functionality IP in IP tunnels are 
expected to set the ECN field to ECT(0) if the inner ECN field is set to CE. This 
leads to the possibility that some packets within the PCN-domain that have already 
been marked may have that mark concealed further into the domain. This is undesirable 
for many PCN schemes and thus standard IP in IP tunnels SHOULD NOT be used within a 
PCN-domain. Further work is needed within the Transport Area to rationalise the 
behaviour of IP in IP tunnels in respect to the ECN field and bring them in line with the 
behaviour of IPSec tunnels <xref target="ecn-tunnelling"></xref>.

{Note this appendix is provided for information only}.

<list style="numbers">
<t>An operator may wish to use PCN-based admission control only. To that end,

<t>
An operator may wish to use PCN-based flow termination only. To that end, excess 
rate marking based on supportable rates might be used as the only PCN metering and

meaning the ingress shoudl start terminating appropriate flows.</t>

<t>
An operator may wish to use both PCN-based admission control and flow termination. 
To that end, excess rate marking based on admissible rates might be used as the only
PCN metering and marking algorithm. The level of marks will be used to determine when
the ingress shoudl stop admitting new traffic and whether the ingress should terminate
any flows.</t>

<t>
An operator may wish to implement admission control based on threshold marking at 
admissible rates and flow termination based on excess rate marking at supportable 
rates because these methods are believed to work better with small ingress-egress 
aggregates. Then two different markings are needed. Such a deployment scenario is not
supported by the PCN baseline encoding.</t>
