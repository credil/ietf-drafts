Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2                 June 2008


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing the Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4
   [RFC4271].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   As part of the IETF standardization effort for the BGP-4 protocol,
   [RFC4273] was written to address open issues in the previous version
   of the BGP-4 MIB, [RFC1657].  However, that RFC was primarily
   intended to address the base BGP-4 protocol as documented in
   [RFC4271].

   The BGP-4 protocol has greatly increased in scope over the years from
   its original definition.  Scaling mechanisms such as Route Reflection
   [RFC4456] and Confederations [RFC5065] have been introduced.  Multi-
   protocol extensions [RFC4760] were introduced which allowed
   advertisement of reachability such as IPv6 [RFC2545], MPLS Labeled
   routes [RFC3107], etc.

   This MIB addresses several of the deficiencies of the previous BGP-4
   MIB and provides an extension mechanism to permit additional MIB
   modules to be authored without requiring the base BGP-4 MIB to be
   updated.  This is seen as a desirable goal since the BGP-4 protocol
   continues to receive attention by those wishing to add to its

   functionality.

   In particular, this MIB addresses some specific weaknesses of the
   previous version:

   o  Add the ability to monitor IPv6 BGP-4 peering sessions and carry
      IPv6 reachability.  Other forms of reachability can be added at a
      later date courtesy of the address-family independent manner in
      which this was done.

   o  Add several counters of operational interest.  For example, the
      number of routes received from a given BGP peer.

   o  Replaces objects that were incapable of carrying the full range of
      their values with ones that can.

   o  Provides human-readable output for some complex data structures,
      such as the AS_PATH while also preserving a version of the data
      that is canonically machine readable.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Global Scalars

   o  bgpVersion - A vector of supported BGP Versions.

   o  bgpIdentifier - The BGP identifier of the local system.

   o  bgpLocalAsNew - A 4-byte capable local AS number which replaces
      the bgpLocalAs object.

   o  bgpAfPathAttrCounter - The number of entries in the
      bgpAfPathAttrTable.

5.2.  Tables

   o  bgpPeerAfTable - The BGP peer table.  This table is capable of
      representing IPv6 and other address-family (Af) independent
      peering sessions.  This table replaces the bgpPeerTable from
      previous versions of this MIB.

   o  bgpPeerAfErrorsTable - A table of peering session errors.  This
      table covers information previously present in bgpPeerTable.

   o  bgpPeerAfEventTimesTable - A table of peer-specific event timers.
      This table covers information previously present in bgpPeerTable.

Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2                 June 2008


   o  bgpPeerAfConfiguredTimersTable - A table of the configured values
      of peer-specific event timers.  This table covers information
      previously present in bgpPeerTable.

   o  bgpPeerAfNegotiatedTimersTable - A table of per-peer negotiated
      timers.  This information covers information previously derived
      from the bgpPeerTable.

   o  bgpPerAfCountersTable - A table of per-peer counters for messages
      and the BGP FSM.

   o  bgpPrefixCountersTable - A table of per-peer per Address Family
      Identifer-Subsequent Address Family Identifier (AFI-SAFI)
      [RFC4760] counters for prefixes.

   o  bgpNlriTable - A table of per-peer per AFI-SAFI prefix data.  This
      table covers information previously present in bgp4PathAttrTable.

   o  bgpAdjRibsOutTable - A per-peer per AFI-SAFI table indicating what
      reachability has been advertised to a given peer.

   o  bgpAfPathAttrTable - A table of BGP Path Attribute information.

   o  bgpAsPathTable - A table that decomposes the elements of a BGP AS
      Path.

   o  bgpAfPathUnknownTable - A table that decomposes the unknown
      elements received in a BGP Path Attribute tuple.

5.3.  Obsoleted Tables

   o  bgpPeerTable - Replaced by the information in bgpPeerAfTable,
      bgpPeerAfErrorsTable, bgpPeerConfiguredTimersTable,
      bgpPeerAfNegotiatedTimersTable, bgpPeerAfCountersTable.

   o  bgpRcvPathAttrTable - Covered BGP-3 and earlier.

   o  bgp4PathAttrTable - Replaced by the information in bgpNlriTable,
      bgpAfPathAttrTable and bgpAfPathUnknownTable.

5.4.  Textual Conventions

   o  BgpIdentifierTC - Representation of a BGP Identifier

   o  BgpAddressFamilyIdentifierTC - Representation of a BGP Address
      Family Identifier

Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2                 June 2008


   o  BgpSubsequentAddressFamilyIdentifierTC - Representation of a BGP
      Subsequent Address Family Identifier

   o  BgpPathAttributeFlagsTC - Representation of BGP-4 Path Attribute
      Flags.

5.5.  Notifications

   o  bgpAfEstablishedNotification - Sent when a BGP peer transitions
      into the Established state.  Replaces the previous
      bgpEstablishedNotification, which was not address family
      independent.

   o  bgpAfBackwardTransitionNotification - Sent when a BGP peer
      transitions out of the Established state.  Replaces the previous
      bgpBackwardTransNotification, which was not addrss family
      independent.

   o  bgpEstablished - Erroneously added to an incorrect OID in a
      previous version of this MIB.

   o  bgpBackwardsTransition - Erroneously added to an incorrect OID in
      a previous version of this MIB.

5.6.  Extensions

   A feature of this MIB is the recognition that the BGP protocol
   continues to grow in functionality.  The bgpExtensions OID is defined
   to provide a place for IDR-approved MIB modules for BGP extensions to
   be added to the bgp MIB subtree.

   It is intended that, where possible, that tables added via extensions
   that add information via additional path attributes use
   bgpAfPathAttrIndex as a common index, either via INDEX or AUGMENTS.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the TCP-MIB

   The bgpPeerAfLocalAddrType/bgpPeerAfLocalAddr/bgpPeerAfLocalPort and
   bgpPeerAfRemoteAddrType/bgpPeerAfRemoteAddr/bgpPeerAfRemotePort
   objects may provide a suitable index for monitoring the BGP peering
   session's TCP session via the TCP-MIB [RFC4022].

   Note that conducting BGP peering sessions over transport protocols
   other than TCP over IP are out of scope of the current BGP
   specifications.

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system providing inter-domain routing.  As
   such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB
   may result in denial of service to a large number of end-users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      bgpPeerAdminStatus - Improper change of bgpPeerAdminStatus, from
      start to stop, can cause significant disruption of the
      connectivity to those portions of the Internet reached via the
      applicable remote BGP peer.

Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2                 June 2008


      bgpPeerConnectRetryInterval - Improper change of this object can
      cause connections to be disrupted for extremely long time periods
      when otherwise they would be restored in a relatively short period
      of time.

      bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured, bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured -
      Misconfiguration of these objects can make BGP sessions more
      fragile and less resilient to denial of service attacks on the
      inter-domain routing system.

      bgpPeerMinASOriginationInterval,
      bgpPeerMinRouteAdvertisementInterval - Misconfiguration of these
      objects may adversely affect global Internet convergence of the
      routes advertised by this BGP speaker.  This may result in long-
      lived routing loops and blackholes for the portions of the
      Internet that utilize these routes.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  bgpPeerAfLocalAddrType, bgpPeerAfLocalAddr,bgpPeerAfLocalPort
      bgpPeerAfRemoteAddrType, bgpPeerAfRemoteAddr, bgpPeerAfRemotePort,
      bgpPeerLocalAddr, bgpPeerLocalPort, bgpPeerRemoteAddr,
      bgpPeerRemotePort - A BGP peer's local and remote addresses might
      be sensitive for ISPs who want to keep interface addresses on
      routers confidential in order to prevent router addresses used for
      a denial of service attack or spoofing.  Note that other tables
      which share elements of these objects as indexes may similarly
      expose sensitive information.

   o  bgpNlriTable, bgpAdjRibsOutTable, bgpAfPathAttrTable,
      bgpAsPathTable, bgpRcvdPathAttrTable, bgp4PathAttrTable - A BGP
      peer's routing information may be sensitive for ISPs as the
      contents of their routing tables may expose details related to
      business relationships as implemented in Internet routing.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as

   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes an OID, bgpExtensions, which defines a name
   space for future BGP extensions.  IANA is requested to create a new
   registry for new OIDs under bgpExtensions that will define the root
   OID of future MIB modules for bgp extensions.  The assignment OIDs
   should be done based upon IDR working group consensus.

10.  Contributors

   This document owes significant thanks over the years to Wayne
   Tackabury, Susan Hares and the members of the idr and ops-nm mailing
   lists.  This document represents several years of negotiating
   operational needs, Internet operational security considerations and
   the sheer messiness of representing the BGP protocol in SMIv2.

   I owe particular thanks to Susan Hares as a mentor who let me dive
   head-first into the world of Internet standards work by saying, "We
   have this MIB that just needs a little cleanup to advance in the
   standards process."
