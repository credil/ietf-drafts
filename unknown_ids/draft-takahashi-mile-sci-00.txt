Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Aug 2011


1.  Introduction

   Cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated, and their numbers are
   increasing day by day.  To cope with such situation, incident
   information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among
   organizations.  IODEF is one of the tools enabling such exchange, and
   is already in use.

   On the other hand, there exist various other activities facilitating
   detailed and structured description of cybersecurity information,
   major of which includes CAPEC, CEE, CPE, CVE, CVRF, CVSS, CWE, CWSS,
   OVAL, and XCCDF.  Since such structured description facilitates
   cybersecurity operations, it would be beneficial to embed and convey
   these information inside IODEF document.

   To enable that, this document extends the IODEF to embed and convey
   various structured cybersecurity information, with which
   cybersecurity operations can be facilitated.  Since IODEF defines a
   flexible and extensible format and supports a granular level of
   specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF instead of
   defining a new report format.  For clarity, and to eliminate
   duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing
   the exhange of such structured information are provided.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in
   [RFC5070].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange
   cybersecurity information, which includes the following information:
   attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness,
   countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.

   IODEF provides a scheme to exchange such information among interested
   parties.  However, the detailed common format to describe such
   information is not defined in the IODEF base document.

   On the other hand, to describe those information and to faciliate
   exchange, a structured format for that is already available.  Major

   of them are CAPEC, CEE, CPE, CVE, CVRF, CVSS, CWE, CWSS, OVAL, and
   XCCDF.  By embedding them into the IODEF document, the documnt can
   convey more detailed contents to the receivers, and the document can
   be easily reused.

   These structured cybersecuriity information facilitates cybersecurity
   operation at the receiver side.  Since the information is machine-
   readable, the data can be processed by computers.  That expedites the
   automation of cybersecurity operations

   For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident
   wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited.  Then the sender
   can simply use IODEF, where an CAPEC record is embedded instead of
   describing everything in free format text.  Receiver can also
   identify the needed details of the attack pattern by looking up some
   of the xml tags defined by CAPEC.  Receiver can accummulate the
   attack pattern information (CAPEC record) in its database and could
   distribute it to the interested parties if needed, without needing
   human interventions.


4.  Extension Definition

   This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity
   information by introducing new classes, with which these information
   can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents of
   AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.

   The IODEF Incident element ([RFC5070], Section 3.2) is summarized
   below.  It is expressed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax as
   used in the IODEF specification.  The UML representation is for
   illustrative purposes only; elements are specified in XML as defined
   in Appendix A.

   | EventRecord        |
   +--------------------+
   | STRING Version     |<>----------[ SpecificationName ]
   |                    |<>--(0..1)--[ SpecificationVersion  ]
   |                    |<>--(1..*)--[ Record  ]
   +--------------------+

   This class has an attribute.

   Version:  REQUIRED.  STRING.  The version shall be the value 1.00, to
      be compliant with this document.

   This class is composed of three aggregate classes.

   SpecificationName:  One. ENUM.  The name of the specification
      specifying the format of the Record element.  This field contains
      one of the following values:

         1. cee. common attack pattern enumeration and classification.

         2. other.  This is used to identify not-yet-enumerated
         specifications.

   SpecificationVersion:  Zero or one.  ML_STRING.  The version of the
      specification specifying the format of the Score element

   Record:  One or more.  ML_STRING.  A complete document that is
      formatted according to the schema referenced by the IANA
      registration of the ENUM value used for SpecificationName and
      SpecificationVersion elements.

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the SpecificationName and
   SpecificationVersion are consistent with the contents of the Record;
   if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the
   specification and version derived from the content, and SHOULD log
   the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.7.  Remediation

   A Remediation consists of an extension to the Incident.AdditionalData
   element with a dtype of "xml".  The extension elements describes
   incident remediation infomration including instructions.

   It is recommended that Incident class SHOULD contain one or more of
   this extension elements whenever available.

   A Remediation class is structured as follows.

      specifying the format of the Record element.  This field contains
      one of the following values:

         1. oval.

         2. ocil.

         3. xccdff.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity for the specific environment.

   Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.

   [Note: additional text will appear soon]

6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns

   The critical security concerns are that phishing activity reports may
   be falsified or the PhraudReport may become corrupt during transit.
   In areas where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the



Takahashi, et al.       Expires February 27, 2012              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Aug 2011


   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection.

6.2.  Using the iodef:restriction Attribute

   In some instances, data values in particular elements may contain
   data deemed sensitive by the reporter.  Although there are no
   general-purpose rules on when to mark certain values as "private" or
   "need-to-know" via the iodef:restriction attribute, the reporter is
   cautioned not to apply element-level sensitivity markings unless they
   believe the receiving party (i.e., the party they are exchanging the
   event report data with) has a mechanism to adequately safeguard and
   process the data as marked.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-msmspecs-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: None

   Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-msmspecs-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in the appendix of the document.
