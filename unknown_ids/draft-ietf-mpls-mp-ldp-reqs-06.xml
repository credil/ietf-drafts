    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>LDP <xref target="RFC5036" pageno="false" format="default"/> has been deployed for setting up
      point-to-point (P2P) and multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs, in order to
      offer point-to-point services in MPLS backbones.</t>

      <t>There are emerging requirements for supporting delivery of
      point-to-multipoint applications in MPLS backbones, such as those
      defined in <xref target="RFC4834" pageno="false" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC5501" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>This requires mechanisms for setting up point-to-multipoint LSPs
      (P2MP LSP), i.e. LSPs with one Ingress LSR, a set of Egress LSRs, and
      with MPLS traffic replication at some Branch LSRs.</t>

      <t>RSVP-TE extensions for setting up Point-To-Multipoint Traffic
      Engineered LSPs (P2MP TE LSPs), have been defined in <xref target="RFC4875" pageno="false" format="default"/>. They meet requirements expressed in <xref target="RFC4461" pageno="false" format="default"/>. This approach is useful, in network
      environments where P2MP Traffic Engineering capabilities are needed
      (Optimization, QoS, Fast recovery).</t>

      <t>However for operators who want to support point-to-multipoint traffic
      delivery on an MPLS backbone, without Traffic Engineering needs, and
      have already deployed LDP for P2P traffic, an interesting and useful
      approach would be to rely on LDP extensions in order to setup
      point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs. This would bring consistency with P2P
      MPLS applications and would ease the delivery of point-to-multipoint
      services in an MPLS backbone.</t>

      <t>This document focuses on the LDP approach for setting up P2MP LSPs.
      It lists a detailed set of requirements for P2MP extensions to LDP, so
      as to deliver P2MP traffic over a LDP-enabled MPLS infrastructure. These
      requirements should be used as guidelines when specifying LDP
      extensions. It is intended that solutions that specify LDP procedures
      for P2MP LSP setup, satisfy these requirements.</t>

      <t>Note that generic requirements for P2MP extensions to MPLS are out of
      the scope of this document. Rather this document describes solution
      specific requirements related to LDP extensions in order to set up P2MP
      LSPs.</t>

      <t>Note also that other mechanisms could be used for setting up P2MP
      LSPs, such as for instance PIM extensions, but these are out of the
      scope of this document. The objective is not to compare these mechanisms
      but rather to focus on the requirements for an LDP extension
      approach.</t>

    <section anchor="pbstatement" title="Problem Statement and Requirements Overview" toc="default">
      <section title="Problem Statement" toc="default">
        <t>LDP <xref target="RFC5036" pageno="false" format="default"/> has been deployed for setting up
        P2P and MP2P MPLS LSPs as PE-to-PE tunnels so as to carry
        point-to-point traffic essentially in Layer 3 and Layer 2 VPN
        networks. There are emerging requirements for supporting multicast
        traffic delivery within these VPN infrastructures (<xref target="RFC4834" pageno="false" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC5501" pageno="false" format="default"/>). For
        various reasons, including consistency with P2P applications, and
        taking full advantages of MPLS network infrastructure, it would be
        highly desirable to use MPLS LSPs for the delivery of multicast
        traffic. This could be implemented by setting up a group of P2P or
        MP2P LSPs, but such an approach may be sub-optimal since it would
        result in data replication at the ingress LSR, and bandwidth
        inefficiency (duplicate data traffic within the network). Hence new
        mechanisms are required that would allow traffic from an Ingress LSR
        to be efficiently delivered to a number of Egress LSRs in an MPLS
        backbone, avoiding duplicate copies of a packet on a given link.</t>

        <t>Such efficient traffic delivery requires setting up P2MP LSPs. A
        P2MP LSP is an LSP starting at an Ingress LSR, and ending on a set of
        one or more Egress LSRs. Traffic sent by the Ingress LSR is replicated
        on one or more Branch LSRs down to Egress LSRs.</t>

        <t>RSVP-TE extensions for setting up P2MP TE LSPs, which meet
        requirements expressed in <xref target="RFC4461" pageno="false" format="default"/>, have been
        defined in <xref target="RFC4875" pageno="false" format="default"/>. This approach is useful, in
        network environments where Traffic Engineering capabilities are
        required. However, for operators that deployed LDP for setting up
        PE-to-PE unicast MPLS LSPs, and without the need for traffic
        engineering, an interesting approach would be using LDP extensions for
        setting up P2MP LSPs.</t>

        <t>The following gives a set of guidelines that a specification of LDP
        extensions for setting up P2MP LSPs should follow.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Requirements overview" toc="default">
        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs, i.e. LSPs
        with one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress LSRs, with traffic
        replication at some Branch LSRs.</t>

        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the addition or removal of leaves
        associated with a P2MP LSP.</t>

        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST co-exist with current LDP mechanisms
        and inherit its capability sets from <xref target="RFC5036" pageno="false" format="default"/>.
        It is of paramount importance that the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST NOT
        impede the operation of existing P2P/MP2P LDP LSPs. Also the P2MP LDP
        mechanism MUST co-exist with P2P and P2MP RSVP-TE mechanisms <xref target="RFC3209" pageno="false" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC4875" pageno="false" format="default"/>. It</t>

        <t>is of paramount importance that the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST NOT
        impede the operation of existing P2P and P2MP RSVP-TE LSPs.</t>

        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MAY also allow setting up
        multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs connecting a group of Leaf LSRs
        acting indifferently as Ingress LSR or Egress LSR. This may allow a
        reduction in the amount of LDP state that needs to be maintained by a
        LSR.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="appscenario" title="Application scenario" toc="default">
      <t><xref target="fig1" pageno="false" format="default"/> below illustrates an LDP enabled MPLS
      provider network, used to carry both unicast and multicast traffic of
      VPN customers following for instance the architecture defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast" pageno="false" format="default"/> for BGP/MPLS VPNs, or the
      one defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>In this example, a set of MP2P LDP LSPs are setup between Provider
      Edge (PE) routers to carry unicast VPN traffic within the MPLS
      backbone.</t>

      <t>And in this example a set of P2MP LDP LSPs are setup between PE
      routers acting as Ingress LSRs and PE routers acting as Egress LSRs, so
      as to support multicast VPN traffic delivery within the MPLS
      backbone.</t>

      <t>For instance, a P2MP LDP LSP is setup between Ingress LSR PE1 and
      Egress LSRs PE2, PE3, and PE4. It is used to transport multicast traffic
      from PE1 to PE2, PE3 and PE4. P1 is a Branch LSR, it replicates MPLS
      traffic sent by PE1 to P2, P3 and PE2. P2 and P3 are non-branch transit
      LSRs, they forward MPLS traffic sent by P1 to PE3 and PE4
      respectively.</t>

      <t>If later there are new receivers attached to PE5 and PE6, then PE5
      and PE6 join the P2MP LDP LSP. P2 and P3 become Branch LSRs and
      replicate traffic received from P1, to PE3 and PE5, and to PE4 and PE6
      respectively (see <xref target="fig2" pageno="false" format="default"/> below).</t>

      <t>The above example is provided for the sake of illustration. Note that
      P2MP LSPs ingress and egress LSRs may not necessarily be PE routers.
      Also branch LSRs may not necessarily be P routers.</t>

    <section anchor="detailedreqs" title="Detailed Requirements" toc="default">
      <section title="P2MP LSPs" toc="default">
        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs. Data
        plane aspects related to P2MP LSPs are those already defined in <xref target="RFC4461" pageno="false" format="default"/>. That is, a P2MP LSP has one Ingress LSR and
        one or more Egress LSRs. Traffic sent by the Ingress LSR is received
        by all Egress LSRs. The specific aspects related to P2MP LSPs is the
        action required at a Branch LSR, where data replication occurs.
        Incoming labelled data is appropriately replicated to several outgoing
        interfaces which may use different labels. Only one copy of a packet
        MUST be sent on a given link of a P2MP LSP.</t>

        <t>A P2MP LSP MUST be identified by a constant and unique identifier
        within the whole LDP domain, whatever the number of leaves, which may
        vary dynamically. This identifier will be used so as to add/remove
        leaves to/from the P2MP tree.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="P2MP LSP FEC" toc="default">
        <t>As with P2P MPLS technology <xref target="RFC5036" pageno="false" format="default"/>, traffic
        MUST be classified into a FEC in this P2MP extension. All packets
        which belong to a particular P2MP FEC and which travel from a
        particular node MUST use the same P2MP LSP.</t>

        <t>As such, a new LDP FEC that is suitable for P2MP forwarding MUST be
        specified.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="P2MP LDP routing" toc="default">
        <t>As with P2P and MP2P LDP LSPs, the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support
        hop-by-hop LSP routing. P2MP LDP-based routing SHOULD rely upon the
        information maintained in LSR Routing Information Bases (RIB).</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that the P2MP LSP routing rely upon a shortest
        path to the Ingress LSR so as to setup an MPLS shortest path tree.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Setting up, tearing down and modifying P2MP LSPs" toc="default">
        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment, maintenance
        and teardown of P2MP LSPs in a scalable manner. This MUST include both
        the existence of a large amount of P2MP LSPs within a single network
        and a large amount of leaf LSRs for a single P2MP LSP (see also
        section 5.17 for scalability considerations and figures).</t>

        <t>In order to scale well with a large number of leaves it is
        RECOMMENDED to follow a leaf-initiated P2MP LSP setup approach. For
        that purpose, leaves will have to be aware of the P2MP LSP identifier.
        The ways a Leaf LSR discovers P2MP LSPs identifiers rely on the
        applications that will use P2MP LSPs, and are out of the scope of this
        document.</t>

        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the dynamic addition and removal
        of leaves to and from a P2MP LSP, without any restriction (provided
        there is network connectivity). It is RECOMMENDED that these
        operations be leaf-initiated. These operations MUST NOT impact the
        data transfer (packet loss, duplication, delay) towards other leaves.
        It is RECOMMENDED that these operations do not cause any additional
        processing except on the path from the added/removed Leaf LSR to the
        Branch LSR.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Label Advertisement" toc="default">
        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support downstream unsolicited label
        advertisement mode. This is well suited to a leaf-initiated approach
        and is consistent with P2P/MP2P LDP operations.</t>

        <t>Other advertisement modes MAY also be supported.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data Duplication" toc="default">
        <t>Data duplication refers to the receipt of multiple copies of a
        packet by any leaf. Although this may be a marginal situation, it may
        also be detrimental for certain applications. Hence, data duplication
        SHOULD as much as possible be avoided, and limited to (hopefully rare)
        transitory conditions.</t>

        <t>Note, in particular, that data duplication might occur if P2MP LSP
        rerouting is being performed (See also section 6.8).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Detecting and Avoiding Loops" toc="default">
        <t>The P2MP LDP extension MUST have a mechanism to detect routing
        loops. This may rely on extensions to the LDP Loop detection mechanism
        defined in <xref target="RFC5036" pageno="false" format="default"/>. A loop detection mechanism
        may require recording the set of LSRs traversed on the P2MP Tree. The
        P2MP loop avoidance mechanism MUST NOT impact the scalability of the
        P2MP LDP solution.</t>

        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD have a mechanism to avoid routing
        loops in the data plane even during transient events.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST avoid routing loops in the
        data plane, that may trigger unexpected non-localized exponential
        growth of traffic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="P2MP LSP Re-routing" toc="default">
        <t>The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the rerouting of a P2MP LSP in
        the following cases:<list style="symbols">

    <section anchor="sharedtrees" title="Shared Trees" toc="default">
      <t>For traffic delivery between a group of N Leaf LSRs which are acting
      indifferently as Ingress or Egress LSRs, it may be useful to setup a
      shared tree connecting all these LSRs, instead of having N P2MP LSPs.
      This would reduce the amount of control and forwarding state that has to
      be maintained on a given LSR.</t>

      <t>There are actually two main options for supporting such shared
      trees:<list style="symbols">
          <t>This could rely on the applications protocols that use LDP LSPs.
          A shared tree could consist of the combination of a MP2P LDP LSP
          from Leafs LSRs to a given root node, with a P2MP LSP from this root
          to Leaf LSRs. For instance with Multicast L3 VPN applications, it
          would be possible to build a shared tree by combining (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast" pageno="false" format="default"/>):<list style="symbols">

              group.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Or this could rely on a specific LDP mechanism allowing to setup
          multipoint-to-multipoint MPLS LSPs (MP2MP LSPs).</t>
        </list>The former approach (Combination of MP2P and P2MP LSPs at the
      application level) is out of the scope of this document while the latter
      (MP2MP LSPs) belong to the scope of this document. Requirements for the
      set up of MP2MP LSPs are listed below.</t>

      <section title="Requirements for MP2MP LSPs" toc="default">
        <t>A MP2MP LSP is a LSP connecting a group of Leaf LSRs acting
        indifferently as Ingress or Egress LSRs. Traffic sent by any Leaf LSR
        is received by all other Leaf LSRs of the group.</t>

        <t>Procedures for setting up MP2MP LSPs with LDP SHOULD be specified.
        An implementation that support P2MP LDP LSPs MAY also support MP2MP
        LDP LSP.</t>

        <t>The MP2MP LDP procedures MUST NOT impede the operations of P2MP
        LSP.</t>

        <t>Requirements for P2MP LSPs, set forth in section 6, apply equally
        to MP2MP LSPs. Particular attention should be given on the below
        requirements:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The solution MUST support recovery upon link and transit node
            failure and there MUST NOT be any single point of failure
            (provided network connectivity is redundant);</t>

            <t>The size of MP2MP state on a LSR, for one particular MP2MP LSP,
            SHOULD only depend on the number of adjacent LSRs on the LSP;</t>

            <t>Furthermore, the MP2MP LDP mechanism MUST avoid routing loops
            that may trigger exponential growth of traffic. Note that this
            requirement is more challenging with MP2MP LSPs as a LSR can
            receive traffic for a given LSP on multiple interfaces.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>There are additional requirements specific to MP2MP LSPs:<list style="symbols">
            <t>It is RECOMMENDED that a MP2MP MPLS LSP follow shortest paths
            to a specific LSR called root LSR;</t>

            <t>It is RECOMMENDED to define several root LSRs (e.g. a primary
            and a backup) to ensure redundancy upon root LSR failure;</t>

            <t>The receiver SHOULD NOT receive back a packet it has sent on
            the MP2MP LSP;</t>

            <t>The solution SHOULD avoid that all traffic between any pair of
            leaves is traversing a root LSR, and SHOULD as much as possible
            minimize the distance between two leaves (similarly to PIM-Bidir
            trees);</t>

<t>The architecture for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is described in RFC 3031.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

<abstract>
<t>This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the negative effects on MPLS traffic caused by Label Switching Router's (LSR's) control plane restart, specifically by the restart of its Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) component, on LSRs that are capable of preserving the MPLS forwarding component across the restart.  The mechanism described in this document is applicable to all LSRs, both those with the ability to preserve forwarding state during LDP restart and those without (although the latter needs to implement only a subset of the mechanism described in this document).  Supporting (a subset of) the mechanism described here by the LSRs that can not preserve their MPLS forwarding state across the restart would not reduce the negative impact on MPLS traffic caused by their control plane restart, but it would minimize the impact if their neighbor(s) are capable of preserving the forwarding state across the restart of their control plane and implement the mechanism described here.  The mechanism makes minimalistic assumptions on what has to be preserved across restart - the mechanism assumes that only the actual MPLS forwarding state has to be preserved; the mechanism does not require any of the LDP-related states to be preserved across the restart.  The procedures described in this document apply to downstream unsolicited label distribution.  Extending these procedures to downstream on demand label distribution is for further study.

<abstract>
<t>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) systems will be used in core networks where system downtime must be kept to an absolute minimum.  Many MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs) may, therefore, exploit Fault Tolerant (FT) hardware or software to provide high availability of the core networks.  The details of how FT is achieved for the various components of an FT LSR, including Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), the switching hardware and TCP, are implementation specific.  This document identifies issues in the LDP specification in RFC 3036, "LDP Specification", that make it difficult to implement an FT LSR using the current LDP protocols, and defines enhancements to the LDP specification to ease such FT LSR implementations.  The issues and extensions described here are equally applicable to RFC 3212, "Constraint-Based LSP Setup Using LDP" (CR-LDP). [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>This document describes a solution for overcoming a subset of the limitations of existing VPLS multicast solutions. It describes procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the sevice provider (SP) network.  One such multicast tree can be shared between multiple VPLS instances.  Procedures by which a single multicast tree in the SP network can be used to carry traffic belonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams from one or more VPLSes are also described.</t></abstract>

<abstract>
<t>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been extended to encompass point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As with point-to-point MPLS LSPs, the requirement to detect, handle, and diagnose control and data plane defects is critical.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; For operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs, the detection and specification of how to handle those defects are important because such defects not only may affect the fundamentals of an MPLS network, but also may impact service level specification commitments for customers of their network.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document describes requirements for data plane operations and management for P2MP MPLS LSPs. These requirements apply to all forms of P2MP MPLS LSPs, and include P2MP Traffic Engineered (TE) LSPs and multicast LSPs. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

The solution relies on RSVP-TE without requiring a multicast routing protocol in the Service Provider core. Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; There can be various applications for P2MP TE LSPs such as IP multicast. Specification of how such applications will use a P2MP TE LSP is outside the scope of this document. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>The widespread interest in provider-provisioned Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions lead to memos proposing different and overlapping solutions. The IETF working groups (first Provider Provisioned VPNs and later Layer 2 VPNs and Layer 3 VPNs) have discussed these proposals and documented specifications. This has lead to the development of a partially new set of concepts used to describe the set of VPN services.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; To a certain extent, more than one term covers the same concept, and sometimes the same term covers more than one concept. This document seeks to make the terminology in the area clearer and more intuitive. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>This document describes the use of RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol), including all the necessary extensions, to establish label-switched paths (LSPs) in MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching).  Since the flow along an LSP is completely identified by the label applied at the ingress node of the path, these paths may be treated as tunnels.  A key application of LSP tunnels is traffic engineering with MPLS as specified in RFC 2702. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
