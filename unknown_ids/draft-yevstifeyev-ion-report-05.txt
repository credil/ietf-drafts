1. Introduction

   This document reports on the IETF Operational Notes (IONs) process
   experiment, conducted by RFC 4693 [RFC4693] in accordance with RFC
   3933 [RFC3933].  It discusses the results of this experiment after
   first giving some background information on it in Section 2 and makes
   the appropriate conclusion.

   This document updates RFC 4693 [RFC4693] and changes its status to
   Historic per RFC 2026 [RFC2026] and [HISTORIC].

2. Background 

   IETF Operational Notes (IONs) were a series of documents established
   by RFC 4693 [RFC4693] on an experimental basis [RFC3933] in 2006. 
   This series is (in accordance with RFC 4693 [RFC4693])

     intended for use as a repository for IETF operations documents,
     which should be more ephemeral than RFCs, but more referenceable
     than Internet-Drafts, and with more clear handling procedures than
     a random Web page.

   RFC 4693 [RFC4693] contains some regulations regarding this series,
   such as ION attributes ("front page matters"), approval procedure,
   ION store considerations, etc.  It also proposes a set off initial
   IONs to be published and sets the sunset period of 1 year.  See
   Section 5 of RFC 4693 [RFC4693] for more background information on
   this topic.

3. Experiment Notes and Results

   This section is a detailed description of the IONs experiment process
   and results.  It also gives the information on further destiny of
   IONs.

3.1. Published IONs

   After establishing the IONs series per RFC 4693 [RFC4693], a number
   of IONs proposed by that document, as well as on some other topics,
   were published.  Particularly, the following IONs were issued (in
   alphabetical order):

   o ion-ad-sponsoring on "Guidance on Area Director Sponsoring of
     Documents" by Jari Arkko;

   o ion-agenda-and-minutes on "Formatting and Content of IETF Working
     Group Agendas and Minutes" by David Meyer and Olaf Kolkman;

   o ion-discuss-criteria on "DISCUSS Criteria in IESG Review" by the
     IESG members (at the date of approval);

   o ion-execd-tasks on "Tasks previously assigned to the IETF Executive
     Director" by Lucy Lynch and Brian Carpenter;

   o ion-ion-formats on "ION Format specification" by Brian Carpenter
     and Cullen Jennings;

   o ion-ion-store on "The ION Store" by Cullen Jennings and Brian
     Carpenter.

   o ion-meeting-network-requirements on "IETF Meeting Network
     Requirements" by Karen O'Donoghue, Jim Martin, Chris Elliott and
     Joel Jaeggli;

   o ion-procdocs on "The IETF Process: an Informal Guide" by Brian
     Carpenter;

   o ion-rfc-2026-in-practice on "RFC 2026 in Practice" by Brian
     Carpenter;

   o ion-subpoena on "Subpoenas in the IETF: Procedures" by Brian
     Carpenter;

   o ion-tsv-alt-cc on "Experimental Specification of New Congestion
     Control Algorithms" by Lars Eggert;

   The first 2 IONs were published on 11 January 2007.  They were ion-

   ion-formats and ion-ion-store.  The latest ION was ion-meeting-
   network-requirements, published on 13 December 2007.

3.2. Experiment Closure

   In 2008 the IONs experiment was terminated.  On 28 April 2008, the
   IESG said [IESG-IONS]:

     The IESG has determined that IONs will not be used in the future. 
     It is clear that the IESG, IAB, and IAOC need the ability to
     publish documents that do not expire and are easily updated. 
     Information published as web pages, including IESG Statements, are
     sufficient for this purpose. 

   De facto, IONs experiment had already been concluded by that time. 
   This document is to have a permanent record of its closure, required
   by RFC 3933 [RFC3933].

3.3. Subsequent Actions on IONs

   All IONs were republished whether as IESG statements, Web Pages, or
   were discarded.  The full list is as follows (in alphabetical order):

   o ion-ad-sponsoring was republished as IESG statement "Guidance on
     Area Director Sponsoring of Documents" [SPONSOR];

   o ion-agenda-and-minutes was republished as Web Page "Formatting and
     Content of IETF Working Group Agendas and Minutes" [AGENDA];

   o ion-discuss criteria was republished as IESG Statement "DISCUSS
     Criteria in IESG Review" [DISCUSS];

   o ion-execd-tasks was republished as Web Page "Tasks previously
     assigned to the IETF Executive Director" [EXECD];

   o ion-ion-formats was discarded;

   o ion-ion-store was discarded.

   o ion-meeting-network-requirements was republished as Web Page "IETF
     Meeting Network Requirements" [MEETING];

   o ion-procdocs was republished as Web Page "The IETF Process: an
     Informal Guide" [PROCDOCS];

   o ion-rfc2026-in-practice was republished as the Internet-Draft "RFC
     2026 in Practice" [2026PRACTICE] (that, however, at the time of
     publication of this document, has not resulted in RFC and is

     expired);

   o ion-subpoena was republished as Web Page "Subpoenas in the IETF:
     Procedures" [SUBPOENAS];

   o ion-tsv-alt-cc was republished as IESG Statement "Experimental
     Specification of New Congestion Control Algorithms" [ALT-CC];

3.4. Archival Copies of IONs

   All IONs were located at
   <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/content/ions.html>, which is currently
   removed from IETF site.  However the Internet Wayback Machine project
   [WAYBACK] currently has some snapshots of this page, as well as all
   published or drafted IONs, the most current before the experiment
   closure dated 16 April, 2008.  You may freely access them at
   <http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080416153527/http://www.ietf.org/
   IESG/content/ions.html>.

4. Conclusion

   Taking everything into account, it was considered that IONs added
   complications to the maintenance of documents but did not give a
   corresponding benefit to the IETF.  This document formally concludes
   the IONs experiment [RFC4693], as required by RFC 3933 [RFC3933]. 
   RFC 4693 is moved to Historic status per RFC 2026 [RFC2026] and
   [HISTORIC].

5. Security Considerations

   IONs did not include protocol specifications and therefore
   terminating this series is not believed to have any impact on
   security of the Internet.

6. IANA Considerations

   None.  RFC Editor must delete this section upon publication.

7. Acknowledgments

   Brian Carpenter and Russ Hosuley provided useful comments on this
   document.

   Many thanks to Harald Alvestrand for his work on RFC 4693.  

   I would also like to thank all the authors and editors of IONs for
