1.  Introduction

   This document provide IPv6 transition scenario using Stateless
   Automatic IPv4 over IPv6 Tunneling (SA46T) and applicabilities of
   SA46T.

   SA46T [I-D.draft-matsuhira-sa46t-spec] require IPv6, so if SA46T
   deploy, IPv6 also deploy too.  SA46T is just one of automatic
   tunnling technologies, so there are several usage with SA46T. This
   document shows such possible applicability.

   Translation between IPv6 and IPv4 is out of scope of this document.


2.  IPv6 Transition scenario with SA46T

   The basic strategy for IPv6 deployment is dual stack.  More careful
   viewing, IPv6 deployment could be think independently, that mean host
   deployment and network deployment could be treat different thing in
   technically.  Today, hosts that have a capabiliry generating IPv6
   traffic are very common and widely deployed, so network which treat
   both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic is not the point already.  The network
   which can treat both IPv4 and IPv6 is precondition already, the point
   is how network treat both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  The important thing
   is provided some options which can suitabele in time and place, or
   type of network.  The solution maight be different in each network.

   In general, three basic method is considered for network which enable
   to treat both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  Figure 1 shows such relation
   and below is some description about these.  SA46T correspond IPv4
   over IPv6 Tunneling technologies at IPv6 only network base.

   IPv4 only network base

      Based on current existing IPv4 network, and adding IPv6 over IPv4
      Tunneling technologies.  Maybe early stage method in IPv6
      transition

   Dual Stack network base

      Favorite method.

   IPv6 only network bse

      Considered in final transition stage.

   Thinking with time scale, following three stages are considered,
   these are starting IPv4 only network base, then Dual stack network
   base, and finally IPv6 only network base.  IPv6 only network base is
   final transition stage.  However, when the network is newly
   constructed, starting from dual stack network base may be common in
   current situation, and maybe starting with IPv6 only network base
   with SA46T may possible.  These approach may skip some investment,
   such as IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling at IPv4 only network base.  Figure 2
   shows such stages and starting options.

                                 Figure 2

   On a well stable IPv4 network, enabling IPv6 may bring something not
   predictable and not desirable.  Nobody can say something should
   happen, or something does not happen, because there are no
   experiences.  It may be pressure for opeator.  If operator can stop
   the service, some test for enabling IPv6 should be done in out of
   service time.  Enterprise network may be stop in holiday, however
   network service for consumer may be difficult to stop.

   One solution for such case, well stable network should leave as it is
   and buiding new network, that should be IPv6 base, and well test and
   get more stable with early adaptor, and then starting trial service,
   and finally staring formal service.  At this IPv6 based network, IPv4
   over IPv6 Tunneling should also test from the beginning, and after
   this new network get stable, moving IPv4 service from old IPv4 only
   based network to new IPv6 based network with SA46T. Figure 3 shows

   such transition scenario.  Adding IPv6 over IPv4 Tunnel to existing
   IPv4 only network may possible for providing early IPv6 service.

                                 Figure 3

   There may be other transition senarios, anyway, SA46T provide the
   scenario that start with new IPv6 only network base, and transition
   from existing IPv4 based network to new IPv6 based network.


3.  Applicability of SA46T

3.1.  IPv6 only backbone network

   As descrive above, SA46T make IP backbone network IPv6 only.  This
   case, IPv4 plane ID does not needed.  Type of possible network
   described below.

   Intranet

      Campus backbone network, Corporate backbone network, Enterprise
      backbone network, etc.  In technically, may using IPv4 private
      address and connect to the Internet via firewall.

Internet-Draft             SA46T applicability              January 2011


   ISP backbone

      ISP backbone network.

   Access Network

      xDSL, FTTH, CATV are example for access network.

   WIreless access network

      Public Wireless LAN servie is example of wireless access network.

   Data Center network

      DataCenter network.

3.2.  IPv4 VPNs over IPv6 backbone network

   SA46T can provide IPv4 VPN (Virtual Private Network) service for
   enterprise using IPv4 network plane id.  This mechanism also provide
   closed IPv4 service.

   Type of VPN like service describe below.

   o  IPv4 VPN service

   o  IPv4 based extranet

   o  Closed IPv4 service

   If allocated SA46T global address [I-D.draft-matsuhira-sa46t-gaddr],
   inter AS service would possible using SA46T global address.  These
   service may not recommended, however providing network service for
   IPv4 service may be useful for service provider who does not have
   enough readyness for IPv6 version.  This mean SA46T may provide
   smooth service transition network infrastructure from IPv4 to IPv6.

3.3.  IPv4 address sharing / reuse over IPv6 backbone network

   After IPv4 address running out, some provider may still want IPv4
   address.  Using SA46T's IPv4 network plane ID, private address can
   reuse in different IPv4 network plane which provided SA46T. This
   case, IPv4 network plane may connect with the Internet via NAT
   (Network address translator).  Figure 4 shows such example.  In this
   case, communication between hosts in the same IPv4 network plane can
   be done in IP layer directly.

3.4.  IPv4 address separation in Data Center

   In data center, there are many servers which owned corporate, and
   accessed from corporate network.  These server may have private
   address which managed owner corporate.  Viewing from data center,
   there should be servers which static allocated same IPv4 private
   address, so data center network should separate IP address space.
   There are several separation method, one is physically separated (
   not connected each other), other is using IEEE802.1Q VLAN
   technologies, other is using MPLS VPN technologies.  SA46T also
   provide such separation using IPv4 network plane ID.

   With IEEE802.1Q VLAN, up to 4095 separation possible, that mean, up
   to 4095 company's server could be hosting.  SA46T provide over 4096
   separation and up to 4.3 billion possible with 32bits IPv4 network
   plane id, that mean there are no limmit for such separation.
