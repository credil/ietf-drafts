                     draft-sakura-6rd-datacenter-00

Abstract

   IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) as defined in RFC 5969 focuses on rapid
   deployment of IPv6 by an access service provider which has difficulty
   deploying native IPv6.  This document describes how 6rd can be used

Internet-Draft                6rd in an LDC                    July 2011


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) as defined in RFC 5969 focuses on rapid
   deployment of IPv6 by an access service provider which has difficulty
   deploying native IPv6.  This document describes how one service
   provider in Japan, Sakura Interent, Inc., not for a large residential
   deployment, but for a large data center network.  While the protocol
   mechanism of 6rd is unchanged, the deployment model varies a bit from
   the classical "residential home access provider" model.  The
   motivation for using 6rd is very similar to that of the residential
   case where the service provider would like to offer IPv6 quickly to
   those users who want it, but without replacing equipment that
   currently does not support IPv6.  This document is provided as
   information to the Internet community.


2.  Network Architecture

   The case study presented here is based on the services provide by
   Sakura Internet Inc. Sakura Internet provides Internet services
   through Internet backbones and large data centers.  Sakura offers
   four types of services:

   1.  Housing Service, which provides Collocation and Internet Access
   on 5 urban datacenters (4 in Tokyo,1 in Osaka)

   2.  Hosting Service, which provides shared service on the servers.

   3.  Dedicated Server Service, which provides customer dedicated
   server with variable OSs.

   4.  Virtual Private Server Service (VPS), which provides guest
   operating system on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

   At the time of this writing, Sakura serves more than 200 Gpbs of
   traffic on its backbones, and around 50,000 dedicated servers,
   Virtual Private Servers, and collocated servers.

   Figure.1 describes server-based 6rd in datacenter's network
   architecture.

   Sakura has deployed commercial 6rd Border Relays, and relies on CE
   functionality in gateway routers or directly within the operating
   system of the servers.  In the latter model, there is no need for a
   CE gateway as the 6rd function is implemented directly in the server
   operating system itself.

   -For Housing users, there are two options.  Either the 6rd CE
   function is performed on the Gateway router itself, or the servers
   themselves can run 6rd directly.

   -For Hosting users, IPv6 service can start by deploying 6rd CE
   function on the server OS or guest OS on the KVM.

   Server administrators can start IPv6 service on demand themselves by
   using server-based 6rd.

   There were some issues when Sakura considers IPv6 deployment on their
   backbone.

   1.Some backbone switches are too old.

   IPv6 Switching would be software switching even if IPv4 Switching in
   hardware.It needs replacement.

   2.Some backbone switches required software upgrade.

   IPv6 supports on hardware.But software upgraded is needed.In
   datacenter,there is different requirement on each server,even if the
   server connected to the same switch.Because the server administrator
   are completely different.Each server is providing different service
   to the different service.So backbones maintenance time negotiation to
   the customer is very difficult.

   To provide native IPv6 service to the existing customer,it needs
   cost,time and negotiation.

   This is the reason why Sakura decided to provide server-based 6rd to
   the existing customer.


3.  6rd Availability in Server Operating Systems

   In particular for the server-initiated case, Sakura relies on 6rd
   availability in Server operating systems.

   Linux kernel has started to support 6rd since 2.6.33.So if Linux
   based Operating Systems are using 2.6.33 and the later,it can
   provides server-based 6rd.

   FreeBSD and CentOS could not provide 6rd in default,but the patch
   exist.

4.  Deployment Consideration

4.1.  IPv4 compression address

   6rd protocol specification is defined on [RFC5969].Section 4 of
   [RFC5969] described o-bit which can compression 32 bit IPv4 address
   in the 6rd delegated prefix.Linux Kernel also supports this
   feature.So customer could get some IPv6 prefixes even if datacenter's
   prefix is /32.But [BSD patch] doesn't has the feature of aggregate
   IPv4 address,so datacenter provider has to prepare /32 IPv6 prefix at
   least in that case.

   In Sakura's case,6rd prefix address using /32,and no compression IPv4
   address.So delegated 6rd address is /64.It is enough address space
   for server-based 6rd.

4.2.  Configuration

   Section 7.1 of [RFC5969] describes 6rd CE automatically configuration
   method such as DHCP,TR-69 and so on.But server-based 6rd does not
   needs automatically configuration because the server usually
   configure IPv4 address statically.

4.3.  MTU consideration

   Section 9.1 of [RFC5969] describes about Maximum Transmission
   Unit(MTU) on 6rd tunnel.This guide also applicable for server-based
   6rd.But datacenter's IPv4 network is well-managed and is known by the
   server administrator.So 6rd CE's tunnel MTU could set be -20 byte
   from IPv4 MTU.If the 6rd CE would be TCP server such as WWW,TCP
   MSS(Maximum Segment Size) automatically would be calculated from
   tunnel MTU.
