                 RADIUS Extensions for Dual-Stack Lite
                draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-radius-ext-01

Abstract

   Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
   connectivity to customers which are addressed only with an IPv6
   prefix.  DS-Lite requires to pre-configure the AFTR tunnel
   information on the B4 element.  In many networks, the customer
   profile information may be stored in AAA servers while client
   configurations are mainly provided through DHC protocol.  This
   document specifies one new RADIUS attribute to carry Dual-Stack Lite
   Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) name; the RADIUS attribute is
   defined based on the equivalent DHCPv6 option already specified in
   draft-ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option.  This RADIUS attribute is
   meant to be used between the RADIUS Server and the NAS, it is not
   intended to be used directly between the B4 element and the RADIUS
   Server.

Internet-Draft          DS-Lite RADIUS Extensions          December 2010


1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is a solution to
   offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which are
   addressed only with an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to
   the attachment device).  One of its key components is an IPv4-over-
   IPv6 tunnel, but a DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) will not
   know if the network it is attached to offers Dual-Stack Lite support,
   and if it did, would not know the remote end of the tunnel to
   establish a connection.

   To inform the B4 of the AFTR's location, a Fully Qualified Domain
   Name (FQDN) may be used.  Once this information is conveyed, the
   presence of the configuration indicating the AFTR's location also
   informs a host to initiate Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) service and
   become a Softwire Initiator.

   The draft draft-ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option] specifies a DHCPv6 option
   which is meant to be used by a Dual-Stack Lite client (Basic Bridging
   BroadBand element, B4) to discover its Address Family Transition
   Router (AFTR) name.  In order to be able to populate such option the
   DHCPv6 Server must be pre-provisioned with the Address Family
   Transition Router (AFTR) name.

   In Broadband environments, customer profile may be managed by AAA
   servers, together with user Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA).  RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] is usually used by AAA
   Servers to communicate with network elements.
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] describes a typical broadband network
   scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts as the access
   gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a DHCPv6
   Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6 requests
   issued by the clients.

   Since the DS-Lite AFTR information can be stored in AAA servers and
   the client configuration is mainly provided through DHC protocol
   running between the NAS and the requesting clients, a new RADIUS
   attribute is needed to send AFTR information from AAA server to the
   NAS.

   This document aims at defining a new RADIUS attribute to be used for
   carrying the DS-Lite Tunnel Name, based on the equivalent DHCPv6
   option already specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option]

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) and the DS-
   Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR) are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]


3.  DS-Lite Configuration with RADIUS and DHCPv6

   The Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work
   together to accomplish DS-Lite configuration on the B4 element when a
   PPP Session is used to provide connectivity to the user.

   The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and as
   DHCP Server for DHC protocol.  The NAS initially sends a RADIUS
   Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting
   authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives the request, it
   validates the sending client and if the request is approved, the AAA
   server replies with an Access Accept message including a list of
   attribute-value pairs that describe the parameters to be used for
   this session.  This list may also contain the AFTR Tunnel Name.  When
   the NAS receives a DHCPv6 client request containing the DS-Lite
   tunnel Option, the NAS shall use the address returned in the RADIUS
   DS-Lite-Tunnel-Addr attribute to populate the DHCPv6
   OPTION_DS_LITE_ADDR option in the DHCPv6 reply message.

        Figure 1: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for a PPP Session

   The Figure 2 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work
   together to accomplish DS-Lite configuration on the B4 element when
   an IP Session is used to provide connectivity to the user.

   The only difference between this message flow and previous one is
   that in this scenario the interaction between NAS and AAA/ RADIUS
   Server is triggered by the DHCPv6 Solicit message received by the NAS
   from the B4 acting as DHCPv6 client, while in case of a PPP Session
   the trigger is the PPP LCP Config Request message received by the
   NAS.

4.  RADIUS Attribute

   This section specifies the format of the new RADIUS attribute.

4.1.   DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name

   Description

   The DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute contains a Fully Qualified
   Domain Name that refers to the AFTR the client is requested to
   establish a connection with.  The NAS shall use the name returned in
   the RADIUS DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute to populate the DHCPv6
   OPTION_DS_LITE_NAME option [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option]

   This attribute MAY be used in Access-Accept packets and it MAY be
   present in Accounting-Request records where the Acct-Status-Type is
   set to Start, Stop or Interim-Update.  The DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS
   attribute and MUST NOT appear more than once in a message.

   A summary of the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.
