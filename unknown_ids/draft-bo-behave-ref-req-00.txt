Internet-Draft            Referral Requirements             October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Mobile operators are using referrals in their network to make
   entities reachable straightforward.  However, this simple approach is
   failed by deployment of firewall and translator (like NAT) in the
   network, in which causes the translation function happened during the
   communication.  This document is intended to discuss about the
   requirements that need to be met by the potential referral
   modifications in the mobile network.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Requirements of referral design

2.1.  R1 Standard referral format

   The referral format need to be standardised.  All kinds of
   applications can understand the meaning of referral informed.

2.2.  R2 Guarantee of NAT traversal

   The referral (entity A) need to inform entity B how to reach entity C
   with NAT traversal, if there is a NAT between B and C. This can
   reduce the cost of NAT ALG.
