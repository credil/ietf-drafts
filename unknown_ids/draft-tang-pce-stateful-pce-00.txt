Abstract

   A PCE can be either stateful or stateless.  The information carried
   in stateful PCE are more detailed than that of stateless PCE.  With
   the state capability of PCEs, the PCCs may make advanced and informed
   choices about the PCEs to use.  This draft focus on stateful PCE,
   describes the applicability of stateful PCE and gives the IGP and
   PCEP extensions to support stateful PCE.

Internet-Draft                Statefull PCE                     Oct 2010


1.  Introduction

   As defined in [RFC4655], a PCE can be either stateful or stateless.
   For stateful PCE, there is a strict synchronization between the PCE
   and not only the network states (in term of topology and resource
   information), but also the set of computed paths and reserved
   resources in use in the network.  Since stateful PCE has more network
   information, it can be used to do some complicated work, such as
   loops and resource scrap.

   However, the exsisting PCE discovery ([RFC5088], [RFC5089]) and PCEP
   don't support stateful PCE.  So, this document focus on stateful PCE,
   describes the applicability of stateful PCE and gives the IGP and
   PCEP extensions to support stateful PCE.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   o  PCC: Path Computation Client.  A client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by the Path Computation Element.

   o  PCE: Path Computation Element.  An entity that is capable of
      computing a network path or route based on a network graph, and of
      applying computational constraints during the computation.

   o  PCED: PCE Discovery.

   o  PCEP: Path Computation Element communication Protocol.

   o  TED: Traffic Engineering Database, which contains the topology and
      resource information of the domain.  The TED may be fed by
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) extensions or potentially by other
      means.


3.  Requirement

   This section lists the tipcal use case of statefull PCE.  As
   described in [RFC4655], stateful PCE not only use information from
   TED, but also information about existing paths (for example, TE LSPs)
   in the network when processing new requests, so the information
   carried in stateful PCE are more detailed than that of stateless

   PCE.Knowing the state capability of PCEs, the PCC may make advanced
   and informed choices about which PCE to use.

   Another scenario for using the state of PCEs is that the PCC send the
   path state (created or deleted) to stateful PCE.  Having no knowledge
   of the state of PCEs, the PCC have no idea of which PCE to send the
   path state.  In this situation, there are two possibilities for the
   PCC: send the path state to all the PCEs whatever the state of them,
   or not send to any of the PCE, and every stateful PCE query the path
   state information when needed.  In the former case, there would be
   lots of unnecessary operation; and in the second case, it would
   increasing the complexity of the realization of the control plane and
   PCEs .  Knowing the state of PCEs, the PCC only send the path state
   information to stateful PCEs.

   [RFC5088] defines extensions to OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340]
   to allow a PCE in an OSPF routing domain to advertise some
   information useful to a PCC for PCE selection.  It defines a new TLV
   (named the PCE Discovery TLV (PCED TLV)) to be carried within the
   OSPF Router Information LSA ([RFC4970]).  The type 5 sub-TLV of PCED
   TLV, which named CE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV, used to indicate PCE
   capabilities.  It contains eight capabilities, but not includes the
   state capability of a PCE.  So the PCE in an OSPF routing domain
   cannot advertise its state capability information to a PCC for PCE
   selection.


4.  PCE Discovery and PCEP Extensions

4.1.  Statefull PCE Capability Flag

   To support statefull PCE, PCC SHOULD know a PCE is statefull or not.
   Therefore, the PCE discovery message SHOULD indicates whether the PCE
   advertises this message is a statefull PCE.  Since PCE-CAP-FLAGS Sub-
   TLV ([RFC5088] for OSPF, [RFC5089] for IS-IS) contains PCE Capability
   Flags, so this document defines a new flag, Statefull PCE Capability
   Flag, as follows (need to be assigned by IANA):

     Bit        Capabilities

     9          Stateful PCE

4.2.  PCEP Extensions

   With respect to the definitation of stateful PCE ([RFC4655]), a
   stateful PCE utilizes information from the TED as well as information
   about existing paths (for example, TE LSPs) in the network when
   processing new requests.  So, a stateful PCE SHOULD know the status

   (created or deleted) of a path it computed.  Thus, the PCC SHOULD
   tell PCE the path status which can be done by PCNtf message which is
   detailed in this section.

   A new Notification-type and two Notification-value are defined as
   follows (need to be assigned by IANA):

   o  Notification-type=3: LSP path Status

      *  Notification-value=1: LSP path is created.  When a LSP path is
         created, the PCC SHOULD send a notification message with
         Notification-type=3 and Notification-value=1 to PCE which
         computed out the path.

      *  Notification-value=1: LSP path is deleted.  When a LSP path is
         deleted, the PCC SHOULD send a notification message with
         Notification-type=3 and Notification-value=2 to PCE which
         computed out the path.

   Furthermore, the LSP path information SHOULD be contained in PCNtf
   message so that a PCE can identify which path status changes.  For
   the exsisting ERO object has expressed the path information well, so,
   it's subobjects ([RFC3209]) can be used in Optional TLVs of
   NOTIFICATION object.  (NOTE: This extension needs to be disscussed.)


5.  Security Considerations

   The extensions of this draft is baed on PCEP and OSPF, only some
   optional protocol elements are added which will not change the
   security of existing network.


6.  IANA Consideration

   TBD.
