Internet-Draft  Guidelines for Free Standards in the IETF   October 2007


1.  Introduction, or, What Is a Free Standard?

   A natural first question is "What is a free standard?".
   Unfortunately, we are not aware of any precise academic definition of
   a free standard.  Basic criteras for free standards may include that
   the standard is available free of charge to anyone, or that it is
   possible to implement the standard by everyone.

   We will not develop a clear definition of "free standard".  Instead,
   we take a pragmatic and incremental approach.  We observe problems
   that implementers and distributors have had with existing standards
   related to freedom aspects.  We have drawn some conclusions from
   these observations, and we attempt to formulate these as guidelines,
   suitable for those who share these concerns.

   There are two main problems when implementing standards: copyright
   licenses and patents.

   Other areas, such as trademarks, are less problematic in practice.
   In particular, if the copyright license concern is resolved, any
   trademark concern can be solved by renaming the trademark word.  A
   good example of this is [ICEWEASEL].

   This topic is complex and rapidly evolving.  It is expected that this
   document will be revised when new IETF rules are approved, or when
   new concerns are brought up.


2.  Intended Audience

   This document was written for authors and readers of IETF documents
   who are concerned with freedom issues.  The document is written from
   the point of view that standards should be free to use and implement
   by everyone, which is a personal preference.

   If you are the author of an IETF document, this document will
   recommend certain copyright-related additions to your document and
   hints on how to write a patent disclosure.  This is intended to make
   it more likely that the document will be met positively by
   implementers, especially those in the free software community.  That
   often leads to faster and wider implementations of your technology.

   Readers of IETF documents need to be careful and aware of certain
   things (i.e., patents) that may affect the freedom of a document, and
   we give recommendations for what to look out for.

   In some working groups, there is resistance against adopting
   encumbered technology.  This document may be useful to serve as a

   check-list for reviewers, and can also provide background information
   for new members.


3.  Copyright Concerns

   It is widely regarded as a problem when standards are not available
   publicly, or when they do not allow public distribution.  A
   traditional example that has been regarded as a problem in the IETF
   community are ISO/ITU standards, which are available for a fee under
   the condition that you do not redistribute it.  A reasonable
   requirements on a free standard is that it is possible to distribute
   to everyone for free.

   Further rights may be needed to implement a standard.  Sometimes, a
   standard contains instructions intended for machines, for example
   ASN.1 schemas, MIB modules, data tables.  To include machine-readable
   parts of a standard into a free software implementation, which is a
   reasonable requirement on a free standard, the license has to permit
   modification of said part and be compatible with typical free
   software licenses.

   If a goal with the standard is to facilitate the fastest spread and
   adoption of the standard, further rights to the document will help
   further that goal.  For example, when text in the standard is used as
   starting point for documentation or educational material about the
   technology.  A reasonable requirement here would then be that the
   entire document is available under a license compatible with typical
   free documentation and software licenses.

   The IETF rules (see [RFC3978]) related to the copying license on the
   standards have a few problems.  Some problems, such as the inability
   to redistribute RFCs by third parties, have been acknowledged and
   solutions are being worked on.

   A basic problem is that IETF standard documents are not licensed in a
   way that make it possible to re-use the text of the standard in
   implementations (code or manuals).

   For example, the Debian GNU/Linux distribution have rules that
   requires included material to be available under a license that
   permits modification and redistribution.  IETF Standards documents
   fail this test, and consequently they are not distributed with
   Debian.

   A serious problem is when standards contains code-like portions that
   are required to be included in conforming implementations.  Examples
   include ASN.1 schemas and data tables.  Revising the IETF rules to

Internet-Draft  Guidelines for Free Standards in the IETF   October 2007


   make this possible is underway in the IPR WG, although we have yet to
   see the license text that will be used.

   To adress these problems, we suggest that authors place the following
   copying license in their documents.  This license has been found
   compatible with free software licenses, and acceptable to some RFC
   authors ([RFC3492], [RFC4398], [RFC4737]).


         Regarding this entire document or any portion of it (including
         the pseudocode and C code), the author makes no guarantees and
         is not responsible for any damage resulting from its use.  The
         author grants irrevocable permission to anyone to use, modify,
         and distribute it in any way that does not diminish the rights
         of anyone else to use, modify, and distribute it, provided that
         redistributed derivative works do not contain misleading author
         or version information.  Derivative works need not be licensed
         under similar terms.


4.  Patent Concerns

   A reasonable requirement on a free standard is that everyone is free
   to implement it.  Patents may be used to restrict that right, and
   there are many examples where patented technology cannot be
   implemented widely.

   The IETF rules (see [RFC3979]) demands that contributors notify the
   IETF when they submit, or even discuss, documents with patented
   technology (as far as the authors are aware of).  Third parties are
   also encouraged to submit disclosures about patented technology in
   others' documents.  (To understand the full policies, which are not
   easy to explain in a few sentences, the reader is kindly referred to
   RFC 3979.)

   This process does not guarantee that all IETF documents will have no
   patent concerns.  That was not the intention, and there are several
   documents with a complicated patent situation.  One example is the
   standards-track use of the patented RSA public-key algorithm.
   Fortunately, the IETF process encourages and makes it easy to verify
   whether there are known patents for a particular document.

   If a documented is known to be patented, that may complicate the use
   of the document in free software environments, but it depends on the
   conditions placed by the patent owner.

   The first conclusion here is that readers will have to search the
   online "IETF IPR Disclosure" page at <http://www.ietf.org/ipr/> for

   the document they are interested in.

4.1.  What To Look For In A Patent Disclosure

   An alternative title for this section may be 'How To Write A Free-
   Software Friendly Patent Disclosure'.

   Words to look for in a patent license is free-of-charge, world-wide,
   royaltee-free, perpetual and non-exclusive right to the patent.

   Some patent disclosures demands that you to write to the patent owner
   and request a license.  Such a clause leads to problems if a company
   goes away or won't respond to requests.  Depending on the text used,
   it may even require that every user of the software is required to
   apply for a license.  That is not feasible for free software, which
   is widely distributed to everyone.  The recommendation here is that
   the license should grant rights directly to third parties.

   Some patent licenses restricts how you can use the technology.  This
   causes an incompatibility with many free software licenses, which
   says that no additional restrictions may be placed on the
   redistribution of the software.  Further, free software is intended
   to be generally useful.  If one field-of-use is restricted, that goes
   against the spirit of free software.  The recommendation here is that
   patent licenses should not impose any additional restrictions before
   granting the rights.

   A clause in the patent license that licensee's license to the patent
   is revoked when the licensee sue the patent holder for patent
   infringement does not limit the ability to implement a standard.
   Such clauses have been successfully used to protect the patent owner.

4.2.  Handling Submarine Patents

   In some cases, patent disclosures are filed late in the process.  It
   may after a WG has accepted a document, after it has been last-
   called, after it has been approved by the IESG, or even after it has
   been published as an RFC.  We call such late notification of earlier
   patents as a submarine patent.

   If the document has already been approved as an RFC, the published
   document itself cannot be modified.  However, the documents' status
   on the standards track can be modified by publishing an approved
   document containing the reasons for doing so.  If the patent
   disclosure is not considered to grant sufficient rights to third
   parties, it is recommended to consider alternative technologies and
   to write a document moving the RFC with patented technology off the
   standards track.

Internet-Draft  Guidelines for Free Standards in the IETF   October 2007


   In the other situations, it is recommended that interested parties
   evaluate the patent disclosure and re-evaluate their earlier decision
   to accept, last-call or approve the document.

4.3.  Example License Text

   Here is a simplistic patent license that would grant third parties
   the necessary rights in order to use it in free software.


             X grants a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully-paid, perpetual,
             royaltee-free patent license to everyone for any purpose.

   [XXX: Most likely, this section will be heavily modified based on
   feedback.]

4.4.  Non-assertion Claims

   Some patent licenses are not really patent licenses at all, but
   promises not to assert the claims in the patent.  These promises, if
   they are kept, should be sufficient for free implementations of the
   standard.  However, there is a legal loop-hole that the patent owner
   may simply not chose keep the promise.  It can be unclear whether the
   original promise is legally binding.

   If the non-assertion claim is written in the form of a patent
   license, that would avoid the potential loop-hole.  It can add value
   if the claim states explicitly that it is perpetual and cannot be
   revoked.

   Naturally, you should confirm that whoever give this claims is
   entitled to speak on behalf of the patent owner.

   It is recommended to ask whoever gives non-assertion claims to
   rewrite them in the form of a patent license.  That would make it
   more clear that the statement is actually legally binding.


5.  Frequently Asked Questions

5.1.  Why Not Use A Well-Known Free Copyright License?

   This question is a common comment that is worth discussion.  It is
   widely accepted that it is preferable to use a widely accepted free
   license instead of crafting new text (see for example [WHEELER]).
   All of the widely used free software licenses that are based on
   copyright, and require that the copyright notice are preserved.  For
   example, the clause 1 of the BSD license [BSD] says:



Josefsson                Expires April 25, 2008                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Guidelines for Free Standards in the IETF   October 2007


       Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
       notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

   Further, clause 1 of the GNU General Public License [GPL] says:


     You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

   However, the IETF rules disallow such additional copyright notices in
   documents.  [RFC3978] section 5.4 says:


      Additional copyright notices are not permitted in IETF Documents
      except in the case where such document is the product of a joint
      development effort between the IETF and another standards
      development organization or the document is a republication of the
      work of another standards organization.  Such exceptions must be
      approved on an individual basis by the IAB.

   This rule has not been followed in practice, and makes it impossible
   to re-use widely approved licenses.  The IAB was contacted to grant
   an exception on one document [RFC4648] that contained code licensed
   under the GNU Lesser General Public License [LGPL], but turned down
   the request.  An attempt to resolve this by altering the IETF rules
   were initiated in draft-josefsson-ipr-notices-00
   [I-D.josefsson-ipr-notices] but have not gained any traction so far.

5.2.  Why Isn't It Sufficient To Use A Free License For Code

   It has been suggested that the copyright license could be separated
   to cover code and text separately.  The intention is supposedly that
   the IETF would use a free and GPL/BSD-compatible license for code,
   but not for the text portion.

   We argue that this solution is sub-optimal, and in particular it
   would prevent scenarios including the following:

   1.  Excerpts from RFCs included in source code comments.  This is a
       common example, many free IETF implementations embed excerpts
       from the RFC text in source code comments.

Internet-Draft  Guidelines for Free Standards in the IETF   October 2007


   2.  Teaching material derived from RFC texts.  University teacher may
       want to modify RFCs to illustrate a point and as an
       implementation exercises, and include the resulting work in
       freely available online course material.
   3.  Material used in manuals or online help ("man" pages) may include
       protocol overviews (such as in SASL) or API function
       documentation (such as in GSS-API).  For example, several
       vendors, including FreeBSD and Sun, have shipped a man page for
       getaddrinfo that is derived from RFC 2133.
   4.  Wider distribution of RFCs.  The Debian operating system have
       license guidelines regarding the content, and unless the entire
       text is licensed in a free fashion, a document cannot be included
       (even as documentation) in the distribution.
   5.  Development of protocol extensions.  When protocols evolve, that
       is sometimes done by creating a modified version of an existing
       implementation to experiment with how well the idea works.
       Having to send every version intended for re-distribution to the
       IETF slows down experiments.

   We recommend strongly to use the same license to both code and text.
