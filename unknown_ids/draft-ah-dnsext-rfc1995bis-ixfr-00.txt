             DNS Incremental Zone Transfer Protocol (IXFR)
                   draft-ah-dnsext-rfc1995bis-ixfr-00

Abstract

   The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol for
   maintaining coherence among a zone's authoritative name servers
   consists of three mechanisms.  Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) is
   one of the mechanisms and originally was defined in RFC 1995.

   This document aims to provide a more detailed and up-to-date
   specification of the IXFR mechanism and to align it with the current
   specification of the primary zone transfer mechanism, AXFR, given in
   RFC 5936.  Further, based on operational experience, this document
   juxtaposes to the original IXFR query a new query type, IXFR-ONLY,
   that will be preferred over IXFR in specific deployments.

   This document obsoletes and replaces RFC 1995.

Internet-Draft        DNS Incremental Zone Transfer         October 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   The Domain Name System standard facilities for maintaining coherent
   servers for a zone consist of three elements.  Authoritative Transfer
   (AXFR) originally was defined in STD 13: "Domain Names - Concepts and
   Facilities" [RFC1034] (referred to in this document as RFC 1034) and
   "Domain Names - Implementation and Specification" [RFC1035]
   (henceforth RFC 1035), and is now precisely specified in "DNS Zone
   Transfer Protocol (AXFR)" [RFC5936] (henceforth RFC 5936).
   Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) was originally defined in
   "Incremental Zone Transfer in DNS" [RFC1995].  A mechanism for prompt
   notification of zone changes (NOTIFY) is defined in "A Mechanism for
   Prompt Notification of Zone Changes (DNS NOTIFY)" [RFC1996].  The
   goal of these mechanisms is to enable a set of DNS name servers to
   remain coherently authoritative for a given zone.

   For large domains that incur frequent changes that need to be
   available quickly to prospective DNS clients, AXFR has proven less
   suitable because it always transfers the whole zone content.  The
   latency incurred in the propagation of changes to the DNS database
   ([RFC1034], [RFC1035]) can be substantially reduced by actively
   notifying secondary servers of the availability of a new version of
   the authoritative zone data at the primary server for a zone; this is
   accomplished by the DNS NOTIFY mechanism [RFC1996].  The time and
   resources needed to accomplish the transfer of the new zone content
   to the secondary servers in many cases can be reduced substantially
   by only carrying forward the changes from a previous version of the
   zone data.  This is accomplished by the IXFR mechanism originally
   specified in RFC 1996 [RFC1996] and, more precisely, below.

   The original IXFR automatically falls back to AXFR behavior whenever
   the IXFR server cannot fulfill the given delta-update request.  In
   some deployments, in particular where multiple IXFR servers are
   available to the IXFR client, this can lead to premature fallback to
   AXFR, which incurs the additional overhead that the client wants to
   avoid whenever possible.  This gap is closed by a variant of the IXFR
   mechanism, dubbed "IXFR-ONLY", which originally has been proposed in
   "IXFR-ONLY to Prevent IXFR Fallback to AXFR" [I-D.kerr-ixfr-only] and
   which is fully specified below as well.

   Thus, this document re-specifies the IXFR mechanism as it is deployed
   in the Internet at large, giving more details than in the original
   specification, and using RFC 5936 as its foundation.  Additionally,
   it newly specifies a versatile variant of IXFR, IXFR-ONLY.

   This document is organized as follows: After presenting the

   terminology used and elaborations on the scope of this protocol and
   its specification in the next subsections, Section 2 gives an
   overview on the principles of operation of the IXFR protocol.
   Section 3 normatively specifies the IXFR query and response message
   format and the basic rules governing their generation and processing.
   Subsequent sections detail mandatory and optional server behavior,
   and supply management, security, and IANA considerations.

1.2.  Definition of Terms and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" BCP 14 [RFC2119].

   The terms "AXFR server", "AXFR client", "AXFRE session", "General-
   purpose DNS implementation" and "Turnkey DNS implementation" are used
   as defined in Section 1.1 of RFC 5936 [RFC5936]

   The bare term "IXFR" is intended to refer to the generic case of an
   IXFR or IXFR-ONLY query/response, unless it is clear from the context
   that the original IXFR is dealt with specifically.

   An "IXFR client" is a (secondary) name server for a given DNS zone
   that, based on a trigger event, e.g. a DNS NOTIFY message, issues an
   IXFR query to a "superordinate" authoritative server (e.g. the
   primary server of the zone) and receives the IXFR response from it.

   An "IXFR server" is an authoritative server that is presumed to
   become aware of changes to a zone earlier than other authoritiative
   servers, e.g. the primary server for a zone as specified in STD 13 or
   a secondary server that already has synchronized with the primary
   server, and which is configured to respond to IXFR queries.

   The interaction and protocol exchange(s) performed by an IXFR client
   and an IXFR server to issue an IXFR query and accomplish its
   processing are collectively denoted as an "IXFR session".

1.3.  Scope

   In general terms, authoritative name servers for a given zone can use
   various means to achieve coherency of the zone contents they serve.
   For example, there are DNS implementations that assemble answers from
   data stored in relational databases (as opposed to master files),
   relying on the database's non-DNS means to synchronize the database
   instances.  Some of these non-DNS solutions interoperate in some
   fashion.  However, AXFR, IXFR, and NOTIFY are the only protocol-
   defined in-band mechanisms to provide coherence of a set of name



Hoenes & Sury            Expires April 22, 2011                 [Page 5]

   servers, and they are the only mechanisms specified by the IETF.

   This document does not cover incoherent DNS situations.  There are
   applications of the DNS in which servers for a zone are designed to
   be incoherent.  For these configurations, a coherency mechanism as
   described here would be unsuitable.

   IXFR is an optional protocol component for authoritiative DNS
   servers; it is not needed on DNS resolver software that does not
   support the functions of an authoritative NS server.  Thus, all usage
   of normative [RFC2119] language is applicable only to DNS server
   implementations that claim support of this specification.

   Whereas the original IXFR already is widely implemented, IXFR-ONLY
   offers an operational choice for administrators of zones with a non-
   trivial propagation graph for the authoritative zone data, who are
   looking for more options to fine-tune the synchronization efficiency
   of their authoritative servers.  It could be implemented without bare
   IXFR, but for the sake of backwards compatibility and flexibility,
   and for simplicity in documentation, we strongly recommend that IXFR-
   ONLY be always implemented in concert with bare IXFR.

2.  Principles of IXFR Protocol Operation

   Each version of the authoritative date of a DNS zone is edentified by
   the SOA serial number (cf. Section 3.3.13 of [RFC1035]); succesive
   versions are tagged with monotonically increasing serial numbers.
   Below, serial numbers are symbolically referred to by "sn" with some
   distinguishing postfix.

   When an IXFR client currently serving sn_o of a particular zone
   receives a trigger that it should incrementally update the zone data,
   it sends one of the flavors of an IXFR request to an IXFR server,
   with the expectation to obtain in the IXFR repsonse the change
   information necessary to transform the sn1 zone data into the zone
   data of the current zone version, say, sn_n.

   The details of which triggers can and will start such IXFR session
   are implementation dependent.  Possible triggers are some time
   schedule or a management request, but most likely the IXFR query will
   be triggered by a DNS NOTIFY message received by an authoritative
   server of higher precedence in the propagation graph for the zone.

   Possible IXFR servers are usually configured (per zone) on an IXFR
   client, amended with some indication of precedence.  Similarly, IXFR
   servers are configured (per zone) with the identities of the
   secondary servers they should accept as IXFR clients.  This way, some
   authoritative servers for a given zone may act both as an IXFR client



Hoenes & Sury            Expires April 22, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        DNS Incremental Zone Transfer         October 2010


   and an IXFR server.  Among all authoritative servers for a zone, at
   least one server (the primary server of the zone) is not acting as an
   IXFR client.  This way, the {IXFR server, IXFR client} pairs form a
   binary relation on the set of these servers that defines a directed
   graph rooted at the primary server(s); this is the IXFR propagation
   graph for the zone.

      Note that, for the purpose of IXFR, it is possible that more than
      one server can be acting as a primary server; this requires that
      zone synchronization between these servers is accomplished by
      other meachanisms, e.g., AXFR, or non-DNS means like distributed
      database technology.

   The most simple propagation graph is a star (hub and spokes)
   configuration, with the primary server as the central hub.  For
   redundancy, important zones with many authoritative servers are
   likely to be configured with a more dense propagation graph that
   gives each IXFR client a choice of multiple IXFR servers to contact,
   for the sake of resilience and/or load sharing.  All these
   configuration details are a strictly local matter and do not affect
   interoperability.  The only property of the propagation graph that
   needs to be ensured by the zone administration is that each secondary
   (i.e. non-primary) server must be reachable by at least one path in
   this graph that originates in a primary server.

   In order to be able to act as a useful IXFR server, a DNS server
   needs to keep track of the zone history, to a certain extent (as
   directed by local policy, as well).  To this end, the server must
   maintain knowledge of the changes that have been applied successively
   to the zone content from one SOA serial up to the current version.
   This does not necessarily mean that each change needs to be recorded,
   however; if some parts of the zone content change frequently, it
   might be preferable to coalesce subsequent chunks of change
   information -- both for local storage and/or for transmission --, for
   instance instead of the change information from sn_1 to sn_2 and the
   change information from sn_2 to sn_3 (where sn_1 < sn_2 < sn_3), the
   change information from sn_1 to sn_3 can be provided.  This
   condensation of data has some downsides, however: if an IXFR client
   serves sn_2 and asks an IXFR server for the delta information to the
   current version of the zone, but the server has performed the above
   condensation, it has no way to tell the necessary information to the
   IXFR client, and the IXFR request necessarily is doomed to fail.
   Therefore, is becomes apparent that an IXFR server must maintain
   seemless chains of change information chunks from all past SOA serial
   number values it wants/needs to support (because potential IXFR
   clients currently serve these zone versions) to the current zone
   version.  See Section XXX for more details on Condensation.

   Upon receipt of any IXFR query, the IXFR server conceptionally
   constructs a chain of change information chunks from the SOA serial
   number indicated by the client (sn_o) to the current zone version
   (sn_n).

   If this is not possible, in the case of bare IXRF, the server falls
   back to AXFR, i.e. it provides the full zone content.  In the case of
   an IXFR-ONLY query, however, an error response is returned
   immediately to the IXFR client, thus giving it a chance to try with
   another IXFR server that might (still) serve the client's sn_o
   without immediately incurring the potential overhead of a full zone
   transfer.

   In case it turns out that the IXFR client already has the current
   zone version (sn_o = sn_n), the IXFR server does not reply with an
   empty chain of chunks, but with the (current) SOA record of the zone.

   If the IXFR server determines that it would be inefficient to
   transfer the series of chunks, it also may fall back to full zone
   transfer.  Note that this is recommended behavior for the IXFR
   server, but the correct protocol operation does not depend on this
   (useful) optimization.

   Ordinarily, in the generic case, the IXFR server transmits the change
   information chunks in their "natural" order (by ascending sn) to the
   IXFR client.

   Each such change information chunk -- say from sn_a to sn_b -- is
   represented by a sequences of RR deletions and a sequence of
   subsequent RR additions, all of which need to be applied in order to
   transform the zone content at sn_a to the zone content at sn_b.  For
   transfer in the IXFR response, each sequence starts with the
   corresponding SOA RR as its delimiter, and the other RRs within it
   can be given in arbitrary order.

   The whole chain of change information chunks is embedded in a pair of
   two copies of the new SOA RR (at sn_n).

   For example, if the IXFR server wants to transmit the changes from
   sn_o to sn_n in three chunks, based on two intermediary zone versions
   at sn_1 and sn_2 (where sn_o < sn_1 < sn_2 < sn_n), i.e., the chunk
   with the change information from sn_o to sn_1, the chunk from sn_1 to
   sn_2, and the chunk from sn_2 to sn_n, it would deliver in the IXFR
   response packet(s) the following resource records (RRs), in order:

      *  SOA for sn_o # outer bracket
      *  SOA for sn_o # start of first chunk
      *  {other RRs to be deleted from the zone at sn_o}
      *  SOA for sn_1
      *  {other RRs to be added for getting the zone at sn_1}
      *  SOA for sn_1 # start of second chunk
      *  {other RRs to be deleted from the zone at sn_1}
      *  SOA for sn_2
      *  {other RRs to be added for getting the zone at sn_2}
      *  SOA for sn_2 # start of third chunk
      *  {other RRs to be deleted from the zone at sn_2}
      *  SOA for sn_n
      *  {other RRs to be added for getting the zone at sn_n}
      *  SOA for sn_n # outer bracket

   In contrast, in the case of fallback to AXFR, the IXFR response would
   convey, in order:

      *  SOA for sn_n # first instance
      *  {DNSSEC signature RRs for the SOA, if any}
      *  {other RRsets of the zone at sn_n, in arbitrary order}
      *  SOA for sn_n # repeated as trailing delimiter

3.  IXFR Messages

   This section specifies the format of IXFR messages and the basic
   message generation and processing rules.

   An IXFR session is started with an IXFR query message sent from an
   IXFR client to an IXFR server, which solicits one of more response
   messages in return.

   All these messages adhere to the basic DNS message format specified
   in RFC 1035 [RFC1035] and later amended in various ways, for which
   Section 2 of RFC 5936 gives an expanded bibliography.  Implementers
   should be aware of the considerations in "Measures for Making DNS
   More Resilient against Forged Answers" [RFC5452] and follow the
   recommendations given there.

   For convenience of the reader, the synopsis of the DNS message header
   from RFC 5395 [RFC5395] (and the IANA registry for DNS Parameters
   [DNSVALS]) is reproduced here informally:

   capitalized in this document for clarity, e.g., "Additional section".

   An IXFR session can be carried out over UDP (with tight restrictions
   -- see below) and over TCP.  Thus, the DNS message size limit from
   RFC 1035 for DNS over UDP (and its extension specified in RFC 2671,
   "Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)" [RFC2671]) apply in the former
   case.  BCP 145, "Unicast UDP Usage Guidelines for Application
   Designers" [RFC5405] contains valuable considerations regarding IP
   level fragmentation of UDP messages, and "Security Assessment of the
   Internet Protocol version 4" [I-D.ietf-opsec-ip-security] contains a
   detailed security assessment of IPv4 segmentation and reassembly;
   both documents should be considered by implementers when deciding on
   the maximum size of DNS repsonse messages over UPD supported by an
   IXFR server implementation.  The upper limit on the permissible size
   of a DNS message over TCP is only restricted by the TCP framing
   defined in Section 4.2.2 of RFC 1035, which specifies a two-octet
   message length field, understood to be unsigned, and thus causing a
   limit of 65535 octets.  This limit is not changed by EDNS0, and it
   applies to IXFR over TCP.

      Note that unlike with all common DNS responses, but like AXFR, the
      IXFR protocol makes no use of the TC (truncation) bit.  To signal
      that an IXFR session needs to be retried over TCP, an IXFR server
      sends a response that only contains its current version of the SOA
      RR for the zone.

3.1.  IXFR Query

   An IXFR query is sent by a client whenever it wants to obtain the
   delta information needed to update the content of a zone it is aware
   of (as identified by its SOA serial number) to the most recent

   version.  The predominant trigger for this is the receipt of a DNS
   NOTIFY message [RFC1996], but it also can be triggered by other
   mechanisms or events, for instance as a result of a command line
   request, say for debugging.  The details for these triggers are
   implemenation dependent and out of scope for this specification.

3.1.1.  Header Values

   The specification for AXFR in Section 2.1.1 of RFC 5936 applies
   likewise for IXFR queries, with a single exception:

      NSCOUNT     Number of entries in Authority section;  MUST be 1

3.1.2.  Question Section

   The Question section of an IXFR query MUST conform to Section 4.1.2
   of RFC 1035, and it MUST contain (matching QDCOUNT=1 in the DNS
   message header) a single resource record with the following values:

      QNAME       the name of the zone requested

      QTYPE       one of the pseudo-RR types for incremental zone
                  transfer: IXFR (= 251) or IXFR-ONLY (= {IANA-TBD1})
                  [DNSVALS]

      QCLASS      the class of the zone requested [DNSVALS]

   The choice of QTYPE depends on the intended IXFR server behavior in
   case the request cannot be fulfilled due to lack of stored
   information on the server, as detailed below in Section 3.2.

3.1.3.  Answer Section

   The Answer section MUST be empty, as indicated by ANCOUNT=0 in the
   DNS message header.

3.1.4.  Authority Section

   Corresponding to NSCOUNT=1 in the DNS message header, the Authority
   section MUST contain a single DNS resource record, the SOA record of
   the client's version of the zone content, identified by its serial
   number (denoted as sn_o in this document).

3.1.5.  Additional Section

   Currently, two kinds of resource records are defined that can appear
   in the Additional section of IXFR queries and responses: EDNS and DNS
   transaction security.  Future specifications defining RRs that can be

   carried in the Additional section of normal DNS transactions need to
   explicitly describe their use with IXFR, should that be desired.

   All considerations from Section 2.1.5 of RFC 5936 apply in the same
   manner for IXFR as they do for AXFR.

   [[ Do we need to make EDNS support a MUST for IXFR-ONLY (over UDP),
   in order to allow IANA to assign an extended RCODE for CannotIXFR ?
   ]]

3.2.  IXFR Response

   An IXFR server that has received an IXFR query responds to it with an
   IXFR response addressed to the transport source identifier from which
   the query has been received, in particular using the same transport
   protocol.

   An IXFR response consists of one or more response messages.  If the
   IXFR query has been received over a connectionless transport
   (currently: UDP), the IXFR response MUST consist of a single message.
   If it is not possible to send the complete response in a single DNS
   message, a response only containing the currrent SOA RR at the server
   is sent, whose serial sn_n being different from sn_o is the signal to
   the IXFR client to retry over connection oriented transport
   (currently: TCP).

   If the server detects an error condition that makes it impossible to
   fulfill the request, it immediately sends an error response.  In case
   of connetionless transport (UDP), this is the single response message
   sent.  In case of connection-oriented transport, the error condition
   might occur after one of more response messages already have been
   sent; in this case the error message is sent as soon as need arises,
   and it will abort the ongoing IXFR session; i.e., the error message
   is the last response message sent by the server.  The special case of
   a server closing the TCP connection without sending an IXFR response
   message is covered in Section 2.3.

   If an IXFR server is not able or willing to send the incremental zone
   change information to change the client's version (sn_o) to its
   version (sn_n), the server SHOULD, in the case of QTYPE=IXFR, fall
   back to AXFR (see below); however, it MAY, and in the case of
   QTYPE=IXFR-ONLY, it MUST respond with an appropriate error, e.g.
   CannotIXFR (see below) in the case of QTYPE=IXFR-ONLY.

   Any non-error IXFR response starts with the server's version of the
   SOA resource record.
   If the server detects that the client's version is current (sn_n =
   sn_o), or if the server detects that the entire response to an IXFR

   query received over connectionless transport (UDP) cannot be placed
   into a single response message, this SOA record is the only answer
   sent to the client.  Otherwise, the subsequent answer RRs sent form a
   sequence of one or more change information chunks as described below
   in Section 3.3, and the final RR sent is another copy of the current
   SOA RR.
   In case of fallback to AXFR, the answer contains the same RRs (and is
   subject to the same ordering rules) as specified in Sections 2.2
   through 3 of RFC 5936, with the single difference being the echoed
   QCODE (i.e., IXFR) in the Question section.

   [[ Move part of the above material to Section 4 ?? ]]

3.2.1.  Header Values

   The specification for AXFR in Section 2.2.1 of RFC 5936 applies
   likewise for IXFR queries, where in the case of IXFR the "new"
   behavior from RFC 5936 is always followed, i.e. the query ID from the
   IXFR query is to be echoed in all IXFR response messages.

   The only additonal rule to be followed applies to the deliberations
   on the RCODE field in Note e) of Section 2.2.1 in RFC 5936: If the
   IXFR server is not able to fulfill an IXFR-ONLY request, is SHOULD
   respond with the (extended?)  RCODE CannotIXFR (see Section
   Section 10.

3.2.2.  Question Section

   In the first response message, the IXFR server MUST copy this section
   from the corresponding IXFR query message.  For subsequent messages,
   it MAY do the same or leave the Question section empty.  However, if
   the last response message sent is an error message (RCODE unequal to
   0), the query MUST also be copied.  Accordingly, QDCOUNT in the DNS
   message header is set to either 1 (query copied) or 0 (otherwise).

   The content of this section MAY be used to determine the context of
   the message, that is, the name of the zone being transferred.  The
   recipent (IXFR client) SHOULD apply the response verification rules
   from RFC 5452 [RFC5452].

3.2.3.  Answer Section

   The Answer section MUST be populated with the zone change information
   or, in the case of fallback to AXFR, the full zone contents.  See
   Section 3 below for details.

3.2.4.  Authority Section

   Corresponding to NSCOUNT=0 in the DNS message header, the Authority
   section in IXFR response messages MUST be empty.

3.2.5.  Additional Section

   All considerations from Section 2.1.5 (and hence, by reference, also
   Section 2.1.5) of RFC 5936 apply in the same manner for IXFR as they
   do for AXFR.

3.3.  Connection Aborts

   In case of an IXFR session carried over connection-oriented transport
   (TCP), the considerations in Section 2.3 of RFC 5936 [RFC5936] apply
   similarly.
   In a nutshell: Servers SHOULD avoid dropping active connections
   whenever possible, and clients nevertheless must be prepared to
   gracefully deal with such aborts.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA Registry "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" [DNSVALS]
   contains a sub-registry "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs", in which
   [RFC5395] has reserved the range 128 through 255 for pseudo-RRs only
   being used in DNS queries, for short "Q Types".  This partial
   namespace is managed under the "DNS RRTYPE Allocation Policy"
   specified in RFC 5395 [RFC5395].

   Since RFC 1995, the Q Type 251 has been assigned to IXFR.  Upon
   publication as an RFC, IANA will update / has updated the description
   for that entry to say "incremental zone transfer" and the Reference
   for that entry to point to this memo.
   Upon publication of this memo as an RFC, IANA also will assign / has
   assigned the Q Type {IANA-TBD1} to the TYPE mnemonic IXFR-ONLY, with
   description "incremental zone transfer w/o fallback", and pointing to
   this memo.

   [[ TBD: assignment of a new, extended (??) RCODE value for CannotIXFR
   ({IANA_TBD2}) ]]

   Masataka Ohta is acknowledged for his original work as the author of
   RFC 1995 [RFC1995], and this extends to the contributors listed in
   the Acknowledgements section of that RFC.

   The specification of IXFR-ONLY in this document is based on the
   original proposal [I-D.kerr-ixfr-only], whose authors are
   acknowledged for identifying the operational need for this behavior
   and carrying it to the IETF.
