Internet-Draft                 JSON Patch                   October 2011


1.  Introduction

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for
   the exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789]
   extends HTTP [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial modifications
   to resources.

   The JSON Patch media type "application/json-patch" is a JSON document
   structure for expressing a sequence of partial modifications to a
   JSON document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Document Structure

   A JSON Patch document contains a JSON array of objects.  Each object
   contains an operation to apply to the target JSON document.

   A sample JSON Patch document:

   [
       { "remove": "/a/b/c" },
       { "add": "/a/b/c", "value": "foo" },
       { "replace": "/a/b/c", "value": "bar" }
   ]

   Evaluation of a JSON Patch document begins with a target JSON
   document to modify.  Operations are applied sequentially in the order
   they appear in the array.  Each operation in the sequence is applied
   to the target document.  The resulting modified document becomes the
   target for the next operation.  The process repeats until all
   operations are successfully applied.


4.  Operations

   The operation to perform is expressed in the name of a member in the
   operation object, with that member's value holding a string
   containing the [JSON Pointer], which references the value to modify.
   It is an error condition if an operation object contains more than
   one operation member.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Patch                   October 2011


4.1.  add

   The "add" operation adds a new value into an object or array.  The
   value to be added is specified in the operation object's "value"
   member.

   If adding to an object, it is an error condition if the member to be
   added in the object already exists.

   If adding to an array, all elements at or above the specified index
   are shifted one position to the right.  It is an error condition if
   the specified index is greater than the number of elements in the
   existing array.

4.2.  remove

   The "remove" operation removes a value from an object or array.

   If removing an element from an array, all elements above the
   specified index are shifted one position to the left.

   It is an error condition if the value to be removed does not exist.

4.3.  replace

   The "replace" operation replaces an existing value with a new value.
   This operation is equivalent to expressing a "remove" operation for a
   value, followed immediately by an "add" operation for the same value.
   The value to be replaced is specified in the operation object's
   "value" member.

   It is an error condition if the value to be replaced does not exist.


5.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Patch
   document terminates and modification of the target document fails to
   complete.


6.  Acknowledgements

   The structure of a JSON Patch document was informed by the XML Patch
   document [RFC5261] specification.
