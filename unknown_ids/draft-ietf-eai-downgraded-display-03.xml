  <abstract>
    <t>
This document describes a method for displaying downgraded messages
which originally contained internationalized E-mail addresses or
internationalized header fields.
    </t>
  </abstract>
</front>

<middle>
  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
	<t>
	The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension document set
	<xref target="RFC4952" />
	<xref target="RFC5336" />
	<xref target="RFC5335" />
	<xref target="RFC5337" />
	expands Email address structure, syntax and Email header format.
	To avoid rejection of internationalized Email messages,
	the downgrading mechanism <xref target="RFC5504" />
	converts an internationalized message to a traditional Email message
	when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP extension.
	The downgraded message is a traditional Email message,
	except the message has "Downgraded-" header fields.
	</t>
	<t>
	A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist
	because the encoding defined in <xref target="RFC2047" /> is not exactly reversible
	and Received header field downgrading may remove FOR clause information.
	The restoration of the downgrading should be done once at the final
	destination of the downgraded message such as MUAs or IMAP servers.
	This document describes the restoration methods for displaying downgraded messages
	in MUAs.
	</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Terminology">
    <t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
      2119 <xref target="RFC2119" />.
    </t>
    <t>
   Specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the
   EAI overview <xref target="RFC4952" /> or in
	<xref target="RFC5321" /><xref target="RFC5322" />,
	MIME documents
		<xref target="RFC2045" />
		<xref target="RFC2047" />
		<xref target="RFC2183" />
		<xref target="RFC2231" />.
    </t>
    <t>
	This document depends on
	<xref target="RFC5335" /> and
	<xref target="RFC5504" />.
	Key words used in these document are used in this document, too.
    </t>
    <t>
	The term "MIME decode" is used for both "encoded-word" decoding defined by <xref target="RFC2047" /> and
	MIME parameter value decoding defined by <xref target="RFC2231" />.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Converting downgraded message headers for display" anchor="converting">
    <section title="Considerations" anchor="considerations">
      <t>
	The order of some header fields (such as "Resent-*" fields) is
	significant.  The process of regenerating the original fields
	from the downgraded ones MUST NOT reorder the fields.
      </t>
      <t>
	In order to regenerate a field from a specific downgraded
	header field, it's necessary to find the corresponding
	replacement in the current message.  If the corresponding
	field can not be found, the downgraded header field in
	question can not be regenerated and used.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="The process" anchor="process">
      <t>
	A MUA MAY decode and re-generate the original header fields of
	the message (MTAs and MDAs SHOULD NOT attempt to do this; it
	SHOULD be left to the MUA).  This procedure can be used to
	approximately reverse the Downgrade process, but it will not
	always construct the original header fields exactly.
      </t>
      <t>
	Three types of Downgraded header fields are described in section 3
	of <xref target="RFC5504" />:
    <list style="numbers">
	  <t>"Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields", described in RFC5504 section 3.1 and in <xref target="envelope-preservation"/>, below.</t>
	  <t>"Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in RFC5504 section 3.2 and in <xref target="address-preservation"/>, below.</t>
	  <t>"Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in RFC5504 section 3.3 and in <xref target="unknown-preservation"/>, below.</t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	After processing Downgraded header fields, decode all header fields, as described in <xref target="RFC2047"/> and <xref target="RFC2231"/>.
      </t>
      <section title="No reconstruction of the Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields" anchor="envelope-preservation">
	<t>
	  Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields are new
	  fields that might have been added by the downgrade process.
	  Because they do not represent fields that appeared in the
	  original message, this process is not applicable to them.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Reconstructing the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields" anchor="address-preservation">
	<t>
	  Reconstructing Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields is OPTIONAL, and
	  a decision MAY be made on each field, individually.  In particular, it might be less
	  important to process the Resent-* header fields, so an implementation MAY choose to
	  skip those.
	</t>
	<t>
	  To construct a displayable copy of a header field from one
	  of these downgraded header fields, follow this procedure:
          <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="1. ">
	      In an edit buffer, create a new header field:"
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="1a. ">
	      For the field name, remove the "Downgraded-" prefix from
	      the downgraded field name.  For example,
	      "Downgraded-From" becomes "From", and
	      "Downgraded-Resent-To" becomes "Resent-To".
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="1b. ">
	      For the field value, decode the MIME-encoded value of
	      the downgraded field according to <xref target="RFC2047"
	      />.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="2. ">
	      If the header field is one that can only appear once,
	      according to the table in <xref target="RFC5322" />
	      section 3.6 ("From", "Sender", "To", "CC", "BCC",
	      "Reply-To"), locate the corresponding field in the
	      message's headers, and skip to step 9.  Otherwise,
	      continue with step 3.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="3. ">
	      Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading", defined in
	      section 5 of <xref target="RFC5504"/>, to the field in
	      the edit buffer, but do not prepend the "Downgraded-"
	      prefix.  Put the result into comparison buffer 1.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="4. ">
	      Canonicalize the header fields in the comparison buffer:
	      <list style="numbers">
		<t>
		  Unfold all header field continuation lines as
		  described in <xref target="RFC5322" />.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Ensure that there is one space character before and
		  one after the &lt;mailbox-list&gt; separator ",".
		  If a space character is missing, insert one.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Ensure that there is one space character before and
		  one after each &lt;comment&gt;.  If a space character is
		  missing, insert one.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Decode each &lt;encoded-word&gt; whose charset is "UTF-8".
		</t>
		<t>
		  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters
		  to a single space character.  WSP characters here
		  include those before and after a line-folding
		  boundary.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header
		  field value.
		</t>
		<t>
		  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after
		  the colon separating the header field name from the
		  header field value, retaining the colon separator.
		</t>
	      </list>
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="5. ">
	      Locate the first instance of the corresponding field in
	      the message's headers.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="6. ">
	      Canonicalize the located field as in step 4, and put the result
	      into comparison buffer 2.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="7. ">
	      Compare the header field in comparison buffer 1 with the header
	      field in comparison buffer 2.  If they match, go to step 9.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="8. ">
	      Locate the next instance of the corresponding field in
	      the message's headers.  If one is found, go to step 6.
	      If none is found, stop: you can not use this downgraded
	      field because you can't find its replacement in the
	      message.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="9. ">
	      Replace the located header field with the one in the edit buffer.
	      You MUST NOT reorder the header fields when you do this; it's
	      important to replace the field in place.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields" anchor="unknown-preservation">
	<t>
	  The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields SHOULD be
	  left as they are unless the MUA has special knowledge of a particular field.
	  An MUA with such knowledge MAY use the procedure in <xref target="address-preservation"/>,
	  above, for those fields that it knows about.
    </t>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section title="Security considerations" anchor="security">
    <t>
   While information in any email header should usually be treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   For example, an organization's boundary MTA can modify "From:" lines
   so that messages arriving from outside the organization are easily
   distinguishable from internal emails. As a result of that rewriting,
   it might not be possible to reconstruct the "Downgraded-From" header field.
	</t>
    <t>
   A MUA MAY emphasize bogus or broken Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields found in step 8 of
   <xref target="address-preservation" />.
    </t>
    <t>
   Hiding the information from the actual header fields when using the
   "Downgraded-" header fields does not cause loss of information if
   generating MIME decoded header fields in step 1
   of <xref target="address-preservation" />
   and
   the comparison done in step 8
   are successful.
   To ensure that no information is lost, a MUA
   SHOULD have a function that uses the actual message that was
   received (with/without MIME decoding) to render the message.
    </t>

    Two of the fields, Downgraded-Mail-From and Downgraded-Rcpt-To, are
    Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields, and will not be reconstructed.
    One field, Downgraded-Unknown-Field, is an Unknown Header Fields' Preservation
    Header Field, and will also not be reconstructed.  That leaves these to be
    reconstructed, the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields:

    In step 2, we set aside the "From", "To", and "Cc" fields, and continue to step 3
    with just "Resent-From" and "Resent-To" (the fields that may appear more than once).
    The fields we set aside will be picked up again later, in step 9.

	As a result, in this simple example, some original header fields are now displayed in their
	original form.
	Differences between <xref target="example-originaleaismtpsession" /> and <xref target="step9" /> are Return-Path, Downgraded-Mail-From, Downgraded-Rcpt-To, and Downgraded-Unknown-Field.
