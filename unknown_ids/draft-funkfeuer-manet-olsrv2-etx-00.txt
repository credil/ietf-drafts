Internet-Draft                ETX for MANET                December 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Funkfeuer [FUNKFEUER] and Freifunk networks [FREIFUNK] are OLSR-
   based [RFC3626] wireless community networks with hundreds of routers
   in permanent operation.  The Vienna Funkfeuer network in Austria
   consists of 400 routers, around 600 routes, covering the whole city
   of Vienna and beyond spanning roughly 40km in diameter.  It has been
   in operation since 2003 and supplies it's users with Internet access.
   The Funkfeuer network is special in a respect that it manages to
   provide Internet access through a city wide, large scale Wi-Fi mesh
   cloud, having just one single uplink

   Operational experience with these network has revealed that the use
   of hop-count as routing metric leads to unsatisfactory network
   performance (especially if going through a single uplink).
   Experiments with the ETX metric [MOBICOM03] were therefore undertaken
   in parallel in the Berlin Freifunk network as well as the Funkfeuer
   network and found satisfactory.  This metric is in operational use in
   these networks for a couple of years.  Even though a couple of other
   metrics have been proposed and asked for by the community in the
   Funkfeuer network, ETX proved a very easy to implement metric which
   provides sufficiently good results.

   The ETX metric of a link is the estimated number of transmissions
   required to successfully send a packet (each packet smaller than MTU)
   over that link, until an acknowledgement is received.  The ETX metric
   is additive, i.e. the ETX metric of a path is the sum of the ETX
   metrics for each link on this path.

   This document describes the ETX metric as used by the Funkfeuer
   network, and specifies its usage in OLSRv2 [olsrv2].  More precisely,
   this document specifies additional signaling and processing to NHDP
   [nhdp] in order to establish the ETX metric value for a link.

   In order to use the ETX metric for routers, this document assumes
   that the suggestions in [olsrv2-metric] are incorporated into
   [olsrv2].


2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
   NOT','SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in[RFC2119].

   The terminology introduced in [RFC5444], [olsrv2], [nhdp], and
   [olsrv2-metric], including the terms "packet", "message", "Address

   Block", "TLV Block","TLV", "address", "address prefix", and "address
   object" are to be interpreted as described therein.

   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology and
   notational conventions:

   LIFO  - a last in, first out queue of numbers.

   LIFO[current]  - the most recent entry added to the queue.

   push(LIFO, value)  - an operation which removes the oldest entry in
      the queue and place a new entry at the head of the queue.

   sum(LIFO)  - an operation which returns the sum of all elements in a
      LIFO.

   diff_seqno(new, old)  - an operation which returns the positive
      distance between two elements of the circular sequence number
      space defined in [RFC5444].  Its value is either (new - old) if
      this result is positive, or else its value is (new - old + 65536).

   UNDEFINED  - a constant for -1.


3.  Applicability Statement

   The mechanism specified in this document is used daily by hundreds of
   routers in the Funkfeuer network [FUNKFEUER], as well as in similar
   OLSR-based wireless community networks which use the OLSR.org
   [OLSR.org] code base, such as [FREIFUNK], [AWMN], [NINUX], [GUIFI],
   [OPENAIR].  Operational experience suggests that this mechanism is
   viable in (at least) these kinds of networks.

   The ETX metric value of a link is established by measuring the rate
   of successful exchange of OLSRv2 control packets over that link,
   which use the format defined in [RFC5444].  ETX metric computation is
   thus based only on layer 3 signaling, and is therefore independent
   from underlying link layer technologies.  Moreover, ETX metric
   computation does not require inspection of data traffic.

   If a neighbor does not add use this ETX metric, this protocol falls
   back to DEFAULT_METRIC as defined in [olsrv2-metric].


4.  Protocol Functioning & Overview

   Router A computes the value of the ETX metric of its link to router B
   by continuously estimating the loss rates over this link, in both



Rogge, et al.             Expires June 11, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                ETX for MANET                December 2009


   directions: from B to A (this rate is called R_etx), and from A to B
   (this rate is called D_etx).  Router A computes R_etx as the measured
   proportion of [RFC5444] packets successfully arriving from B, and
   signals this value in NHDP HELLO messages by inclusion of a R_etx
   TLV.  Symmetrically, router B computes the proportion of [RFC5444]
   packets successfully arriving from A, and signals its value in NDHP
   HELLO messages by inclusion of a R_etx TLV, which router A can then
   take as D_etx value for this link.

   The value of the ETX metric of the link is then ETX = R_etx * D_etx,
   which corresponds to the expected number of attempts to successfully
   receive and acknowledge a packet over this link.  Note that this
   metric is symmetric, i.e. on a link connecting router A and router B,
   the ETX metric value for this link computed by router B will be the
   same as the ETX metric value computed by router A.


5.  Data Structures

   This specification extends the Link Set per Interface Information
   Base, as defined in [nhdp], with the following additional elements
   for each link tuple:

   L_METRIC_received_lifo  - a LIFO queue with ETX_MEMORY_LENGTH integer
      elements.  Each entry contains the number of successfully received
      [RFC5444] packets within an interval of ETX_METRIC_INTERVAL.

   L_METRIC_total_lifo  - a LIFO queue with ETX_MEMORY_LENGTH integer
      elements.  Each entry contains the estimated number of [RFC5444]
      packets transmitted by the neighbor, based on the received packet
      sequence numbers within an interval of ETX_METRIC_INTERVAL.

   L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno  - the last received packet sequence number
      received from this link.

   L_METRIC_r_etx  - the current r_etx value for this link to the
      neighbor.

   L_METRIC_d_etx  - the last d_etx value received from the neighbor for
      this link.

   L_METRIC_hello_time  - time when the next hello will be expected.
      This is used to detect missing hellos by timeout.

   L_METRIC_hello_interval  - the interval between two hello messages of
      the links neighbor.

Internet-Draft                ETX for MANET                December 2009


   L_METRIC_lost_hellos  - the estimated number of lost hello messages
      from this neighbor, based on the value of the hello interval.


6.  Initial Values

   When generating a new tuple in the Link Set, the values of the
   elements specified above are set as follows:

      L_METRIC_received_lifo := 0, ..., 0.

      L_METRIC_total_lifo := 0, ..., 0.

      L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno := UNDEFINED.

      L_METRIC_r_etx := UNDEFINED.

      L_METRIC_d_etx := UNDEFINED.

      L_METRIC_hello_time := EXPIRED.

      L_METRIC_hello_interval := UNDEFINED.

      L_METRIC_lost_hellos := 0


7.  Protocol Parameters

   This specification uses the parameters defined in [olsrv2].  This
   specification defines the following additional parameters:

   ETX_MEMORY_LENGTH  - ETX algorithm memory length in seconds.  All
      received and lost packets within this time period are used to
      calculate the delivery ratio R_etx.

   ETX_METRIC_INTERVAL  - interval in seconds between two metric
      recalculations as described in Section 10.

   ETX_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION  - threshold in number of missing packets
      (based on received packet sequence numbers) at which point the
      router considers the neighbor has restarted.

   ETX_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR  - timeout factor for HELLO interval at
      which point a HELLO is definitely considered lost.  The value
      should be between 1.0 and (2.0 * (1 - HT_MAXJITTER/
      HELLO_INTERVAL)).

Internet-Draft                ETX for MANET                December 2009


   ETX_PERFECT_METRIC  - metric value for ETX 1.0.


8.  Packets and Messages

   Generated packets and messages use the format defined in [RFC5444].
   The present specification adds the following constraints:

   o  A packet MUST contain a packet sequence number as defined in
      [RFC5444].  This sequence number MUST be interface specific.

8.1.  HELLO Message Generation

   HELLO messages are generated as specified in [olsrv2].  In addition,
   the HELLO messages must comply with the following:

   o  For each address included in a HELLO message with a TLV with type
      LINK_STATUS and value SYMMETRIC or HEARD, a TLV of type R_etx MUST
      also be included.

   R_etx TLV formatting is specified in Table 1, whereby the value of
   the directional link cost is encoded as TimeTLV [RFC5497] encoded
   values with C = 1024.

                    +-------+--------------+----------+
                    |  Type | Value Length |   Value  |
                    +-------+--------------+----------+
                    | R_etx |    1 octet   | linkcost |
                    +-------+--------------+----------+

                                  Table 1

   The value of the linkcost field of an R_etx TLV in a HELLO message is
   set to the L_METRIC_r_etx value of the corresponding link listed in
   this HELLO message.

8.2.  HELLO Message Processing

   HELLO messages are first processed as specified in [olsrv2].  This
   processing includes identifying (or creating) a Neighbor Tuple
   corresponding to the originator of the HELLO message (the "current
   Neighbor Tuple").  After this, the following MUST be performed:

   1.  If the IP address of this link local interface is included in the
       HELLO address block and the address block contains an R_etx
       address TLV, then:

       1.  L_METRIC_d_etx := R_etx.

   2.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_METRIC_d_etx := UNDEFINED.

   3.  If the HELLO message contains an INTERVAL_TIME TLV, then:

       1.  L_METRIC_hello_interval := INTERVAL_TIME.

   4.  If L_METRIC_hello_interval != UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_METRIC_hello_time := current_time +
           ETX_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR * INTERVAL_TIME.

   5.  L_METRIC_lost_hellos := 0.

8.3.  Packet Processing

   Each incoming packet is processed as defined in OLSRv2 [olsrv2].
   Furthermore, the following additional processing MUST be carried out
   after the package has been processed on the link set tuple
   corresponding to the source of the packet:

   1.  If L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno = UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_METRIC_received_lifo[current] := 1.

       2.  L_METRIC_total_lifo[current] := 1.

   2.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_METRIC_received_lifo[current] :=
           L_METRIC_received_lifo[current] + 1.

       2.  diff := seq_diff(seqno, L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno).

       3.  If diff > ETX_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION, then:

           1.  diff := 1.

       4.  L_METRIC_total_lifo[current] := L_METRIC_total_lifo[current]
           + diff.

   3.  L_METRIC_last_pkt_seqno := seqno.

9.  HELLO Timeout

   When L_METRIC_hello_time has timed out, the following step MUST be
   done:

   1.  L_METRIC_lost_hellos := L_METRIC_lost_hellos + 1.

   2.  L_METRIC_hello_time := L_METRIC_hello_time +
       L_METRIC_hello_interval.


10.  Periodic Metric Computation

   This metric stores the number of received packets per link to a
   neighbor and use the package sequence number to calculate the total
   number of sent packages of the neighbor.  The total number of
   packages divided by the number of received packages is used as a cost
   metric for the link.

   If a link to a node is lost, no packets are received anymore and
   neither the received not total value of packages will change.  To
   prevent a constant result in this case, the metric stores the number
   of HELLO message interval timeouts since the last received packet
   from a neighbor and use this value to reduce the received packet
   count proportionally to the length of the metric memory
   ETX_MEMORY_LENGTH.

   Once every ETX_METRIC_INTERVAL, this protocol MUST recalculate of all
   L_METRIC_r_etx in all Link Set entries:

   1.  sum_received := sum(L_METRIC_total_lifo).

   2.  sum_total := sum(L_METRIC_received_lifo).

   3.  If L_METRIC_hello_interval != UNDEFINED and L_METRIC_lost_hellos
       > 0, then:

       1.  penalty := L_METRIC_hello_interval * L_METRIC_lost_hellos /
           ETX_MEMORY_LENGTH.

       2.  sum_received := sum_received - sum_received * penalty;

   4.  If sum_received < 1, then:

       1.  L_METRIC_r_etx := UNDEFINED.

       2.  L_in_metric := MAXIMUM_METRIC.

   5.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_METRIC_r_etx := sum_total / sum_received.

       2.  If L_METRIC_d_etc = UNDEFINED, then:

           1.  L_in_metric := DEFAULT_METRIC,

       3.  Otherwise:

           1.  L_in_metric := ETX_PERFECT_METRIC * L_METRIC_r_etx *
               L_METRIC_d_etx.

   6.  push(L_METRIC_total_lifo, 0)

   7.  push(L_METRIC_received_lifo, 0)


11.  Proposed Values for Parameters and Constants

   This section proposes values for various parameters used in this
   specification.

   o  ETX_MEMORY_LENGTH := 32 seconds

   o  ETX_METRIC_INTERVAL := 1 second

   o  ETX_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION := 256

   o  ETX_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR := 1.5

   o  ETX_PERFECT_METRIC := DEFAULT_METRIC * 0.1


12.  Security Considerations

   Artificial manipulation of metrics values can drastically alter
   network performance.  In particular, advertising a higher R_etx value
   may decrease the amount of incoming traffic, while advertising lower
   R_etx may decrease the amount of incoming traffic.  By artificially
   increasing or decreasing the R_etx values it advertises, a rogue
   router may thus attract or repulse data traffic.  A rogue router may
   then potentially degrade data throughput by not forwarding data as it
   should or redirecting traffic into routing loops or bad links.

13.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one Address Block TLV Type, which have
   been allocated from the "Assigned Address Block TLV Types" repository
   of [RFC5444] as specified in Table 2.

13.1.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines

   For the registries for TLV Type Extensions where an Expert Review is
   required, the designated expert SHOULD take the same general
   recommendations into consideration as are specified by [RFC5444].
