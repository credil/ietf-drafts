             IMAP LIST extension for special-use mailboxes
                   draft-ietf-morg-list-specialuse-00

Abstract

   Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
   used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients
   allow users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put,
   but configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
   server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new
   mailbox flags that a server MAY include in IMAP LIST command
   responses to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing
   configuration.

Note

   A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC
   editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion
   and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to
   morg@ietf.org.

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes        January 2010


1.  Introduction

   Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
   used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients
   allow users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put,
   but configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
   server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new
   mailbox flags that a server MAY include in IMAP LIST command
   responses to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing
   configuration.

   In addition, this extension adds an OPTIONAL parameter on the IMAP
   CREATE command, allowing a client to assign a special use to a
   mailbox when it is created.  Servers MAY choose to support this part
   of the extension, but are not required to.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Kwds].


2.  New mailbox flags identifying special-use mailboxes

   An IMAP server that supports this extension MAY include any or all of
   the following flags in responses to the IMAP LIST command.  The new
   flags are included along with existing flags, such as "\Marked" and
   "\Noselect".  A given mailbox may have none, one, or more than one of
   these flags.  In some cases, a special use is advice to a client
   about what to put in that mailbox.  In other cases, it's advice to a
   client about what to expect to find there.

   The new flags defined here are as follows:

   \Drafts
        This mailbox is used to hold draft messages -- typically,
        messages that are being composed but have not yet been sent.  In
        some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with
        the "\Draft" message flag.  Alternatively, this might just be
        advice that a client put drafts here.

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes        January 2010


   \Inbox
        This mailbox is the inbox, where new incoming mail is placed by
        default.  This will normally be the same as the mailbox with the
        name "inbox", as defined in the base IMAP protocol [IMAP].

   \Sent
        This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that have been
        sent.  Some server implementations might put messages here
        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice that a
        client save sent messages here.

   \Spam
        This mailbox is where messages deemed to be "spam" (junk mail)
        are held.  Some server implementations might put messages here
        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice to a
        client-side spam filter.

   \Starred
        This mailbox presents all messages marked as "important".  When
        this special use is supported, it is likely to represent a
        virtual mailbox containing messages from other mailboxes that
        are marked with the "\Flagged" message flag.

   \Trash
        This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted, or
        marked for deletion.  In some server implementations, this might
        be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from other mailboxes
        that are marked with the "\Deleted" message flag.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that
        chooses not to use the IMAP "\Deleted" model should use this as
        its trash location.  In server implementations that strictly
        expect the IMAP "\Deleted" model, this special use is likely not
        to be supported.

   \AllMail
        This mailbox presents all messages in the user's message store.
        Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those
        in \Trash and \Spam.  When this special use is supported, it is
        almost certain to represent a virtual mailbox.

   All of the above flags are OPTIONAL, and any given server or message
   store may support any combination of the flags, or none at all.
   There is no capability string associated with this feature.


3.  Extension to IMAP CREATE command to set special-use flags

   As an OPTIONAL feature, a server MAY allow clients to designate a



Leiba & Nicolson          Expires July 29, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      IMAP LIST: special-use mailboxes        January 2010


   mailbox, at creation, as having one or more special uses.  This
   extension defines the "USE" parameter to the IMAP CREATE command for
   that purpose.  The new OPTIONAL "USE" parameter is followed by a
   parenthesized list of zero or more special-use flags, as defined
   above.

   In some server implementations, some special uses may imply automatic
   action by the server.  For example, creation of a "\Spam" mailbox
   might cause the server to start placing messages that have been
   evaluated as spam into the mailbox.

   In some server implementations, some special uses may result in a
   mailbox with unusual characteristics.  For example, creation of an
   "\AllMail" mailbox might cause the server to create a virtual
   mailbox, rather than a standard one, and that mailbox might behave in
   unexpected ways (COPY into it might fail, for example).

   Servers MAY allow the creation of a special-use mailbox even if one
   so designated already exists, having the effect of moving the special
   use from the old mailbox to the new one.  Alternatively, servers MAY
   refuse the creation, considering the designation to be a conflict.

   If the server can not create a mailbox with the designated special
   use defined, for whatever reason, it MUST NOT create the mailbox, and
   MUST respond to the CREATE command with a tagged NO response.

   An IMAP server that supports this OPTIONAL feature will advertise the
   CREATE-SPECIAL-USE capability string.  Clients MUST NOT use the "USE"
   parameter unless the server advertises the capability.


4.  Examples

4.1.  Example of an IMAP LIST command

   This example shows an IMAP LIST response from a server that supports
   this extension.  Note that not all of the flags are used.  This
   server also supports the Child Mailbox extension [Child].

     C: t1 LIST "" "%"
     S: * LIST (\Marked \HasNoChildren) "/" Inbox
     S: * LIST () "/" ToDo
     S: * LIST (\HasChildren) "/" Projects
     S: * LIST (\Sent) "/" SentMail
     S: * LIST (\Marked \Drafts) "/" MyDrafts
     S: * LIST (\Trash) "/" Trash
     S: t1 OK done

4.2.  Example of an IMAP CREATE command

   This example shows an IMAP CREATE command that might be used to
   create a mailbox designated to hold draft and sent messages.  It also
   attempts to create a mailbox that will contain all the user's
   messages, but the server does not support that special use for this
   user's message store.

     C: t1 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 CREATE-SPECIAL-USE
     S: t1 OK done
     C: t2 CREATE MySpecial USE (\Drafts \Sent)
     S: t2 OK MySpecial created
     C: t3 CREATE Everything USE (\AllMail)
     S: t3 NO \AllMail not supported


5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [ABNF].

   create         =/  "CREATE" SP mailbox [SP use-param]
                    ; Extends "create" from IMAP base [IMAP]

   mbx-list-oflag =/  use-flag
                    ; Extends "mbx-list-oflag" from IMAP base [IMAP]

   use-param       =  "USE" SP "(" [use-flag *(SP use-flag)] ")"

   use-flag        =  "\AllMail" / "\Drafts" / "\Inbox" / "\Sent" /
                    "\Spam" / "\Starred" / "\Trash" / use-flag-ext

   use-flag-ext    =  "\" atom
                    ; Reserved for future extensions.  Clients
                    ; MUST ignore list flags they do not understand
                    ; Server implementations MUST NOT generate
                    ; extension flags except as defined by
                    ; future standards-track revisions of or
                    ; extensions to this specification.


6.  Security Considerations

   LIST response: There are no security issues with conveying special-
   use information to a client.

   CREATE command "USE" parameter: In some server implementations, some

   special uses may imply automatic action by the server.  For example,
   creation of a "\Spam" mailbox might cause the server to start placing
   messages that have been evaluated as spam into the mailbox.  Server
   implementors SHOULD consider the consequences of allowing a user (or
   client program) to designate the target of such automatic action.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IMAP capability.  IANA is asked to add
   "CREATE-SPECIAL-USE" to the imap4-capabilities registry.
