                      The 'view-source' URI Scheme
                 <draft-yevstifeyev-view-source-uri-00>

Abstract

   This document specifies the 'view-source' Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) scheme.  The 'view-source' URIs have long been used by web-
   browsers to refer to the source code of resource identified by it
   having mostly semi-formal specifications and no official record at
   the IETF.  This document is to remove this uncertainty; it gives the
   formal definition of 'view-source' URI scheme and registers it in the
   corresponding IANA registry.

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the 'view-source' Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) scheme.  The 'view-source' URIs have long been used by web-
   browsers to refer to the source code of resource identified by it
   having mostly semi-formal specifications (such as the record at
   Microsoft Developer Network [MSDN-VIEW-SOURCE]) and no official
   record at the IETF.  This document is to remove this uncertainty; it
   gives the formal definition of 'view-source' URI scheme and registers
   it in the corresponding IANA registry.

   Generic URI syntax is defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]; registration
   procedures for new URI schemes are described in RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  URI Scheme Registration Template

   This section contains the registration template for 'view-source' URI
   scheme, as required by RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

   o URI Scheme Name:  The name of registered URI scheme is

     "view-source".

   o Status:  Provisional

   o URI Scheme Syntax:  The 'view-source' URI SHALL take the form of
     the <view-source-uri> rule below, defined in ABNF [RFC5234]:

     view-source-uri = "view-source:" absolute-URI

     where the <absolute-URI> rule is defined in Appendix A of RFC 3986
     [RFC3986].

   o URI Scheme Semantics:  The application resolving the 'view-source'
     URI SHALL return the source code of the resource, identified by its
     <absolute-URI> part.  Each application implementing it is permitted
     to choose how the source code is displayed.  However this document
     recommends that it SHOULD be represented in the media type
     "text/plain" [RFC2046] and the character encoding "UTF-8"
     [RFC3629].

     Per RFC 4395, not all URI schemes are used to identify resources. 
     Therefore if the 'view-source' URI refers to such URI (e. g. 
     "view-source:telnet://exmaple.com/" with a 'telnet' URI [RFC4248]
     in the <absolute-URI> part), the application that resolves it SHALL
     return the resource of zero length, containing no data, with the
     media type "text/plain" [RFC2046] and the character encoding 
     "UTF-8" [RFC3629].

   o Encoding Considerations:  There are no other encoding
     considerations for 'view-source' URI scheme not discussed in RFC
     3986 [RFC3986].

   o Applications and Protocols that Use this URI Scheme Name:  The
     'view-source' URIs is generally used by web-browsers.  However this
     document does not place the limit on where else they can be used.  

     See Wikipedia's entry on "View-source URI scheme" 
     [WIKI-VIEW-SOURCE] for the up-to-date list of browser support
     information.

   o Interoperability Considerations:  The 'view-source' URI may
     sometimes refer to the source code that is under certain legal
     provisions, according to which an individual or a company may not
     have granted the free access or other actions with regard to the
     source code returned after resolving such URI.

   o Security Considerations:  Security considerations for 'view-source'
     URIs are discussed in Section 3 of this document.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for URIs are discussed in Section 7
   of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   The 'view-source' URIs may sometimes reveal the information (source
   code) that is a governmental, trade or other type of secret and,
   therefore, disclose confidential information.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'view-source' URI scheme using the
   template of Section 2.
