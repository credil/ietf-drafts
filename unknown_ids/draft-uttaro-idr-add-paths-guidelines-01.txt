Abstract

   Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertise
   multiple distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides a
   number of potential benefits, including reduced routing churn, faster
   convergence and better loadsharing.

   This document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Paths
   so that network operators have the tools needed to address their
   specific applications and to manage the scalability impact of Add-
   Paths. A router implementing Add-Paths may learn many paths for a
   prefix and must decide which of these to advertise to peers. This
   document analyses different algorithms for making this selection and
   provides recommendations based on the target application.

1. Introduction

   The BGP Add-Paths capability enhances current BGP implementations by
   allowing a BGP router to exchange with its BGP peers more than one
   path for the same destination/NLRI. The base BGP standard [RFC 4271]
   does not provide for such a capability. If a BGP router learns
   multiple paths for the same NLRI (from multiple peers), it selects
   only one as its best path and advertises the best path to its peers.

   The primary goal of Add-Paths is to increase the visibility of paths
   within an iBGP system.  This has the effect of improving robustness
   in case of failure, reducing the number of BGP messages exchanged
   during such an event, and offering the potential for faster re-
   convergence. Through careful selection of the paths to be advertised,
   Add-Paths can also prevent routing oscillations. The following
   network example illustrates these points.

   Consider a network such as the one depicted in Figure 1 and suppose
   that none of the routers support Add-Paths. From AS1 there are 3
   paths (A, B and C) to a particular destination XYZ: two of the paths
   are via AS3 and one of the paths is via AS2. In this example, Path A
   is preferred over Path B due to Path A having a lower MED (multi-exit
   discriminator) (MED for Path A is lower than MED for path B).

   AS1 uses a route reflector RR1 to reduce the scale of its IBGP mesh.
   During steady state, RR1 knows about (has in its RIB-IN) only 2 of
   the 3 paths. Router B suppresses the advertisement of its best
   external path (B) to RR, an IBGP peer, because its best overall path
   is A, learnt from router A (via the RR). RR1 chooses path A as the
   overall best since its IGP cost to router A is the lowest among path
   A and C. During normal conditions, router D has even less knowledge
   of the available paths to destination XYZ; it knows only about path
   (A), the best path from RR1's perspective.

   Consider now the steps required to restore traffic from router D to
   destination XYZ when the link between Router A and Router E fails.

   1. Router A sends a BGP UPDATE message withdrawing its advertisement
      of path (A).

   2. RR receives the withdrawal, and propagates it to its other client
      peers, routers B, C and D.

   3. When router B receives the withdrawal of path (A) it reruns its
      decision process and selects path (B) as its new best path. Router
      B advertises path (B) to RR.

   4. RR reruns its decision process and selects path (B) as its new
      best path. RR advertises path (B) to client peers A, C and D.

   5. Router D reruns its decisions process, determines path (B) to be
      the best path, and updates its forwarding table. After this step
      traffic from router D to destination XYZ is restored (the traffic
      path has changed from A to B).

   With the use of Add-Paths, the convergence time for the above path
   failure example can be reduced considerably. The main reason for the
   improvement is that Add-Paths allows router D to be aware of more
   than one path to destination XYZ prior to the failure of the best
   path (A). In steady-state (with no failures) router B decides, as
   before, that path (A) is its best path but it also advertises path
   (B) - which happens to be its next-best overall path and its best
   "external" path - to RR. With Add-Paths RR1 now has knowledge of all
   3 paths to destination XYZ and it can advertise more than just the
   best path (A) to its peers. Suppose RR1 is allowed to advertise up to
   3 paths for destination XYZ. In this case, with the appropriate path
   selection algorithm, it will advertise paths (A), (B) and (C) to
   router D. Now consider again the scenario where the link between
   Router A and Router E fails. In this case, with Add-Paths, fewer
   steps are required to achieve re-convergence:

   1. Router A sends a BGP UPDATE message withdrawing its advertisement
      of path (A).

   2. RR1 receives the withdrawal, and propagates it to its other client
      peers, routers B, C and D.

   3. Router D receives the withdrawal, reruns the decision process and
      updates the forwarding entry for destination XYZ.

   This one example illustrates the benefit of Add-Paths in terms of
   faster convergence, and it also suggests how other benefits are
   realizable as well. As an example, router D can use the knowledge of
   multiple paths to perform [un]equal cost load balancing if required.

   As with any technology, there are costs to Add-Paths that must be
   considered in relation to the benefits before introducing it into a
   network. Specifically -

   o  Finding the multiple paths to advertise can be more CPU-intensive
      than the normal BGP decision process.

   o  Advertising multiple paths per prefix requires more memory and
      state than an implementation that advertises only the best path
      per prefix. More specifically, with the current behavior of
      advertising the best path only, each BGP speaker maintains send
      state information in its prefix data structure per neighbor as a
      way to determine that the prefix has been advertised to the
      neighbor. With Add-Paths, this information has to be replicated on
      a per path basis that needs to be advertised. Mathematically, if
      "send state" size per prefix is 's' bytes, number of neighbors is
      'n', and number of paths being advertised is 'p', then the current
      memory requirement for BGP "send state" = n * s bytes; with Add-
      Paths, it becomes n * s * p bytes.

   o  Receiving multiple paths per prefix also requires more memory and
      state since the number of paths per prefix effectively increases.

   o  In any BGP deployment it is important that the BGP routers within
      an AS make a consistent routing decision about how to reach a
      particular destination, otherwise route oscillations may occur.
      When using Add-Paths the opportunity for inconsistent routing
      decisions increases and therefore routing policies must be applied
      carefully.

2. Terminology and Conventions Used in this Document

   In this document the following terms are used:

   Add-Paths peer: refers a peer with which the local system has agreed
   to receive and/or send NLRI with path identifiers

   Primary path: A path toward a prefix that is considered a best path
   by the BGP decision process [RFC 4271] and actively used for
   forwarding traffic to that prefix. A router may have multiple primary
   paths for a prefix if it implements multipath.

   Backup path: One of the non-best paths toward a prefix.

   Optimal backup path: the backup path that will be selected as the new
   best path for a prefix when all primary paths are removed/withdrawn.

   AS-Wide preferred paths: All paths that are considered as best when
   applying rules of the BGP decision process up to the IGP tie-break.

   Path diversity: The property that a router has several paths for a
   given prefix and each one is associated with a unique BGP next-hop
   (and BGP router).

3. Add-Paths Applications

   [draft-mohapatra] presents the applications that would benefit from
   multiple paths advertisement in iBGP.  They fall into 3 categories:

   Fast Connectivity Restoration, thanks to the dissemination of backup
   paths.  If a router has a backup path, it can directly select that
   path as best upon failure of the primary path.  This minimizes packet
   loss on dataplane.  Sending multiple paths in iBGP allows routers to
   receive backup paths when path visibility is not sufficient with
   classical BGP.  This is especially useful when Route Reflection is
   used.

   Load Balancing, across several BGP nexthops: Increased path diversity
   allows routers to install several paths in their Routing Table and to
   load balance traffic across those paths.

   Churn reduction: As failures can be recovered locally when backup
   paths are available, BGP path exploration is reduced in iBGP, which
   results in less updates disseminated in eBGP.  When the preferred
   backup path is the post-convergence path, churn is minimized.

                       Figure 2: BGP Peering Example


   In Figure 2, in order for a router A to receive multiple paths per
   NLRI from peer B, for a particular address family (AFI=x, SAFI=y),
   the BGP capabilities advertisements during session setup must
   indicate that peer B wants to send multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y
   and that router A is willing to receive multiple paths for AFI=x,
   SAFI=y. Similarly, in order for router A to send multiple paths per
   NLRI to peer B, for a particular address family (AFI=x, SAFI=y), the
   BGP capabilities advertisements must indicate that router A wants to
   send multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y and peer B is willing to

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-Add-Pathss-guidelines         Feb 2010


   receive multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y. Refer to [Add-Paths] for
   details of the Add-Paths capabilities advertisement.

   The capabilities of the local router shall be configurable per peer
   and per address family, with the ability to configure send-only
   operation or receive-only operation. The default mode of operation
   shall be to both send and receive.

4.2. Receiving Multiple Paths

   Currently, per standard BGP behavior, if a BGP router receives an
   advertisement of an NLRI and path from a specific peer and that peer
   subsequently advertises the same NLRI with different path information
   (e.g. a different NEXT_HOP and/or different path attributes) the new
   path effectively overwrites the existing path.

   When Add-Paths has been negotiated with the peer, the newly
   advertised path should be stored in the RIB-IN along with all of the
   paths previously advertised (and not withdrawn) by the peer.

   When the Add-Paths receive capability for (AFIx, SAFIy) has been
   negotiated with a peer all advertisements and withdrawals of NLRI
   within that address family by that peer shall include a path
   identifier, as described in [Add-Paths]. The path identifiers have no
   significance to the receiving peer. If the combination of NLRI and
   path identifier in an advertisement from a peer is unique (does not
   match an existing route in the RIB-IN from that peer) then the route
   is added to the RIB-IN. If the combination of NLRI and path
   identifier in a received advertisement is the same as an existing
   route in the RIB-IN from the peer then the new route replaces the
   existing one. If the combination of NLRI and path identifier in a
   received withdrawal matches an existing route in the RIB-IN from the
   peer then that route shall be removed from the RIB-IN.

   A BGP UPDATE message from a peer sending NLRI with the path
   identifier may advertise and withdraw more than one NLRI belonging to
   one or more address families. In this case Add-Paths may be supported
   for some of the address families and not others. In this situation
   the receiving BGP router should not expect that all of the path
   identifiers in the UPDATE message will be the same.

4.3. Advertising Multiple Paths

   [Add-Paths] specifies how to encode the advertisement of multiple
   paths towards the same NLRI over an iBGP session, but provides no
   details about which set of multiple paths should be advertised.  In
   this section we present different path selection algorithms and


Uttaro, et al.         Expires January 12, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-Add-Pathss-guidelines         Feb 2010


   provide implementation recommendations to ensure flexibility,
   robustness and interoperability.

   Different algorithms are possible for selecting which set of multiple
   paths to advertise to Add-Paths peers. The following criteria are
   important to consider when deciding the best algorithm to use for a
   particular application:

   Control Plane Load: When a router receives multiples paths for a
   prefix from an iBGP client it has to store more paths in its Adj-Rib-
   Ins.

   Control Plane Stress: Coping with multiple iBGP paths has two
   implications on the computation that a router has to handle. First,
   it has to compute the paths to send to its peers, i.e. more than the
   best path.  Second, it also has to handle the potential churn related
   to the exchange of those multiple paths.

   MED/IGP oscillations: BGP sometimes suffers from routing oscillations
   when the physical topology differs from the logical topology, or when
   the MED attribute is used.  This is due to the limited path
   visibility when a single path is advertised and Route Reflection is
   used.  Increasing the path visibility by advertising multiple paths
   can help solve this issue.

   Path optimality: When a single path is advertised, border routers do
   not always receive the optimal path. As an example, Route Reflectors
   send a single path chosen based on their own IGP tie-break.
   Increasing path visibility would also help routers to learn the path
   that is best suited for them w.r.t. the IGP tie-break.

   Backup path optimality: Multiple paths advertisement gives routers
   the opportunity to have a backup path.  However, some backup paths
   are better than others.  Indeed, when a link failure occurs, if a
   router already knows its post-convergence path, the BGP reconvergence
   is straightforward and traffic is less impacted by the transient use
   of non-best forwarding paths.

   Convergence time: Advertising multiple paths in iBGP has an impact on
   the convergence time of the BGP system.  More paths need to be
   exchanged, but on the other hand, the routing information is
   propagated faster. With an increased path visibility, there is less
   path exploration during the convergence.  Also, with the availability
   of backup paths, convergence time in case of failure is also reduced.

   Depending on the application type, the number of paths to advertise
   for a prefix will vary. For example, for fast connectivity


Uttaro, et al.         Expires January 12, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-Add-Pathss-guidelines         Feb 2010


   restoration, only one additional path (in addition to the best path)
   will suffice to cater to all single point failures. For load
   balancing purposes, the number of paths will depend on the operator
   requirements and service level agreements (one to all). For route
   oscillation elimination, it is required to advertise all group-best
   paths for a prefix. Thus it is important to make a distinction on the
   application type per prefix or group of prefixes and apply the route
   policy on the Add-Paths advertiser accordingly. This is to make sure
   it does not degenerate to advertising all paths for all prefixes that
   would create unnecessary burden on the routers.

4.3.1. Path Selection Modes

   The path selection mode and any parameters applicable to the mode
   MUST be configurable per AFI/SAFI and per peer and SHOULD be
   configurable per prefix.

4.3.1.1. Advertise All Paths

   A simple rule for advertising multiple paths in iBGP is to simply
   advertise to iBGP peers all received paths, provided they pass export
   filters.  This solution is easy to implement, but the counter part is
   that all those paths need to be stored by all routers that receive
   them, which can be quite expensive.  If a path to a prefix P is
   advertised to N border routers, with a Full Mesh of iBGP sessions,
   all routers have N paths in their Adj-RIB-Ins.  If Route Reflection
   is used and each client is connected to 2 Route Reflectors, it may
   learn up to 2*N paths.

   This solution gives a perfect path visibility to all routers, thus
   limiting churn and losses of connectivity in case of failure. Indeed,
   this allows routers to select their optimal primary path, and to
   switch on their optimal backup path in case of failure.

   However, as more paths are exchanged, the number of BGP messages
   disseminated during the initial iBGP convergence can be high, and
   convergence may be slower.

   Routing oscillations are prevented with this rule, because a router
   won't need to withdraw a previously advertised path when its best
   path changes.

4.3.1.2. Advertise N Paths

   Another solution is for a router to advertise a maximum of N paths to
   iBGP peers.  Here, the computational cost is the selection of the N
   paths. Indeed, there must be a ranking of the paths in order to

   advertise the most interesting ones.  A way for a router to select N
   paths is to run N times its decision process. At each iteration of
   the process only those paths not selected during a previous iteration
   and not having a NEXT_HOP or BGP Identifier (or Originator ID) in
   common with the previously-selected paths are eligible for
   consideration. The memory cost is bounded: a router receives a
   maximum of N paths for each prefix from each peer. With N equal to 2,
   all routers know at least two paths and can provide local recovery in
   case of failure.  If multipath routing is to be deployed in the AS, N
   can be increased to provide more alternate paths to the routers.

   Path optimality and backup path optimality are not guaranteed, but as
   path diversity is better, the nexthops of the chosen primary and
   backup path are more likely to be closer to the router than with
   classical BGP.

   This solution helps to reduce routing oscillations, but not in all
   cases.  Indeed, path visibility is still constrained by the maximum
   number of paths, and configurations with routing oscillations still
   exist.

   If the advertising router (the RR) advertises N paths to peer_n and M
   paths to peer_m, and N < M, then all the paths advertised to peer_n
   must be included in the paths advertised to peer_m.  If these rules
   are not followed routing inconsistencies could occur. Note that it is
   valid to have a mix of Add-Paths capable and non Add-Paths capable
   peers and in that case, the non Add-Paths capable peers will receive
   only the best path.

4.3.1.3. Advertise All AS-Wide Best Paths

   Another choice is to advertise all paths with the same AS-wide
   preference [Basu-ibgp-osc], i.e. the paths that all routers would
   select based on the rules of the decision process that are not
   router-dependent (i.e.  Local-preference, ASPath length and MED
   rules).  Thus, for a given router, those paths only differ by the IGP
   cost to the nexthop or by the tie-breaking rules.

   The computational cost is reduced, as a router only has to send the
   paths remaining before applying the IGP tie-breaking rule.  However,
   it is difficult to predict how many paths will be stored, as it
   depends on the number of eBGP sessions on which this prefix is
   advertised with the best AS-wide preference.

   With this rule, the routing system is optimal: all routers can choose
   their best path (or best paths if multipath is used) based on their
   router-specific preferences, i.e. the IGP cost to the nexthop. Hot

   potato routing is respected.  Also, MED oscillations are prevented,
   because the path visibility among the AS-wide preferred paths is
   total.

   The existence of a backup path is not guaranteed. If only one path
   with the AS-wide best attributes exists, there is no backup path
   disseminated.  However, if such a path exists, it is optimal as it
   has the same AS-wide preference as the primary.

4.3.1.4. Advertise Neighbor-AS Group Best Path

   [walton-osc] proposes that a router groups its paths based on the
   neighbor AS from which it was learned, and to advertise the best path
   in each of those groups.

   The control plane stress induced by this solution is the computation
   of the per-neighbor path group, and the application of the decision
   process to each of them.  The Control-Plane load is bounded by the
   number of neighboring ASes advertising a prefix, which cannot be
   known a-priori.

   Path optimality and backup path optimality are not guaranteed, as the
   paths advertised are not all the AS-wide preferred paths. Backup path
   availability is not guaranteed.  Indeed, if only one AS advertises
   this prefix, even on multiple eBGP sessions, only one of the paths
   may be selected and advertised.

4.3.1.5. Best LocPref/Second Locpref

   This selection method consists in grouping the paths by Local
   Preference.  A router sends to its peers all paths with the highest
   Local Preference.  If there is only a single path with the highest
   Local Preference, it also sends all paths with the second best Local
   Preference.

   This method ensures that all routers know all paths with the best
   local preference.  As local preference are often related to the type
   of peering of the peer the path comes from, this ensures that in case
   of failure, routers have a backup path of equivalent quality.  This
   prevents for example that a router switches temporarily on a peer
   path while an alternate path from a customer is available but hidden
   at the border of the AS.  Such a situation could result in a
   temporary withdrawal of the prefix on some eBGP sessions when the
   router selects the path via the peer.

   The advertisement of the Second Local Preference occurs when there is
   no alternate path with the same quality as the best path.  This way,

   fast convergence is still ensured.  Backup path is optimal, as it has
   the second AS-Wide preference, which becomes the AS-wide best
   preference upon failure of the primary one.

   Sending all the paths with a given Local Preference also has a
   positive impact on routing optimality. Indeed, this allows border
   routers to have an increased path visibility and to choose their best
   path based on their own criteria.

   The computational cost of this solution is reduced when there are
   several paths with the best local preference.  In this case, it is
   sufficient to stop the decision process after the first rule to have
   the set of paths to be advertised.  When it is necessary to advertise
   the paths with second local-preference, the additional cost is to
   apply a second time the first rule of the decision process, which is
   still reasonable.  The memory cost depends on the number of paths
   with the best local preference.

4.3.1.6. Advertise Paths at decisive step - 1

   When the goal is to provide fast recovery by advertising candidate
   post-reconvergence paths, one can choose to stop the decision process
   just before the step where only one path remains.  If the decision
   process comes to IGP tie-break, all remaining paths are advertised.
   This way, routers advertise as many paths as possible with a quality
   as similar as possible.

   This path selection is an intermediary solution between the two
   preceding ones.  Here, instead of stopping the decision process at
   the local preference step or the IGP step, we stop it before the rule
   that removes the best potential backup paths.  This way, we minimize
   the number of paths to advertise while guaranteeing the presence of a
   backup path.  Primary and backup path optimality is ensured, as all
   paths with the same AS-wide preference as the best paths are included
   in the set of paths advertised.
