Abstract

   SIP is being used more an more today for everyday communication
   purposes.  With this widespread adoption comes the inevitability of
   abuse.  This document describes the problems that fit into the
   category of "unwanted Communication".

Terminology

1.  Introduction

   As worldwide communication infrastructure is shifting to IP the
   potential for disruption or abuse is increasing as well (see cost
   analysis brought down in [RFC5039]).  As such it is important to be
   able to assess the potential threat so that possible remedies can be
   sought.  It is important to stress, however, that this document and
   by extension this WG is not focusing ONLY on fraud or
   misrepresentation attacks such as those mentioned in [RFC5039]) but
   on all types of "unwanted" communications.

   Fortunately (or unfortunately) we have a large body of work already
   completed in other similar areas such as email and as such the
   guiding principles of this WG MUST be:

   What has been done right

   What has been done wrong

   What should have been done earlier


2.  Unwanted Communication

   So what constitutes Unwanted Communication?  Until now, most of the
   work that has been done in this area in the various IETF WGs has
   focused on the "misrepresentation" issue ([RFC5039]) suggesting
   strong Identity (e.g.  [RFC4474]) as the cornerstone of any solution.
   Lately, there has been a lot of discussion on the various lists
   trying to extend the identity protection (or better yet - give it
   some meaning) to e.164 numbers as well as sip URIs.

   Still, this is only one aspect of "Unwanted Communications" and
   focusing or solving only this issue (if at all possible) will clearly
   not eliminate SPAM.  As an example, one attack that is cropping up of
   late is a hybrid email VoIP attack which upgrades the age old
   phishing attack by replacing a compromised web server with a
   compromised PBX (or one set up just for this purpose) and includes an
   e.164 number in the email message that supposedly is sent by your
   bank instead of the traditional fake URL.  Since there is no "whois"
   equivalent for e.164 numbers there is no way today to combat this
   attack.  While not much can be done if the unsuspecting caller
   initiates the call from the PSTN, if the call is initiated using SIP,
   there may be some help we can provide.  But this help is contingent
   on us realizing that the problem scope is wider than we previously
   imagined.

   Following is an initial list of possible unwanted communication

   categories:

       Data Mining -       This category includes messaging whose sole
                           purpose is to mine for information.
                           Included in this category are things like:

                           * Number Harvesting
                           * SIP message trace routing
                           * SIP Proxy capability mapping

       Lack of policy -    This category deals with the non malicious
                           2AM or Japanese (to an English speaker)
                           communication.  Strong identity will not
                           prevent this sort of communication.

       Misrepresentation - The one we all like to hate. In this
                           category are included:

                           * Telemarketing
                           * Fraudulent access (e.g. voice mail)

                           Any application where access is based
                           on the signaling party phone number
                           falls into this category

       "underprivileged" - Malicious applications just trying to
                           gain a foothold on a remote computer fall
                           into this category. This class addresses
                           attacks that use IP communications as
                           a means rather than an end.

               Figure 1: Unwanted Communications Categories

   Each of these categories MUST be addressed if we are to truly tackle
   this issue.


3.  Data Mining

   As opposed to the URI namespace which is infinite, the e.164
   namespace which is in use for the majority of SIP voice calls today
   is quite finite.  As a result, it is quite trivial to gather or mine
   this information for use (individually or resale) in
   misrepresentation attacks.  Low volume SIP INVITE messages recording
   failures (e.g. 404 Not found) and successes (e.g. 183 Session
   Progress) are highly effective and relatively hard to defend against.
   These kind of attacks have been seen in the field both using SIP
   [RFC3261] as well as ENUM [RFC3761]

Internet-Draft            RUCUS Prob statement             February 2008


   Similarly, gathering network information using SIP messaging is
   relatively simple as well.  Manipulation of the Max-Forwards header
   as well as clever usage of other SIP headers or messages can expose
   much about an internal SIP network.


4.  Lack Of Policy

   Unwanted communication is subjective - not objective.  As such it is
   entirely possible for a legitimate call to be unwanted (even at the
   level of not having the phone ring and force me to answer) at its
   intended destination and it is completely reasonable to arm the
   receiving party with the ability to prevent this sort of occurance
   a-priori.


5.  Misrepresentation

   This category deals with propagation of trusted identity across trust
   boundaries and is covered in [RFC5039].


6.  Underprivileged Attacker

   This category reminds me of the slogan used in the 1992 US
   presidential elections:  "It's the economy stupid".  We sometimes get
   so caught up in what we do that we forget that its not always about
   attacking IP communications.  Very often the attack is just using the
   IP communication application as a trusted or privilaged application
   sitting on some server for gaining access to server.  This attack
   manifests itself in some of the more clever fuzzing attaks including
   things like SQL injections in fields such as "username" or "Call-ID".


7.  Regulatory

   It wouldn't be right to finish a document describing the RUCUS
   problem statement without raising the specter of regulatory
   involvement.  An incident which occurred in 1997 in which House
   Speaker Newt Gingrich's cellular telephone conversation was illegally
   intercepted, taped and published by the media prompted calls in
   Congress for stronger anti-eavesdropping legislation.  One can only
   imagine what unwanted communications to one of these legislatures
   will cause to IP communications.
