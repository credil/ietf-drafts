1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks are 
   constructed from Traffic Engineering (TE) links connecting Label 
   Switching Routers (LSRs). The TE links are constructed from a set of 
   data channels. In this context, a data channel corresponds to a 
   resource label in a non-packet technology (such as a timeslot or a 
   lambda).  

   A data channel status mismatch exists if the LSR at one end of a TE 
   link believes that the data channel is assigned to carry data, but 
 
 
Li                     Expires November 2009                 [Page 2] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-confirm-data-channel-status-04.txt            May 2009 
    

   the LSR at the other end does not. The term "ready to carry data" 
   means cross-connected or bound to an end-point for the receipt or 
   delivery of data. 

   Data channel mismatches cannot be detected from the TE information 
   advertised by the routing protocols [RFC4203], [RFC4205]. The 
   existence of some data channel mismatch problems may be detected by 
   a mismatch in the advertised bandwidths where bidirectional TE links 
   and bidirectional services are in use, but where unidirectional 
   services exist, or where multiple data channel mismatches occur, it 
   is not possible to detect such errors through the routing protocol-
   advertised TE information. In any case, there is no mechanism to 
   isolate the mismatches by determining which data channels are at 
   fault. 

   If a data channel mismatch exists, any attempt to use the data 
   channel for a new LSP will fail. One end of the TE link may attempt 
   to assign the TE link for use, but the other end will report the 
   data channel as unavailable when the control plane or management 
   plane attempts to assign it to an LSP. 

   Although such a situation can be resolved through the use of the 
   Acceptable Label Set object in GMPLS signaling [RFC3473], such a 
   procedure is inefficient since it may require an additional 
   signaling exchange for each LSP that is set up. When many LSPs are 
   to be set up, and when there are many data channel mismatches, such 
   inefficiencies become significant. It is desirable to avoid the 
   additional signaling overhead, and to report the problems to the 
   management plane so that they can be resolved to improve the 
   efficiency of LSP setup. 

   Correspondingly, such a mismatch situation may give rise to 
   misconnections in the data plane especially when LSPs are set up 
   using management plane operations. 

   Resources (data channels) that are in a mismatched state are often 
   described as "stranded resources". They are not in use for any LSP, 
   but they cannot be assigned for use by a new LSP because they appear 
   to be in use. Although it is theoretically possible for management 
   plane applications to audit all network resources to locate stranded 
   resources and to release them, this process is rarely performed 
   because of the difficulty of coordinating different Element 
   Management Systems (EMSs), and the associated risks of accidentally 
   releasing in-use resources. It is desirable to have a control plane 
   mechanism that detects and reports stranded resources.

   This document defines simple additions to the Link Management 
   Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] to provide a control plane tool that can 
   assist in the location of stranded resources by allowing adjacent 
   LSRs to confirm data channel statuses, and provides triggers for 
   notifying the management plane if any discrepancies are found. As LMP 
   is already used to verify data plane connectivity, it is considered 
   to be an appropriate candidate to support this feature. 

2. Problem Explanation 

   Examples of data channel mismatches are described in the following 
   three scenarios. 

   In all of the scenarios, the specific channel resource of a data link 
   will be unavailable because of the data channel status mismatch, and 
   this channel resource will be wasted. Furthermore, a data channel 
   status mismatch may reduce the possibility of successful LSP 
   establishment, because a data channel status mismatch may result in 
   failure when establishing an LSP.  

   So it is desirable to confirm the data channel statuses as early as 
   possible. 

2.1. Mismatch Caused by Manual Configuration 

   The operator may have configured a cross-connect at only one end of 
   a TE link using an EMS. The resource at one end of the data channel 
   is allocated, but the corresponding resource is still available at 
   the other end of the same data channel. In this case, the data 
   channel may appear to be available for use by the control plane when 
   viewed from one end of the TE link, but will be considered to be 
   unavailable by the other end of the TE link. Alternatively, the 
   available end of the data channel may be cross-connected by the 
   management plane and a misconnection may result from the fact that 
   the other end of the data channel is already cross-connected. 

   Figure 1 shows a data channel between nodes A and B. The resource at 
   A's end of the TE link is allocated through manual configuration, 
   while the resource at B's end of the TE link available, so the data 
   channel status is mismatched.

2.2. Mismatch Caused by LSP Deletion 

   The channel status of a data link may become mismatched during the 
   LSP deletion process. If the LSP deletion process is aborted in the 
   middle of the process (perhaps because of a temporary control plane 
   failure), the cross-connect at the upstream node may be removed while 
   the downstream node still keeps its cross-connect, if the LSP 
   deletion was initiated by the source node. 

   For example, in Figure 2 an LSP traverses nodes A, B, and C. Node B 
   resets abnormally when the LSP is being deleted. This results in the 
   cross-connects of node A and C being removed, but the cross-connect 
   of node B still being in use. So the data channel statuses between 
   nodes A and B, and between nodes B and C are both mismatched.

                       +-+-------+-+-------+-+          
                       | |       |X|       | |            
                       +-+-------+-+-------+-+     
                        A         B         C  
             Figure 2. Mismatch caused by LSP deletion  

   In [RFC2205] and [RFC3209], a soft state mechanism was defined to 
   prevent state discrepancies between LSRs. RSVP-TE restart processes 
   ([RFC3473], [RFC5063]) have been defined: adjacent LSRs may 
   resynchronize their control plane state to reinstate information 
   about LSPs that have persisted in the data plane. Both mechanisms aim 
   at keeping state consistency among nodes and allow LSRs to detect 
   mismatched data plane states. The data plane handling of such 
   mismatched state can be treated as a local policy decision. Some 
   deployments may decide to automatically clean up the data plane state 
   so it matches the control plane state, but others may choose to raise 
   an alert to the management plane and leave the data plane untouched 
   just in case it is in use. 

   In such cases, data channel mismatches may arise after restart and 
   might not be cleared up by the restart procedures. 

2.3. Failed Resources 

   Even if the situation is not common, it might happen that a 
   termination point of a TE-link is seen as failed by one end, while 
   on the other end it is seen as OK. This problem may arise due to

   some failure either in the hardware or in the status detection of 
   the termination point. 

   This mismatch in the termination point status can lead to failure 
   in case of bidirectional LSP set-up.

               Figure 3. Mismatch caused by resource failure 

   In this case upstream node chooses to use termination point A in 
   order to receive traffic from downstream node. From the upstream 
   node's point of view, the resource is available thus usable; however, 
   in the downstream node, the corresponding termination point (resource 
   B) is broken. This leads to a set-up failure. 

3. Motivation 

   The requirement does not come from a lack in GMPLS specifications 
   themselves but rather from operational concerns because, in most 
   cases, GMPLS-controlled networks will co-exist with legacy networks 
   and legacy procedures. 

   The protocol extensions defined in this document are intended to 
   detect data plane problems resulting from mis-use or mis-
   configurations triggered by user error, or resulting from failure to 
   clean up the data plane after control plane disconnection. It is 
   anticipated that human mistake is probably the major source of errors 
   to deal with. It is not the intention to provide a protocol mechanism 
   to deal with broken implementations. 

   The procedures defined in this document are designed to be operated 
   on a periodic or on-demand basis. It is NOT RECOMMENDED that the 
   procedures be used to provide a continuous and on-line monitoring 
   process. 

   As LMP is already used to verify data plane connectivity, it is 
   considered to be an appropriate candidate to support this feature.

4. Extensions to LMP 

   A control plane tool to detect and isolate data channel mismatches is 
   provided in this document by simple additions to the Link Management 
   Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204]. It can assist in the location of stranded 
   resources by allowing adjacent LSRs to confirm data channel statuses. 

   Outline procedures are described in this section. More detailed 
   procedures are found in Section 5. 

4.1. Confirm Data Channel Status Messages  

   Extensions to LMP to confirm a data channel status are described 
   below. In order to confirm a data channel status, the new LMP 
   messages are sent between adjacent nodes periodically or driven by 
   some event (such as an operator command, a configurable timer, or the 
   rejection of an LSP setup message because of an unavailable resource). 
   The new LMP messages run over the control channel, encapsulated in 
   UDP with an LMP port number and IP addressing as defined in Link 
   Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204]. 

   Three new messages are defined to check data channel status. Message 
   Type numbers are found in Section 7.1. 

   If the message is a Confirm Data Channel Status message, and the 
   Message_Id value is less than the largest Message_Id value previously 
   received from the sender for the specified TE link, then the message 
   SHOULD be treated as being out-of-order. 

4.1.1. ConfirmDataChannelStatus Messages 

   The ConfirmDataChannelStatus message is used to tell the remote end 
   of the data channel what the status of the local end of the data 
   channel is, and to ask the remote end to report its data channel. The 
   message may report on (and request information about) more than one 
   data channel. 

   <ConfirmDataChannelStatus Message> ::= <Common Header> 
                                          <LOCAL_LINK_ID> 
                                          <MESSAGE_ID> 
                                          <DATA_LINK>[<DATA_LINK>...] 
    
   When a node receives the ConfirmDataChannelStatus message, and the 
   data channel status confirmation procedure is supported at the node, 
   the node compares its own data channel statuses with all of the data 
   channel statuses sent by the remote end in the 
   ConfirmDataChannelStatus message. If a data channel status mismatch 
 
 
Li                     Expires November 2009                 [Page 7] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-confirm-data-channel-status-04.txt            May 2009 
    

   is found, this mismatch result is expected to be reported to the 
   management plane for further action. Management plane reporting 
   procedures and actions are outside the scope of this document. 

 
4.1.2. ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck Messages 

   The ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck message is sent back to the node 
   which originated the ConfirmDataChannelStatus message to return the 
   requested data channel statuses. 

   When the ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck message is received, the node 
   compares the received data channel statuses at the remote end with 
   those at the local end (the same operation as performed by the 
   receiver of the ConfirmDataChannelStatus message). If a data channel 
   status mismatch is found, the mismatch result is expected to be 
   reported to the management plane for further action. 

   <ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck Message> ::= <Common Header> 
                                             <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> 
                                             <DATA_LINK>[<DATA_LINK>...] 
    

   The contents of the MESSAGE_ID_ACK objects MUST be obtained from the 
   ConfirmDataChannelStatus message being acknowledged. 

   Note that the ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck message is used both when 
   the data channel statuses match and when they do not match. 

4.1.3. ConfirmDataChannelStatusNack Messages 

   When a node receives the ConfirmDataChannelStatus message, if the 
   data channel status confirmation procedure is not supported but the 
   message is recognized, a ConfirmDataChannelStatusNack message 
   containing an ERROR_CODE indicating "Channel Status Confirmation 
   Procedure not supported" MUST be sent. 

   If the data channel status confirmation procedure is supported, but 
   the node is unable to begin the procedure, a 
   ConfirmDataChannelStatusNack message containing an ERROR_CODE 
   indicating "Unwilling to Confirm" MUST be sent. If a 
   ConfirmDataChannelStatusNack message is received with such an 
   ERROR_CODE, the node which originated the ConfirmDataChannelStatus 
   message MAY schedule the ConfirmDataChannelStatus message 
   retransmission after a configured time. A default value of 10 minutes 
   is suggested for this timer.

4.2. Data Channel Status Subobject 

   A new Data Channel Status subobject type is introduced to the DATA 
   LINK object to hold the data channel status and Data Channel 
   Identification. 

   See Section 7.2 for the Subobject Type value.

   Data Channel Status: 

   This is a series of bit flags to indicate the status of the data 
   channel. The following values are defined. 

   0x0000 : The channel is available/free. 
   0x0001 : The channel is unavailable/in-use. 
    
   Data Channel ID 

   This identifies the data channel. The length of this field can be 
   deduced from the Length field in the subobject. Note that all 
   subobjects must be padded to a four byte boundary with trailing zeros. 
   If such padding is required, the Length field MUST indicate the 
   length of the subobject up to, but not including, the first byte of 
   padding. Thus, the amount of padding is deduced and not represented 
   in the Length field. 

   Note that the Data Channel ID is given in the context of the sender 
   of the ConfirmChannelStatus message.

   The data-channel ID must be encoded as a label value. Based on the 
   type of signal e.g. SONET/SDH, Lambda etc. the encoding methodology 
   used will be different. For SONET/SDH the label value is encoded as 
   per RFC4606. 

4.3. Message Construction 

   Data_Link Class is included in ConfirmDataChannelStatus and 
   ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck messages, which is defined in section 
   13.12 in [RFC4204]. 

   The status of the TE link end MUST be carried by the Data Channel 
   Status subobject which is defined in section 4.2 of this document. 
   The new subobject MUST be part of Data_Link Class. 

   In the case of SDH/SONET, DATA Channel ID in the new subobject SHOULD 
   be used to identify each timeslot of the data link. 

5. Procedures 

   The data channel status confirmation related LMP messages MAY be sent 
   between adjacent nodes which are triggered by timer periodically or 
   driven by some events to confirm the channel status for the data 
   links. It's a local police decision to start the data channel status 
   confirmation process. The procedure is described below: 

   . The SENDER constructs a ConfirmDataChannelStatus message which 
      MUST contain one or more DATA_LINK objects. DATA_LINK object is 
      defined in [RFC4204]. Each DATA_LINK object MUST contain one or 
      more Data Channel Status subobjects. The Data Channel ID field in 
      the Data Channel Status subobject MUST indicate which data channel 
      needs to be confirmed, and MUST report the data channel status at 
      the SENDER. The ConfirmDataChannelStatus message is sent to the 
      RECEIVER. 

   . The RECEIVER MUST extract the data channel statuses from the 
      ConfirmDataChannelStatus message, and SHOULD compare these with 
      its data channel statuses for the reported data channels. If a 
      data channel status mismatch is found, the mismatch result SHOULD 
      be reported to the management plane for further action. The 
      RECEIVER also SHOULD send the ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck message 
      which MUST carry all the local end statuses of the requested data 
      channels to the SENDER.

draft-ietf-ccamp-confirm-data-channel-status-04.txt            May 2009 
    

   . If the RECEIVER is not able to support or to begin the 
      confirmation procedure, the ConfirmDataChannelStatusNack message 
      MUST be responded with the ERROR_CODE which indicates the reason 
      of rejection. 

   . When the SENDER receives the response ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck 
      message, and MUST compare the received data channel statuses at 
      the remote end with the data channel statuses at the local end. If 
      a data channel status mismatch is found, the mismatch result 
      SHOULD be reported to the management plane for further action. 

   The data channel status mismatch issue identified by LMP may be 
   automatically resolved by RSVP restart. For example, the restarting 
   node may also have damaged its data plane. This leaves the data 
   channels mismatched. But RSVP restart will re-install the data plane 
   state in the restarting node. The issue may also be resolved via RSVP 
   soft state timeout. 

   If the ConfirmDataChannelStatus message is not recognized by the 
   RECEIVER, the RECEIVER ignores this message, and will not send out an 
   acknowledgment message to the SENDER. 

   Due to message loss problem, the SENDER may not be able to receive 
   the acknowledgment message. 

   ConfirmDataChannelStatus SHOULD be sent using LMP [RFC4204] reliable 
   transmission mechanisms. If after the retry limit is reached, a 
   ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck message or a ConfirmDataChannelStatusNack 
   message is not received by the SENDER, the SENDER SHOULD terminate 
   the data channel confirmation procedure. 

6. Security Considerations 

   [RFC4204] describes how LMP messages between peers can be secured, 
   and these measures are equally applicable to the new messages defined 
   in this document. 

   The operation of the procedures described in this document does not 
   of themselves constitute a security risk since they do not cause any 
   change in network state. It would be possible, if the messages were 
   intercepted or spoofed to cause bogus alerts in the management plane 
   and so the use of the LMP security measures are RECOMMENDED. 

   Note that operating the procedures described in this document may 
   provide a useful additional security measure to verify that data 
   channels have not been illicitly modified.

7. IANA Considerations 

7.1. LMP Message Types 

   IANA maintains the "Link Management Protocol (LMP)" registry which 
   has a subregistry called "LMP Message Type". IANA is requested to 
   make three new allocations from this registry as follows. The message 
   type values are suggested and to be confirmed by IANA. 

   Value    Description 
   ------   --------------------------------- 
     21     ConfirmDataChannelStatus 
     22     ConfirmDataChannelStatusAck 
     23     ConfirmDataChannelStatusNack 
    

7.2. LMP Data Link Object Subobject 

   IANA maintains the "Link Management Protocol (LMP)" registry which 
   has a subregistry called "LMP Object Class name space and Class type 
   (C-Type)". This subregistry has an entry for the DATA_LINK object, 
   and there is a further embedded registry called "DATA_LINK Sub-object 
   Class name space". IANA is requested to make the following allocation 
   from this embedded registry. The value shown is suggested and to be 
   confirmed by IANA. 

   Value    Description 
   ------   --------------------------------- 
     9      Data Channel Status
