1. Introduction 
    
   The SIP protocol, as defined in [RFC3261] and its extensions, 
   supports multiple means of resolving the connection information 
   necessary to deliver out-of-dialog SIP requests to their intended 
   targets.  When a SIP Proxy needs to send a request to a target 
   address-of-record (AoR) within its domain, it can use a location 
   service to resolve the Registered Contact URI, and potentially any 
   Path information attached to it per [RFC3327], to build a route set 
   to reach the target UA(s).  When a SIP UA or Proxy needs to send a 
   request to a target which is scoped in a domain for which it is not 
   authoritative, the UA/Proxy can use [RFC3263] procedures for using 
   DNS to resolve the next-hop connection information. 
    
   It is not uncommon, however, to use REGISTER requests to provide the 
   reachability information for such cases, even for AoR's and domains 
   outside of the local SIP domain.  This draft defines the behavior of 
   such a mechanism, coined "Domain Registration".

2. Definitions 
    
   For brevity's sake, this document uses the word "request" instead of 
   "out-of-dialog request", but in all cases means out-of-dialog 
   requests. 
 
   AoR: address-of-record, as defined by RFC 3261: a URI by which the 
   user is canonically known (e.g., on their business cards, in the 
   From header field of their requests, in the To header field of 
   REGISTER requests, etc.). 
    
   SIP Domain: An administrative domain for which the authority is 
   responsible for handling SIP application service of its AoR's, such 
   as providing voicemail and intra-Domain routing.  This may not 
   actually be a separate "Domain Name" in the DNS sense; it may just 
   be an IP Address. 
    
   Domain Name: An explicit identifier which defines a separate scope 
   of authority, following the syntax and semantics of DNS. 
    
   Domain Registration: providing SIP Domain reachability information 
   through REGISTER transactions. 
    
   Domain Resolution Table (DRT): a logical lookup table in the 
   Registrar, which is updated by REGISTER requests based on the 
   mechanism in this document, and used for request routing purposes to 
   reach the Registered SIP Domain in lieu of [RFC3263] procedures. 
    
   Reachability Information: a set of URI's identifying the host and 
   path of Proxies to reach that host; like any URI, these URI's may 
   identify the specific connection transport, IP Address, and port 
   information, or they may only identify FQDN's. 
    
   SSP: SIP Service Provider, as defined by [RFC5486]. 
    
3.   Introduction 
    
   In some environments, notably the Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) 
   market, SIP devices in the Enterprise are effectively IP-PBX's, 
   receiving Primary Rate Interface (PRI) type SIP trunk services from 
   a SIP Service Provider (SSP).  The SIP IP-PBX device is 
   authoritative for its local domain of AoR's. 
    
   Even if the IP-PBX has its own Domain Name, not every small business 
   owner has a DNS, or has the technical capability to provision DNS 
   entries (e.g., SRV's) appropriately in their DNS, or has the ability 
   to do so through any third party which hosts their domain name(s), 
   or has the wish to make their SIP device address known publicly.   
 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2010                 [Page 3] 
Internet-Draft         SIP Domain Registrations           October 2009 
 
 
    
   Furthermore, the SMB may not have its own Domain Name at all, and 
   instead merely has an IP Address. 
    
   Because a single SSP may support multiple thousands of such SMB IP-
   PBX's, it is impractical and cost-prohibitive to manually provision 
   their IP Addresses in every SIP node along the path which needs to 
   reach the SMB IP-PBX customer.  Instead, a dynamic reachability 
   mechanism is needed. 
    
   Such a mechanism already exists for SIP: the REGISTER transaction.  
   A REGISTER request transaction provides dynamic reachability 
   information for an AoR's authoritative domain. 
    
   Since a REGISTER request mechanism is generally supported by most 
   SIP Service Providers' equipment, it has become common practice for 
   small IP-PBX's to use the mechanism as a means of providing their 
   reachability information.  In some cases interoperability problems 
   have arisen, due to differing expectations and implementations of 
   how such a mechanism should work in practice.   
    
3.1. Benefits of using REGISTER 
    
   Using a REGISTER request transaction for providing reachability 
   information has several benefits: 
     . It alleviates the Enterprise from having a SIP signaling 
        address publicly viewable in DNS.  
     . It enables mechanisms that make the SIP device publicly 
        reachable even if a NAT exists between the device and the 
        Service Provider network. 
     . It avoids having to statically provision the path from the 
        Service Provider core through edge proxies per Enterprise, 
        because the Path header field can be used. 
     . It allows the SIP Service Provider to give the SIP device a 
        pre-loaded route set for subsequent requests, using the 
        Service-Route header field per [RFC3608]. 
     . It provides a periodic keep-alive mechanism, in order to detect 
        service outages, and service restoration. 
     . It is an existing SIP request method type, known to be 
        supported by most SIP devices. 
     . It is conceptually similar to the Registration behavior model 
        in RFC 3261. 
    
4.   Domain Registration Mechanism 
    
4.1. Overview of the Mechanism 
    
   In a Domain Registration model, the SIP UA (i.e., an IP-PBX) 
   Registers a single mutually agreed-upon Domain name; this Domain 
 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2010                 [Page 4] 
Internet-Draft         SIP Domain Registrations           October 2009 
 
 
   name might not be publicly useable or resolvable in DNS, and may 
   only exist for the purpose of this mechanism.   
    
   The SIP UA Registers the SIP Domain Name that it is authoritative 
   for, to a Registrar of another SIP Domain for which it is not 
   authoritative, such as that of a SIP Service Provider (SSP).  The 
   Contact URI it Registers, along with any Path header field 
   information, represents the reachability information used to route 
   subsequent requests from the SSP to the SIP UA, for the Registered 
   Domain Name. 
    
   Unlike typical SIP Registrations in [RFC3261], the Domain 
   Registration does not update a location service database for a SIP 
   AoR, but rather updates a logical Domain Resolution Table which 
   provides external Domain routing resolution - similar to a host 
   file.  This table is queried prior to DNS lookup procedures in 
   [RFC3263], and used in lieu of such DNS procedures if a matching 
   entry is found. 
    
   The SIP Domain Name being Registered MUST be globally unique.  If 
   there are multiple IP-PBX's of the same Enterprise Domain Name, each 
   one MUST Register a SIP URI having the same Domain Name, but with 
   unique user portions.  The Domain Name may be a subdomain of the 
   SSP's Domain Name, or it may be a completely separate Domain Name.  
   The Registered Domain Name itself is technically under the 
   Enterprise's authority. 
    
4.2. User Agent Behavior 
    
4.2.1     Generating the REGISTER Request 
    
   The target request-uri of the REGISTER request MUST be the Domain 
   Name of the SSP or a Registrar host name of the SSP, as allowed per 
   [RFC3261] section 10.2.6, which allows the Registrar address to be 
   in a separate Domain from the one being Registered. 
    
   The To and From URI's of the REGISTER request MUST contain the 
   Domain Name being Registered, in a SIP URI format.  The URI MUST 
   have a user portion, to uniquely identify the IP-PBX. 
    
   A SIPS URI MUST NOT be used for the To/From URI of the REGISTER.  
   This does not preclude using TLS for the entire path between the UA 
   and the Registrar, nor does it preclude using SIPS URI's for AoR's 
   of other SIP requests to or from the Registering SIP UA.  For a SIPS 
   scheme to be usable, the Domain Registration would have had to have 
   been sent over a transport which SIPS allows (e.g., TLS), but the 
   Domain Registration is registering reachability information for a 
   Domain and not for a particular AoR, and thus the URI being 

 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2010                 [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft         SIP Domain Registrations           October 2009 
 
 
   Registered does not limit the scheme which can be used to route 
   through it later. 
    
   The REGISTER request MUST contain one and only one Contact URI, 
   which MUST be the transport connection reachability address 
   information for reaching the UA.  If a UA/IP-PBX has multiple 
   connection paths it can be reached through (e.g., multiple 
   transports or multiple interfaces), each one MUST be Registered 
   separately, in separate REGISTER transactions with their individual 
   respective Contact URI's.   
    
   The Contact header field of the REGISTER request MAY contain a 'q' 
   q-value parameter to indicate a relative preference for this 
   particular reachability information, as defined in [RFC3261] section 
   20.10.  Note that only a single Contact URI is allowed in a single 
   REGISTER request based on this document's mechanism, and thus the q-
   value is relative to all REGISTERs for the same Domain Name.  The 
   default q-value, if not explicitly indicated, is 0.5. 
    
   The Contact header field MUST contain an 'expires' parameter, 
   indicating how long the Contact URI is valid, as defined in 
   [RFC3261]. 
    
   The procedures in [SIP-Outbound] SHOULD be followed, if both the SIP 
   UA and the SSP support Outbound.  Using Outbound procedures does not 
   change the fundamental behavior of the mechanism described in this 
   document; it only provides additional procedures and fields for 
   Registering multiple flows using identifiers, with specific keep-
   alive mechanisms and timers. 
    
   The REGISTER request MUST contain the new 'dreg' option-tag in a 
   Require header field.  This option-tag indicates the mechanism 
   identified in this document is being used to Register a SIP Domain.  
    
4.3. Registrar Behavior 
    
   This document uses a logical "Domain Resolution Table" (DRT) 
   residing in the Registrar, for the purpose of describing the 
   behavior of the mechanism in this document.  Specific 
   implementations need not follow this data structure, so long as they 
   maintain the same logical external behavior. 
    
   The DRT is indexed by the SIP Domain name being Registered, with one 
   or more result entries, one for each Registered Contact URI.  Each 
   entry identifies the route set necessary to reach the Registered 
   Domain, including the Contact URI and any Path header field 
   information per [RFC3327].  Each entry also identifies a q-value for 
   prioritizing among multiple entries for the same Domain name.

4.3.1     Processing the REGISTER Request 
    
   If a matching SIP Domain Name is found and the Contact URI being 
   Registered matches one already in the DRT, the REGISTER updates the 
   entry.  Note that other information in the REGISTER request such as 
   Path header field information, q-value, or expires value, may be 
   different and need to replace previously stored result values in the 
   DRT. 
    
   If a matching SIP Domain Name is found and the Contact URI being 
   Registered does not match any already in the DRT, the Registrar MUST 
   add the Contact URI as a new result entry.  Any received Path header 
   field information MUST be added as a route set in the DRT entry.  If 
   a q-value is received, it MUST be added as well, otherwise the 
   default q-value of 0.5 MUST be used. 
    
   Example DRT: 
   ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
   | Domain Name        |    Result    
   ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
   |example.org          | Contact-URI: sip:pbx-100@192.0.2.4:6000 
   |                     | Path-info: <empty> 
   |                     | Q-Value: 0.5

   |                     | Q-Value: 1.0 
   |                     | Expires: 3600 
   |                     |------------------------------------------ 
   |                     | Contact-URI: sip:admin@192.0.4.2:7000 
   |                     | Path-info: sip:p2.ssp.example.net;lr 
   |                     | Q-Value: 0.3 
   |                     | Expires: 3600 
   ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
    
    
4.3.2     Routing SIP Requests 
    
   If the SSP receives a SIP request containing a Request-URI that 
   identifies the Domain of the SIP UA/IP-PBX and not the SSP, then SSP 
   MUST NOT replace the Request-URI with the Registered Contact URI. 
    
   If the Request-URI identifies the Domain of the SSP and the request 
   is retargeted or local policy indicates the request belongs to the 
   Domain of the SIP UA/IP-PBX, then the request-URI's host portion 
   MUST be changed to the Domain Name of the UA/IP-PBX. 
    
 
 
Kaplan                   Expires - April 2010                 [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft         SIP Domain Registrations           October 2009 
 
 
   For example, if a UA such as "pbx.example.com" Registers itself to 
   "ssp.example.net", then the Request-URI of SIP requests sent to the 
   SSP with a domain portion of pbx.example.com will remain unchanged.  
   In practice, however, it is likely that SIP request sent to the SSP 
   will be based on phone numbers and have a domain portion of 
   ssp.example.net.  Since the SSP is authoritative for 
   ssp.example.net, it will change the domain portion of the Request-
   URI to be pbx.example.com. 
    
   When routing the request to the external SIP Domain, the local Proxy 
   performs a query to the Domain Resolution Table prior to performing 
   [RFC3263] procedures (before a NAPTR query), using the target SIP 
   Domain name for the lookup.  If a matching Domain Name with 
   reachability information is found, the entry is used in lieu of DNS 
   procedures.  Otherwise, if no matching entries are found, then 
   [RFC3263] procedures are followed. 
    
   If multiple matching entries are found, for example due to multiple 
   Registered Contact URI's for the same Domain Name, then the q-value 
   of each Registered Contact URI MUST be used to select the route set.  
   The highest q-value is selected first, and only if it fails is the 
   next highest one attempted, and so on. 
    
   If a matching entry is found, a Route header field(s) MUST be 
   inserted with the value of the Registered reachability information, 
   after any other Route header field values generated from local 
   policies.  Note this is any received Path URI's, and the entire 
   Registered Contact URI, including any userinfo portion, URI 
   parameters, and embedded headers.  As per [RFC3327], the created 
   Route header field values would be based on the Registered Path URI 
   list in received order, with the Registered Contact URI appended as 
   the last and final entry.  A loose-route 'lr' URI parameter MUST be 
   added to the Registered Contact URI when it is inserted in the Route 
   header field value.

5.   Examples 
    
   The following sections provide example cases of the mechanism 
   defined in this document.  Each example includes more than one 
   concept being shown at the same time.  The first example shows a 
   single Registrar-Proxy case, with the Enterprise's SIP Domain name 
   being unrelated to the Registered-to SSP's Domain name, an implicit 
   q-value, and an initial INVITE request targeted to the SSP's Domain 
   which is retargeted to the Enterprise's Domain.  The second example 
   shows a separate edge-Proxy before the Registrar, with the Path 
   header field mechanism being used, the Registered SIP Domain name 
   being a sub-domain of the SSP's Domain name, an explicit q-value, 
   and an initial INVITE request targeted to Enterprise's Domain. 
    
5.1. Example-1: Registrar only 
    
   As an example, assume the following scenario: 
    
      UA1----REG-----UA2 
    
   The node marked UA1 is the Registering IP-PBX of domain 
   "corp.example.com"; REG is a registrar and a proxy, and serves as 
   the authoritative proxy for ssp.example.net; and UA2 is another UA 
   trying to reach a user of UA1. 
    
   Note that some header fields (e.g., Content-Length) and session 
   descriptions are omitted to provide a shorter and hopefully more 
   readable presentation.

       REGISTRAR looks up name "+12125551212" and finds an entry for an 
   external domain "corp.example.com" belonging to UA1; subsequent 
   modified [RFC3263] location query for "corp.example.com" resolves to 
   a Registered Domain reachability information of: 
       Contact: <sip:pbx-100@192.0.2.4:6000> 
   REGISTRAR performs route set creation based on this document's

5.2. Example-2: Registrar with Proxy 
    
   As an example, assume the following scenario: 
    
      UA1----P1-----REG-----UA2 
    
   The node marked UA1 is the Registering IP-PBX; P1 is the SSP's edge 
   proxy; REG is a registrar and a proxy, and serves as the 
   authoritative proxy for ssp.example.net; and UA2 is another UA 
   trying to reach a user of UA1. 
    
   In this example, the Registering Domain is "corp.ssp.example.net", a 
   sub-domain of the SSP domain "ssp.example.net". 
    
   Note that some header fields (e.g. Content-Length) and session 
   descriptions are omitted to provide a shorter and hopefully more 
   readable presentation.

6.   Security Considerations 
    
   Performing SIP Registration for Domains has security implications 
   beyond those inherent in plain AoR Registrations.  With AoR 
   Registrations, the potential exists for illegitimate devices to 
   receive SIP requests for an AoR they are unauthorized to receive; 
   but with Domain Registration, a worst-case scenario would have an 
   illegitimate device receiving all requests for an entire Domain, 
   which is a far larger scope.   
    
   Furthermore, a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) need only be able to 
   intercept and modify the REGISTER request from the SIP UA to the SSP 
   in order to subsequently receive all SIP requests to the Domain.  A 
   Domain Registration is performed by a SIP UA sending a REGISTER 
   request to the SSP, which then causes all SIP Requests to follow the 
   Registered reachability information (Contact and Path), and thus 
   MitM interception in one direction easily enables interception in 
   the other.  For example, since the Path URI information is not, and 
   cannot be, authenticated by the SSP, all the MitM has to do is 
   insert a Path URI of itself in the REGISTER request, in order to 
   receive all requests in the other direction.  This is weaker than 
   previous SIP routing behavior using DNS, since the SSP would have 
   followed the DNS information, which could have been protected, or at 
   least required additional work for a MitM. 
    
   Therefore, it is strongly recommended that TLS be used between the 
   Registering SIP UA and its Registrar/Proxy, so that a MitM cannot 
   insert itself in the SIP Request routing path.

7.   Alternatives 
    
   [Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this "Alternatives" section prior 
   to publication] 
    
   There are no currently defined IETF-based alternatives this author 
   is aware of to perform dynamic reachability notification for the 
   scenarios described in this document, other than DNS Dynamic Update 
   (RFC 2136).  It is unknown if any vendors actually use DDNS Update 
   for this purpose, but many devices are known to use SIP REGISTER 
   transactions for a purpose very similar (but not identical) to the 
   one in this document.  There are several advantages to using SIP for 
   providing the reachability information, but it is beyond the scope 
   of this document to enumerate them. 
    
   Clearly DNS by means of [RFC3263] is assumed to be the "normal" way 
   of performing resolution of reachability information when a SIP 
   request crosses Domains, assuming they are of different Domain 
   Names.  However it is not clear if the market actually aligns with 
   that belief. 
    
   Some vendors use (and some people have argued for) other SIP method 
   transactions to perform the same thing, for example using an OPTIONS 
   request or even an out-of-dialog NOTIFY.  I believe the closest 
   semantic would actually be a PUBLISH request, to publish 
   reachability information. (Effectively the logical equivalent of 
   Dynamic-DNS Updates)  However, since REGISTER already has the 
   necessary semantic, and is widely supported, this author is not sure 
   what advantage using a different Method name really provides. 
    
8.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document requests IANA to reserve a SIP option tag named 
   "dreg", for the purposes described in this document.
