Abstract 
    
   It is highly desirable for VPN customers to be able to dynamically 
   establish their MPLS TE LSPs in the context of a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN. In 
   such a scenario, it is advantageous to use PCE to calculate customer 
   MPLS TE LSPs. This document defines PCEP extensions for BGP/MPLS IP-
   VPNs.

1. Introduction 
    
   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE)-based path computation model for Multi 
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) / Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this model, path 
   computation requests are issued by a PCC to PCE that may be composite 
   or external. In case the PCC and PCE are not composite, a 
   request/response communication protocol is required to carry the 
   request and return the response. The requirements for such a 
   communication protocol are described in [RFC4657]. The communication 
   protocol between PCC and PCE, and between PCEs, is defined in 
   [RFC5440]. 
    
   Service Providers have requirements to support PCE architecture for a 
   CE-CE MPLS TE LSP / a PE-PE MPLS TE LSP establishments in the context 
   of a BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. [E2E-RSVP-TE][PCE-VPN-REQ] In order to 
   establish a customer MPLS TE LSP over BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, PCEs need to 
   know the VPNv4/VPNv6 tail-end addresses or PCE addresses for this 
   tail-end address to forward to them, and finally need to calculate 
   the end-to-end customer MPLS TE LSP. [RFC5441] can be used as an 
   example of calculate methods for a customer MPLS TE LSP. Also, in 
   order to discover these PCEs in BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, [PCE-BGP-VPN] is 
   proposed. Note that it is assumed that PCE functions are included in 
   PE. In this way, it is advantageous to use PCEs to calculate customer 
   MPLS TE LSPs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. 
    
   This document defines new object types in END-POINTS object to 
   calculate the end-to-end customer MPLS TE LSP in the context of 
   BGP/IP-VPNs and describes a procedure of PCEP message including new 
   object types. The new object types are defined in section 4.1 and the 
   specific procedure is described in section 4.2.

2. Problem Statement 
    
   PCEs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs are shown in figure 1. Here, 
   we make the following set of assumptions. 
    
   1. VPN1 and VPN2 are completely different customers. 
   2. CE0 and CE4 are head-end routers. 
   3. CE3 and CE7 are tail-end routers. 
   4. A same address (e.g., 192.0.2.1) is assigned at CE3 and CE7.

             Figure 1 PCEs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs 
    
   Consider that customers in VPN1 and VPN2 establish a customer MPLS TE 
   LSP between their sites (i.e., between CE0 and CE3, between CE4 and 
   CE7) In this case, CE0 and CE4 send a PCReq message to PCE1 to 
   establish customer MPLS TE LSPs between CE0 and CE3, CE4 and CE7, 
   respectively. After receiving these messages, PE1 can identify each 
   PCReq message (i.e., a message for VPN1 and a message for VPN2) from 
   each incoming interface. Afterwards, PCE1 forwards the messages to 
   PCE2 by BGP discovery [PCE-BGP-VPN]. PE2, however, can not identify 
   each PCReq message from current specification of [RFC5440] (i.e., the

   message for VPN1 and the message for VPN2). Therefore, PCE2 can not 
   calculate an appropriate TE LSP between CEs per VPN. 
    
   Also, PCRep messages per VPN can not be identified at PCE1 due to the 
   above reason. 
    
   In order to distinguish between the VPN1 PCReq/PCRep messages and the 
   VPN2 PCReq/PCRep messages, an identifier in PCReq/PCRep messages is 
   required. 
    
   In this document, new object types in END-POINTS object as an 
   identifier are defined to distinguish PCReq messages per VPN in the 
   context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs.

   Two new Object-Types for VPN-IPv4 address and VPN-IPv6 address in 
   END-POINTS object described in [RFC5440] are defined.

4.2 Handling 
    
   It assumes that ingress PEs and egress PEs in the context of BGP/MPLS 
   IP-VPNs have PCE capabilities. It is considered that ingress PEs and 
   egress PEs are not PCEs (e.g., external PCE models). However, this 
   topic is for further study. 
    
4.2.1 PCReq message Processing at Ingress PE (PCE) 
    

 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.                                              [Page 5] 
            draft-kumaki-murai-pce-pcep-extension-l3vpn-04  October 2009 
 
 
   When an ingress PE (PCE) receives a PCReq message from a PCC/PCE, it 
   can distinguish a VRF instance that is associated with an incoming 
   interface. The ingress PE deals with a destination IPv4/IPv6 address 
   in END-POINTS object as a destination VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address in 
   the VRF instance. Afterwards, the destination VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 
   address is looked up in the context of VRF instance, and the BGP 
   next-hop for this destination is identified. The destination VPN-
   IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address in a new END-POINTS object consists of the 
   original destination IPv4/IPv6 address in END-POINTS object and the 
   Route Distinguisher (RD). Note that the RD is specified by the BGP 
   next-hop for the destination VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address. The source 
   VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address in the new END-POINTS object consists of 
   the original IPv4/IPv6 address in END-POINTS object and the RD. Note 
   that the RD is used by this ingress PE to advertise customer's prefix 
   including the source VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address into the vrf instance. 
   The ingress PE will send the PCReq message to next PCE (maybe an 
   egress PE for BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs) if it needs to send it. Finally, the 
   ingress PE should replace the incoming END-POINTS object from PCC/PCE 
   into the new END-POINTS object. 
    
    
4.2.2 PCReq message Processing at Egress PE (PCE) 
    
   When an egress PE (PCE) receives a PCReq message from an ingress 
   PE(PCE), it can distinguish a VRF instance from the destination VPN-
   IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address in the new END-POINTS object. The egress PE 
   will send a PCReq message to next PCE if it needs to send it. 
   Afterwards, the egress PE should remove the RD from the source and 
   the destination VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 addresses in the new END-POINTS 
   object received from the ingress PE. Finally, the source and the 
   destination addresses in the original END-POINTS object are IPv4/IPv6 
   ones. The egress PE should store the new END-POINTS object for a 
   PCReq message in a VRF instance. 
    
4.2.3 PCRep message Processing at Egress PE (PCE) 
    
   When an egress PE (PCE) receives a PCRep message for a PCReq message 
   from a previous PCE (i.e. CE), it can look up the new END-POINTS 
   object associated with the PCReq message for the PCRep message. 
   The egress PE performs a path computation. Note that the path 
   computation procedure itself is out of scope in this document. 
   Afterwards, the egress PE adds the new END-POINTS object in a PCRep 
   message and send it to an ingress PE. 
    
4.2.4 PCRep message Processing at Ingress PE (PCE) 
    
   When an ingress PE (PCE) receives a PCRep message for a PCReq message 
   from an egress PE (PCE), it can distinguish a VRF instance from the 
   source VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address in the new END-POINTS object. 
 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.                                              [Page 6] 
            draft-kumaki-murai-pce-pcep-extension-l3vpn-04  October 2009 
 
 
   Therefore, it is now possible to generate a PCRep message to send to 
   an appropriate PCC/PCE. 
    
5.  Security Considerations 
    
   This document defines PCEP extensions for BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. Hence the 
   security of the PCE extensions relies on the security of PCEP. 
    
   The security issues are described in the existing PCEP. [RFC5440] 
    
6.  IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA will assign END-POINTS Object-Types for VPN-IPv4 address and 
   VPN-IPv6 address.
