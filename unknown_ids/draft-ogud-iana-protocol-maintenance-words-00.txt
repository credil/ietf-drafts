   protocols, but there are certain deficiencies in using them when it
   comes to protocol maintainability.  Protocols are maintained by
   either updating the core specifications or via changes in protocol
   registries.

   For example, protocols often use external algorithms to to provide
   security functionality such as cryptography.  Cryptographic
   algorithms frequently have limited lifecyles as new algorithms are
   phased in to replace older algorithms.

   This document proposes standard terms to use in protocol registries
   and possibly in standards track documents to indicate the life cycle
   support of protocol features and operations.

Internet-Draft           Keywords IANA registry             October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The RFC series have been the main way to define Internet protocols.
   In the old days RFCxx00 contained a listing of all current protocol
   parameters that were needed, RFC 3232 [RFC3232] obsoleted the RFCxx00
   series and replaced them with on-line protocol registries maintained
   by IANA.  In many cases these registries are "write-once" i.e. new
   things are added; in other cases the requirements of a protocol
   implementation changes over time.  This document is aimed at the
   second case.

   This document is motivated by the experiences of the editors in
   trying to maintaining registries for DNS and DNSSEC.  For example,
   DNS defines a registry for hash algorithms used for a message
   authentication scheme called TSIG [RFC2845], the first entry in that
   registry was for HMAC-MD5.  The DNSEXT working group decided to try
   to decrease the number of algorithms listed in the registry and add a
   column to the registry listing the requirements level for each one.
   Upon reading that HMAC-MD5 was tagged as "OBSOLETE" a firestorm
   started.  It was interpreted as the DNS community making a statement
   on the status of HMAC-MD5 for all uses.  While the document was
   definitely overreaching in its specification, the point remained
   there was no standard way to tag different requirements levels in
   protocol registries.

   In the crypto community there has been some attempts to indicate
   emerging and retiring algorithms by adding + or - to RFC2119 words
   RFC4305 [RFC4305], SHOULD+ is to be interpreted as "SHOULD for now,
   expected to be MUST soon".  MUST- indicates that the currently
   required algorithm or feature might be retired sometime in the near
   future.

   In this document when we say "registry" we mean both "IANA registry"
   and possibly protocol specifying RFCs.

1.1.  Implementation vs. Operations requirements

   It is common that before a new technology is considered "useful" it
   has to gain widespread deployment.  Thus it makes sense to have
   different levels of RFC2119 words requirement on implementations than
   on operations.

   In a world of protocol maintenance when something is being 'retired'
   it is nice if operations can easily migrate to a newer functionality.
   This document includes certain extra requirements on implementations
   during the phase-out of a functionality.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Proposed requirement words for IANA protocol registries

   The words below are expected to be in a separate column in the
   Registries indicating what support implementations are expected to
   provide for each functionality.

3.1.  MANDATORY

   This is the strongest requirement and for an implementation to ignore
   it there MUST be a valid reason.

   Implementations:  To be considered compliant all implementations MUST
      support this registry entry.
   Operations:  To be considered compliant operations MUST use at least
      one of the mandatory entries.
   Note 1:  There can be more than one MANDATORY requirement.
   Note 2:  The requirement applies only to new or future
      implementations on the day the requirement is released.  In many
      cases existing implementations can become compliant via software
      upgrade or point release.

3.2.  OPTIONAL

   Implementations:  Any implementation MAY or MAY NOT support this
      entry in the protocol registry.  The presence or omission of this
      MUST NOT be used to judge implementations on standards compliance.
   Operations:  Any use of this in operation is supported, ignoring or
      rejecting requests using this protocol component MUST NOT be used
      as bases for asserting lack of compliance.
   Note 1:  Optional is taken to mean that the given functionality MAY
      or MAY NOT be supported by an implementation or a given
      operational MAY or MAY NOT be used.

3.3.  OBSOLETE

   Implementations:  New implementations SHOULD NOT support this
      functionality.

Internet-Draft           Keywords IANA registry             October 2009


   Operations:  Any use of this functionality in operation MUST be
      phased out.
   Note  This is the most dangerous term of the requirements words as it
      is easy to read too much into this term.  The intent is to express
      the following:
      *  This functionality is not needed/desired anymore by the given
         protocol.  This is not to say that this particular
         functionality should be obsoleted by other protocols that use
         the the same (or similar) functionality.

3.4.  ENCOURAGED

   This word is added to the registry entry when new functionality is
   added and before it is safe to rely solely on it.  Protocols that
   have the ability to negotiate capabilities MAY NOT need this state.

   Implementations:  This functionality SHOULD be supported by
      implementations.
   Operations:  This functionality SHOULD NOT be used in operations,
      except for testing.
   Note1:  In broadcast protocols like BGP and DNS there is no way for
      an originator of a message to know the capabilities of all
      recipients.  In these cases the requirement for support ought to
      be placed on implementations before the functionality is used in
      operations to guarantee maximum acceptance of the messages.
   Note2:  In some cases this requires having both "new" and "old"
      algorithms in use at the same time.  In this case the new
      functionality can be used before a high percentage of deployment
      of the new functionality has taken place.
   Note3:  In protocols that negotiate which functionality to use, there
      is no reason to place different requirement on operations other
      than list of accepted functionality SHOULD contain at least one
      MANDATORY functionality.

3.5.  DISCOURAGED

   This requirement is placed on functionality that is being phased out.

   Implementations:  Implementations MUST support this functionality,
      and SHOULD provide features to migrate to a MANDATORY
      functionality.  The use of this functionality SHOULD NOT be used
      as default behavior.
   Operations:  Operations SHOULD phase out any use of this
      functionality.

Internet-Draft           Keywords IANA registry             October 2009


   Note:  This is the strongest signal to the community that this
      functionality is no longer considered best practice.  Some time
      after the functionality enters this state, it will migrate to
      OBSOLETE.

3.6.  RESERVED

   Sometimes there is a need to reserve certain values to avoid problems
   such as values that have been used in implementations but were never
   formally registered.  In other cases reserved values are magic
   numbers that may be used in the future as escape valves if the number
   space becomes too small.

   Implementations:  Implementations MUST NOT use any RESERVED values
      for implementation specific processing.
   Operations:  MUST NOT be used, any implementation in use that uses
      this code SHOULD be upgraded/retired.

3.7.  AVAILABLE

   This is a value that can be allocated by IANA at any time.
   Implementations:  Implementations SHOULD NOT use these values for
      implementation specific processing.
   Operations:  Any implementation claiming to know the meaning of this
      unallocated code MUST NOT be used.


4.  Protocol Registry maintenance

   In theory the process to change the status of protocol field should
   be the same as reserving a new field.  In practice this is going to
   be burdensome, as there is a chance the IESG will have to process
   many documents that are simply saying "Value X in Registry Y is now
   Mandatory" (or similar).

   For this reason we propose that it be possible to make reservations
   and have a change in that reservation to take place at defined date
   in the future.  For example, a document could say:

      Value X in registry Y is "ENCOURAGED".  On June 1st 2020 this
      value is to become "MANDATORY".

   or Value X in registry Y is "DISCOURAGED".  On June 1st 2020 this
      value is to become "OBSOLETE".

Internet-Draft           Keywords IANA registry             October 2009



   or Value X in registry Y is "RESERVED" until June 1st 2020 when this
      value becomes "AVAILABLE".

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a set of terms to indicate the status of
   features in protocol implementations and operations.  It is not meant
   to be a discussion on feature or operation superiority or provide a
   means to measure the usefulness of a feature.  It is hoped that by
   extending the RFC2119 words to be more applicable for protocol
   maintenance over all security of the Internet is improved.


7.  IANA considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.
