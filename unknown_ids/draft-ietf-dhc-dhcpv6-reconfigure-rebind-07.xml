      <t>This document updates RFC 3315 to allow the Rebind message type to
      appear in the Reconfigure Message option of a Reconfigure message, which
      extends the Reconfigure message to allow a DHCPv6 server to cause a
      DHCPv6 client to send a Rebind message. The document also clarifies how
      a DHCPv6 client responds to a received Reconfigure message.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> allows a server to send an
      unsolicited Reconfigure message to a client. The client's response to a
      Reconfigure message, according to section 19 of RFC 3315 is either a
      Renew or an Information-Request message, depending on the contents of
      the msg-type field in the Reconfigure Message option of the Reconfigure
      message.</t>

      <t>If the client sends a Renew message, it includes a Server Identifier
      option in the Renew message to specify the server that should respond to
      the Renew message. Under some circumstances, it may be desirable for the
      client to communicate with a different server; for example, if the
      server that the client most recently communicated with is no longer
      available, the network administrator may want the client to communicate
      with a different server. This document expands the allowed values of the
      msg-type field to allow the server to indicate that the client is to
      send a Rebind message, which does not include a Server Identifier option
      and allows any server to respond to the client.</t>

      <t>RFC 3315 does not specify that a Reconfigure message must be sent
      from the server with which the client most recently communicated, and it
      does not specify which server the client should identify with a Server
      Identifier option when the client responds to the Reconfigure message.
      This document clarifies that the client should send a Renew message in
      response to a Reconfigure message with a Server Identifier option
      identifying the same server that the client would have identified if the
      client had sent the Renew message after expiration of T1.</t>

    <section title="Server Behavior">
      <t>This section updates specific text in sections 19.1, 19.2 and 19.3 of
      RFC 3315.</t>

      <t>The server MUST include a Reconfigure Message option (as defined in
      <xref target="format"></xref>) to select whether the client responds
      with a Renew message, a Rebind message or an Information-Request
      message.</t>

      <t>The Reconfigure message causes the client to initiate a Renew/Reply,
      a Rebind/Reply message exchange or an Information-request/Reply message
      exchange. The server interprets the receipt of a Renew, a Rebind or an
      Information-request message (whichever was specified in the original
      Reconfigure message) from the client as satisfying the Reconfigure
      message request.</t>

      <t>The server retransmits a Reconfigure message specifying a Rebind
      message in the same way as described in section 19.1.2 of RFC 3315.</t>

      <t>In response to a Rebind message, the server generates and sends a
      Reply message to the client as described in sections 18.2.4 and 18.2.8,
      including options for configuration parameters.</t>

      <t>The server MAY include options containing the IAs and new values for
      other configuration parameters in the Reply message, even if those IAs
      and parameters were not requested in the Renew message from the
      client.</t>

      <section title="Client Behavior">
        <t>This section updates specific text in section 19.4 of RFC 3315.</t>

        <t>Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure message, the client responds
        with a Renew message, a Rebind message or an Information-request
        message as indicated by the Reconfigure Message option (as defined in
        <xref target="format"></xref>). The client ignores the transaction-id
        field in the received Reconfigure message. While the transaction is in
        progress, the client silently discards any Reconfigure messages it
        receives.</t>

        <t>When responding to a Reconfigure, the client creates and sends the
        Rebind message in exactly the same manner as outlined in section
        18.1.4 of RFC 3315, with the exception that the client copies the
        Option Request option and any IA options from the Reconfigure message
        into the Rebind message.</t>

        <t>If a client is currently sending Rebind messages, as described in
        section 18.1.4 of RFC 3315, the client ignores any received
        Reconfigure messages.</t>

        <t>The client uses the same variables and retransmission algorithm as
        it does with Renew, Rebind or Information-request messages generated
        as part of a client-initiated configuration exchange. See sections
        18.1.3, 18.1.4 and 18.1.5 of RFC 3315 for details. If the client does
        not receive a response from the server by the end of the
        retransmission process, the client ignores and discards the
        Reconfigure message.</t>

    <section title="Clarification of section 19.4.2, RFC 3315">
      <t>When sending a Renew message in response to the receipt of a
      Reconfigure message, the client MUST include a Server Identifier option
      identifying the server the client most recently communicated with.</t>
