Internet-Draft    Multicast Addresses for Documentation        July 2011


1.  Introduction

   It is often useful in documentation, IETF documents, etc., to provide
   examples containing IP multicast addresses.  For documentation where
   examples of general purpose multicast addresses are needed, one
   should use multicast addresses that never will be assigned or in
   actual use.  There is a risk that addresses used in examples may
   accidentally be used.  It is then important that the same addresses
   are not used by other multicast applications or services.  It may
   also be beneficial to filter out such addresses from multicast
   signalling and multicast data sent to such addresses.

   For unicast there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses reserved for this
   purpose, see [RFC5737] and [RFC3849] respectively.  This document
   reserves multicast addresses for this purpose.

   There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
   numbers or unicast addresses.  For examples where such addresses are
   desired, one should derive them from the AS numbers and unicast
   addresses reserved for documentation purposes.  This document also
   discusses the use of these.

Internet-Draft    Multicast Addresses for Documentation        July 2011


2.  IPv4 multicast documentation addresses

   The type of multicast addresses most commonly used today, are
   addresses used for so-called ASM (Any-Source Multicast).  For ASM,
   the IPv4 multicast addresses allocated for documentation purposes are
   233.252.0.0 - 233.252.0.255 (233.252.0.0/24).

   Another type of multicast is SSM (Source-Specific Multicast).  For
   SSM it is less important which multicast addresses are used, since a
   host/application joins a channel identified by both source and group.
   Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast addresses
   reserved for documentation purposes, see [RFC5737].

   Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific type of address
   is desired.  E.g. for text about multicast scoping, one might want
   the examples to use addresses that are to be used for administrative
   scoping.  See below for guidance on how to construct specific types
   of example addresses.

2.1.  Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses

   Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses [RFC2365] are
   reserved for scoped multicast.  They can be used within a site or an
   organization.  Apart from a small set of scope relative addresses,
   these addresses are not assigned.  There are no specific scoped
   addresses available for documentation purposes.  Except for examples
   detailing the use of scoped multicast, one should avoid using them.

2.2.  GLOP multicast addresses

   GLOP [RFC3180] is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast group
   addresses from 16 bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP addresses
   are desired, the addresses should be derived from the AS numbers
   reserved for documentation use.  See [RFC5398].

2.3.  Unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses

   IPv4 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,
   see [RFC6034].  For examples where this type of addresses are
   desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
   reserved for documentation purposes, see [RFC5737].

3.  IPv6 multicast documentation addresses

   The type of multicast addresses most commonly used today, are
   addresses used for so-called ASM (Any-Source Multicast).  For ASM,
   the IPv6 multicast addresses allocated for documentation purposes are
   TBD.

   Another type of multicast is SSM (Source-Specific Multicast).  For
   SSM it is less important which multicast addresses are used, since a
   host/application joins a channel identified by both source and group.
   Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast addresses
   reserved for documentation purposes, see [RFC3849].

   Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific type of address
   is desired.  E.g. for text about multicast scoping, one might want
   the examples to use addresses that are to be used for administrative
   scoping.  See below for guidance on how to construct specific types
   of example addresses.

3.1.  Unicast prefix based IPv6 multicast addresses

   IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,
   see [RFC3306].  For examples where this type of addresses is desired,
   the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses reserved
   for documentation purposes, see [RFC3849].

3.2.  Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses

   There is a type of IPv6 multicast addresses called Embedded-RP
   addresses where the IPv6 address of a Rendezvous-Point is embedded
   inside the multicast address, see [RFC3956].  For examples where this
   type of addresses is desired, the addresses should be derived from
   the unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes, see see
   [RFC3849].

4.  Security Considerations

   The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes
   has no impact on security.

Appendix A.  Examples

   Usually addresses for documentation can simply be selected from the
   addresses reserved for such.  But as we discuss in this document,
   there are cases where one wants to use multicast addresses derived
   from AS numbers (GLOP) or from unicast addresses.  In this appendix
   we will just provide some examples for how such addresses can be
   derived.

A.1.  GLOP multicast addresses

   GLOP [RFC3180] is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast group
   addresses from 16 bit AS numbers.  The 16 bit AS numbers reserved for
   documentation use in [RFC5398] are 64496 - 64511.  By use of
   [RFC3180], we then get 16 /24 multicast prefixes for documentation
   use.  The first one 233.251.240.0/24, and the last 233.251.255.0/24.

A.2.  Unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses

   IPv4 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,
   see [RFC6034].  There are three unicast address ranges provided for
   documentation use in [RFC5737].  The ranges are 192.0.2.0/24,
   198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24.  Using [RFC6034] this leaves us
   with the unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses 234.192.0.2,
   234.198.51.100 and 234.203.0.113.

A.3.  Unicast prefix based IPv6 multicast addresses

   IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,
   see [RFC3306].  The IPv6 unicast prefix reserved for documentation
   purposes is 2001:DB8::/32, see [RFC3849].  This allows a wide range
   of different IPv6 multicast addresses.  Using just the base /32
   prefix, one get the IPv6 multicast prefixes FF3X:20:2001:DB8::/64,
   one for each available scope X. But also, from 2001:DB8::/32 one can
   pick say a /64 prefix 2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/64 which gives us the
   multicast prefixes FF3X:40:2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/96, one for each
   available scope X.

A.4.  Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses

   For Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses, the the IPv6 address of a
   Rendezvous-Point is embedded inside the multicast address, see
   [RFC3956].  For documentation purposes, the RP address can be any
   address from the range 2001:DB8::/32, see [RFC3849], that follows the
   constraints specified in [RFC3956].  One example address could be
   2001:DB8::1.  The embedded-RP multicast prefixes might then be FF7X:
   120:2001:DB8::/96.  Another example could be the RP address 2001:DB8:
   BEEF:FEED::7 which gives the prefixes FF7X:740:2001:DB8:BEEF:
