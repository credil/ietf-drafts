Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes the metadata model as
   viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS).

1.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document focuses on the Recording metadata
   which describes the communication session.  The document describes a
   metadata model as viewed by Session Recording Server, the
   requirements for which are described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-req] and the
   architecture for which is described in
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs."


3.  Metadata Model

   Metadata is the data that describes the communication session.  Below
   diagram shows a model for Metadata as viewed by Session Recording
   Server (SRS).

   The mechanism MUST provide a means to convey every attribute
   mentioned in the metamodel.  The Session Recording Client (SRC) MAY
   initiate the Recording Session.  It should be noted that the
   Recording Session is a completely independent from the Communication
   Session that is being recorded at both the SIP dialog level and at
   the session level.  The metadata MUST be conveyed from SRC to SRS.
   The metadata MAY be conveyed in Recording Session Dialog.

   Note that the metadata model captures changes that occur over the
   duration of the recording session.  For example, if the call is
   transferred from one participant to another, then the SRC SHALL

   convey a change of participant and the properties of the new media
   stream to the SRS.

   Some of the data in the model may not be conveyed explicitly from the
   SRC to the SRS, if it can be obtained contextually by the SRS.  For
   instance, the timing of changes may not explicitly conveyed from the
   SRC to the SRC, because the mechanism (yet to be defined) which
   conveys the metadata may implicitly provide the timing.  (E.g. the
   time a change occurred by be assumed to be the same as the time when
   notification of the change is received by the SRS.)


4.  Recording Metadata elements

   This section describes the different elements and its attributes of
   the metadata model shown above.  This section also describes in brief
   on how the different elements of metadata are associated.

   A Recording Session element represents one instance of a Recording
   Session.

4.1.1.  Attributes

   A Recording Session element MAY have attributes like:
   o  Recording requestor ID(which could be SRS or SRC).
   o  Recording type - This attribute indicates whether the recording
      session is selective or persistent.

   One instance of Recording Session SHALL have:

   o  Zero or more instances of Communication Session Group.This is to
      accommodate persistent recording cases.

    Communication Session (CS)


   A Communication Session Group provides association or linking of
   Communication Sessions.

4.2.1.  Attributes

   A CS Group MUST have a Unique-ID attribute.  SRC (or MAY be SRS) MUST
   ensure the uniqueness of Unique-ID in case multiple SRC interacts
   with the same SRS.  The mechanism by which SRC creates this unique-ID
   and ensures its uniqueness is outside the scope of SIPREC.

   NOTE: Need more clarity/use cases on how the unique-ID SHALL be used

4.2.2.  Associations

   A communication Session Group SHALL be associated with RS and CS in
   the following manner:

   o  There can be one or more Recording Session elements per
      Communication Session Group.
   o  Each Communication Session Group MUST be associated with one or
      more RS [ setup by the same SRC]
   o  There MAY be one or more Communication Sessions per CS Group [e.g.
      Consult Transfer]
   o  Each CS MUST be associated to one CS-Group

   Participant              Media Stream



   A Communication Session block/element in the metadata model
   represents Communication Session and its properties needed as seen by
   SRC.

4.3.1.  Attributes

   A communication Session block SHALL have the following attributes:

   o  Call Termination Reason - This represents the reason why a CS was
      terminated.  This MAY be derived from SIP Reason header of CS.
      call termination reason MUST be optional and MAY be included in
      metadata after the call is terminated.

   NOTE: Attributes like Retention (represent the value/duration for
   which Media streams of the CS needs to be retained), Access
   Information e.t.c that are primarily related to policy will not be

   passed in metadata from SRC to SRS.  However if there are
   implementations where SRC has enough information, this could be sent
   as App Data attached to CS

4.3.2.  Associations

   A Communication Session SHALL be associated to CS-Group,Participant
   and Media Stream.  Cardinalities between CS and Participant allows:

   o  CS to have atleast two or more participants
   o  Participant may be associated with zero or more CS's (It is
      possible, though unlikely, that there are participants who are not
      part of any CS).  An example of such a case is participants in a
      premixed media stream.  The SRC may have knowledge of such
      Participants, yet not have any signaling relationship with them.
      This might arise if one participant in CS is a conf focus.
      Another use case is if one UA in CS works in 3pcc mode to acquire
      an MoH media stream, this might be reflected as unique source for
      media stream without having a reported signaling relationship to
      it.
   o  The model also allows participants in CS that are not participants
      in the media.  An example is the identity of a 3pcc controller
      that has initiated a CS to two or more participants of the CS.
      Another example is the identity of a conference focus.  Of course
      a focus is probably in the media, but since it may only be there
      as a mixer, it may not report itself as a participant in any of
      the media streams.

   Cardinalities between CS and Media Stream allows:

   o  A CS to have zero or more Streams
   o  A stream can be associated with 1 or more CS.  An example is
      multicast MoH stream which might be associated with many CSs.
      Also if we were to consider a B2BUA to have a separate CS on each
      "side" then they might share a stream.(Though more likely this
      would be treated as a single CS.)

      [ e.g.  P-Asserted-ID which can have both SIP and TEL URIs]
   o  Name - This attribute represents Participant name(SIP display
      name) or DN number ( in case it is known)
   o  Participant Type - This attribute can have values as "internal" or
      "external" or "don't know" (in cases where it is not possible to
      determine).

   OPEN ITEM: Need to conclude on what other attributes [ like
   Participant Role ] are needed to be represented in the model

4.4.2.  Associations

   Cardinalities between participant and Media Stream allows:

   o  Participant to receives zero or more media streams
   o  Participant to send zero or more media streams.  (Same participant
      provides multiple streams e.g. audio and video)
   o  Media stream to be received by zero or more participants.  Its
      possible, though perhaps unlikely, that a stream is generated but
      sent only to the SRC and SRS, not to any participant.  E.g.  In

      conferencing where all participants are on hold and the SRC is
      collocated with the focus.  Also a media stream may be received by
      multiple participants (e.g.  Whisper calls, side conversations).
   o  Media stream to be sent by one or more participants (pre-mixed
      streams).

   NOTE: Example of a case where a participant may receive Zero or more
   streams - a Supervisor may have side conversation with Agent, while
   Agent converses with customer.

   A Media Stream block shall have properties of media as seen by SRC
   and sent to SRS.  Different instances of Media Stream block would be
   created whenever there is a change in media (e.g. dir change like
   pause/resume and/or codec change and/or participant change.).

4.5.1.  Attributes

   A Media Stream block SHALL have the following attributes:

   o  Start Time - Represents Media Start time at SRC.
   o  End Time - Represents Media End time at SRC.  This is an optional
      attribute and MAY be included after a stream ends
   o  Codec params - represents codec parameters of the CS media
   o  Media Stream Reference - In implementations this can reference to
      m-line

   OPEN ITEM: Is it required to model media streams that are not
   recorded[ e.g SRC offered certain media types but SRS choose to
   accept only subset of them] ?

4.5.2.  Associations

   A Media Stream SHALL be associated with Participant and CS.  The
   details of association with the Participant are described in the
   Participant block section.  The details of association with CS is
   mentioned in the CS section.

4.6.  Application Data

   A recording metadata object MAY have a opaque application data.  This
   opaque data is intended to be used by vendor specific applications on
   SRS.


5.  Metadata Model Object Instances

   This section describes the metadata model object instances for
   different use cases of SIPREC.  For the sake of simplicity as the
   media streams sent by each of the participants is received by every
   other participant in these use cases, it is NOT shown in the object
   instance diagrams below.

5.1.  Use case 1: Basic Call

   Basic call between two Participants A and B. In this use case each
   participant sends one Media Stream.

6.  Security Considerations

   The metadata information sent from SRC to SRS MAY reveal sensitive
   Information about different participants of CS.  For this reason, it
   is RECOMMENDED that a SRC use a strong means for authentication and
   metadata information protection and that it apply comprehensive
   authorization rules when using the metadata model defined in this
   document.  The following sections will discuss each of these aspects
   in more detail.

6.1.  Connection Security

   It is RECOMMENDED that a SRC authenticate SRS using the normal SIP
   authentication mechanisms, such as Digest as defined in Section 22 of

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata             January 2011


   [RFC3261].  The mechanism used for conveying the metadata information
   MUST ensure integrity and SHOULD ensure confidentially of the
   information.  In order to achieve these, an end-to-end SIP encryption
   mechanism, such as S/MIME described in [RFC3261], SHOULD be used.

   If a strong end-to-end security means (such as above) is not
   available, it is RECOMMENDED that a SRC use mutual hop-by-hop
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication and encryption
   mechanisms described in "SIPS URI Scheme" and "Interdomain Requests"
   of [RFC3261].
