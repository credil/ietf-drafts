Abstract 

   This memo describes a method for decoding order recovery of the 
   Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units carried in multiple session-
   multiplexed RTP sessions for Scalable Video Coding (SVC), which is 
   defined in Annex G of the ITU-T Recommendation H.264 video codec that 
   is technically identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International 
   Standard 14496-10.  The method applies when non-interleaved 
   transmission of NAL units using the Single NAL Unit packetization 
   mode or the Non-Interleaved packetization mode defined in RFC 3984 is 
   in use.

6.5. Packetization Modes 

   Section 5.4 of RFC 3984 applies when session multiplexing is not in 
   use.  The packetization modes specified in Section 5.4 of RFC 3984 
   are also referred to as session-specific packetization modes. 

   When session multiplexing is in use, the following applies in 
   addition. 

6.5.1. Packetization Modes for Session Multiplexing 

   This memo specifies two cases of session-multiplexing packetization 
   modes when session multiplexing is in use: 

   o  Non-interleaved AU-DON (NI-A) mode 

   o  Interleaved CS-DON (I-C) mode 

   The NI-A mode is targeted for systems that require relatively low 
   end-to-end latency, e.g. conversational systems.  In the NI-A mode, 
   NAL units in each RTP session are transmitted in NAL unit decoding 
   order.  The I-C mode is targeted for systems that do not require very 
   low end-to-end latency.  The I-C mode allows transmission of NAL 
   units out of NAL unit decoding order in each RTP session. 

   The session-multiplexing packetization mode in use MAY be signaled by 
   the value of the OPTIONAL session-multiplexing-packetization-mode 
   media type parameter or by external means.  When the value of 
   session-multiplexing-packetization-mode is equal to 0, the NI-A mode 
   MUST be used.  When the value of session-multiplexing-packetization-
   mode is equal to 1, the I-C mode MUST be used.  [Ed.Note(YkW): There 
   MAY be at most one global session-multiplexing-packetization-mode 
   present in the SDP common for all the multiplexed RTP sessions.  It 
   is also possible to have session-multiplexing-packetization-mode 
   session-specific in the SDP, but then all the multiplexed sessions 
   MUST have the same value of this parameter.  When session-
   multiplexing-packetization-mode is not present, the NI-A mode is 
   implied.] 

   The used session-multiplexing packetization mode governs which 
   session-specific packetization modes are allowed in the multiplexed 
   RTP sessions, which in turn govern which NAL unit types are allowed 
   as RTP payloads. 

   Table 3.1 summarizes the allowed session-specific packetization modes 
   for the NI-A session-multiplexing packetizatio modes.  Table 3.2

   are reserved for future extensions.  NAL units of those types SHOULD 
   NOT be sent by a sender and MUST be ignored by a receiver.  Note that 
   NAL unit type 30 and 31 are indicated as undefined in RFC 3984, 
   therefore RFC 3984 receivers MUST ignore NAL units of this type, if 
   present.

6.6. Decoding Order Number (DON) 

   Section 5.5 of [RFC3984] applies when session multiplexing is not in 
   use. 

   When session multiplexing is in use, the following applies in 
   addition. 

6.6.1. Access Unit DON (AU-DON) for Session Multiplexing 

   When the NI-A session-multiplexing packetization mode is in use, the 
   packetization of each session MUST be as specified in Section 7.1., 
   and the following applies for the derivation of the AU-DON value for 
   each non-PACSI NAL unit. 

   The AU-DON value for all NAL units having the same NALU time is 
   identical and MUST be conveyed in at least one PACSI NAL unit. 

6.6.2. Cross-Session DON (CS-DON) for Session Multiplexing 

   When the I-C session-multiplexing packetization mode is in use, the 
   DON values derived according to RFC 3984 of all the NAL units in each 
   of the multiplexed RTP sessions MUST indicate CS-DON values. 

6.7. Aggregation Packets 

   Section 6.7 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

6.8. Fragmentation Units (FUs) 

   Section 6.8 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

6.9. Payload Content Scalability Information (PACSI) NAL Unit 

   Section 6.9 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies with the following 
   modifications. 

   The name of the DONC field is changed to AU-DON. 

   The semantics of DONC are removed. 

   The occurrences of "DONC" are replaced with "AU-DON". 

   The semantics of AU-DON are specified as follows.

   o  When present, the field AU-DON indicates the access unit decoding 
      order number for all the NAL units in the aggregation packet (when 
      the PACSI NAL unit is included in an aggregation packet) or the 
      AU-DON of the next non-PACSI NAL unit in transmission order (when 
      the PACSI NAL unit is included in a single NAL unit packet). 

7. Packetization Rules 

   Section 7 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

7.1. Packetization Rules for Session Multiplexing 

   When session multiplexing is used, decoding order recovery for NAL 
   units carried in all the multiplexed RTP sessions is needed.  The 
   following packetization rules ensure that decoding order of NAL units 
   carried in the multiplexed sessions can be correctly recovered for 
   each of the session-multiplexing packetization modes according to the 
   de-packetization process specified in Section 8.1. . 

7.1.1. NI-A Session-Multiplexing Packetization Rules 

   When the NI-A session-multiplexing packetization mode is in use, the 
   following applies. 

   o  For each single NAL unit packet containing a non-PACSI NAL unit, 
      if present, the previous packet MUST have the same RTP timestamp 
      as the single NAL unit packet, and the following applies. 

         If the NALU time of the non-PACSI NAL unit is not equal to the 
          NALU time of the previous non-PACSI NAL unit in decoding 
          order, the previous packet MUST contain a PACSI NAL unit 
          containing the AU-DON field; 

         Otherwise (the NALU time of the non-PACSI NAL unit is equal to 
          the NALU time of the previous non-PACSI NAL unit in decoding 
          order), the previous packet MAY contain a PACSI NAL unit 
          containing the AU-DON field. 

   o  For each STAP-A packet, if present, if the RTP timestamp is 
      different from the RTP timestamp of the previous STAP-A packet, 
      the first NAL unit in the STAP-A packet MUST be a PACSI NAL unit 
      containing the AU-DON field. 

   o  For each FU-A packet, if present, the previous packet MUST have 
      the same RTP timestamp as the FU-A packet, and the following 
      applies.

         If the FU-A packet is the start of the fragmented NAL unit, the 
          following applies; 

              If the NALU time of the fragmented NAL unit is not equal 
               to the NALU time of the previous non-PACSI NAL unit in 
               decoding order, the previous packet MUST contain a PACSI 
               NAL unit containing the AU-DON field; 

              Otherwise (the NALU time of the fragmented NAL unit is 
               equal to the NALU time of the previous non-PACSI NAL unit 
               in decoding order), the previous packet MAY contain a 
               PACSI NAL unit containing the AU-DON field. 

   o  For each single NAL unit packet containing a PACSI NAL unit, if 
      present, the PACSI NAL unit MUST contain the AU-DON field. 

7.1.2. I-C Session-Multiplexing Packetization Rules 

   Section 7.1.2 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

7.1.3. Packetization rules for non-VCL NAL units 

   Section 7.1.3 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

7.1.4. Packetization rules for Prefix NAL units 

   Section 7.1.4 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

8. De-Packetization Process 

   Section 8 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

8.1. De-Packetization Process for Session Multiplexing 

   Section 8.1 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies. 

8.1.1. Decoding Order Recovery for the NI-A Mode 

   The following process SHALL be applied when the NI-A session-
   multiplexing packetization mode is in use. 

   The RTP packets output from the RTP-level reception processing for 
   each session are placed into the de-session-multiplexing buffer. 

   It is RECOMMENDED to set the size of the de-session-multiplexing 
   buffer, in terms of number of bytes, equal to or greater than the

   value of the sprop-desemul-buf-req media type parameter of the 
   highest RTP session the receiver receives. 

   The AU-DON value is inferred and stored for each NAL unit. 

   The receiver operation is described below with the help of the 
   following functions and constants: 

   o  Function AbsDON is specified in Section 8.1 of RFC 3984. 

   o  Function don_diff is specified in Section 5.5 of RFC 3984. 

   o  Constant N is the value of the OPTIONAL sprop-session-
      multiplexing-depth media type parameter of the highest RTP session 
      incremented by 1. 

   Initial buffering lasts until one of the following conditions is 
   fulfilled: 

   o  There are N or more VCL NAL units in the de-session-multiplexing 
      buffer. 

   o  If sprop-semul-max-don-diff of the highest SVC RTP session is 
      present, don_diff(m,n) is greater than the value of sprop-semul-
      max-don-diff of the highest RTP session, in which n corresponds to 
      the NAL unit having the greatest value of AbsDON among the 
      received NAL units and m corresponds to the NAL unit having the 
      smallest value of AbsDON among the received NAL units. 

   o  Initial buffering has lasted for the duration equal to or greater 
      than the value of the OPTIONAL sprop-desemul-init-buf-time media 
      type parameter of the highest SVC RTP session. 

   The NAL units to be removed from the de-session-multiplexing buffer 
   are determined as follows: 

   o  If the de-session-multiplexing buffer contains at least N VCL NAL 
      units, NAL units are removed from the de-session-multiplexing 
      buffer and passed to the decoder in the order specified below 
      until the buffer contains N-1 or fewer VCL NAL units.

   o  If sprop-semul-max-don-diff of the highest SVC RTP session is 
      present, all NAL units m for which don_diff(m,n) is greater than 
      sprop-max-don-diff of the highest RTP session are removed from the 
      de-session-multiplexing buffer and passed to the decoder in the 
      order specified below.  Herein, n corresponds to the NAL unit 
      having the greatest value of AbsDON among the NAL units in the de-
      session-multiplexing buffer. 

   The order in which NAL units are passed to the decoder is specified 
   as follows: 

   o  Let PDON be a variable that is initialized to 0 at the beginning 
      of the RTP sessions. 

   o  For each NAL unit associated with a value of AU-DON, an AU-DON 
      distance is calculated as follows.  If the value of AU-DON of the 
      NAL unit is greater than the value of PDON, the AU-DON distance is 
      equal to AU-DON - PDON.  Otherwise, the AU-DON distance is equal 
      to 65535 - PDON + AU-DON + 1. 

   o  NAL units are delivered to the decoder in ascending order of AU-
      DON distance.  If several NAL units share the same value of AU-DON 
      distance, the following applies. 

         An initial NAL unit order for an access unit is formed 
          starting from the base session and proceeding to the highest 
          session in the session dependency order specified according to 
          [I-D.ietf-mmusic-decoding-dependency].  Within a session, NAL 
          units sharing the same value of AU-DON are ordered into the 
          initial NAL unit order for the access unit in their 
          transmission order. 

         A NAL unit decoding order for the access unit is derived from 
          the initial NAL unit order for the access unit by reordering 
          SEI NAL units conveyed in a non-base session and not included 
          PACSI NAL units as specified for the NAL unit decoding order 
          in [SVC]. 

         NAL units are passed to the decoder in the NAL unit decoding 
          order for the access unit. 

   o  When a desired number of NAL units have been passed to the 
      decoder, the value of PDON is set to the value of AU-DON for the 
      last NAL unit passed to the decoder.

9.1. Media Type Registration 

   Section 9.1 of draft-ietf-avt-rtp-svc-10 applies with the following 
   modifications. 

      session-multiplexing-packetization-mode: 
         This parameter MUST be present when the current RTP depends 
         one or more other RTP sessions. 

         This parameter signals the properties of a NAL unit stream 
         carried in more than one RTP session using session 
         multiplexing or the capabilities of a receiver implementation.  
         When the value of session-multiplexing-packetization-mode is 
         equal to 0, the NI-A mode MUST be used.  When the value of 
         session-multiplexing-packetization-mode is equal to 1, the I-C 
         mode MUST be used.  The value of session-multiplexing-
         packetization-mode MUST be an integer in the range of 0 to 1, 
         inclusive. 

      sprop-session-multiplexing-depth: 
         This parameter MUST be present when the current RTP depends 
         one or more other RTP sessions. 

         This parameter signals the properties of a NAL unit stream 
         carried in the current RTP session and the RTP sessions the 
         current RTP session depends on.  It is guaranteed that 
         receivers can reconstruct NAL unit decoding order as specified 
         in section 8.1.  of this memo when the de-session-multiplexing 
         buffer size is at least the value of sprop-session-
         multiplexing-depth + 1 in terms of VCL NAL units. 

         The value of sprop-session-multiplexing-depth MUST be an 
         integer in the range of 0 to 32767, inclusive.

      sprop-desemul-buf-req: 
         This parameter MUST be present when the current RTP depends 
         one or more other RTP sessions. 

         sprop-desemul-buf-req signals the required size of the de-
         session-multiplexing buffer for the NAL unit stream carried in 
         the current RTP session and the RTP sessions the current RTP 
         session depends on.  It is guaranteed that receivers can 
         recover the decoding order of the received NAL units from the 
         current RTP session and the RTP sessions the current RTP 
         session depends on as specified in section 8.1. , when the de-
         session-multiplexing buffer size is at least the value of 
         sprop-desemul-buf-req in terms of bytes. 

         The value of sprop-desemul-buf-req MUST be an integer in the 
         range of 0 to 4294967295, inclusive. 

      desemul-buf-cap: 
         This parameter signals the capabilities of a receiver 
         implementation and indicates the amount of de-session-
         multiplexing buffer space in units of bytes that the receiver 
         has available for recovering the NAL unit decoding order as 
         specified in section 8.1. .  A receiver is able to handle any 
         NAL unit stream for which the value of the sprop-desemul-buf-
         req parameter is smaller than or equal to this parameter. 

         If the parameter is not present, then a value of 0 MUST be 
         used for desemul-buf-cap.  The value of desemul-buf-cap MUST 
         be an integer in the range of 0 to 4294967295, inclusive. 

      sprop-desemul-init-buf-time: 
         This parameter MAY be used to signal the properties of a NAL 
         unit stream carried in the current RTP session and the RTP 
         sessions the current RTP session depends on. 

         The parameter signals the initial buffering time that a 
         receiver MUST wait before starting to recover the NAL unit 
         decoding order as specified in section 8.1.  of this memo. 

         The parameter is coded as a non-negative base10 integer 
         representation in clock ticks of a 90-kHz clock.  If the 
         parameter is not present, then no initial buffering time value 
         is defined.  Otherwise the value of sprop-desemul-init-buf-
         time MUST be an integer in the range of 0 to 4294967295, 
         inclusive.

      sprop-semul-max-don-diff: 
         This parameter MAY be used to signal the properties of a NAL 
         unit stream carried in the current RTP session and the RTP 
         sessions the current RTP session depends on.  It MUST NOT be 
         used to signal transmitter or receiver or codec capabilities.  
         sprop-semul-max-don-diff is an integer in the range of 0 to 
         32767, inclusive.  If sprop-semul-max-don-diff is not present, 
         the value of the parameter is unspecified.  sprop-semul-max-
         don-diff is calculated same as sprop-max-don-diff as specified 
         in RFC 3984, with decoding order number being replaced by AU-
         DON or CS-DON when the NI-A mode or the I-C mode is in use, 
         respectively.
