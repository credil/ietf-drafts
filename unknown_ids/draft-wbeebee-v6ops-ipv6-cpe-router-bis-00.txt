   This document continues the work undertaken by a earlier version of
   this document.  IETF preferred to expedite the IPv6 CPE Router
   document.  As a result, anything that was seen to be under
   development for a technology or feature for the IPv6 CPE Router has

Internet-Draft         CPE Router Recommendations            August 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document continues the work undertaken by the IPv6 CPE Router
   work to incorporate technologies under development.


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

      mDNS - Multicast Domain Name System - see http://www.zeroconf.org.


3.  Conceptual Configuration Variables

   The CPE Router maintains such a list of conceptual optional
   configuration variables.

   1.  Softwire enable.

   2.  More Specifc Route ([RFC4191]) enable and configure routes.

   3.  If DHCPv6 fails, the CPE Router may initiate PPPOE, L2TPv2
       Softwire tunnel, or 6to4 [RFC3056] operation.


4.  Other IPv6 Features

4.1.  Firewall (DEV)

   The CPE Router must support an IPv6 Firewall feature.  The firewall
   may include features like access-control lists.  The firewall may
   support interpretation or recognition of most IPv6 extension header
   information including inspecting fragmentation header.  The firewall
   must support stateful and stateless Packet Filters as follows.

4.1.1.  Packet Filters (DEV)

   The CPE Router must support packet filtering based on IP headers,
   extended headers, UDP and TCP ports etc.  There are numerous filters
   mentioned (section 3.2) in draft-ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security], like some that allow IKE, IPSec
   packets while another filter may block Teredo packets.

   It is possible that in future, IPv6 global unicast prefix can expand
   beyond its existing range.  Therefore the CPE Router MUST not have
   hard coded filters tied to only allow prefixes in a given range.

   6to4 and ISATAP tunnels may be initiated by hosts behind the CPE
   Router.  The CPE Router MUST NOT block 6to4 or ISATAP packets without

Internet-Draft         CPE Router Recommendations            August 2009


   a configurable override.

4.2.  Zero Configuration Support (MEDIUM)

   The CPE Router MAY support manual configuration via the web using a
   URL string like http://router.local as per mDNS described in the
   Terminology and Abbreviations section.  Note that mDNS is a link-
   local protocol, so extra functionality is required if configuration
   is to be supported over cascaded routers.  Support of configuration
   through cascaded routers is beyond the scope of this document.

4.3.  6to4 Automated Tunneling (MEDIUM)/Dual-Stack Lite (DEV)/ISATAP
      (MEDIUM)

   If the IPv4 address assigned to the WAN interface of the CPE Router
   is a non-[RFC1918] IPv4 address, and the CPE Router fails to acquire
   an IPv6 address before WAN_IP_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT seconds after acquiring
   the IPv4 address, then the 6to4 tunneling protocol [RFC3056] SHOULD
   be enabled automatically, allowing tunneling of IPv6 packets over
   IPv4 without requiring user configuration.  If an anycast 6to4 server
   cannot be located, the CPE Router MAY initiate ISATAP [RFC4214] to
   establish IPv6 connectivity over the IPv4 network.  If an IPv6
   address is acquired, but no IPv4 address is acquired before
   WAN_IP_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT seconds after the IPv6 address was acquired,
   then the CPE Router SHOULD use DS-Lite and disable NAT44 in the CPE
   Router.  If both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses are acquired within
   WAN_IP_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT seconds of each other, then the CPE Router
   operates in dual stack mode, and does not need either 6to4 or DS-
   Lite.  If no IPv4 and no IPv6 address has been acquired, then the CPE
   Router retries acquisition.

   6to4 can be useful in the scenario where the Service Provider does
   not yet support IPv6, but devices in the home use IPv6.  An IPv6
   address is constructed automatically from the IPv4 address (V4ADDR)
   configured on the interface using the prefix 2002:V4ADDR::/48.  A
   6to4 tunnel can be automatically created using a pre-configured 6to4
   gateway end-point for the tunnel.

   Several proposals are being considered by IETF related to the problem
   of IPv4 address depletion, but have not yet achieved working group
   consensus for publication as an RFC.  Dual-stack lite ietf-softwire-
   dual-stack-lite-00 [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] requires the
   CPE Router to support features such as v4 in v6 encapsulation and
   softwires.  Further, any approach which requires the use of a tunnel
   MUST take into account the reduced MTU.  The tunnel software on the
   CPE Router MUST be capable of fragmenting data packets.

   For DS-Lite, the CPE Router also discovers the IPv6 address of the

   Carrier Grade NAT node in the deployment.  The ietf-softwire-dual-
   stack-lite-00 [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] draft has yet to
   fully describe the method of discovery.

4.4.  DNS Support (DEV)

   For local DNS queries for configuration, the CPE Router may include a
   DNS server to handle local queries.  Non-local queries can be
   forwarded unchanged to a DNS server specified in the DNS server
   DHCPv6 option.  The CPE Router may also include DNS64 functionality
   which is specified in draft-bagnulo-behave-dns64
   [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64].  The local DNS server MAY also handle
   renumbering from the Service Provider provided prefix for local names
   used exclusively inside the home (the local AAAA and PTR records are
   updated).  This capability provides connectivity using local DNS
   names in the home after a Service Provider renumbering.  A CPE Router
   MAY add local DNS entries based on dynamic requests from the LAN
   segment(s).  The protocol to carry such requests from hosts to the
   CPE Router is yet to be described.

4.5.  Multi-homed Host Support (MEDIUM)

   The CPE Router MAY support [RFC4191] on its LAN interfaces.  Small
   consumer embedded multi-homed hosts in the home may not have
   configurable routing tables.  The CPE Router can communicate More
   Specific Routes (MSRs) to these hosts to allow them to choose a
   preferred router to send traffic to for traffic destined to specific
   prefixes configured through manual configuration.  Advertisement of
   MSRs through RAs is turned off by default.


5.  Future Work

   1.  Enumerate requirements in list form (to be done after
       requirements are solidified).


6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations of a CPE router are covered by
   draft-ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security].


7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
