      <t>
	RFC documents contain a number of fixed elements such as the
	title page header, standard boilerplates and a standard
	acknowledgement section.  This document describes them and
	introduces some updates to reflect current usage and
	requirements of RFC publication.  In particular, this updated
	structure is intended to communicate clearly the source of RFC
	creation and review.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	RFCs published before this document (e.g. the one immeditatly
	prior to this one <xref target="RFCXXXX-1" />) (??? or is it
	prior to approval of this document?) contained a number of
	elements that were there for historical, practical, and legal
	reasons. They also contained boilerplate material to clearly
	indicate the status of the document and possibly contained
	"Notes" to indicate how the document interacts with IETF
	standard track documents.
      </t>
      <t>
	As the RFC Series has evolved over the years, there has been
	increasing concern over appropriate labelling of the
	publications to make clear the status of each RFC and the
	status of the work it describes.  Chiefly, there is a
	requirement that RFCs published as part of the IETF's review
	process not be easily confused with RFCs that may have had a
	very different review and approval process.  Various
	adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving
	text of "Notes" included in the published RFC.
      </t>
      <t>
	With the definition of the different RFC streams <xref
	target="RFC4844"/> it is appropriate to formalize the
	definition of the various pieces of standard RFC boilerplate
	and introduce some adjustments to ensure better clarity of
	expression of document status, aligned with the review and
	approval processes defined for each stream.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	This memo identifies and describes the common elements of RFC
	boilerplate structure, and provides a comprehensive approach
	to updating and using those elements to communicate, with
	clarity, RFC document and content status.  Most of the
	historical structure information is collected from <xref
	target="RFC2223"/>.

    <section anchor="standards" title="RFC Streams and Internet Standards">
      <t>
	Users of RFCs should be aware that while all Internet
	standards-related documents are published as RFCs, not all
	RFCs are Internet standards-related documents.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	The IETF is responsible for maintaining the Internet Standards
	Process, which includes the requirements for developing,
	reviewing and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs.  These,
	and any other standards-related documents (Informational or
	Experimental) are reviewed by appropriate IETF bodies and
	published as part of the IETF Stream.
      </t>
      <t>
	Documents published in streams other than the IETF Stream are
	not reviewed by the IETF for such things as security,
	congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with deployed
	protocols.  They have also not been subject to IESG approval,
	including an IETF-wide last call.  Therefore, the IETF
	disclaims, for any of the non-IETF Stream documents, any
	knowledge of the fitness of those RFCs for any purpose.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	Refer to <xref target="RFC2026"/> and <xref target="RFC4844"/>

	  The right column contains author name and affiliation
	  information as well as RFC publication date.  Conventions
	  and restrictions for these elements are described in RFC
	  style norms and some individual stream definitions.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This memo is primarily concerned with the information in
	  left column:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="hanging">
	    
	    <t hangText="&lt;document source&gt;"> 
	      This describes the area where the work originates.
	      Historically, all RFCs were labeled Network Working
	      Group. "Network Working Group" refers to the original
	      version of today's IETF when people from the original
	      set of Arpanet sites and whomever else was interested --
	      the meetings were open -- got together to discuss,
	      design and document proposed protocols.' [Steve Crocker,
	      private communication]. Here, we obsolete the term
	      "Network Working Group" in order to indicate the
	      originating stream.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The &lt;document source&gt; is the name of the RFC
	      stream, as defined in <xref target="RFC4844"/> and its
	      successors.  At the time of this publication, the
	      streams, and therefore the possible entries are:
	      <list style='symbols'>
		<t>IETF Stream </t> 
		<t>IAB Stream</t> 
		<t>IRTF Stream</t>
		<t>Independent Stream</t>
	      </list>
	      
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="Request for Comments:  &lt;RFC number&gt;">
	      This indicates the RFC number, assigned by the RFC
	      Editor upon publication of the document.  This element
	      is unchanged.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="&lt;subseries ID&gt; &lt;subseries number&gt;"> 
	      Some document categories are also labeled as a subseries
	      of RFCs.  These elements appear as appropriate for such
	      categories, indicating the subseries and the documents
	      number within that series.  Currently, there are
	      subseries for BCPs, STDs and FYIs.  These subseries
	      numbers may appear in several RFCs.  For example, when a
	      new RFC updates an old one, the same subseries number is
	      used.  Also, several RFCs may be assigned the same
	      subseries number: a single STD, for example, may be
	      composed of several RFCs, each of which will bear the
	      same STD number.  This element is unchanged.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="[&lt;RFC relation&gt;:&lt;RFC number[s]&gt;]"> 
	      Some relations between RFCs in the series are explicitly
	      noted in the RFC header.  For example, a new RFC may
	      update one or more earlier RFCs.  Current relationships
	      are "Updates" and "Obsoletes".  This document introduces
	      the new relation "Clarifies" which can be used when a
	      new RFC updates a previous RFC without making any
	      normative changes.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Category: &lt;category&gt;">
	      This indicates the RFC document category of the
	      publication.  These are defined in <xref
	      target="RFC2026"/>.  Currently, this is always one of:
	      Standards Track, Best Current Practice, Experimental,
	      Informational, or Historic.  This element is unchanged.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The ISSN number is the International Standard Serial
	      Number<xref target="ISO3297"/>. Once such number has been assigned to the RFC series this 
	      element will appear here.

	  Going forward, the "Status of This Memo" will start with a

	  statement describing the the stream-specific review of the

	  The first paragraph of the Status of this Memo section contains

<title>Clarifying when Standards Track Documents may Refer Normatively to Documents at a Lower Level</title>

<abstract>
<t>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from other standards bodies).  For example, a standards track document may not have a normative reference to an informational RFC.  Exceptions to this rule are sometimes needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or IETF-specific modes of use of such standards.  This document clarifies and updates the procedure used in these circumstances.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<title>IETF Rights in Contributions</title>

<abstract>
<t>The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are designed to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to the IETF and Internet communities while permitting the authors to retain as many rights as possible.  This memo details the IETF policies on rights in Contributions to the IETF.  It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates RFC 2026, and, with RFC 3979, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>
