<!--================ PROBLEM STATEMENT===============-->

		<section anchor="problems" title="Problem Statement">
			<t>
				6LoWPANs are formed by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4
				standard <xref target="IEEE802.15.4"/>. 
				Most of the LoWPAN devices are distinguished by their low bandwidth,
				short range, scarce memory capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
				inexpensive hardware.  The characteristics of nodes
				participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in 
				the 6LoWPAN problem statement <xref target="RFC4919"/>,
				and the IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="RFC4944"/> document which has specified
				how to carry IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 and similar networks. 
				Whereas IEEE 802.15.4 distinguishes two types of devices called 
				full-function devices (FFD) and reduced-function devices (RFDs), 
				this distinction is based on some MAC layer features that are not always in use. 
				Hence, the distinction is not made in this document. 
				Nevertheless, some 6LoWPAN nodes may limit themselves to the role of hosts only, 
				whereas other 6LoWPAN nodes may take part in routing. 
				This host/router distinction can correlate with the processing and storage 
				capabilities of the device and power available in a similar way to the idea of RFDs and FFDs.
			</t>
			<t>
				IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies.
				However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
				specification (<xref target="RFC4944"/>) define
				how mesh topologies could be obtained and maintained. Thus, 6LoWPAN
				formation and multi-hop routing can be supported either 
				below the IP layer (the adaptation layer or LLC) or the IP layer. 
				(Note that in the IETF, the term "routing" usually, but not 
				always <xref target="RFC5556"/>, refers exclusively to the formation of paths 
				and the forwarding at the IP layer.  In this document we distinguish 
				the layer at which these services are performed by the terms "Route Over" and "Mesh Under".  
				See <xref target="terminology"/> and <xref target="designspace"/>.) 
				A number of IP routing protocols have been developed in various
				IETF working groups. However, these existing routing protocols may not
				satisfy the requirements of multi-hop routing in 6LoWPANs, for the following
				reasons:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as nodes drawing their power from primary batteries,
						power-affluent nodes, mains-powered and high-performance gateways,
						data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN routing protocols should support multiple device types
						and roles.
					</t>
					<t>
						More stringent requirements apply to LoWPANs, as opposed
						to higher performance or non-battery-operated networks.
						6LoWPAN nodes are characterized by small memory sizes,
						low processing power, and are running on very limited power supplied
						by primary non-rechargeable batteries (a few kBytes of RAM,
						a few dozens of kBytes of ROM/flash memory, and a few MHz of CPU is
						typical).  A node's lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of
						its battery.
					</t>
					<t>
						Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in LoWPANs, more than in
						traditional ad-hoc networks. LoWPAN nodes might stay in sleep mode
						for most of the time. Taking advantage of appropriate times for
						transmissions is important for efficient packet forwarding.
					</t>
					<t>
						Routing in 6LoWPANs might possibly translate to a simpler problem
						than routing in higher-performance networks. LoWPANs might be either
						transit networks or stub networks.  Under the assumption that LoWPANs
						are never transit networks (as implied by <xref target="RFC4944"/>),
						routing protocols may be drastically simplified.
						This document will focus on the requirements for stub
						networks. Additional requirements may apply to transit networks.
					</t>
					<t>
						Routing in LoWPANs might possibly translate to a harder problem
						than routing in higher-performance networks. Routing in LoWPANs
						requires power optimization, stable operation in lossy environments,
						etc.  These requirements are not easily
						satisfiable all at once <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey"/>.
					</t>
				</list>

				These properties create new challenges on design of<!-- obtaining robust and reliable --> routing within LoWPANs.
			</t>

			<t>
				The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals" <xref target="RFC4919"/>)
				briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols:
				<list>
					<t>(a) low overhead on data packets</t>
					<t>(b) low routing overhead</t>
					<t>(c) minimal memory and computation requirements</t>
					<t>(d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving</t>
				</list>
				These four high-level requirements describe the basic requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.
				Based on the fundamental features of 6LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements
				are presented in this document, which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.
			</t>
			<t>
				Considering the problems above, detailed 6LoWPAN routing requirements must be defined.
                Application-specific features affect the design of 6LoWPAN routing requirements and the
                corresponding solutions. However, various applications can be profiled by similar technical
				characteristics, although the related detailed requirements might differ (e.g., a few dozens
                of nodes in a home lighting system need appropriate scalability for its applications, while
                millions of nodes for a highway infrastructure system also need appropriate scalability).
			</t>
			<t>
				This routing requirements document states the routing requirements of 6LoWPAN applications in
                general, providing examples for different cases of routing. It does not imply a single routing
                solution to be favorable for all 6LoWPAN applications and there is no requirement of different
                routing protocols to run simultaneously.

			<t>
				The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

				Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
				that are discussed in <xref target="RFC4919">"IPv6 over Low-Power

			</t>
			<t>
			    This specification makes use of the terminology defined in the
				"Neighbor Discovery for 6LoWPAN" <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd"/>.
				<!--and "Design and Application Spaces for 6LoWPANs" <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-usecases"/>.
				In addition, this specification defines a Mesh node as a device 
				which is capable of routing data below the IP layer.

<!--defines the following additional term:
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="Mesh Node"></t>
					<t>
						A LoWPAN node that forwards data between arbitary source-destination pairs

						in Mesh Under LoWPANs). A Mesh Node may also serve as a Host.
					</t>
				</list>  -->
			</t>
		</section>

<!--=============== DESIGN SPACE ==============-->

		<section anchor="designspace" title="Design Space">
			<t>
				Apart from a wide variety of conceivable routing algorithms for 6LoWPAN,
				it is possible to perform routing in the IP layer, using a Route Over approach
				or below IP, as defined by the
				6LoWPAN format document <xref target="RFC4944"/>, using the Mesh Under approach (see <xref target="NetworkStack"/>).
			</t>
			<t>
				The Route Over approach relies on IP routing and therefore supports
				routing over possibly various types of interconnected links.
				<vspace/>
				Note: The ROLL WG is now working on Route Over approaches for Low power
				and Lossy Networks (LLNs), not specifically for 6LoWPAN.
                This document focuses on 6LoWPAN-specific requirements; it may be used in
				conjunction with the more application-oriented requirements defined by the ROLL WG.
			</t>
			<t>
				The Mesh Under approach performs the multi-hop communication below the IP link.
				The most significant consequence of Mesh Under mechanism is that
				the characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4 directly affect the 6LoWPAN routing mechanisms,
				including the use of 64-bit (or 16-bit short) link layer addresses instead of IP
				addresses.  A 6LoWPAN would therefore be seen as a single IP link.
			</t>
			<t>
				Most statements in this	document consider both the Route Over and Mesh Under cases.

  * Here, 'Routing' is not equivalent to IP routing,
    but includes the functionalities of path computation and
    forwarding under the IP layer.
    The term 'Routing' is used in the figure in order to
    illustrate which layer handles path computation and
    packet forwarding in Mesh Under compared to Route Over.
				</artwork>
				<postamble/>
			</figure>

			<t>
				In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for reassembly,
				routing packets should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4 physical frame
				and application data should not be expanded to an extent that they
				no longer fit.
			</t>

		<!--================================-->
        <section title="Reference Network Model">
			<t>
				For multi-hop communication in 6LoWPAN, when a Route Over mechanism is in use,
				all routers (i.e. 6LoWPAN Border Routers (6LBRs) and 6LoWPAN
    Routers (6LRs)) perform IP routing within the stub network (see <xref target="x6LoWPAN-rover-conf"/>).
				In this case, the link-local scope covers the set of nodes within symmetric radio range of a node.
			</t>
			<t> <!--some text changes, feb 17,2009-->
				 When a LoWPAN follows the Mesh Under configuration,
				 the 6LBR is the only IPv6 router in the LoWPAN (see <xref target="x6LoWPAN-mesh-conf"/>).
                 This means that the IPv6 link-local scope includes all nodes in the LoWPAN.
				 For this, a Mesh Under mechanism MUST be provided to support multi-hop transmission.

			<t>
     Note than in both Mesh Under and Route Over networks, there is no
     expectation of topologically based address assignment in the 6LoWPAN.
     Instead, addresses are typically assigned based on the EUI-64
     addresses assigned at manufacturing time to nodes, or based on a
     (from a topological point of view) more or less random process
     assigning 16-bit MAC addresses to individual nodes.
     Within a 6LoWPAN, there is therefore no opportunity for
     aggregation or summarization of IPv6 addresses beyond the sharing
     of (one or more) common prefixes.
   </t>
   <t>
    Not all devices that are in radio range of each other need to be
    part of the same LoWPAN.
				When multiple LoWPANs are formed with globally unique IPv6 addresses
				in the 6LoWPANs, and device (a) of LoWPAN [A] wants to communicate
				with device (b) of LoWPAN [B], the normal IPv6 mechanisms will be employed.
				For Route Over, the IPv6 address of (b) is set as the destination of the packets, and
				the devices perform IP routing to the 6LBR for these outgoing packets.
				For Mesh Under, there is one IP hop from a device (a) to the 6LBR of [A],
				no matter how many radio hops they are apart from each other. This, of course, assumes
				the existence of a Mesh Under routing protocol in order to reach the 6LBR.
				Note that a default route to the 6LBR could be inserted into the 6LoWPAN routing system 
				for both Route Over and Mesh Under.

				When a Route Over mechanism is built over the IPv6 layer, the Dispatch value
				can be chosen as one of the Dispatch patterns for 6LoWPAN, followed by a compressed
				or uncompressed IPv6 header, and Route Over routing header will be included in the payload of IPv6 packet.
				The 6LoWPAN compression format for IPv6 Datagrams <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc"/>

				IP-based LoWPAN technology is still in its early stage of

				tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
				make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
				environments and robust routing will be a necessity for expedient

			</t>
      <t>
			<list style="letters">
				<t>Network Properties:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						Number of Devices, Density and Network Diameter: <vspace/>
						These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
						(e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
						list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
						be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
						entries in order to prevent memory overflow.
					</t>
					<t>
						Connectivity: <vspace/>
						Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a LoWPAN
						can be in several states of connectivity; anything in the
						range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
						poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes
						across a LoWPAN.
					</t>
					<t>
						Dynamicity (including mobility): <vspace/>
						Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external
						factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
						changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
						LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
						volume of control messages may heavily depend on the number
						of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed, as well as how
						quickly and frequently environmental characteristics influencing radio propagation change.
					</t>
					<t>
						Deployment: <vspace/>
						In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
						or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
						occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
						affect the routing state.
					</t>
					<t>
						Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways: <vspace/>
						Network connectivity depends on the spatial distribution of the nodes and on other factors,
                        such as device number, density and transmission range. For instance, nodes can be placed on a
                        grid, or randomly located in an area (as can be modeled by a bidimensional Poisson distribution), etc.
                        Assuming a random spatial distribution, an average of 7 neighbors per node are required for
                        approximately 95% network connectivity (10 neighbors per node are needed for 99% connectivity)<xref target="refs.Kuhn"/>.
						In addition, if the LoWPAN is connected to other networks through infrastructure nodes called
                        gateways, the number and spatial distribution of gateways affects network congestion and available
						data rate, among others.
					</t>
					<t>
						Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications: <vspace/>
						The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
						have a big impact on the network topology and the most efficient routing type to be
						used.  For different traffic patterns (point-to-point,
						multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint) and network
						architectures, various routing mechanisms have been
						developed, such as data-centric, event-driven, address-centric,
						and geographic routing.
					</t>
					<t>
						Classes of Service: <vspace/>
						For mixing applications of different criticality on one LoWPAN, support of
						multiple classes of service may be required in resource-constrained LoWPANs and may
						require a new routing protocol functionality.
					</t>
					<t>
						Security: <vspace/>
						LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
						level of security support where the availability, integrity,
						and confidentiality of data are of prime relevance.  Secured messages
						cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
						routing protocols.

				<t>Node Parameters:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						Processing Speed and Memory Size: <vspace/>
						These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing state and the
						maximum complexity of its processing. LoWPAN nodes may have different
						performance characteristics, queuing strategies and queue buffer sizes.
					</t>
					<t>
						Power Consumption and Power Source: <vspace/>
						The number of battery- and mains-powered nodes and their positions in the topology created by them in
						a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
						paths that optimize network lifetime.
					</t>
					<t>
						Transmission Range: <vspace/>
						This parameter affects routing.  For example, a
						high transmission range may cause a dense network, which in
						turn results in more direct neighbors of a node, higher
						connectivity  and a larger routing state.
					</t>
					<t>
						Traffic Pattern: <vspace/>
						This parameter affects routing since highly loaded nodes (either
						because they are the source of packets to be transmitted or due
						to forwarding) may contribute to higher delivery
						delays and may consume more energy than lightly loaded nodes.
						This applies to both data packets and routing control messages.

		<section anchor="Requirements" title="6LoWPAN Routing Requirements">
			<t>
				This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.
				An important design property specific to low-power networks is that LoWPANs
				have to support multiple device types and roles, such as:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>host nodes drawing their power from primary batteries or using energy harvesting (both called "power-constrained nodes" in the following)</t>
					<t>mains-powered host nodes (an example for what we call "power-affluent nodes")</t>
					<t>power-affluent (but not necessarily mains-powered) high-performance gateway(s)</t>
					<t>nodes with various functionality (data aggregators, relays, local manager/coordinators, etc.)</t>
				</list>

					Due to these different device types and roles LoWPANs need to consider
					the following two primary attributes:

				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but many are
						battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
						with a single AA battery. Many devices are mains-powered most of
						the time, but still need to function for possibly extended periods
						from batteries (e.g. on a construction site before building power
						is switched on for the first time).
					</t>
					<t>
						Low performance: tiny devices, small memory sizes, low-performance
						processors, low bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.
					</t>
				</list>
				These fundamental attributes of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
				solutions. Whether existing routing specifications are
				simplified and modified, or new solutions are introduced in order to
				fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs, they need to meet the requirements
				described in the following.
			</t>

        <!--====================================-->
		<!-- start of Section 5.1: Device -->
			<section anchor="reqs1" title="Support of 6LoWPAN Device Properties">
				<t>
					The general objectives listed in this section should be met
					by 6LoWPAN routing protocols. The importance of each requirement is
					dependent on what node type the protocol is running on and what
					the role of the node is. The following requirements consider the presence of battery-powered nodes in LoWPANs.
				</t>
				<t>
				    [R01] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow implementation with small code size
					and require low routing state to fit the typical 6LoWPAN node capacity.
                                        Generally speaking, the code size is bounded by available flash memory size, and the routing table is bounded by RAM size, possibly limiting it to less than 32 entries.
				</t>
        <t>
				<list>
					<t> <!-- R01: small code-->
            The RAM size of LoWPAN nodes often ranges between 4 kB (2 kB minimum) and 10 kB,
						and program flash memory normally consists of 48 kB to 128 kB.
						(e.g., in the current market, MICAz has 128 kB program flash,
						4 kB EEPROM, 512 kB external flash ROM; TIP700CM has 48 kB program
						flash, 10 kB RAM, 1 MB external flash ROM).
					</t>
					<t>
						Due to these hardware restrictions, code SHOULD
						fit within a small memory size; no more than 48 kB to 128 kB of flash memory including
						at least a few tens of KB of application code size.
						(As a general observation, a routing protocol of low
            complexity may help achieving
						the goal of reducing power consumption, improves robustness,
						requires lower routing state, is easier to analyze, and may be
						less prone to security attacks.)
					</t>
					<t>
						In addition, operation with limited amounts of routing state (such as routing tables and neighbor lists)
						SHOULD be maintained since some typical memory sizes preclude storing
						state of a large number of nodes. For instance, industrial monitoring applications
						may need to support at maximum 20 hops <xref target="RFC5673"/>.

						Small networks can be designed to support a smaller number of hops.
						While the need for this is highly dependent on the network architecture,
					        there should be at least one mode of operation that can
						function with 32 forwarding entries or less.
					</t>
				</list> <!-- end of R01-->
        </t>
				<t> <!-- R02: minimal power -->
				    [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power
					consumption by the efficient use of control packets
					(e.g., minimize expensive IP multicast which causes link broadcast to the entire
					LoWPAN) and by the efficient routing of data packets.
				</t>
        <t>
				<list>
					<t>
						One way of battery lifetime optimization is by achieving a minimal
						control message overhead. Compared to functions such as
						computational operations or taking sensor samples, radio communications
						is by far the dominant factor of power consumption <xref target="refs.SmartDust"/>.
						Power consumption of transmission and/or reception depends linearly
						on the length of data units and	on the frequency of transmission
						and reception of the data units <xref target="refs.Shih"/>.
					</t>
					<t>
						The energy consumption of two
						example RF controllers for low-power nodes is shown in <xref target="refs.Hill"/>.
						The TR1000 radio consumes 21 mW when transmitting at 0.75 mW,
						and 15 mW on reception (with a receiver sensitivity of -85 dBm).
						The CC1000 consumes 31.6 mW when transmitting 0.75 mW, and 20 mW for receiving (with a receiver sensitivity
						of -105 dBm). The power endurance under the concept of
						an idealized power source is explained in <xref target="refs.Hill"/>.
						Based on the energy of an idealized AA battery,
						the CC1000 can transmit for approximately 4 days straight or receive
						for 9 consecutive days. Note that availability for reception consumes
						power as well.
					</t>
					<t>
						As multicast may cause flooding in the LoWPAN, a 6LoWPAN routing
						protocol SHOULD minimize the control cost by multicasting routing packets.
          </t>
          <t>
						Control cost of routing protocols in low power and lossy
            networks is discussed in more detail in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey"/>.

				<-->
				 [R03] 6LoWPAN routing protocol control messages SHOULD NOT exceed a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame size

				<!-- give ur opinion on this text changes. i think we need better wording..-->
				</t>
				<t>
				<list>
					<t>
						In order to save energy, routing overhead should be minimized to
						prevent fragmentation of frames.
						Therefore, 6LoWPAN routing should not cause packets to exceed the
						IEEE 802.15.4 frame size.  This reduces the energy required for
						transmission, avoids unnecessary waste of bandwidth, and prevents
						the need for packet reassembly.  As calculated in RFC4944
						<xref target="RFC4944"/>, the maximum size of a 6LoWPAN frame,
						in order not to cause fragmentation, is 81 octets.
						This may imply the use of semantic fragmentation and/or algorithms

					packets are to be delivered	with sufficient probability according to application requirements.
				</t>
        <t>
				<list>
					<t>
						Requirements on successful end-to-end packet delivery ratio
						(where delivery may be bounded within certain latency) vary depending
						on applications. In industrial applications, some non-critical monitoring
						applications may tolerate successful delivery ratio of less than 90%
						with hours of latency; in some other cases, a delivery ratio of 99.9%
						is required <xref target="RFC5673"/>. In building automation applications,
						application layer errors must be below 0.01% <xref target="RFC5867"/>.
					</t>
					<t>
						Successful end-to-end delivery of packets in an IEEE 802.15.4 mesh
						depends on the quality of the path selected by the routing protocol and
						on the ability of the routing protocol to cope with short-term and long-term quality variation.
						The metric of the routing protocol strongly influences performance of
						the routing protocol in terms of delivery ratio.
					</t>
					<t>
						The quality of a given path depends on the individual qualities of the links
						(including the devices) that compose that path. IEEE 802.15.4 settings affect
						the quality perceived at upper layers. In particular, in IEEE 802.15.4 reliable mode,
						if an acknowledgment frame is not received after a given period,
						the originator retries frame transmission up to a maximum number of times.
						If an acknowledgment frame is still not received by the sender
						after performing the maximum number of transmission attempts,
						the MAC layer assumes the transmission has failed and notifies the next
						higher layer of the failure. Note that excessive retransmission may be detrimental,
						see RFC 3819 <xref target="RFC3819"/>.

				</t>

				<list>
					<t>
						Latency requirements may differ from a few hundreds milliseconds to minutes,
						depending on the type of application.
						Real-time building automation applications usually need response times
						below 500 ms between egress and ingress, while
						forced entry security alerts must be routed to one or more fixed or mobile user devices
						within 5 s <xref target="RFC5867"/>.
						Non-critical closed loop applications for industrial automation
						have latency requirements that can be as low as 100 ms but many control loops are
						tolerant of latencies above 1 s <xref target="RFC5673"/>. In contrast to this,
						urban monitoring applications allow latencies smaller than the typical intervals used for
						reporting sensed information; for instance, in the order of seconds to
						minutes <xref target="RFC5548"/>.

					<t>
						The range of latencies of a frame transmission between a single
						sender and a single receiver through an ideal unslotted IEEE 802.15.4
						2.4 GHz channel is between 2.46 ms and 6.02 ms in 64 bit MAC address

						63.7 ms, depending on the address type and reliable/unreliable
						mode used. Note that the latencies may be larger than that depending
						on channel load, MAC layer settings
						procedure, and reliable/unreliable mode choice.
						Note that other MAC approaches than the legacy 802.15.4 may be used (e.g. TDMA).
						Duty cycling may further affect latency (see [R08]).

				    [R06] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be robust to dynamic loss caused by link failure
                    or device unavailability either in the short term (ca. 30 ms), due to RSSI
                    variation, interference variation, noise and asynchrony, or in the long term, due
                    to a depleted power source, hardware breakdown, operating system misbehavior, etc.
				</t>
        <t>
				<list>
					<t>
						An important trait of 6LoWPAN devices is their unreliability due to
						limited system capabilities, and also because they might be closely
						coupled to the physical world with all its unpredictable variation.
						In harsh environments, LoWPANs easily suffer from
						link failure. Collision or link failure easily increases send
						and receive queues and can lead to queue overflow and
						packet losses.
					</t>
					<t>
						For home applications, where users expect feedback after carrying out actions
						(such as handling a remote control while moving around), routing protocols must converge
						within 2 seconds if the destination node of the packet has moved and must converge within
                        0.5 seconds if only the sender has moved <xref target="RFC5826"/>.
						The tolerance of the recovery time can vary depending on the application, however, the

                        disappearance. The routing protocol has to exploit network resources (e.g. path redundancy)
					    to offer good network behavior despite of node failure.

         Different routing protocols may exhibit different scaling

                        it is suggested that the devices have to maximize the sleep phase with a duty cycle lower

					    Dependent on the application in use, packet rates may range from one per second to one per day
                        or beyond. Routing protocols may take advantage of knowledge about the packet transmission rate
						and utilize this information in calculating routing paths. In many IEEE 802.15.4 deployments, and
                        in other wireless low-power technologies, forwarders are mains-powered devices (and hence do not
                        need to sleep). However, it cannot be assumed that all forwarders are mains-powered.
                        A routing protocol that addresses this case
                        SHOULD provide a mode in which power
                        consumption is a metric.  In addition, using
                        nodes in power-saving modes for forwarding may
                        increase delay and reduce packet delivery

				<t>
					The routing requirement described in this subsection allows secure
					transmission of routing messages. 
					<!-- Added by Eunah, Nov. 4,2010, for meeting Sean's comment in IESG -->
					As in traditional networks, routing mechanisms in 6lowpan
					present another window from which, an attacker might disrupt and
					significantly degrade the 6lowpan overall performance.  Attacks
					against unsecure routing aim mainly to contaminate WPAN networks with
					false routing information resulting in routing inconsistencies.  A
					malicious node can also snoop packets and then launch replay attacks
					on the 6lowpan nodes.  These attacks can cause harm especially when
					the attacker is a high-power device, such as laptop.  It can also
					easily drain 6lowpan devices batteries by sending broadcast messages,
					redirecting routes etc. <!-- until here, copied from 6LoWPAN security analysis -->
					<!-- deleted by Eunah, Nov. 4, 2010
					Solutions may take into account the
					specific features of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layers. -->
				</t>
				<t> <!-- R14: security-->
				    [R14] 6LoWPAN routing protocols MUST support confidentiality, authentication and 
					integrity services as required for secure delivery of control messages.
				</t>
				<t>
				<list>
					<t>
						A general set of requirements that may apply to these services
                        can be found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs"/>.
					</t>
					<t>
						Security is very important for designing robust routing
						protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
						overhead.
						<!-- added by Eunah, Nov 4,2010, for satisfying Sean's comment -->
						The security aspect, however, seems a bit tradeoff in the 6lowpan
						since security is always a costly function.  
						6lowpan poses unique challenges to which, traditional security techniques 
						cannot be applied directly.
						For example, public key cryptography primitives are typically avoided
						(as being too expensive) as are relatively heavyweight conventional
						encryption methods.
					</t>
					<t>
						Consequently, it becomes questionable whether the 6lowpan devices can
						support IPsec as it is.  While IPsec is mandatory with IPv6, 
						considering the power constraints and limited processing capabilities of 
						IEEE 802.15.4 capable devices, IPsec is computationally expensive; 
						Internet key exchange (IKEv2) messaging described in RFC5996 <xref target="RFC5996"/> will not work well
						in 6lowpans as we want to minimize the amount of signaling in these
						networks. IPsec supports AH for authenticating the IP
						header and ESP for authenticating and encrypting the payload.  The
						main issues of using IPsec are two-fold: (1) processing power and (2)
						key management.  Since these tiny 6lowpan devices do not process huge
						number of data or communicate with many different nodes, it is not
						well understood if complete implementation of SADB, policy-database
						and dynamic key-management protocol are appropriate for these small
						battery powered devices. <!-- until here, copied from 6LoWPAN security analysis --> 
					</t>
					<t>
						Bandwidth is a very scarce resource in 6lowpan environments.  The
						fact that IPsec additionally requires another header (AH or ESP) in
						every packet makes its use problematic in 6lowpan environments.
						IPsec requires two communicating peers to share a secret key that is
						typically established dynamically with the Internet Key Exchange
						(IKEv2) protocol.  Thus, it has an additional packet overhead
						incurred by IKEv2 packets exchange.
					</t>
					<t>
						Given existing constraints in 6lowpan environments, IPsec may not be
						suitable to use in such environments, especially that 6lowpan node
						may not be able to operate all IPsec algorithms on its own capability.
						Thus, 6lowpan may need to define its own keying management
						method(s) that requires minimum overhead in packet-size and in number
						of signaling messages exchange.  IPsec will provide authentication
						and confidentiality between end-nodes and across multiple lowpan-
						links, and may be useful only when two nodes want to apply security
						to all exchanged messages.  However, in most cases, the security may
						be requested at the application layer as needed, while other messages
						can flow in the network without security overhead.
					</t>
					<t>
						Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
						threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  If IEEE 802.15.4 security is not used, 
						Neighbor Discovery (ND) in IEEE 802.15.4 links is susceptible to threats. 
						These include NS/NA spoofing, malicious router, default router killed, 
						good router goes bad, spoofed redirect, replay attacks and remote ND DoS 
						<xref target="RFC3756"/>. However, if IEEE 802.15.4 security is used, 
						no other protection is needed for ND, as long as none of the nodes becomes compromised, 
						because the Corporate Intranet Model of RFC 3756 can be assumed 
						<xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd"/>.
					</t>
					<t>
						Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats. For example, a malicious node can 
						obtain initial configuration information in order to appear as a legitimate node 
						and then carry out various types of attacks. Such a node can also keep legitimate 
						nodes busy by broadcasting authentication/join requests. 
						One option for mitigating such threats is the use of mutual authentication schemes 
						based on the use of pre-shared keys <xref target="refs.Ikram"/>.
					</t>
					<t>
						The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides an AES-based security mechanism. Routing protocols may
                        define how this mechanism (in conjunction with IP security whenever available) 
						can be used to obtain the intended security, either for
                        the routing protocol alone or in conjunction with the security used for the data.
                        Byte overhead of the mechanism, which depends on the security services selected, must
                        be considered. In the worst case in terms of overhead, the mechanism consumes 21 bytes
                        of MAC payload.
					</t>
					<t>
						The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC security is typically supported by crypto
						hardware even in very simple chips that will be used in a 6LoWPAN.
						Even if the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC security mechanisms are not used,
						this crypto hardware is usually available for use by application
						code running on these chips.  A security protocol outside IEEE
						802.15.4 MAC security SHOULD therefore provide a mode of
						operation that is covered by this crypto hardware.
					</t>
					<t> <!-- This is inserted to resolve Issue Tracker #4. Suggested by Carles, Feb. 18.2009 -->
						IEEE 802.15.4 does not specify protection for acknowledgement frames.
						Since the sequence numbers of data frames are sent in the clear,
						an adversary can forge an acknowledgement for each data frame.
						This weakness can be combined with targeted jamming to prevent delivery of
						selected packets. In consequence, IEEE 802.15.4 acknowledgements cannot be relied upon.
						In applications that require high security, the routing protocol must not exploit
						feedback from acknowledgements (e.g. to keep track of neighbor connectivity, see [R16]).

				<t>
					[R16] In order to perform discovery and maintenance of neighbors

			</t>
			<t>
				The use of wireless links renders a 6LoWPAN susceptible to attacks
				like any other wireless network.
				In outdoor 6LoWPANs, the physical exposure of the nodes
				allows an adversary to capture, clone or tamper with these devices.
				In ad-hoc 6LoWPANs that are dynamic in both their topology and node memberships,
				a static security configuration does not suffice.
				Spoofed, altered, or replayed routing information might occur while
				multihopping could delay the detection and treatment of attacks.
			</t>
			<t>
				This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently protected,
				either by means of physical or IP security for the backbone link or with
				MAC sublayer cryptography.
				However, link-layer encryption and authentication may not be sufficient
				to provide confidentiality, authentication,  integrity, and freshness to both data and routing protocol packets.
				Time synchronization, self-organization and secure localization
				for multi-hop routing are also critical to support.
			</t>
			<t>
				For secure routing protocol operation, it may be necessary to consider authenticated
				broadcast (and multicast) and bidirectional link verification.
				On the other hand, secure end-to-end data delivery can be assisted by the routing protocol. For example, multi-path routing could be considered for increasing security
				to prevent selective forwarding.
				However, the challenge is that 6LoWPANs already have high resource constraints,
				so that 6LBR and LoWPAN nodes may require different security solutions.
