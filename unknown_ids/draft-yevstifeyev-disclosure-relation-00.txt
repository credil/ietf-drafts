1. Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined a way of indicating relationships between
   resources on the Web.  This document specifies a new type of such
   relationship - 'disclosure' Link Relation Type.  It designates a list
   of patent disclosures or a particular patent disclosure itself made
   with respect to material for which such relation is specified.

   Active use of 'disclosure' relation type has been identified.  The
   current version of W3C Publication Rules [W3C-PUBRULES], Bullet 36 of
   Section 5, defines that each W3C document must have the boilerplate
   referring to the page where one may find patent disclosures made with
   regard to such document.  As W3C Publication Rules are applied to
   many documents, that might be under different patent policies, a
   number of variants of the mentioned boilerplate exist.  However, the
   phrase "W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in
   connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also
   includes instructions for disclosing a patent." can be found in each
   of these variants.  Publication Rules specify that, in the source
   code, it must look like:

     W3C maintains a <a rel="disclosure" href="...">public list of any
     patent disclosures</a> made in connection with the deliverables of
     the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a
     patent.

   Such provisions existed in previous versions of Publication Rules as
   well, so such source text is often found in different W3C documents
   that predated publication of RFC 5988 significantly.  However,
   'disclosure' relation type has not been mentioned in RFC 5988 when
   creating the registry for relation types; nor was it registered
   separately.

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>            October 23, 2011


   This document is to formally register the 'disclosure' Link Relation
   Type with IANA and provide a permanent record on it for the Internet
   community.  Additionally, it expands the sphere of this relation type
   to allow its use when referring to separate patent disclosures.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. 'disclosure' Link Relation Type

   Whenever the 'disclosure' relation is defined, the target IRI MUST
   either

   (1) designate a list of patent disclosures, or

   (2) refer to a particular patent disclosure made with respect to the
       material being referenced by context IRI.

3. Examples

   This section provides several examples of possible use of
   'disclosure' relation type.

   If the page <http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/> contains a list of
   patent disclosures made with respect to the specification found at
   <http://example.org/specs/meta-spec/spec.html>, the latter would have
   the following fragment of HTML source code:

   <html>
     ...
     Please visit
     <a rel="disclosure" href="http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/"> the
     IPR page</a> for the list of patent disclosures made with respect
     to this specification.
     ...
   </html>

   Or, in the case of Link header field, the HTTP response would contain
   the following header field:

     Link: <http://example.org/ipr/meta-spec/>; rel="disclosure";
     title="Patent Disclosures List"

   (Please note that the actual header field will not contain the line
   break after 'rel' parameter.)

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>            October 23, 2011


   In the case of separate patent disclosures, the HTML source code may
   look like this:

   <html>
     ...
     The following are the patent disclosures known at present made
     with respect to this specification:
     <ul><a rel="disclosure" href="http://patent.gov/8546987">
     U.S. Patent No. 8546987</a></ul>
     <ul><a rel="disclosure" href="http://ipr.su/pat/98745-6">
     U.S.S.R. Patent No. 98745-6</a></ul>
     <ul><a rel="disclosure" href="ftp://ftp.legal.va/a/patent3.pdf">
     Vatical City State Patent No. 3</a></ul>
     ...
   </html>

   (The <ul> element is used to introduce an unordered, bulleted list in
   HTML.)

4. Security Considerations

   The 'disclosure' relation type is truly believed not to raise any new
   security issues which are not discussed in RFC 5988 for generic use
   of Web linking mechanism.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'disclosure' link relation type in the
   corresponding registry, with reference to this document, using the
   following template:

   o Relation name: disclosure

   o Description: refers to a list of patent disclosures or a particular
     patent disclosure itself made with respect to material for which
     'disclosure' relation is specified

   o Reference: RFC xxxx
