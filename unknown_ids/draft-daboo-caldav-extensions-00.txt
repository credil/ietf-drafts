Internet-Draft              CalDAV Extensions               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4791] defines the CalDAV Calendar Access protocol for accessing
   calendar data stored on a server.  With the popularity of CalDAV
   increasing, a number of useful extensions have been proposed to
   improve the protocol.  This specification collects several of those
   extensions into one document for convenience.  Each extension defined
   in this specification can be implemented independently of any of the
   others.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Other notations used in this memo follow the notations of [RFC4791].


3.  Extended Calendar Query Report

   The CALDAV:calendar-query report defined in Section 7.8 of [RFC4791]
   allows a client to search calendar data for a match to iCalendar
   component, property or parameter details.  As defined, this option
   supports querying multiple attributes of the iCalendar data at
   various "nesting" levels based on the syntactic structure of
   iCalendar itself.  When multiple attributes are queried at the same
   level, each has to match for the query to be successful - effectively
   defining a logical "and" operation.  This does not allow clients to
   execute a single query to match different attributes of different
   component types (e.g., clients cannot search for VEVENTs with a
   particular time-range, or VTODOs that are not completed).  Since
   there is a need to be able to execute such queries, a logical "or"
   operation is needed.

   This specification adds a "test" XML attribute to the CALDAV:comp-
   filter and CALDAV:prop-filter XML elements that accepts values of
   "allof" or "anyof" to indicate logical "and" or "or" operations
   respectively.  This copies the behavior defined for CARDDAV:
   addressbook-query reports defined in Section 10.5 of [RFC6352], with
   the exception that the default value for the attribute is "allof" to
   match the current behavior.

   The text comparison operation in [RFC4791] is a simple "contains"
   operation, however more sophisticated comparisons are sometimes
   needed (e.g., 'starts with', 'equals', etc).

Internet-Draft              CalDAV Extensions               October 2011


   This specification adds a "match-type" XML attribute to the CALDAV:
   text-match XML element that accepts values of "equals", "contains",
   "starts-with", or "ends-with", to indicate the comparison operation
   to be used.  This copies the behavior defined for CARDDAV:
   addressbook-query reports defined in Section 10.5.4 of [RFC6352].

   Sometimes clients want to search all component types for a match
   (e.g., clients cannot find all calendar object resources that contain
   a SUMMARY property value matching some text irrespective of the top-
   level component type).

   This specification allows the use of a single "*" character in the
   "name" attribute of "comp-filter" elements to require the server to
   match any component type.

   Servers advertise support for this extension by including the token
   "calendar-query-extended" in the DAV response header to an OPTIONS
   request on any resource supporting the extended query report.
   Clients MUST check for the presence of that token before using the
   "test" or "match-type" XML attributes.

   This specification extends the [RFC4791] XML syntax for the CALDAV:
   comp-filter, CALDAV:prop-filter and CALDAV:text-match XML elements as
   follows.

3.1.  CALDAV:comp-filter XML Element

   XML Element:  CALDAV:comp-filter

   Updated Definition:

   <!ELEMENT comp-filter (is-not-defined | (time-range?,
                          prop-filter*, comp-filter*))>

   <!ATTLIST comp-filter name CDATA #REQUIRED
                         test (allof | anyof) "allof">
   <!-- name value:
           a calendar object or calendar component type (e.g., VEVENT),
           or the value "*" to indicate a match against any type

        test value:
           allof logical AND for matches
           anyof logical OR for matches
    -->

   Additional Description:  The "test" attribute specifies whether any
      (logical OR) or all (logical AND) of the is-not-defined, time-
      range, comp-filter or param-filter tests need to match in order
      for the overall filter to match.

3.2.  CALDAV:prop-filter XML Element

   XML Element:  CALDAV:prop-filter

   Updated Definition:

   <!ELEMENT prop-filter (is-not-defined |
                          ((time-range | text-match)?,
                           param-filter*))>

   <!ATTLIST prop-filter name CDATA #REQUIRED
                         test (allof | anyof) "allof">
   <!-- name value:
           a calendar property name (e.g., ATTENDEE)

        test value:
           allof logical AND for matches
           anyof logical OR for matches
    -->

   Additional Description:  The "test" attribute specifies whether any
      (logical OR) or all (logical AND) of the is-not-defined, time-
      range, text-filter or param-filter tests need to match in order
      for the overall filter to match.

3.3.  CALDAV:text-match XML Element

   XML Element:  CALDAV:text-match

   Updated Definition:

   <!ELEMENT text-match (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- PCDATA value: string -->

   <!ATTLIST text-match
       collation        CDATA "i;ascii-casemap"
       negate-condition (yes | no) "no"
       match-type (equals|contains|starts-with|ends-with) "contains">

   Additional Description:  The "match-type" attribute is used to
      indicate the type of match operation to use.  Possible choices
      are:

         "equals" - an exact match to the target string

         "contains" - a substring match, matching anywhere within the
         target string

         "starts-with" - a substring match, matching only at the start
         of the target string

         "ends-with" - a substring match, matching only at the end of
         the target string

3.4.  Examples

   In this request, the client is querying for VEVENTs that start on or
   after a specific date, or VTODOs that are not completed and not
   cancelled.

4.  Advertising Supported Calendar Component Sets

   CalDAV [RFC4791] supports the notion of calendar collections that are
   restricted to only containing components of a certain type, or set of
   types.  The protocol allows clients to specify the restricted
   component sets by supplying a CALDAV:supported-calendar-component-set
   WebDAV property in an MKCALENDAR or extended MKCOL [RFC5689] request
   that creates a calendar collection.  However, servers themselves
   might need to restrict the allowed sets of components that can be
   used in any one calendar (e.g., some servers might only support
   calendar collections containing components of one type).  Currently
   there is no way for a client to determine what the allowed
   combination of component types is for use with MKCALENDAR or extended
   MKCOL.

   This specification adds a new CALDAV:supported-calendar-component-
   sets WebDAV property for use on calendar home collections.  This
   property enumerates the allowed sets of calendar components that the
   server will support for use with MKCALENDAR or extended MKCOL
   requests.  Clients SHOULD check for the presence of this property
   before issuing an MKCALENDAR or extended MKCOL request that includes
   a CALDAV:supported-calendar-component-set WebDAV property.  When the
   new property is found on a calendar home, clients MUST only use a

Internet-Draft              CalDAV Extensions               October 2011


   CALDAV:supported-calendar-component-set is one advertised as being
   supported.

4.1.  CALDAV:supported-calendar-component-sets Property

   Name:  supported-calendar-component-sets

   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav

   Purpose:  Enumerates the sets of component restrictions the server is
      willingly to allow the client to specify in MKCALENDAR or extended
      MKCOL requests.

   Protected:  This property MUST be protected and SHOULD NOT be
      returned by a PROPFIND allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2
      of [RFC4918]).

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  Calendar homes are not typically copied or moved
      directly via HTTP.

   Description:  If servers apply restrictions on the allowed calendar
      component sets used when creating a calendar, then those servers
      SHOULD advertise this property on each calendar home collection
      within which the restrictions apply.  In the absence of this
      property, clients cannot assume anything about whether the server
      will enforce a set of restrictions or not - in that case clients
      need to handle the server rejecting certain combinations of
      restricted component sets.  If this property is present, but
      contains no child XML elements, then clients can assume that the
      server imposes no restrictions on the combinations of component
      types it is willing to accept.

      If this property is not present on a calendar collection, then the
      default value CALDAV:opaque MUST be assumed.
