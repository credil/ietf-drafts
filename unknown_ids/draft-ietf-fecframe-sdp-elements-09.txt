Internet-Draft       SDP Elements for FEC Framework       September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework, described in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework], outlines a general framework for using
   FEC-based error recovery in packet flows carrying media content.
   While a continuous signaling between the sender(s) and receiver(s) is
   not required for a Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) that uses the FEC
   Framework, a set of parameters pertaining to the FEC Framework has to
   be initially communicated between the sender(s) and receiver(s).  A
   signaling protocol (such as the one described in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-config-signaling]) is required to enable such
   communication and the parameters need to be appropriately encoded so
   that they can be carried by the signaling protocol.

   One format to encode the parameters is the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].  SDP provides a simple text-based format
   for announcements and invitations to describe multimedia sessions.
   These SDP announcements and invitations include sufficient
   information for the sender(s) and receiver(s) to participate in the
   multimedia sessions.  SDP also provides a framework for capability
   negotiation, which can be used to negotiate all or a subset of the
   parameters pertaining to the individual sessions.

   The purpose of this document is to introduce the SDP elements that
   are used by the CDPs using the FEC Framework that choose SDP
   [RFC4566] as their session description protocol.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Forward Error Correction (FEC) and FEC Framework

   This section gives a brief overview of FEC and the FEC Framework.

3.1.  Forward Error Correction (FEC)

   Any application that needs a reliable transmission over an unreliable
   packet network has to cope with packet losses.  FEC is an effective
   approach that provides reliable transmission particularly in
   multicast and broadcast applications where the feedback from the
   receiver(s) is either not available or quite limited.

   In a nutshell, FEC groups source packets into blocks and applies



Begen                    Expires March 30, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       SDP Elements for FEC Framework       September 2010


   protection to generate a desired number of repair packets.  These
   repair packets can be sent on demand or independently of any receiver
   feedback.  The choice depends on the FEC scheme or the Content
   Delivery Protocol used by the application, the packet loss
   characteristics of the underlying network, the transport scheme
   (e.g., unicast, multicast and broadcast) and the application.  At the
   receiver side, lost packets can be recovered by erasure decoding
   provided that a sufficient number of source and repair packets have
   been received.

3.2.  FEC Framework

   The FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] outlines a general
   framework for using FEC codes in multimedia applications that stream
   audio, video or other types of multimedia content.  It defines the
   common components and aspects of Content Delivery Protocols (CDP).
   The FEC Framework also defines the requirements for the FEC schemes
   that need to be used within a CDP.  However, the details of the FEC
   schemes are not specified within the FEC Framework.  For example, the
   FEC Framework defines what configuration information has to be known
   at the sender and receiver(s) at minimum, but the FEC Framework
   neither specifies how the FEC repair packets are generated and used
   to recover missing source packets, nor dictates how the configuration
   information is communicated between the sender and receiver(s).
   These are rather specified by the individual FEC schemes or CDPs.

3.3.  FEC Framework Configuration Information

   The FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] defines a minimum set
   of information that has to be communicated between the sender and
   receiver(s) for a proper operation of an FEC scheme.  This
   information is called the FEC Framework Configuration Information.
   This information includes unique identifiers for the source and
   repair flows that carry the source and repair packets, respectively.
   It also specifies how the sender applies protection to the source
   flow(s) and how the repair flow(s) can be used to recover lost data.

   Multiple instances of the FEC Framework can simultaneously exist at
   the sender and the receiver(s) for different source flows, for the
   same source flow, or for various combinations of the source flows.
   Each instance of the FEC Framework provides the following FEC
   Framework Configuration Information:

   1. Identification of the repair flows.

Internet-Draft       SDP Elements for FEC Framework       September 2010


   2. For each source flow protected by the repair flow(s):

      a.  Definition of the source flow.

      b.  An integer identifier for this flow definition (i.e., tuple).
      This identifier MUST be unique amongst all source flows that are
      protected by the same FEC repair flow.  The identifiers SHOULD be
      allocated starting from zero and increasing by one for each flow.
      A source flow identifier need not be carried in source packets
      since source packets are directly associated with a flow by virtue
      of their packet headers.

   3. The FEC Encoding ID, identifying the FEC scheme.

   4. The length of the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID (in octets).

   5. Zero or more FEC-Scheme-Specific Information (FSSI) elements, each
      consisting of a name and a value where the valid element names and
      value ranges are defined by the FEC scheme.

   FSSI includes the information that is specific to the FEC scheme used
   by the CDP.  FSSI is used to communicate the information that cannot
   be adequately represented otherwise and is essential for proper FEC
   encoding and decoding operations.  The motivation behind separating
   the FSSI required only by the sender (which is carried in Sender-Side
   FEC-Scheme-Specific Information (SS-FSSI) container) from the rest of
   the FSSI is to provide the receiver or the third party entities a
   means of controlling the FEC operations at the sender.  Any FSSI
   other than the one solely required by the sender MUST be communicated
   via the FSSI container.

   The variable-length SS-FSSI and FSSI containers transmit the
   information in textual representation and contain zero or more
   distinct elements, whose descriptions are provided by the fully-
   specified FEC schemes.


4.  SDP Elements

   This section defines the SDP elements that MUST be used to describe
   the FEC Framework Configuration Information in multimedia sessions by
   the CDPs that choose SDP [RFC4566] as their session description
   protocol.  Example SDP descriptions can be found in Section 6.

4.1.  Transport Protocol Identifiers

   This specification defines a class of new transport protocol
   identifiers for SDP media descriptions.  For all existing identifiers



Begen                    Expires March 30, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       SDP Elements for FEC Framework       September 2010


   <proto> (listed in the table for the 'proto' field in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters registry), this specification
   defines the identifier 'FEC/<proto>'.  This identifier MAY be used as
   the transport protocol identifier in the media descriptions for the
   source data to indicate that the FEC Source Packet format defined in
   Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] is used, where the
   original transport payload field is formatted according to <proto>.
   However, if the FEC scheme does not use the Explicit Source FEC
   Payload ID as described in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework], then the original transport protocol
   identifier MUST be used to support backward compatibility with the
   receivers that do not support FEC at all.

   This specification also defines another transport protocol
   identifier, 'UDP/FEC', to indicate the FEC Repair Packet format
   defined in Section 5.4 of [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework].

4.2.  Media Stream Grouping

   In FEC Framework, the 'group' attribute and the FEC grouping
   semantics defined in [RFC5888] and [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc4756bis],
   respectively are used to associate source and repair flows together.

4.3.  Source IP Addresses

   The 'source-filter' attribute of SDP ("a=source-filter") as defined
   in [RFC4570] is used to express the source addresses or fully
   qualified domain names in the FEC Framework.

4.4.  Source Flows

   The FEC Framework allows that multiple source flows MAY be grouped
   and protected together by a single or multiple FEC Framework
   instances.  For this reason, as described in Section 3.3, individual
   source flows MUST be identified with unique identifiers.  For this
   purpose, we introduce the attribute 'fec-source-flow'.

   The syntax for the new attribute in ABNF [RFC5234] is as follows:

        fec-source-flow-line = "a=fec-source-flow:" SP source-id
             [";" SP tag-length] CRLF

        source-id = "id=" src-id
        src-id = 1*DIGIT

        tag-length = "tag-len=" tlen
        tlen = %x31-39 *DIGIT

   The REQUIRED parameter 'id' is used to identify the source flow.
   Parameter 'id' MUST be an integer.

   The 'tag-len' parameter is used to specify the length of the Explicit
   Source FEC Payload ID field (in octets).  In the case that an
   Explicit Source FEC Payload ID is used, the 'tag-len' parameter MUST
   exist and indicate its length.  Otherwise, the 'tag-len' parameter
   MUST NOT exist.

4.5.  Repair Flows

   A repair flow MUST contain only repair packets formatted as described
   in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] for a single FEC Framework instance,
   i.e., packets belonging to source flows or other repair flows from a
   different FEC Framework instance cannot be sent within this flow.  We
   introduce the attribute 'fec-repair-flow' to describe the repair
   flows.

   The syntax for the new attribute in ABNF is as follows (CHAR and CTL
   are defined in [RFC5234]):

        fec-repair-flow-line = "a=fec-repair-flow:" SP fec-encoding-id
             [";" SP flow-preference]
             [";" SP sender-side-scheme-specific]
             [";" SP scheme-specific] CRLF

        fec-encoding-id = "encoding-id=" enc-id
        enc-id = 1*DIGIT ; FEC Encoding ID

        flow-preference = "preference-lvl=" preference-level-of-the-flow
        preference-level-of-the-flow = 1*DIGIT

        sender-side-scheme-specific = "ss-fssi=" sender-info
        sender-info = element *( "," element )
        element     = name ":" value
        name        = token
        token       = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>
        value       = *<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>
        separator   = "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" / "@"
                       / "," / ";" / ":" / "\" / <">
                       / "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" / "="
                       / "{" / "}" / SP / HTAB

        scheme-specific = "fssi=" scheme-info
        scheme-info = element *( "," element )
        element     = name ":" value


   The REQUIRED parameter 'encoding-id' is used to identify the FEC
   scheme used to generate this repair flow.  These identifiers (in the
   range of [0 - 255]) are registered by the FEC schemes that use the
   FEC Framework and are maintained by IANA.

   The OPTIONAL parameter 'preference-lvl' is used to indicate the
   preferred order of using the repair flows.  The exact usage of the
   parameter 'preference-lvl' and the pertaining rules MAY be defined by
   the FEC scheme or the CDP.  If the parameter 'preference-lvl' does
   not exist, it means that the receiver(s) MAY receive and use the
   repair flows in any order.  However, if a preference level is
   assigned to the repair flow(s), the receivers are encouraged to
   follow the specified order in receiving and using the repair flow(s).

   The OPTIONAL parameters 'ss-fssi' and 'fssi' are containers to convey
   the FEC-Scheme-Specific Information (FSSI) that includes the
   information that is specific to the FEC scheme used by the CDP and is
   necessary for proper FEC encoding and decoding operations.  The FSSI
   required only by the sender (called Sender-Side FSSI) MUST be
   communicated in the container specified by the parameter 'ss-fssi'.
   Any other FSSI MUST be communicated in the container specified by the



Begen                    Expires March 30, 2011                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       SDP Elements for FEC Framework       September 2010


   parameter 'fssi'.  In both containers, FSSI is transmitted in the
   form of textual representation and MAY contain multiple distinct
   elements.  If the FEC scheme does not require any specific
   information, the 'ss-fssi' and 'fssi' parameters MUST NOT exist.

4.6.  Repair Window

   Repair window is the time that spans an FEC block, which consists of
   the source block and the corresponding repair packets.

   At the sender side, the FEC encoder processes a block of source
   packets and generates a number of repair packets.  Then both the
   source and repair packets are transmitted within a certain duration
   not larger than the value of the repair window.  The value of the
   repair window impacts the maximum number of source packets that can
   be included in an FEC block.

   At the receiver side, the FEC decoder should wait at least for the
   duration of the repair window after getting the first packet in an
   FEC block to allow all the repair packets to arrive (The waiting time
   can be adjusted if there are missing packets at the beginning of the
   FEC block).  The FEC decoder can start decoding the already received
   packets sooner, however, it SHOULD NOT register an FEC decoding
   failure until it waits at least for the repair-window duration.

   This document specifies a new attribute to describe the size of the
   repair window in milliseconds and microseconds.

   The syntax for the attribute in ABNF is as follows:

        repair-window-line = "a=repair-window:" window-size unit CRLF

        window-size = %x31-39 *DIGIT

        unit = "ms" / "us"

   <unit> is the unit of time the repair window size is specified with.
   Two units are defined here:  'ms', which stands for milliseconds and
   'us', which stands for microseconds.

   The 'a=repair-window' attribute is a media-level attribute since each
   repair flow MAY have a different repair window size.

   Specifying the repair window size in an absolute time value does not
   necessarily correspond to an integer number of packets or exactly
   match with the clock rate used in RTP (in case of RTP transport)
   causing mismatches among subsequent repair windows.  However, in
   practice, this mismatch does not break anything in the FEC decoding

   process.

4.7.  Bandwidth Specification

   The bandwidth specification as defined in [RFC4566] denotes the
   proposed bandwidth to be used by the session or media.  The
   specification of bandwidth is OPTIONAL.

   In the context of the FEC Framework, the bandwidth specification can
   be used to express the bandwidth of the repair flows or the bandwidth
   of the session.  If included in the SDP, it SHALL adhere to the
   following rules:

   The session-level bandwidth for an FEC Framework instance or the
   media-level bandwidth for the individual repair flows MAY be
   specified.  In this case, it is RECOMMENDED to use the Transport
   Independent Application Specific (TIAS) bandwidth modifier [RFC3890]
   and the 'a=maxprate' attribute unless the Application Specific (AS)
   bandwidth modifier [RFC4566] is used.  The use of AS bandwidth
   modifier is NOT RECOMMENDED since TIAS allows the calculation of the
   bitrate according to the IP version and transport protocol, whereas
   AS does not.  Thus, in TIAS-based bitrate calculations, the packet
   size SHALL include all headers and payload, excluding the IP and UDP
   headers.  In AS-based bitrate calculations, the packet size SHALL
   include all headers and payload, plus the IP and UDP headers.

   For the ABNF syntax information of the TIAS and AS, refer to
   [RFC3890] and [RFC4566], respectively.


5.  Scenarios and Examples

   This section discusses the considerations for Session Announcement
   and Offer/Answer Models.

5.1.  Declarative Considerations

   In multicast-based applications, the FEC Framework Configuration
   Information pertaining to all FEC protection options available at the
   sender MAY be advertised to the receivers as a part of a session
   announcement.  This way, the sender can let the receivers know all
   available options for FEC protection.  Based on their needs, the
   receivers MAY choose protection provided by one or more FEC Framework
   instances and subscribe to the respective multicast session(s) to
   receive the repair flow(s).  Unless explicitly required by the CDP,
   the receivers SHOULD NOT send an answer back to the sender specifying
   their choices since this can easily overwhelm the sender particularly
   in large-scale multicast applications.

Internet-Draft       SDP Elements for FEC Framework       September 2010


5.2.  Offer/Answer Model Considerations

   In unicast-based applications, a sender and receiver MAY adopt the
   Offer/Answer Model [RFC3264] to set the FEC Framework Configuration
   Information.  In this case, the sender offers the options available
   to this particular receiver and the receiver answers back to the
   sender with its choice(s).

   Receivers supporting the SDP Capability Negotiation Framework
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation] MAY also use this
   framework to negotiate all or a subset of the FEC Framework
   parameters.

   The backward compatibility in Offer/Answer Model is handled as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc4756bis].


6.  SDP Examples

   This section provides SDP examples that can be used by the FEC
   Framework.

   [RFC5888] defines the media stream identification attribute ('mid')
   as a token in ABNF.  In contrast, the identifiers for the source
   flows MUST be integers and SHOULD be allocated starting from zero and
   increasing by one for each flow.  To avoid any ambiguity, using the
   same values for identifying the media streams and source flows is NOT
   RECOMMENDED, even when 'mid' values are integers.

   In the examples below, random FEC Encoding IDs will be used for
   illustrative purposes.  Artificial content for the SS-FSSI and FSSI
   will also be provided.

6.1.  One Source Flow, One Repair Flow and One FEC Scheme

                           Figure 1: Scenario #1

   In this example, we have one source video flow (mid:S1) and one FEC
   repair flow (mid:R1).  We form one FEC group with the "a=group:FEC-FR
   S1 R1" line.  The source and repair flows are sent to the same port
   on different multicast groups.  The repair window is set to 150 ms.

   FEC-FR S4 R3" and "a=group:FEC-FR S5 R4" lines.  The source and
   repair flows are sent to the same port on different multicast groups.
   The repair window is set to 200 ms and 400 ms for the first and
   second FEC group, respectively.

                           Figure 4: Scenario #4

   In this example, we have one source video flow (mid:S6) and two FEC
   repair flows (mid:R5 and mid:R6) with different preference levels.
   The source flow mid:S6 is protected by both of the repair flows.  We
   form two FEC groups with the "a=group:FEC-FR S6 R5" and "a=group:
   FEC-FR S6 R6" lines.  The source and repair flows are sent to the
   same port on different multicast groups.  The repair window is set to
   200 ms for both FEC groups.

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a weak threat if the SDP is modified in a way that it shows
   incorrect association and/or grouping of the source and repair flows.
   Such attacks can result in failure of FEC protection and/or
   mishandling of other media streams.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   receiver does integrity check on SDP to only trust SDP from trusted
   sources.  The receiver MUST also follow the security considerations
   of SDP [RFC4566].  For other general security considerations related
   to SDP, refer to [RFC4566].  For the security considerations related
   to the use of source address filters in SDP, refer to [RFC4570].

   The security considerations for the FEC Framework also apply.  Refer
   to [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] for details.


8.  IANA Considerations

   Note to the RFC Editor:  In the following, please replace "XXXX" with
   the number of this document prior to publication as an RFC.

8.1.  Registration of Transport Protocols

   This specification updates the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters registry as defined in Section 8.2.2 of [RFC4566].

   Specifically, it adds the following values to the table for the
   'proto' field.

   Type            SDP Name             Reference
   ------          ----------           -----------
   proto           UDP/FEC              [RFCXXXX]


   This specification also defines a class of new transport protocol
   identifiers.  For all existing identifiers <proto> (listed in the
   table for the 'proto' field in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters registry), this specification defines the identifier 'FEC/
   <proto>'.

8.2.  Registration of SDP Attributes

   This document registers new attribute names in SDP.

   SDP Attribute ("att-field"):
        Attribute name:     fec-source-flow
        Long form:          Pointer to FEC Source Flow
        Type of name:       att-field
        Type of attribute:  Media level
        Subject to charset: No
        Purpose:            Provide parameters for an FEC source flow
        Reference:          [RFCXXXX]
        Values:             See [RFCXXXX]

   SDP Attribute ("att-field"):
        Attribute name:     fec-repair-flow
        Long form:          Pointer to FEC Repair Flow
        Type of name:       att-field
        Type of attribute:  Media level
        Subject to charset: No
        Purpose:            Provide parameters for an FEC repair flow
        Reference:          [RFCXXXX]
        Values:             See [RFCXXXX]
