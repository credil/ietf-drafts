   that can be reused for conveying QoS information within Diameter.

   The defined QoS information includes data traffic parameters for
   describing a token bucket filter, bandwidth, defending and preemption
   priority, admission priority, application-level resource priority,
   per-hop behavior class, and DiffServ-aware Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering.

Internet-Draft               QoS Parameters                 January 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters
   that can be reused for conveying QoS information within the Diameter
   protocol.

   This document defines an initial QoS profile containing a set of QoS
   AVPs.

   The traffic model (TMOD) AVPs are containers consisting of four AVPs
   and is a way to describe the traffic source.

   o  rate (r)
   o  bucket size (b)
   o  peak rate (p)
   o  minimum policed unit (m)

   The encoding of <TMOD-1> and <TMOD-2> can be found in Section 3.1 and
   Section 3.2 and the semantic is described in [RFC2210] and in
   [RFC2215]. <TMOD-2> is, for example, needed by some DiffServ
   applications.  It is typically assumed that DiffServ EF traffic is
   shaped at the ingress by a single rate token bucket.  Therefore, a
   single TMOD parameter is sufficient to signal DiffServ EF traffic.
   However, for DiffServ AF traffic two sets of token bucket parameters
   are needed, one token bucket for the average traffic and one token
   bucket for the burst traffic.  [RFC2697] defines a Single Rate Three
   Color Marker (srTCM), which meters a traffic stream and marks its
   packets according to three traffic parameters, Committed Information
   Rate (CIR), Committed Burst Size (CBS), and Excess Burst Size (EBS),
   to be either green, yellow, or red.  A packet is marked green if it
   does not exceed the CBS, yellow if it does exceed the CBS, but not
   the EBS, and red otherwise.  [RFC2697] defines specific procedures
   using two token buckets that run at the same rate.  Therefore, two
   TMOD AVPs are sufficient to distinguish among three levels of drop
   precedence.  An example is also described in the appendix of
   [RFC2597].

   The <Preemption-Priority> AVP refers to the priority of a new flow
   compared with the <Defending-Priority> AVP of previously admitted
   flows.  Once a flow is admitted, the preemption priority becomes
   irrelevant.  The <Defending-Priority> AVP is used to compare with the
   preemption priority of new flows.  For any specific flow, its
   preemption priority is always less than or equal to the defending
   priority.

   The <Admission-Priority> AVP and <ALRP> AVP provide an essential way
   to differentiate flows for emergency services, ETS, E911, etc., and
   assign them a higher admission priority than normal priority flows

   and best-effort priority flows.

   Resource reservations might refer to a packet processing with a
   particular DiffServ per-hop behavior (PHB) [RFC2475] (using the <PHB-
   Class> AVP) or to a particular QoS class, e.g., a DiffServ-aware MPLS
   traffic engineering (DSTE) class type, as described in [RFC3564] and
   in [RFC4124], using the <DSTE-Class-Type> AVP.


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


3.  QoS Parameter Encoding

3.1.  TMOD-1 AVP

   The TMOD-1 AVP is obtained from [RFC2210] and [RFC2215].  The
   structure of the AVP is as follows:

                       TMOD-1  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                   { TMOD-Rate }
                                   { TMOD-Size }
                                   { Peak-Data-Rate }
                                   { Minimum-Policed-Unit }

3.1.1.  TMOD-Rate AVP

   The TMOD-Rate AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Float32 and contains the
   rate (r).

3.1.2.  TMOD-Size AVP

   The TMOD-Size AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Float32 and contains the
   bucket size (b).

3.1.3.  Peak-Data-Rate AVP

   The Peak-Data-Rate AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Float32 and contains
   the peak rate (p).

3.1.4.  Minimum-Policed-Unit AVP

   The Minimum-Policed-Unit AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains the minimum policed unit (m).

Internet-Draft               QoS Parameters                 January 2009


3.2.  TMOD-2 AVP

   A description of the semantic of the parameter values can be found in
   [RFC2215].  The TMOD-2 AVP is useful in a DiffServ environment.  The
   coding for the TMOD-2 AVP is as follows:

                       TMOD-2  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                   { TMOD-Rate }
                                   { TMOD-Size }
                                   { Peak-Data-Rate }
                                   { Minimum-Policed-Unit }

3.3.  Bandwidth AVP

   The Bandwidth AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Float32 and is measured
   in bytes of IP datagrams per second.

3.4.  Priority AVP

   The Priority AVP is a grouped AVP consisting of two AVPs, the
   Preemption-Priority and the Defending-Priority AVP.  A description of
   the semantic can be found in [RFC3181].


                       Priority  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                     { Preemption-Priority }
                                     { Defending-Priority }

3.4.1.  Preemption-Priority AVP

   The Preemption-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   it indicates the priority of the new flow compared with the defending
   priority of previously admitted flows.  Higher values represent
   higher priority.

3.4.2.  Defending-Priority AVP

   The Defending-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.
   Once a flow is admitted, the preemption priority becomes irrelevant.
   Instead, its defending priority is used to compare with the
   preemption priority of new flows.

3.5.  Admission-Priority AVP

   The Admission-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

   The admission control priority of the flow, in terms of access to
   network bandwidth in order to provide higher probability of call

   completion to selected flows.  Higher values represent higher
   priority.  A given admission priority is encoded in this information
   element using the same value as when encoded in the Admission-
   Priority AVP defined in Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp] (Admission Priority parameter).

3.6.  ALRP AVP

   The Application-Level Resource Priority (ALRP) AVP is a grouped AVP
   consisting of two AVPs, the ALRP-Namespace and the ALRP-Priority AVP.

   A description of the semantic of the parameter values can be found in
   [RFC4412] and in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].  The coding for
   parameter is as follows:


                       ALRP  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                 { ALRP-Namespace }
                                 { ALRP-Priority }

3.6.1.  ALRP-Namespace AVP

   The ALRP-Namespace AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

3.6.2.  ALRP-Priority AVP

   The ALRP-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

   [RFC4412] defines a resource priority header and established the
   initial registry.  That registry was later extended by
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].

3.7.  PHB-Class AVP

   The PHB-Class AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

   A description of the semantic of the parameter values can be found in
   [RFC3140].  The registries needed for usage with [RFC3140] already
   exist and hence no new registry needs to be created by this document.
   The encoding requires three cases need to be differentiated.  All
   bits indicated as "reserved" MUST be set to zero (0).

3.7.1.  Case 1: Single PHB

   As prescribed in [RFC3140], the encoding for a single PHB is the
   recommended DSCP value for that PHB, left-justified in the 16 bit
   field, with bits 6 through 15 set to zero.

3.7.2.  Case 2: Set of PHBs

   The encoding for a set of PHBs is the numerically smallest of the set
   of encodings for the various PHBs in the set, with bit 14 set to 1.
   (Thus for the AF1x PHBs, the encoding is that of the AF11 PHB, with
   bit 14 set to 1.)

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.7.3.  Case 3: Experimental or Local Use PHBs

   PHBs not defined by standards action, i.e., experimental or local use
   PHBs as allowed by [RFC2474].  In this case an arbitrary 12 bit PHB
   identification code, assigned by the IANA, is placed left-justified
   in the 16 bit field.  Bit 15 is set to 1, and bit 14 is zero for a
   single PHB or 1 for a set of PHBs.  Bits 12 and 13 are zero.

   Bits 12 and 13 are reserved either for expansion of the PHB
   identification code, or for other use, at some point in the future.

   In both cases, when a single PHBID is used to identify a set of PHBs
   (i.e., bit 14 is set to 1), that set of PHBs MUST constitute a PHB
   Scheduling Class (i.e., use of PHBs from the set MUST NOT cause
   intra-microflow traffic reordering when different PHBs from the set
   are applied to traffic in the same microflow).  The set of AF1x PHBs
   [RFC2597] is an example of a PHB Scheduling Class.  Sets of PHBs that
   do not constitute a PHB Scheduling Class can be identified by using
   more than one PHBID.

3.8.  DSTE-Class-Type AVP

   The DSTE-Class-Type AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  A
   description of the semantic of the parameter values can be found in
   [RFC4124].

   Currently, the values of alues currently allowed are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
   6, 7.  The value of zero (0) is marked as reserved in [RFC4124].
   Furthermore, the CLASSTYPE attribute in [RFC4124] is 32 bits in
   length with 29 bits reserved.


4.  Extensibility

   This document is designed with extensibility in mind given that
   different organizations and groups are used to define their own
   Quality of Service parameters.  This document provides an initial QoS
   profile with common set of parameters.  Ideally, these parameters
   should be used whenever possible but there are cases where additional
   parameters might be needed, or where the parameters specified in this
   document are used with a different semantic.  In that case it is
   advisable to define a new QoS profile that may consist of new
   parameters in addition to parameters defined in this document or an
   entirely different set of parameters.  Finally, it is also possible
   to register a specific QoS profile that defines a specific set of QoS
   values rather than parameters that need to be filled with values in
   order to be used.

   To enable the definition of new QoS profiles a 8 octet registry is
   defined field that is represented by a 4-octet vendor and 4-octet
   specifier field.  The vendor field indicates the type as either
   standards-specified or vendor-specific.  If the four octets of the
   vendor field are 0x00000000, then the value is standards-specified
   and the registry is maintained by IANA as Enterprise Numbers defined
   in [RFC2578], and any other value represents a vendor-specific Object
   Identifier (OID).  IANA created registry is split into two value
   ranges; one range uses the "Standards Action" and the second range
   uses "Specification Required" allocation policy.  The latter range is
   meant to be used by organizations outside the IETF.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  AVP Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate AVP codes for the following AVPs that
   are defined in this document.

5.2.  QoS Profile

   IANA is requested to create the following registry.

   The QoS Profile refers to a 64 bit long field that is represented by
   a 4-octet vendor and 4-octet specifier field.  The vendor field
   indicates the type as either standards-specified or vendor-specific.
   If the four octets of the vendor field are 0x00000000, then the value
   is standards-specified and the registry is maintained by IANA, and
   any other value represents a vendor-specific Object Identifier (OID).

   The specifier field indicates the actual QoS profile.  The vendor
   field 0x00000000 is reserved to indicate that the values in the
   specifier field are maintained by IANA.  This document requests IANA
   to create such a registry and to allocate the value zero (0) for the
   QoS profile defined in this document.

   For any other vendor field, the specifier field is maintained by the
   vendor.

   For the IANA maintained QoS profiles the following allocation policy
   is defined:
      0 to 511: Standards Action
      512 to 4095: Specification Required

   Standards action is required to depreciate, delete, or modify

Internet-Draft               QoS Parameters                 January 2009


   existing QoS profile values in the range of 0-511 and a specification
   is required to depreciate, delete, or modify existing QoS profile
   values in the range of 512-4095.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise any security concerns as it only defines
   QoS parameters and does not yet describe how they are exchanged in a
   AAA protocol.  Security considerations are described in documents
   using this specification.
