       Deprecating Language Tag Characters: RFC 2482 is Historic
                 draft-presuhn-rfc2482-historic-00.txt

Abstract

   RFC 2482, Language Tagging in Unicode Plain Text, described a
   mechanism for using special Unicode language tag characters to
   identify languages when needed without more general markup such as
   that provided by XML.  The Unicode Consortium has deprecated that
   facility and strongly recommends against its use.  RFC 2482 should be
   moved to Historic to reduce the possibility that Internet
   implementers would consider that system an appropriate mechanism for
   identifying languages.

Internet-Draft            RFC 2482 to Historic                 June 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 2482, Language Tagging in Unicode Plain Text [RFC2482], described
   a mechanism for using special Unicode language tag characters to
   identify languages when needed.  It was an idea whose time never
   quite came.  It has been superseded by whole-transaction language
   identification such as the MIME Content-language header [RFC3282] and
   more general markup mechanisms such as those provided by XML.  The
   Unicode Consortium has deprecated the language tag character facility
   and strongly recommends against its use.  RFC 2482 should be moved to
   Historic to reduce the possibility that Internet implementers would
   consider that tagging system an appropriate mechanism for identifying
   languages.

   A discussion of the status of the language tag characters and their
   applicability appears in Section 16.9 of the Unicode Standard
   [Unicode52].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Action

   RFC 2482 is deprecated and reclassified as Historic.  Internet
   protocols and Standards-track documents SHOULD NOT use the facilities
   described in that document.


3.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.]

   This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   By deprecating RFC 2482, we eliminate a facility that is no longer
   encouraged and supported by the Unicode Consortium and that may have
   been slightly risky in use if misinterpreted or if expectations of
   support were not met.  So, if this action has any effect on Internet
   security at all, it should be positive.
