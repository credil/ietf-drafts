      <t>This document outlines the negotiation and signaling protocols for
      RTC-Web client application implementation.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>An integral part of the success and adoption of the Real-Time
      Communications Web (RTC-WEB) will be the interoperability between
      RTC-Web applications running on different browsers or different versions
      of a browser. As browser features evolve, new codecs are deployed, and
      more advanced features are added, it is critical to have a negotiation
      framework between browsers to facilitate evolution of real time
      communications on the web. It is also important for negotiation in a
      backwards compatible way with legacy VoIP equipment. This specification
      proposes negotiation and signaling requirements for enabling broad
      interoperability capabilities for RTC-Web client applications.</t>

      <t>The negotiation and signaling requirements fit into a series of
      specifications have been created to address RTC-Web codec, NAT
      traversal, security, data transmission and use case requirements. More
      information on the RTC-Web can be found here:</t>

      <t>[TODO put links to supporting drafts here]</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This proposal supports an architecture where the negotiations happen
      directly between two browsers (or other RTC-Web client applications) or
      a model where the browser routes the negotiation via a third server that
      helps facilitate the negotiation. In the first model where
      communications are direct, it is assumed that ICE has already been used
      to set up a communication channel between the browsers that can be used
      for negotiation.</t>

      <t>While SIP is used in this proposal, it is a restricted subset of the
      SIP functionally for initiating and setting up RTP streams and
      rendezvous services for these messages.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Negotiation Requirements">
      <t>This section details the secure channel negotiation requirements for
      RTC-Web client applications. The requirements below originate from the
      RTC-Web NAT draft <xref
      target="I-D.cbran-jennings-rtc-web-nat"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="ICE">
        <t>It is plausible that many RTC-WEB client applications, such as web
        browsers will be deployed behind a NAT. To set up secure data plane
        sessions, and address the security requirements identified in <xref
        target="Security"></xref> all RTC-WEB client application
        implementations are REQUIRED to natively expose an implementation of
        either ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> or ICE-Lite (Section 2.7 of
        <xref target="RFC5245"></xref>). Implicit to implementing ICE, all
        RTC-WEB client applications are REQUIRED to implement Simple Traversal
        of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators
        (NATs) (STUN) <xref target="RFC3489"></xref> and Traversal Using
        Relays around NAT (TURN) <xref target="RFC5766"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Echoing from he RTC-Web NAT draft <xref
        target="I-D.cbran-jennings-rtc-web-nat"></xref>, ICE is REQUIRED be
        implemented and available natively from the RTC-Web client
        application. What this means via example is; if the RTC-Web client
        application happens to be a web browser, the web browser MUST
        implement ICE such that adheres to the RTC-Web NAT draft <xref
        target="I-D.cbran-jennings-rtc-web-nat"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Signaling Protocol Requirements">
      <t>This section covers the signaling protocol to be used by RTC-WEB
      applications. To ensure interoperability not just between RTC-WEB
      applications, but with legacy PBX phone systems as well, a small subset
      of SIP will be REQUIRED for all RTC-WEB client application
      implementations. In addition to the subset of SIP specification <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref>, RTC-WEB client application implementations
      will be REQUIRED to support DNS resolutions as specified in <xref
      target="RFC3263"></xref> and the offer/answer model with SDP as
      specified in <xref target="RFC3264"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Because the browsers only need to use a small subset of SIP, the
      specification assumes that a majority of SIP implementations will
      interoperate with the browsers.</t>

      <section title="Client Application SIP Requirements">
        <t>This section focuses on the subset of SIP functionality that will
        exist within all RTC-WEB client applications. The following User Agent
        Client (UAC) subset of the SIP specification <xref
        target="RFC3261"></xref> is REQUIRED.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>General User Agent Behavior - [Section 8]</t>

            <t>Registration - [Section 10]</t>

            <t>Client Transaction - [Section 17.1]</t>

            <t>Canceling a Request - [Section 9.1]</t>

            <t>Terminating a Session - [Section 15.1], [Section 15.1.1]</t>

            <t>3.XX Redirect Responses - [Section 8.1.3.4]</t>

            <t>TLS - [Section 26.3.1]</t>

            <t>Outbound Proxy</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Client Application Optional SIP Support">
        <t>In the SIP specification <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>, the SIP
        features listed below are required for all UAC implementations.
        RTC-WEB client applications are not a fully featured SIP UAC and will
        only be implementing a subset of the SIP specification. Thusly, unlike
        SIP UACs, the following list of SIP features is to be considered
        OPTIONAL for RTC-WEB client application implementations.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>INVITEs without an offer</t>

            <t>re-INVITEs &ndash; [Section 14.1]</t>

            <t>forking &ndash; [Section 19.3]</t>

            <t>S/MIME &ndash; [Section 23]</t>

            <t>SIPS URI Scheme &ndash; [Section 26.2.2]</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Required SIP Methods">
        <t>This section outlines the REQUIRED SIP methods for all RTC-WEB
        client applications.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>INVITE &ndash; <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> - Section 13</t>

            <t>REGISTER &ndash; <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> - Section
            10</t>

            <t>ACK - <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> - Section 13.2</t>

            <t>CANCEL - <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> - Section 13.2</t>

            <t>BYE - <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> - Section 13.2</t>

            <t>UPDATE &ndash; <xref target="RFC3311"></xref></t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multipart SIP Message Requirements">
        <t>For handling SIP messages RTC-WEB client applications are required
        to implement the multipart MIME handling scheme as specified in <xref
        target="RFC5621"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Identity Requirements">
        <t>Identity, for the purposes of this section, is defined as a SIP
        URI. There are two areas concerning SIP identity this specification
        will address.</t>

        <t>The first area covers validation of the message originator. To
        securely validate a the identity of a SIP message originator, all
        RTC-WEB client applications are REQUIRED to implement the mechanism
        specified in <xref target="RFC4474"></xref>.</t>

        <t>To support cases were the identify of a caller/callee may change,
        such as when a call is parked and transferred from the original callee
        to another party, all RTC-WEB client applications are REQUIRED to
        implement the identity mechanism specified in <xref
        target="RFC4916"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>implicitly
        REQUIRES the implementation of the UPDATE method as specified in <xref
        target="RFC3311"></xref></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Network Address Traversal">
        <t>RTC-WEB client applications MUST support Network Address Translator
        (NAT) traversal. This section will address SIP-related areas to
        support NAT traversal.</t>

        <t>As called for in the negotiation requirements; RTC-WEB client
        applications will implement STUN. To support client-managed
        connections, STUN-based keep-alives as specified in <xref
        target="RFC5626"></xref> are REQUIRED.</t>

        <t>When SIP is used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to
        the source address the request came from, and to the port written into
        the topmost Via header field value of the request. This behavior is
        not desirable when the RTC-WEB client application is behind a Network
        Address Translator (NAT). To address UDP traversal problem the "rport"
        extension as specified in <xref target="RFC3581"></xref> is
        REQUIRED.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Legacy VoIP Interoperability">
      <t>The RTC-Web negotiation requirements specify a discrete subset of the
      SIP specification. The discrete subset was chosen to implicitly enable
      broad interoperability between RTC-Web client applications and legacy
      VoIP systems.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes no request of IANA.</t>

      <t>Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
      RFC.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Because there are a number of security issues, considerations and
      requirements for RTC-WEB client applications there is a draft that
      specifically addresses the RTC-WEB application security considerations.
      This draft defers it's security considerations and requirements to the
      security considerations for RTC-Web draft <xref

          <abstract>
            <t>The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTC-Web) working group
            is tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time
            communications between Web browsers. The two major use cases for
            RTC-Web technology are real-time audio and/or video calls and
            direct data transfer. Unlike most conventional real-time systems
            (e.g., SIP-based soft phones) RTC-Web communications are directly
            controlled by some Web server, which poses new security
            challenges. For instance, a Web browser might expose a JavaScript
            API which allows a server to place a video call. Unrestricted
            access to such an API would allow any site which a user visited to
            "bug" a user's computer, capturing any activity which passed in
            front of their camera. This document defines the RTC-Web threat
            model and defines an architecture which provides security within
            that threat model.</t>
