<abstract>
<t>
	Internet mail was originally limited to 7-bit ASCII. Recent enhancements
	support Unicode's UTF-8 encoding in portions of a message. Full
	internationalization of electronic mail requires additional enhancement,
	including support for UTF-8 in user-oriented header fields, such as in
	the To, From, and Subject fields. This document specifies an enhancement
	to Internet mail that permits native UTF-8 support in the header and body
	of a message.
</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="INT">

<t>
    Internet mail distinguishes a message from its transport and further
divides a
	message between a header and a body <xref target="RFC5598" />. Internet
mail
	header fields contain a variety of strings that are intended to be
user-visible.
	The range of supported characters for these strings was originally limited
to
	a subset of <xref target="ASCII" />; globalization of the Internet
requires
	support of the much larger set contained in UTF-8 <xref
target="RFC5198"/>.
	Complex encoding alternatives to UTF-8, as an overlay to the existing
ASCII
	base, would introduce inefficiencies as well as opportunities for
processing
	errors. Native support for UTF-8 encoding <xref target="RFC3629"/>. is
widely
	available among systems now used over the Internet. Hence supporting this
	encoding directly within email is desired. This document specifies an
enhancement
	to Internet mail that permits the use of UTF-8 encoding, rather than only
ASCII,
	as the 	base form for header fields.
</t>
<t>
    This specification is based on a model of native, end-to-end support for
UTF-8,
	which uses an "8-bit clean" environment . Support for carriage across
legacy,
	7-bit infrastructure and for processing by 7-bit receivers requires
additional
	mechanisms that are not provided by this specification.

</t>
<section title="Brief Overview of Changes" anchor="BOC">
<t>
	This document updates email header [RFC5322] and MIME header [RFC2045].
	Email header value extends beyond ASCII, allowing UTF-8 encoding. MIME
	header lifts the prohibition against using content-transfer-encoding on
	all subtypes under composite-type "message/". Appendix A documents the
	derived ABNF rules that inherit support UTF-8, due to the update of ABNF
	introduces from this document.

<section title="Relation to Other Standards" anchor="relations">
<t>
	This document updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045" />.
	It removes the blanket ban on applying a content-transfer-encoding

	subtype MAY specify whether or not a content-transfer-encoding can
	be used for that subtype, with "cannot be used" as the default.

</t>


</section>

<section title="Background and History">
<t>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these
users throughout the world have names that are not normally expressed
with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would like to use more
or less their real names in their mailbox names. These users
are also likely to use non-ASCII text in their display<!-- common --> names
and subjects
of email messages, both received and sent.
This protocol specifies UTF-8 as the encoding to represent email header
field bodies.</t>

<t>The traditional format of email messages

<xref target="RFC5322"/> allows only ASCII characters in the
header fields of messages. This prevents users from having email addresses
that contain non-ASCII characters. It further forces non-ASCII text in
display <!-- common--> names, comments, and in free text (such as in the
"Subject:" field)
to be encoded (as required by MIME format <xref target="RFC2047" />). This
specification describes a change to the email message format that is related
to the SMTP message transport change described in the  associated documents
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis"/> and <xref
target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis"/>, and that
allows non-ASCII characters in most email header fields. These changes
affect
SMTP clients, SMTP servers, mail user agents (MUAs), list expanders,
gateways to other media, and all other processes that parse or handle
email messages.</t>

<t>As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis"/>,
an SMTP protocol extension "UTF8SMTP" is used to prevent the
transmission of messages with UTF-8 header fields to systems that
cannot handle such messages.
<!--
[[Note in Draft: Keyword related to UTF8SMTP  will be decided by WG before
publication.]]
-->

</t>

<t>
Use of this SMTP extension helps prevent the introduction of such
messages into message stores that might misinterpret, improperly display,
or mangle such messages. It should be noted that using an ESMTP extension
does not prevent transferring email messages with UTF-8 header fields to
other systems that use the email format for messages and that may not be
upgraded,  such as unextended POP and IMAP servers. Changes to these
protocols to handle UTF-8 header fields are addressed in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5721bis" /> and
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-5378bis" />.


</t>

<t>The objective for this protocol is to allow UTF-8 in email header fields.
<!--
    Issues such as how to handle messages containing UTF-8 header fields
that
    have to be delivered to systems that have not been upgraded to support
    this capability are discussed in <xref target="RFC5504"/>.

<section title="Terminology">
<t>
A plain ASCII string is fully compatible with <xref target="RFC5321" /> and
<xref target="RFC5322" />.
In this document, non-ASCII strings are UTF-8 strings if they are in header
which contain at least one &lt;UTF8-non-ascii&gt;.

<!-- Original paragraph
A plain ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8 string; see <xref
target="RFC3629"/>.
In this document, ordinary ASCII characters are UTF-8 characters
if they are in headers which contain &lt;UTF8-non-ascii&gt;s.</t>

<section title="Changes on Message Header Fields">
<t>SMTP clients can send header fields in UTF-8 format, if the
UTF8SMTP extension is advertised by the SMTP server or is permitted by other
transport mechanisms. </t>

<t>

This protocol does NOT change the <xref target="RFC5322"/> rules for
defining header field
names. The bodies of header fields are allowed to contain UTF-8 characters,
but the header field names themselves must contain only ASCII characters.
</t>
<t>
To permit UTF-8 characters in field values, the header definition in
<xref target="RFC5322"/> is extended to support the new format.
The following ABNF is defined to substitute those definitions in <xref
target="RFC5322"/>.
</t>
<t>
	The syntax rules not covered in this section remain as defined in <xref
target="RFC5322"/>.
</t>

<section title="UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization" anchor="Normalization">
<t>UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms of octets using the following
ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>, taken from <xref target="RFC3629"/>:
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[

UTF8-non-ascii  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

UTF8-4          =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>
  ]]></artwork>
</figure>

</t>
<t>
See <xref target="RFC5198"/> for a discussion of normalization; the use of
normalization form
<xref target="NFC" /> is RECOMMENDED. Actually, if one is going to do
internationalization properly, one of
the most often-cited goals is to permit people to spell their names
correctly. Since many
mailbox local parts reflect personal names, that principle applies as well.
And NFKC is
not recommended because it may lose information that is needed to correctly
spell some names <!-- except -->in unusual circumstances.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changes on MIME Headers" anchor="change_on_mime_header">
<t>
   This specification updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045"/>.
   <xref target="RFC2045"/> prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding
   to any subtypes of "message/".  This specification relaxes the rule -- it
allows
   newly defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding, and it
allows
   content-transfer-encoding for message/global (see <xref
target="utf8smtp"/>).
</t>



<t>
   Background: Normally, transfer of message/global will be done in
   8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will have "identity" encodings,
   that is, no decoding is necessary.

   In the case where a message containing a message/global is downgraded
   from 8-bit to 7-bit as described in <xref target="RFC1652"/>, an encoding
   may be applied to the message; if the message travels multiple times
   between a 7-bit environment and an environment implementing UTF8SMTP,
   multiple levels of encoding may occur. This is expected to be rarely
   seen in practice, and the potential complexity of other ways of dealing
   with the issue are thought to be larger than the complexity of allowing
   nested encodings where necessary.
</t>

</section>
<section title="Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322" anchor="syntax_change">
<t>The following rules are intended to extend the corresponding rules in
<xref target="RFC5322"/> in order to allow UTF-8 characters.

This means that all the <xref target="RFC5322"/> constructs that build upon
these will
permit UTF-8 characters, including comments and quoted strings. We do not
change the syntax
of &lt;atext&gt; in order to allow UTF-8 characters in &lt;addr-spec&gt;.
This would
also allow UTF-8 characters in &lt;message-id&gt;, which is not allowed due
to the limitation
described in <xref target="TraceFieldLimit" />. Instead, &lt;uAtext&gt; is
added to meet this requirement.

Note, however, this does not remove any constraint on the character set of
protocol elements;
for instance, all the allowed values for timezone in the "Date:" header
fields are still expressed in ASCII.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
<t>
	If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and an ASCII mailbox
	address, a digital certificate that identifies that user may have
	both addresses in the identity. Having multiple email addresses as
	identities in a single certificate is already supported in
	PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure for X.509 Certificates) <xref
target="RFC5280" />
	and OpenPGP <xref target="RFC3156" />.
</t>
<t>
	Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to encode a single character,
	internationalized local parts and header value may cause mail addresses to
	become longer. As specified in <xref target="RFC5322"/>, each line of
	characters MUST be no more than 998 octets, excluding the CRLF. On the
other
	hand, MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) processes that parse, store, or handle
email
	addresses or local parts must take extra care not to overflow buffers,
	truncate addresses,	or exceed storage allotments. Also, they must take
care,
	when comparing, to use the entire lengths of the addresses.
</t>
<t>
	There are lots of ways of using UTF-8 to represent something equivalent
	or similar to a particular displayed character or group of characters,
	then filtering systems can be bypassed by using one of the variants to
	avoid detection while still reaching the end user with largely the same
	original effect. This normalization is described in <xref
target="Normalization" />.

</t>

<t>

The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature systems such as
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP is discussed in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis"/>, Section 14.
