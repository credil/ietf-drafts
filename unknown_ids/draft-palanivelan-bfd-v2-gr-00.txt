1.Introduction

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol [BFD] provides a 
   mechanism for liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems. 
   It is intended to provide low-overhead, short-duration detection of 
   failures in the path between adjacent forwarding engines, including 
   the interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible the 
   forwarding engines themselves.  

   It operates independently of media,data protocols,and routing protocols.
   An additional goal is to provide a single mechanism that can be used for
   liveness detection over any media, at any protocol layer, with a wide 
   range of detection times and overhead, to avoid a proliferation of 
   different methods. 

   The extensions introduced in this draft for bfd shall aid in bfd 
   complementing the GR capabilities of protocols such as ospf and also in 
   providing a consistent behavior for planned/unplanned restarts 
   irrespective of the underlying protocols.


2.Overview

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) specification defines a
   protocol with simple and specific semantics.  Its sole purpose is to
   verify connectivity between a pair of systems, for a particular data
   protocol across a path (which may be of any technology, length, or
   OSI layer).  The promptness of the detection of a path failure can be 
   controlled by trading off protocol overhead and system load with
   detection times.

   The extensions introduced in this draft for bfd shall aid in bfd 
   complementing the GR capabilities of protocols such as ospf and also 
   in providing a consistent behavior for planned/unplanned restarts 
   for the underlying protocols.

3.Motivations

   Though the existing drafts discuss bfd interactions with applications
   with Graceful Restart and ways of implementing in serving successful GR,
   the drafts itself have some exceptions and caveats applied.

   This draft in particular discusses the issues in the following scenarios 
   and provides a generic solution that would scale for future applications.

   *	Unplanned restart.
   *	Planned restart with a control protocol such as ISIS,
        which cannot signal GR. 
   *	BFD co-existing with BB configs

Internet Draft         draft-palanivelan-bfd-v2-gr-00.txt        Dec 2008

   
   This document tries to address the above issues in specific and Graceful 
   restart mechanism in general, for bfd.

	3.1 Planned and Unplanned Restarts with control protocols

	The existing bfd drafts suggest administratively disabling bfd prior 
	to the start of GR. But, this works only for planned restarts and not 
	for unplanned restarts. This also does not work for a protocol such 
	as isis that cannot signal a planned restart.

	For a Planned restart where a control protocol can signal before 
	restarting, if a BFD session failure occurs during the restart, it is 
	recommended in the existing draft(s) that, such a planned restart 
	SHOULD NOT be aborted and the session failure SHOULD NOT result in a 
	topology change being signaled in the control protocol.

	Control protocols that cannot signal a planned restart depend on the
	recently restarted system to signal the Graceful Restart prior to the
	control protocol adjacency timeout. In most cases, whether the 
	restart is planned or unplanned, it is likely that the BFD session 
	will time out prior to the onset of Graceful Restart, and a topology 
	change SHALL be signaled.

	This type of implementation shall impact non-stop routing and non-stop 
	forwarding support using GR-enabled protocols and provides an 
	opportunity to review the existing bfd implementations and improve.

	3.2 BFD Co-existing with BB configs

	In a real time scenario with Broadband configurations,it is highly 
	likely that the bfd sessions do not survive a Graceful restart.
	
	Assume a router at PE that has active DHCP sessions with a large 
	number of clients (say 16k). During a planned restart, it is also 
	likely that the DHCP clients request for renewal of IP address to the
	server (restarting router) at that time. When the router is 
	restarting, these requests do not reach the router. But, when these
	requests reach the router when the router has just come up, 
	it will treat these requests at a high priority and responds to them.

        When we have thousands of such requests to the restarting router, 
	the router shall spend a major part of its first second of uptime 
	in addressing these requests. In this scenario, a control protocol 
	like ospfv2 that has GR enabled, shall withstand the restart for the 
	specified restart interval (as it will be in seconds) and it is 
 	likely to survive the restart in maintaining its forwarding plane.
        In the same scenario, if bfd is enabled for ospfv2, for an unplanned

	restart, the (bfd) neighbor router will be expecting bfd control 
	packets in milliseconds interval and during the restart process, 
	is likely to timeout, also impacting the associated ospfv2 adjacency 
	and resulting in loss of traffic.

	The scenario will be the same for bfd with a protocol such as is-is,
	where the problem is likely to be seen for a planned/unplanned 
	restarts.


4.Extensions to BFD

  This draft introduces a new diag value to indicate that the neighbor is 
  restarting and provisions to configure graceful restart timers.The modified 
  Generic BFD Control Packet Format shown below introduces two additional 
  sections "My Restart Interval" and "Your Restart Interval".

	4.1 Version (Vers)

	The version of bfd defined by this draft, that has support for gr
	configuration and a diag for neighbor restarting state, shall have 
	a value of 2.
  

	4.2 Diagnostic (Diag)

	A diagnostic code specifying the local system's reason for the last 
	change in session state.

A.Palanivelan                                                   [Page 5]


Internet Draft         draft-palanivelan-bfd-v2-gr-00.txt        Dec 2008

	
	A new diag value 9 for "Neighbor Restarting" is introduced in this 
	draft.Values are:

        	0 -- No Diagnostic
        	1 -- Control Detection Time Expired
	        2 -- Echo Function Failed
        	3 -- Neighbor Signaled Session Down
	        4 -- Forwarding Plane Reset
        	5 -- Path Down
	        6 -- Concatenated Path Down
        	7 -- Administratively Down
	        8 -- Reverse Concatenated Path Down
		9 -  Neighbor Restarting
	       10-31 -- Reserved for future use

      	This field allows remote systems to determine the reason that the
      	previous session failed.

	4.3 My Restart Interval   

	This is the restart interval,in microseconds, of the transmitting
	system advertised to the remote system. In the case of a restart (of 
	transmitting system), the remote system is  xpected to keep the bfd
	session up for this duration of time.

	4.4 Your Restart Interval   

	The restart interval,in microseconds, received from the corresponding
	remote system. In the case of a restart (of remote system), the 
	transmitting system is expected to keep the bfd session up for this 
	duration of time.


5.Theory of Operation 

 The system that has support for high-availability, when using a routing 
 protocol that is GR enabled, shall continue to forward traffic during a 
 restart.when bfd is enabled on such a protocol, it is expected to assist 
 the process than disturb it.

 With current bfd implementations, the bfd sessions do not survive a restart
 under different conditions.An Unplanned restart or a planned restart with a
 protocol such as isis that cannot signal about restart, are some of the 
 conditions where bfd config is set to impact a high-availability situation.
 
 Though there are certain implementations adopted by various companies to 
 make bfd survive restarts, there is no uniform method of achieving this and 
 is likely to fail when interop with routers from other companies.This draft
 proposes a standard way of achieving this objective.

Internet Draft         draft-palanivelan-bfd-v2-gr-00.txt        Dec 2008
 

 This draft recommends the introduction of a new diag value (9 for "Neighbor 
 restarting"), new version (2 for gr supported bfd) and two additional 
 sections to the bfd packet format.This design is expected to provide a 
 capability to bfd in withstanding restart scenarios, in complementing the 
 associated protocol.This shall work consistently irespective of the bfd 
 mode or protocol or the type of restart.
 
 This bfd implementation shall have its version field set to 2, that 
 indicates the support for GR.The two new sections to the bfd packet 
 format,"My Restart Interval" and "Your Restart interval" shall be used to
 exchange the GR timers info. between the systems.

 "My Restart Interval" is the time interval in microseconds,that this system 
 expects its remote system  to wait for, before bringing down its bfd session 
 with this system.
 
 "Your Restart Interval" is the time interval in microseconds, specified by 
 the remote system, that it expects this system, to wait for, before bringing
 down its bfd session with this system.
 
 The initial bfd packet exhange from the system to remote system shall have 
 the configured value for the "My Restart Interval" or 0.The "Your Restart 
 Interval" will reflect the value received in "My Restart Inteval" from the
 corresponding remote system or is Zero if value is unknown.A value of Zero
 for "Your Restart Interval" shall mean that the bfd gr is diabled at the 
 remote end and similarly a value of Zero for "My Restart Interval" shall 
 mean that bfd gr is disabled at the transmitting system.This effectively 
 indicates to the other system if there is a requirement for it to wait for
 "restart interval" before timer expiry or not,but doesn't limit the system 
 to act as a gr-helper.In other words, all systems with bfdv2 configurations 
 shall act as GR helpers.


 Once the packet exchanges are complete and the bfd sessions are up,every bfd 
 session will have info, about the time interval, its remote system will wait
 during a Restart and also the time interval this system has to wait,when the  
 remote system restarts.The "My restart interval" value can be modified after 
 the session is up,and in this case, the packet exchanges shall sync up the  
 restart interval times (My and Your) on both the sides appropriately.
 
 The "My Restart Interval" configured shall have a value of  0 or a value more
 than its (Tx interval * Multiplier) value.The system shall not allow 
 configuration of any value between these values.
 
 For Planned restarts, with bfd sessions succesfully up with a protocol such 
 as ospfv2 and gr enabled,ospf shall signal its adjacent neighbor (al o a 
 ospfv2-bfd neighbor) that a restart is about to begin. The bfd diag at the 
 transmitting system (Restarter) shall be set to a value of 9 (Neighbor 
 Restarting) if its "My Restart Interval" has a value other than 0, and bfd 
 shall maintain its neighborship with the remote system for "Your Restart

 Interval" time(at remote neighbor) and the remote system shallnot bring down 
 the adjacency,knowing that the neighbor is restarting (known through the
 diag value).  
 
 For Planned restarts, with bfd sessions succesfully up with a protocol such 
 as isis and gr enabled,isis shall not signal its adjacent neighbor (also a 
 isis-bfd neighbor) that a restart is about to begin.Here again, the remote 
 system shall get to know that the other end is restarting,only after the 
 restart begins.The bfd diag at the transmitting system (Restarter) shall be 
 set to a value of 9 (Neighbor Restarting) if its "My Restart Interval" has 
 a value other than 0, and bfd shall maintain its neighborship with the 
 remote system for "Your Restart Interval" time (at remote neighbor) and the
 remote system shall not bring down the adjacency,knowing that the neighbor
 is restarting (known through the diag value).
 
 For Unplanned restarts,the system cannot signal to its neighbor that a 
 restart is about to begin.In this scenario, Once the restart begins, the 
 system will signal the restart,at the first possible instance.The bfd diag 
 at the transmitting system(Restarter) shall be set to a value of 9 
 (Neighbor Restarting)if its "My Restart Interval" has a value other than 0,
 and bfd shall maintain its neighborship with the remote system for "Your 
 Restart Interval" time (at remote neighbor) and the remote system shall not
 bring down the adjacency,knowing that the neighbor is restarting (known 
 through the diag value). It may also be noted that attempting a GR for 
 unplanned restart may not be a good idea, since the router may not properly
 prepare for a restart.The implementators,in this case,shall optionally 
 provide a knob to turn the option off.

6.Security Considerations 

 Security considerations discussed in [BFD], [BFD-1HOP] and [BFD-MHOP] 
 apply to this document. 

7.IANA Considerations 

 This document currently defines a Diag value of 9 to be used to specify 
 "Neighbor Restarting" 
	
 This document introduces two new sections "My Restart Interval" and "Your 
 Restart Interval" to the bfd generic packet format.
