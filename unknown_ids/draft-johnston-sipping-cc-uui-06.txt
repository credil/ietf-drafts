Abstract

   Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User
   Information Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed.  As
   networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this
   data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability
   to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency.
   This extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints
   implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN services.
   This document discusses requirements and approaches and recommends a
   new header field be standardized.  Example use cases include an
   exchange between two user agents, retargeting by a proxy, and
   redirection.  An example application is in an Automatic Call

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                November 2008


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) in ISDN interworking scenarios using SIP [RFC3261].
   Specifically, we discuss the transport of call control related ITU-T
   Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE) [Q931] data in SIP.
   Q.931 UUI is widely used in the PSTN today in contact center and call
   centers which are transitioning away from ISDN to SIP.  This
   extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints implementing
   similar services and interworking with ISDN services.

   Part of the definition of this ISDN service is that the UUI
   information is not known and understood by the ISDN network that
   transports it.  This is for two reasons.  Firstly, this supports a
   strict layering of protocols and data.  Providing information and
   understanding of the data to the transport layer would not provide
   any benefits and instead could create cross layer coupling and
   increase the complexity of the system.  Secondly, either the
   originator or terminator of the service might be a simple PSTN
   gateway designed for scalability and lowest cost.  As a result, it is
   not able or desirable for this device to understand the information
   but instead the goal is to pass the information as efficiently as
   possible to another application which does understand the data.  Both
   of these arguments still apply to SIP, especially when one or both
   endpoints are gateways.

   In the future, where both endpoints are intelligent SIP user agents,
   it may be possible for them to understand and interpret the UUI data.
   There may be some cases where the UUI information is relevant to SIP.
   In this case, it might be worthwhile attempting to map UUI data to an
   appropriate SIP header field or to standardize a new header field.
   However, the requirements and use cases for this are different enough
   from those described in this document that these two situations
   should be examined separately.  This document looks only at the
   requirements and mechanisms for replicating the existing, widely used
   and deployed ISDN UUI service.

   First, the requirements are discussed with use cases.  Five different
   use case call flows are discussed.  Then, three mechanisms are
   discussed and compared.  The Appendix contains a header field
   definition which meets all the requirements.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119

   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   This section discusses the requirements for the transport of call
   control related user to user information (UUI).  We define call
   control UUI as information that is generated, transported, and
   consumed at the time of call setup (i.e. during a pending INVITE
   transaction).  The information can be used for call routing,
   alerting, call distribution, or simply rendering.  The exact usage
   and semantics of call control UUI is out of scope - SIP is simply
   providing the transport function for this that ISDN Provides in the
   PSTN.  Non-call control UUI can be sent using the INFO method and not
   using the extensions described in this specification.

   REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) to insert and
   receive ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (referred to as
   UUI) data in SIP call setup requests and responses.

      SIP messages covered by this include INVITE requests and end-to-
      end responses to the INVITE, which includes 18x and 200 responses.

   REQ-2: The mechanism will allow UAs to insert and receive ITU-T Q.931
   User to User Information Element (referred to as UUI) data in SIP
   call teardown requests and responses.

      Q.931 UUI supports inclusion in release and release completion
      messages.  SIP messages covered by this include BYE and 200 OK
      responses to a BYE.

   REQ-3: The mechanism will allow UUI to be inserted and retrieved in
   SIP redirects to INVITEs.

      SIP messages covered by this include 3xx responses to INVITE and
      REFER requests.

   REQ-4: The mechanism will allow UUI to be able to survive proxy
   retargeting.

      Retargeting is a common method of call routing in SIP, and must
      not result in the loss of user to user information.

   REQ-5: The mechanism will allow the UUI to be transported directly in
   the SIP message.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                November 2008


      Passing a pointer or link to the UUI information will not meet the
      real-time processing considerations.

   REQ-6: The mechanism will minimize reliance on SIP extensions or
   uncommon SIP behavior.

   REQ-7: The mechanism will allow the inserter of UUI to be sure that
   the recipient understands the call control UUI mechanism.

      Understanding the mechanism means that the UAS will extract and
      utilize the UUI information transported.  Understanding the
      protocol, format, and nature of the actual UUI data is not covered
      by this requirement.


4.  Use Cases

   This section discusses four uses cases for the transport of call
   control related user to user information.  What is not discussed here
   is the transport of non-call control UUI which can be done using the
   SIP INFO method.  These use cases help explain the requirements from
   the previous section.

4.1.  User Agent to User Agent

   In this scenario, the originator UA includes UUI in the INVITE sent
   through a proxy to the terminating UA.  The terminator can use the
   UUI in any way.  If it is an ISDN gateway, it could map the UUI into
   the appropriate Q.931 element.  Alternatively, it might render the
   information to the user, or use it for alerting or as a lookup for a
   screen pop.  In this case, the proxy does not need to understand the
   UUI mechanism, but normal proxy rules should result in the UUI being
   forwarded without modification.  This call flow is shown in Figure 1.

              Originator              Proxy             Terminator
                   |                    |                    |
                   |   INVITE (UUI) F1  |                    |
                   |------------------->|   INVITE (UUI) F2  |
                   |      100 Trying F3 |------------------->|
                   |<-------------------|         200 OK F4  |
                   |          200 OK F5 |<-------------------|
                   |<-------------------|                    |
                   |  ACK F6            |                    |
                   |------------------->|            ACK F7  |
                   |                    |------------------->|

   This call flow utilizes REQ-1.

4.2.  Proxy Retargeting

   In this scenario, the originator UA includes UUI in the INVITE sent
   through a proxy to the terminating UA.  The proxy retargets the
   INVITE, sending it to a different termination UA.  The UUI
   information is then received and processed by the terminating UA.
   This call flow is shown in Figure 2.

                   |                    |                    |
                   |   INVITE (UUI) F1  |                    |
                   |------------------->|   INVITE (UUI) F2  |

                   |<-------------------|         200 OK F4  |
                   |          200 OK F5 |<-------------------|
                   |<-------------------|                    |
                   |  ACK F6            |                    |
                   |------------------->|            ACK F7  |
                   |                    |------------------->|

   This call flow utilizes REQ-1 and REQ-4.

4.3.  Redirection

   In this scenario, UUI is inserted by a redirect server.  The UUI is
   then included in the INVITE sent by the Originator to the Terminator.
   In this case, the Originator does not necessarily need to support the
   UUI mechanism but does need to support the SIP redirection mechanism
   used to include the UUI information.

              Originator          Redirect Server        Terminator
                   |                    |                    |
                   |          INVITE F1 |                    |
                   |------------------->|                    |

                   |            ACK F3  |                    |
                   |------------------->|                    |
                   |  INVITE (UUI) F4   |                    |
                   |---------------------------------------->|

                   |  ACK F6                                 |

   Figure 3.  Call flow with UUI exchanged between Redirect Server and
   Terminator

   This call flow utilizes REQ-1 and REQ-3.

   A common application of this call flow is an Automatic Call
   Distributer (ACD) in a PSTN contact center.  The originator would be
   a PSTN gateway.  The ACD would act as a Redirect Server, inserting
   UUI based on called number, calling number, time of day, and other
   information.  The resulting UUI would be passed to the agent's
   handset which acts as the Terminator.  The UUI could be used to
   lookup information rendered to the agent at the time of call
   answering.

4.4.  Referral

   In this scenario, a Referrer UA causes an INVITE to be generated
   between the Originator and Terminator with UUI information inserted
   by the Referrer UA.  Note that this REFER [RFC3515] could be part of
   a transfer operation or it might be unrelated to an existing call,
   such as out-of-dialog REFER call control.  In some cases, this call
   flow is used in place of the redirection call flow, but where
   immediately upon answer, the REFER is sent.  This scenario is shown
   in Figure 4.

   Some scenarios involving referral have been proposed to use a REFER
   sent during an early dialog.  This NOT RECOMMENDED call flow is shown
   in Figure 5.  This flow is not recommended due to the number of
   messages exchanged (due to the REFER, CANCEL, and 487 responses) and
   the sending of the REFER in the early dialog.  Also, there are race
   conditions that can occur if a 200 OK to the INVITE is received by
   the Originator while the REFER is in progress.

5.  Possible Mechanisms

   Three possible mechanisms for transporting UUI will be described:
   MIME body, URI parameter, and header field transport.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                November 2008


5.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC2976]., was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call
   flows in the previous section show, the information is related to an
   attempt to establish a session and must be passed with the session
   setup request (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or session
   termination requests.  As a result, it is not possible to use INFO in
   these cases.

5.2.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to transport the UUI information as a MIME
   body.  This is in keeping with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in
   which MIME bodies are used to transport ISUP information.  Since the
   INVITE will normally have an SDP message body, the resulting INVITE
   with SDP and UUI will be multipart MIME.  The insertion of a UUI
   message body by a redirect server or in a REFER is difficult.  The
   body would need to be encoded in the Contact URI of the 3xx response
   or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.  For example:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
   application/uui&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
   </allOneLine>

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

   The MIME body approach meets REQs 1-5.  However, it does not meet
   REQ-6 as support for Multipart MIME and escaped bodies in URIs is
   uncommon in SIP UAs.

5.3.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI as a URI parameter
   into the Contact or Refer-To URI.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   An INVITE sent to this Contact URI would contain UUI in the Request-



Johnston & McMillen       Expires May 28, 2009                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                November 2008


   URI of the INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that a URI
   parameter will not survive retargeting by a proxy as shown in Figure
   2.  That is, if the URI is included with an Address of Record instead
   of a Contact URI, the URI parameter will not be copied over to the
   Contact URI, resulting in the loss of the information.  As a result,
   this approach does not meet REQ-4.

5.4.  Header Field Approach

   Another approach that has been proposed is to use a header field to
   transport the UUI information.  The header field would be included in
   INVITE requests and responses and BYE requests and responses, and
   would pass transparently through proxies.  For redirection, the
   header field would be escaped into the Contact or Refer-To URI.  This
   is commonly supported in UAs due to call transfer use cases.  As a
   result, the header field approach supports REQs 1-6.  In order to
   meet REQ-7, a SIP feature tag is needed which can be included in
   Supported and Require header fields.

   The Call-Info header field is related to the UUI information.
   However, there are a number of important differences:

      Call-Info is typically used for rendering to the user.  While some
      of the UUI information may ultimately be rendered to the user,
      most of the UUI information will be consumed by the end device.

      Call-Info usually contains a URI pointer the information instead
      of the actual information itself which does not REQ-5.  It could
      be possible to use a data URI to carry the UUI directly in this
      header field.

      The use of Call-Info for interworking to and from ISDN networks
      seems problematic.

   Overall, the overloading of the Call-Info header field for carrying
   interworked UUI does not seem like a good idea.  A separate header
   field allows for clear policy and authorization rules to be used.
   For these reasons, a separate header field needs to be defined,
   described here as User-to-User.  For example, here is an example
   User-to-User header field from message F1 in Figure 1:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex

   For example, here is an escaped User-to-User header field from the
   redirection response F2 of Figure 3:

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                November 2008


   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex>
   </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE F5 would contain the User-to-User header field
   of the previous example.

   An escaped User-to-User header field from the REFER message response
   F1 of Figure 4:

   <allOneLine>
   Refer-To: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex>
   </allOneLine>

   This would result in the INVITE F4 containing the User-to-User header
   field of the first example.


6.  Recommendation

   The recommendation is to define a new SIP header field "User-to-User"
   to transport UUI information in ISDN interworking applications since
   this mechanism best supports the requirements.  A SIP feature tag
   "uui" also needs to be defined so that it can be used in Supported
   and Require header fields to meet REQ-6.

   The format of the UUI information is a topic of future
   standardization.  Currently, UUI is proprietary, requiring
   coordinated configuration between servers.  Standardizing the format
   or providing content tags would provide additional benefits.


7.  Appendix - Syntax for UUI Header Field

   Editor's Note: Eventually this text will move to a SIP Working Group
   document to define the new header field.

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.

   Current usage is to interoperate with ISDN User to User Signaling
   (UUS), a supplementary service in which manufacturer specific
   information is transported via the codeset 0 User-user Information
   IE.  Three services are defined: service 1, service 2, and service 3.
   This draft only addresses the SIP equivalent of service 1 although it
   could easily be expanded later to address services 2 and 3.  UUS



Johnston & McMillen       Expires May 28, 2009                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                November 2008


   Service 1 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call setup
   and clearing within the following Q.931 call control messages: SETUP,
   ALERT, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, RELEASE, and RELEASE COMPLETE.  UUS
   Service 2 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call
   establishment (between ALERT and CONNECT) via the USER INFORMATION
   message.  This service usually has a maximum of 2 USER INFORMATION
   messages in each direction.  UUS Service 3 involves user to user
   signaling exchanged on an active call via the USER INFORMATION
   message.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.

         UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
         uui-data    = token
         uui-param   = enc-param | generic-param
         enc-param   = "encoding=" ("hex" | token)

   Only one User-to-User header field may be present in a request or
   response.

   The only defined parameter for the User-to-User header field is the
   encoding parameter. "encoding=hex" is used to indicate that the UUI
   information is encoded as hex digits per the ISDN specification.  The
   first octet is the protocol discriminator).  Other encoding methods
   of encoding MAY also be standardized.

   The UUI data MUST be less than 129 octets in length.  This is because
   ISDN limits UUI to 128 octets in length plus the single octet
   protocol discriminator.  Transporting UUI longer than 128 octets will
   result in interoperability failures when interworking with ISDN.

7.1.  IANA Considerations

7.1.1.  Registration of Header Field

   This document defines a new SIP header field named "User-to-User".

   The following row shall be added to the "Header Fields" section of
   the SIP parameter registry:


                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | Header Name      | Compact Form | Reference |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | User-to-User     |              | [RFCXXXX] |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   the eventual SIP Working Group document.

7.1.2.  Registration of Header Field Parameter

   This document defines a parameter for the header field defined in the
   preceding section.  The header field "User-to-User" can contain the
   parameter "encoding".

   The following rows shall be added to the "Header Field Parameters and
   Parameter Values" section of the SIP parameter registry:


   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Header Field     | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | User-to-User     | encoding       | No                | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   the eventual SIP Working Group document.

7.1.3.  Registration of SIP Option Tag

   This specification registers a new SIP option tag, as per the
   guidelines in Section 27.1 of [RFC3261].

   This document defines the SIP option tag "uui".

   The following row has been added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:

   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name       | Description                              | Reference |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | uui        | This option tag is used to indicate that | [RFCXXXX] |
   |            | a UA supports and understands the        |           |
   |            | User-to-User header field.               |           |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   the eventual SIP Working Group document.


8.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can be exchanged over SIP on a hop-by-hop or
   end-to-end basis.  In some cases, UUI may contain private information



Johnston & McMillen       Expires May 28, 2009                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                November 2008


   that would require confidentiality and message integrity.  Standard
   SIP security mechanisms can be used to secure this header field.  For
   example, TLS transport can provide these properties over a single
   hop.  For multiple hop or end-to-end confidentiality and integrity
   protection, S/MIME can be utilized.

   Received User-to-User information should only be trusted if it is
   authenticated or received within a trust domain.  For example,
   Spec-T, defined in [RFC3324] could be used to define a trust domain.
   When utilized by a gateway to map information to or from ISDN Q.931,
   appropriate policy should be applied based on the PSTN trust domain.
