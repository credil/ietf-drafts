  ALTO Deployment Considerations: Configuration and Monitoring by ISPs
                      draft-sun-deployment-00.txt

Abstract

   As ALTO specification continues in the ALTO Working Group and some
   applications start to conduct integration with ALTO, more ISPs start
   to evaluate key issues in the deployment of ALTO in their networks.
   In this document, we discuss key issues that an ISP needs to consider
   when deploying ALTO.  In particular, we disucss issues on how to
   configure ALTO information as well as how to monitor the
   effectiveness of ALTO.

Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


1.  Introduction

   A basic service of ALTO is to provide information from network
   service providers to applications, in order to improve network
   efficiency and application performance.  Some applications start to
   or have shown interests to conduct integration with ALTO.  Some major
   ISPs (e.g., China Telecom) are in the process of deploying production
   ALTO services in some of their production networks.  As a result,
   more ISPs start to evaluate key issues in the deployment of ALTO in
   their networks.  Thus, a document highlighting some key issues that
   an ISP should consider in the deployment process can be a highly
   valuable reference.

   The objective of this document is to provide such a reference.  The
   document draws on many valuable discussions in the ALTO mailing list
   as well as the predecessor p2pi mailing list.  In addition, it draws
   on the trial experiences of multiple ISPs (e.g.,
   [CTTrial,ComcastTrial].

   The deployment of ALTO involves both ISPs and network applications.
   We can identify four major issues in ALTO deployment:

   1.  How does an ISP deploy and configure its ALTO servers?
       Specifically, an ALTO Server provides the Network Map and the
       Cost Map. How does an ISP configure these maps?  Where does an
       ISP deploy ALTO servers?

   2.  Which application entities fetch ALTO information?

   3.  How does an application integrate ALTO information into its
       decision process?

   4.  How does an ISP (potentially with collaboration from
       applications) monitor the deployment of ALTO, so that the ISP can
       better understand the status as well as the policy impacts of its
       ALTO deployment?

   This document focuses more on the ISP perspective.  Therefore, it
   focuses more on the first and fourth issues.  There are additional
   deployment documents in the ALTO working group that focus more on the
   second issue and third issue.  Our document is complementary to these
   other documents.

Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


2.1.  Server Placement

2.1.1.  Optimization Area

   An ISP deploys ALTO service to optimize traffic for a given network
   area.  We define a network area for which traffic need be optimized
   using the ALTO service as an optimization area.  A typical
   optimization objective of an ISP is to reduce the inbound and
   outbound traffic across the optimization area, due to the higher cost
   of such traffic.

   An optimization area can be an access network, a MAN, or a larger
   network consisting of both access works and MANs.  An ISP with a
   relatively small network can define a single optimization area and
   deploy an ALTO server for the area.

   An ISP with a larger network may partition its network into multiple
   optimization areas.  Each optimization area may include one or more
   MANs.  Alternatively, the ISP may choose to use a large optimization
   area and distribute a group of ALTO servers.

2.1.2.  Server Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance

2.2.  Network and Cost Map Configuration

   The key components for an ISP to configure when it deploys its ALTO
   service are the Network Map and Cost Map. They have impacts on both
   the load and the effectiveness of the service.

2.2.1.  Network Map and PID

   Different ISPs use different technologies to build their
   infrastructures.  Some ISPs have only a relatively small network,
   focusing mainly on access.  On the other hand, some large ISPs have
   access networks, MANs, and a Core network.

   There are tradeoffs when a large ISP defines its Network Map. If the
   partition of the network in the Network Map is too fine-grained, it
   may lead to higher complexity and overhead.  On the other hand, a too
   coarse-grained Network Map may lead to suboptimal optimization.

   Specifically, first consider an access network, say an ADSL or
   Ethernet based access network.  A BAS server may be deployed to
   provide access service for its subscribers.  Because all subscribers'
   traffic must be transmitted through the BAS server, one technique is
   to identify each such access network by one PID.  It is generally
   unnecessary to further divide such access networks.  On the hand, it
   can be beneficial to combine several such access networks into a

   single PID.

   A MAN usually consists of several access networks.  The MANs are
   connected to a core network, whose network bandwidth resource may be
   more costly.  Thus, the ISP can define one or several MANS as one
   PID.  It is also possible that the ISP deploys ALTO independently in
   some MANs.

2.2.2.  Cost Map


3.  ALTO Deployment Monitoring

   In addition to providing configuration, an ISP providing ALTO may
   want to deploy a monitoring infrastructure to assess the benefits of
   ALTO and adjust its ALTO configuration.

   To construct an effective monitoring infrastructure, the ISP should
   (1) define the performance metrics to be monitored; (2) and identify
   and deploy devices to collect data to compute the performance
   metrics.  Below we discuss both.

3.1.  Monitoring Metrics

   The monitoring of some performance metrics can be dependent on
   specific applications, and ALTO can be applied to multiple
   applications such as P2P and CDN.  We focus on P2P applications.

3.1.1.  Network Metrics

   An ISP may monitor the impacts of ALTO on its network through a set
   of performance metrics.  We enumerate some key metrics.  We define
   the term domain as one or many groups of Endpoints.  That is, one
   domain includes one PID or some PIDs.  Endpoints and PID are defined
   in "draft-ietf-alto-protocol-05".

   A specific set of metrics measuring the impacts of ALTO on networks
   can include the following:

   o  Total Inter-domain Traffic (Network metric): This metric includes
      total traffic, and usually is IP traffic.  Evaluates the impact of
      ALTO on the inbound and outbound traffic of a domain.

   o  Inter-domain ALTO-Integrated Application Traffic (Network metric):
      This is similar to the preceding but focuses on the traffic of the
      applications that are ALTO integrated.  This metric is always used
      with the preceding and the following metrics.

Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


   o  Intra-domain ALTO-Integrated Application Traffic (Network metric).

   o  Network hop count (Network metric): This metric provides gives the
      average hops that traffic traverses inside a domain.  ALTO may
      reduce not only traffic volume but also the hops.  The metric can
      also indirectly reflect some application performance (e.g.,
      latency).

3.1.2.  Application Metrics

   Each specific application can have its specific set of performance
   metrics.  We give one example for file sharing.

   o  Application download rate (Application metric): This metric
      measures application performance directly.  Download means inbound
      traffic to one user.  Global average means the average value of
      all users' download rates in one or more domains.

3.2.  Monitoring Data Sources

   The preceding metrics are derived from data sources.  We identify
   four data sources.

3.2.1.  Application Log Server

   Many P2P applications deploy Log Servers to collect data.

3.2.2.  P2P Clients

   Some P2P applications may not have Log Servers.  When available, P2P
   client logs can provide data.

3.2.3.  OAM

   Many ISPs deploy OAM systems to monitor IP layer traffic.  An OAM
   provides traffic monitoring of every network device in its management
   area.  It provides data such as link physical bandwidth and traffic
   volumes.

3.2.4.  DPI

   A DPI system can be deployed in an ISPs' network to understand the
   traffic of specific classes of applications.  Differ from OAM, DPI
   system can provide application specific information.

Internet-Draft    ISP ALTO Configuration and Monitoring     October 2010


3.3.  Application/ISP Monitoring Integration

3.3.1.  Structure

   As discussed in the preceding section, some data sources are from ISP
   while some others are from application.  When there is a
   collaboration agreement between the ISP and an application, there can
   be an integrated monitoring system as shown in the figure below.  In
   particular, an application developer may deploy Monitor Clients to
   communicate with Monitor Server of the ISP to transmit raw data from
   the Log Server or P2P clients of the application to the ISP.
