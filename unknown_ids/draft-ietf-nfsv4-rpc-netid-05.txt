Internet-Draft                 RPC Netids                  December 2008


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The concepts of an RPC (defined in RFC1831 [4]) Network Identifier
   (netid) and an RPC Universal Address (uaddr) were introduced in
   RFC1833 [2] for distinguishing network addresses of multiple
   protocols and representing those addresses in a canonical form.
   RFC1833 states that a netid ``is defined by a system administrator
   based on local conventions, and cannot be depended on to have the
   same value on every system.''  (The netid is contained in the field
   r_netid of the data type rpcb_entry, and the uaddr is contained in
   the field r_addr of the same data type, where rpcb_entry is defined
   in RFC1833.)  Since the publication of RFC1833, it has been found
   that protocols like NFSv4.0 [5] and RPC/RDMA [6] depend on consistent
   values of netids and representations of uaddrs.  Current practices
   tend to ensure this consistency.  Thus, this document identifies the
   considerations for IANA to establish registries of netids and uaddr
   formats for RPC and specifies the initial content of the two
   registries.


2.  Acknowledgements

   Lars Eggert, Juergen Schoenwaelder, and Robert Sparks reviewed the
   document and gave valuable feed back.


3.  Security Considerations

   Since this document is only concerned with the IANA management of the
   Network Identifier (netid) and Universal Network Addresses (uaddrs)
   format registry, it raises no new security issues.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This section uses terms that are defined in RFC5226 [7].

4.1.  IANA Considerations for Netids

   IANA will create a registry called "ONC RPC Netids".  The remainder
   of this section describes the registry.

   All assignments to the ONC RPC Netids registry are made on one of two
   bases:

   o  A First Come First Served basis subregistry per section 4.1 of
      RFC5226.

Internet-Draft                 RPC Netids                  December 2008


   o  A Standards Action basis subregistry per section 4.1 of RFC5226.

   The XDR encoding allows netids to be up to 2^32 - 1 octets in length,
   but the registry will only allow a much shorter length.  Assignments
   made on a Standards Action basis should be assigned netids one to
   eight octets long.  Assignments made on a First Come First Served
   basis should be assigned netids nine to 128 octets long.  Some
   exceptions are listed in Table 2.

   Some portion of the netid name space is Reserved:

   o  All netids, regardless of length, that start with the prefixes
      "STDS" or "FCFS" are Reserved, in order to extend the name space
      of either Standards Action or First Come First Served bases.

   o  To give IESG the flexibility in the future to permit Private and
      Experimental Uses, all netids with the prefixes "PRIV" or "EXPE"
      are Reserved.

   o  To prevent confusion with the control protocol by the same name
      [8], netids with the prefix "ICMP" are Reserved.

   o  Since netids are not constructed in an explicit hierarchical
      manner, this document does not provide for Hierarchical Allocation
      of netids.  Nonetheless, all netids containing the octet "." are
      Reserved for future possible provision of Hierarchical Allocation.

   o  The zero length netid is Reserved.

   A recommended convention for netids corresponding to transports that
   work over the IPv6 protocol is to have "6" as the last character in
   the netid's name.

   There are two subregistries of netids, one for Standards Action
   assignments, and one for First Come First Serve assignments.  Each
   registry of netids is a list of assignments, each containing five
   fields for each assignment.

   1.  A US-ASCII string name that is the actual netid.  The netid
       should be one to eight octets long for the Standards Action
       subregistry, and should be nine to 128 octets long for the First
       Come First Served subregistry.  The netid MUST NOT conflict with
       any other registered netid.  Despite the fact that netids are
       case sensitive, the netid, when mapped to all upper case MUST NOT
       conflict with the value of any other registered netid after the
       registered netid is mapped to upper case.  In addition, when
       mapped to upper case, the prefix of the netid MUST NOT be equal
       to a Reserved prefix.

Internet-Draft                 RPC Netids                  December 2008


   2.  A constant name that can be used for software programs that wish
       to use the transport protocol associated with protocol.  The name
       of the constant typically has the prefix: "NC_", and a suffix
       equal to the upper case version of the netid.  This constant name
       should be a constant that is valid in the 'C' programming
       language.  This constant name MUST NOT conflict with any other
       netid constant name.  Constant names with the prefix "NC_STDS",
       "NC_FCFS", "NC_PRIV", "NC_EXPE", and "NC_ICMP" are Reserved.
       Constant names with a prefix of "NC_" and a total length of 11
       characters or less should be for assignments made on the
       Standards Action basis.  The constant "NC_" is Reserved.  The
       constant name can be one to 131 octets long.

   3.  A description and/or a reference to a description of the how the
       netid will be used.  For assignments made on a First Come First
       Served basis the description should include, if applicable, a
       reference to the transport and network protocols corresponding to
       the netid.  For assignments made on a Standards Action basis, the
       description field must include the RFC numbers of the protocol
       associated with the netid, including if applicable, RFC numbers
       of the transport and network protocols.

   4.  A point of contact of the registrant.  For assignments made on a
       First Come First Served basis,

       *  the point of contact should include an email address.

       *  subject to authorization by a Designated Expert, the point of
          contact may be omitted for extraordinary situations, such as
          the registration of a commonly used netid where the owner is
          unknown.

       For assignments made on a Standards Action basis the point of
       contact is always determined by IESG.

   5.  A numerical value, used to cross reference the netid assignment
       with an assignment in the uaddr format registry (see
       Section 4.2).  If the registrant is registering a netid that
       cross references an existing assignment in the uaddr format
       registry, then the registrant provides the actual value of the
       cross reference along with the date the registrant retrieved the
       cross reference value from the uaddr format registry.  If the
       registrant is registering both a new netid and new uaddr format,
       then the registrant provides a value of TBD1 in the netid
       request, and uses TBD1 in the the uaddr format request.  IANA
       will then substitute TBD1 for cross reference number IANA
       allocates.

4.1.1.  Initial Registry

   The initial list of netids is broken into two subregistries: those
   assigned on a First Come First Serve basis in Table 1 and those
   assigned on a Standards Action basis in Table 2.  These lists will
   change when IANA registers additional netids as needed, and the
   authoritative list of registered netids will always live with IANA.

4.1.2.  Updating Registrations

   Per section 5.2 of RFC5226 the registrant is always permitted to
   update a registration made on a First Come First Served basis
   "subject to the same constraints and review as with new
   registrations."  IESG or a Designated Expert is permitted to update
   any registration made on a First Come First Served basis, which
   normally is done when the PoC cannot be reached in order to make
   necessary updates.  Examples where an update would be needed include,
   but are not limited to: the email address or other contact
   information becomes invalid; the reference to the corresponding
   protocol becomes obsolete or unavailable; and RFC1833 is updated or
   replaced in such a way that the scope of netids changes, requiring
   additional fields in the assignment.

   Only IESG, on the advice of a Designated Expert, can update a
   registration made on a Standards Action basis.

4.2.  IANA Considerations for Uaddr Formats

   IANA will create a registry called "ONC RPC Uaddr Format Registry"
   (called the "format registry" for the remainder of this document).
   The remainder of this section describes the registry.

   All assignments to the format registry are made on one of two bases:

   o  First Come First Served basis per section 4.1 of RFC5226.

Internet-Draft                 RPC Netids                  December 2008


   o  Standards Action per section 4.1 of RFC5226.

   The registry of formats is a list of assignments, each containing
   four fields for each assignment.

   1.  The basis for the assignment, which can be either FCFS for First
       Come First Served assignments, or STDS for Standards Action
       assignments.

   2.  A description and/or reference to a description of the actual
       uaddr format.  Assignments made on a Standards Action basis
       always have a reference to an RFC.

   3.  For assignments made on a First Come First Served basis, a point
       of contact, including an email address.  Subject to authorization
       by a Designated Expert, the point of contact may be omitted for
       extraordinary situations, such as the registration of a commonly
       used format where the owner is unknown.  For assignments made on
       a Standards Action basis, the point of contact is always
       determined by IESG.

   4.  A numerical value, used to cross reference the format assignment
       with an assignment in the netid registry.  The registrant
       provides a value of TBD1 for the cross reference field when
       requesting an assignment.  IANA will assign TBD1 to a real value.

   All requests for assignments to the format registry on a Standards
   Action basis must undergo Expert Review and must be approved by IESG.

4.2.1.  Initial Registry

   The initial list of formats is in Table 3.  This lists will change
   when IANA registers additional formats as needed, and the
   authoritative list of registered formats will always live with IANA.

4.2.2.  Updating Registrations

   The registrant is always permitted to update a registration made on a
   First Come First Served basis "subject to the same constraints and
   review as with new registrations."  IESG is permitted to update any
   registration made on a First Come First Served basis, which normally
   is done when the PoC cannot be reached in order to make necessary
   updates.  Examples where an update would be needed include, but are
   not limited to: the email address or other contact information
   becomes invalid; the reference to the format description becomes
   obsolete or unavailable; and RFC1833 is updated or replaced in such a
   way that the scope of uaddr formats changes, requiring additional
   fields in the assignment.

   Only IESG, on the advice of a Designated Expert, can update a
   registration made on a Standards Action basis.

4.2.3.  Uaddr Formats

4.2.3.1.  Uaddr Format for System V Release 4 Loopback Transports

   Although RFC1833 specifies the uaddr as the XDR data type string
   (hence, limited to US-ASCII), implementations of the System V Release
   4 loopback transports will use an opaque string of octets.  Thus the
   format of a loopback transport address is any non-zero length array
   of octets.

4.2.3.2.  Uaddr Format for Netid "-"

   There is no address format for netid "-".  This netid is apparently
   for internal use for supporting some implementations of RFC1833.

4.2.3.3.  Uaddr Format for Most IPv4 Transports

   Most transport protocols that operate over IPv4 use 16 bit port
   numbers, including DCCP [10], RDMA [6], SCTP [13], TCP [14], and UDP
   [15].  The format of the uaddr for the above 16 bit port transports
   (when used over IPv4) is the US-ASCII string:

      h1.h2.h3.h4.p1.p2

   The prefix, "h1.h2.h3.h4", is the standard textual form for
   representing an IPv4 address, which is always four octets long.
   Assuming big-endian ordering, h1, h2, h3, and h4, are respectively,
   the first through fourth octets each converted to ASCII-decimal.  The
   suffix, "p1.p2", is a textual form for representing a service port.

   Assuming big-endian ordering, p1 and p2 are, respectively, the first
   and second octets each converted to ASCII-decimal.  For example, if a
   host, in big-endian order, has an address in hexadecimal of
   0xC0000207 and there is a service listening on, in big endian order,
   port 0xCB51 (decimal 52049) then the complete uaddr is
   "192.0.2.7.203.81".

4.2.3.4.  Uaddr Format for Most IPv6 Transports

   Most transport protocols that operate over IPv6 use 16 bit port
   numbers, including DCCP [10], RDMA [6], SCTP [13], TCP [14], and UDP
   [15].  The format of the uaddr for the above 16 bit port transports
   (when used over IPv6) is the US-ASCII string:

      x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8.p1.p2

   The suffix "p1.p2" is the service port, and is computed the same way
   as with uaddrs for transports over IPv4 (see Section 4.2.3.3).  The
   prefix, "x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8", is the preferred textual form for
   representing an IPv6 address as defined in Section 2.2 of RFC4291
   [3].  Additionally, the two alternative forms specified in Section
   2.2 of RFC4291 are also acceptable.

4.2.3.5.  Uaddr Format for ICMP over IPv4 and IPv6

   As ICMP is not a true transport, there is no uaddr format for ICMP.
   The netid assignments "icmp" and "icmp6" and their shared uaddr
   "format" are listed to prevent any registrant from allocating the
   netids "icmp" and "icmp6" for a purpose that would likely cause
   confusion.

4.3.  Cross Referencing Between the Netid and Format Registry

   The last field of the netids registry is used to cross reference with
   the last field of the format registry.  IANA is under no obligation
   to maintain same numeric value in cross references when updating each
   registry; i.e.  IANA is free to "re-number" these corresponding
   fields.  However, if IANA does so, both the netid and format
   registries must be updated atomically.
