    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Web-based protocols often require the discovery of host policy or metadata, where host is
        not a single resource but the entity controlling the collection of resources identified by
        Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) with a common host as defined by
        <xref target="RFC3986"/>. While these protocols have a wide range of metadata needs, they
        often define metadata that is concise, has simple syntax requirements, and can benefit from
        storing its metadata in a common location used by other related protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because there is no URI or resource available to describe a host, many of the methods
        used for associating per-resource metadata (such as HTTP headers) are not available. This
        often leads to the overloading of the root HTTP resource (e.g. 'http://example.com/') with
        host metadata that is not specific to the root resource, and often has nothing to do it.
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo registers the "well-known" URI suffix <spanx style="verb">host-meta</spanx> in
        the Well-Known URI Registry established by <xref target="RFC5785" />, and specifies a
        simple, general-purpose metadata document for hosts, to be used by multiple Web-based
        protocols.

          The following is a simple host-meta document for the 'example.com' and 'www.example.com'
          hosts with a link providing host-wide copyright information and a link template providing
          a URI for obtaining resource-specific author information for each resource within the
          host-meta document scope:

      <section title="Namespace and Version" anchor="ns">
        <t>
          The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 XML namespace URI <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114" />:

        </figure>
        <t>
        The XML namespace URI for the host-meta specific extension elements defined in this
        specification is:
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[

      </section>
      
      <section title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
          "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <xref target="RFC2119" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          Examples in this specification uses the namespace prefix <spanx style="verb">hm:</spanx>
          for the extension Namespace URI identified in <xref target="ns" />. The
          <spanx style="verb">hm:</spanx> namespace prefix is arbitrary and not is semantically
          significant. Element names without a namespace prefix belong to the XRD 1.0 XML namespace
          identified in <xref target="ns" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC5234" />.
          Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref target="RFC3986" />: reserved,
          unreserved, and host.
        </t>
      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Metadata Scope">
      <t>
        Each host-meta document describes one or more hosts, where a host is not a single resource
        but the entity controlling the collection of resources identified by URIs with a common
        host as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"/>, across all ports and schemes.
      </t>
      <t>
        The scope MUST be expressed explicitly within the document using the
        <spanx style="verb">hm:Host</spanx> element as described in <xref target="Host element" />.
        The host-meta scope does not apply to any other hostname (or sub-domain) not explicitly
        declared. For example, 'example.net', 'example.com', and 'www.example.com' all have
        different and non-overlapping scopes.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="The host-meta Document Format">
      <t>
        The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 document format as defined by
        <xref target="OASIS.XRD-1.0" />, which provides a simple and extensible XML-based schema
        for describing resources. This memo defines additional elements and processing rules needed
        to describe hosts. Documents MAY include any XRD element not explicitly excluded.
      </t>
      <t>
        The host-meta document root MUST be an <spanx style="verb">XRD</spanx> element. The
        document SHOULD NOT include a <spanx style="verb">Subject</spanx> element, as at this time
        no URI is available to identify hosts. The use of the <spanx style="verb">Alias</spanx>
        element in host-meta is undefined and NOT RECOMMENDED.
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo defines the <spanx style="verb">hm:Host</spanx> element for declaring document
        scope. The subject (or "context resource" as defined by
        <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header" />) of the XRD
        <spanx style="verb">Property</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">Link</spanx> elements consists
        of the hosts included in the document scope. However, the subject of
        <spanx style="verb">Link</spanx> elements with a <spanx style="verb">template</spanx>
        attribute is the individual resources (included in the document scope) applied to the link
        template as described in <xref target="Link element" />.
      </t>

      <section title="The 'hm:Host' Element" anchor="Host element">
        <t>
          The 'hm:Host" element is used to declare the scope of the host-meta document and
          is defined as a child element of the root <spanx style="verb">XRD</spanx> element. The
          parent <spanx style="verb">XRD</spanx> element MUST include one but MAY include more
          <spanx style="verb">hm:Host</spanx> elements (order does not matter). If a host-meta
          document includes more than one <spanx style="verb">hm:Host</spanx> element, it does not
          signify any relationship between the individual hosts other than sharing the same
          metadata included in the document.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            The element value syntax ABNF:

  ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section title="The 'Link' Element" anchor="Link element">
        <t>
          The XRD <spanx style="verb">Link</spanx> element, when used with the
          <spanx style="verb">href</spanx> attribute, conveys a link relation between the hosts
          described by the document and a common target URI.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the following link declares a common author for the entire scope:
          </preamble>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
    <Link rel='author' href='http://example.com/author' />
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          However, a <spanx style="verb">Link</spanx> element with a
          <spanx style="verb">template</spanx> attribute conveys relations whose context are the
          individual resources within the host-meta document scope, and whose target is constructed
          by applying each context resource URI to the template. The template string MAY contain a URI
          string without any variables to represent a resource-level relation that is identical for
          every individual resource.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, a blog with multiple authors can provide information about each article's
            author by providing an endpoint with a parameter set to the URI of each article. Each
            article has a unique author, but all share the same pattern of where that information
            is located:
          </preamble>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
    <Link rel='author' template='http://example.com?author={uri}' />
  ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <section title="Template Syntax" anchor="template_syntax">
          <t>
            This memo defines a simple template syntax for URI transformation. A template is a
            string containing brace-enclosed ("{}") variable names marking the parts of the string
            that are to be substituted by the corresponding variable values.
          </t>
          <t>
            Before substituting template variables, any value character other than unreserved (as
            defined by <xref target="RFC3986" />) MUST be percent-encoded per
            <xref target="RFC3986" />.
          </t>
          <t>
            This memo defines a single variable - <spanx style="verb">uri</spanx> - as the entire
            context resource URI. Protocols MAY define additional relation-specific variables and
            syntax rules, but SHOULD only do so for protocol-specific relation types, and MUST NOT
            change the meaning of the <spanx style="verb">uri</spanx> variable. If a client is
            unable to successfully process a template (e.g. unknown variable names, unknown or
            incompatible syntax) the parent <spanx style="verb">Link</spanx> element SHOULD be
            ignored.

    <section title="Obtaining host-meta Documents" anchor="obtain">
      <t>
        Clients obtain the host-meta document for a given host by making an
        HTTPS <xref target="RFC2818" /> GET request to the host's port 443 for the
        <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/host-meta</spanx> path. If the request fails to produce a
        valid host-meta document, clients make an HTTP <xref target="RFC2616" /> GET request
        to the host's port 80 for the <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/host-meta</spanx> path.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers MUST support at least one but SHOULD support both ports. If both ports are
        supported, they MUST serve the same document. Clients MAY attempt to obtain the host-meta
        document from either port, SHOULD attempt using port 443 first, and SHOULD attempt the
        other port if the first fails.
      </t>
      <figure>
        <preamble>
          For example, the following request is used to obtain the host-meta document for the
          'example.com' host:
        </preamble>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
    GET /.well-known/host-meta HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
  ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        If a representation is successfully obtained, but is not in the format described above,
        clients should infer that the path is being used for other purposes, and not process the
        response as a host-meta document. To aid in this process, authorities using this mechanism
        SHOULD correctly label host-meta responses with the
        <spanx style="verb">application/xrd+xml</spanx> internet media type.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the server response indicates that the host-meta resource is located elsewhere (a 301,
        302, or 307 response status code), the client SHOULD try to obtain the resource from the
        location provided in the response. This means that the host-meta document for one host
        MAY be retrieved from a another host. Likewise, if the resource is not available or does
        not exist (indicated respectively, by the 404 and 410 response status codes) at both ports,
        the client should infer that metadata is not available via this mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        The scope declared within the host-meta document MUST match the desired host. Clients
        MUST NOT use host-meta documents when the desired host (used to obtain the document) is not
        listed in the document.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
        The metadata returned by the host-meta resource is presumed to be under the control of the
        appropriate authority and representative of all the resources described by it. If this
        resource is compromised or otherwise under the control of another party, it may represent a
        risk to the security of the server and data served by it, depending on what protocols use it.
      </t>
      <t>
        The host-meta scope is explicitly declared by the <spanx style="verb">hm:Host</spanx>
        elements listed in the document. Clients SHOULD evaluate the authority of a host-meta
        document obtained from one host to describe another host. Protocols that change the scope
        from the one declared in the document without careful consideration can incur security
        risks.
      </t>
      <t>
        Protocols using host-meta templates SHOULD evaluate the construction of their templates as
        well as any protocol-specific variables or syntax to ensure that the templates cannot be
        abused by an attacker. For example, a client can be tricked into following a malicious link
        due to a poorly constructed template which produces unexpected results when its variable
        values contain unexpected characters.
      </t>
      <t>
        Protocols MAY restrict document retrieval to HTTPS based on their security needs.
        Protocols utilizing host-meta documents obtained via other methods not described in this
        memo SHOULD consider the security and authority risks associated with such methods.
