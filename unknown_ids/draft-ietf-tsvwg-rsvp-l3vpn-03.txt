   use RSVP to perform admission control on the links between Customer
   Edge (CE) routers and Provider Edge (PE) routers.  This document
   specifies procedures by which RSVP messages travelling from CE to CE
   across an L3VPN may be appropriately handled by PE routers so that
   admission control can be performed on PE-CE links.  Optionally,
   admission control across the provider's backbone may also be
   supported.

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4364] and [RFC4659] define a Layer 3 VPN service known as BGP/
   MPLS VPNs for IPv4 and for IPv6 respectively.  [RFC2205] defines the
   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) which may be used to perform
   admission control as part of the Integrated Services (Int-Serv)
   architecture [RFC1633][RFC2210].

   Customers of a layer 3 VPN service may run RSVP for the purposes of
   admission control (and associated resource reservation) in their own
   networks.  Since the links between Provider Edge (PE) and Customer
   Edge (CE) routers in a layer 3 VPN may often be resource constrained,
   it may be desirable to be able to perform admission control over
   those links.  In order to perform admission control using RSVP in
   such an environment, it is necessary that RSVP control messages, such
   as Path messages and Resv messages, are appropriately handled by the
   PE routers.  This presents a number of challenges in the context of
   BGP/MPLS VPNs:

   o  RSVP Path message processing depends on routers recognizing the
      router alert option in the IP header.  However, packets traversing
      the backbone of a BGP/MPLS VPN are MPLS encapsulated and thus the
      router alert option is not normally visible to the egress PE.

   o  BGP/MPLS VPNs support non-unique addressing of customer networks.
      Thus a PE at the ingress or egress of the provider backbone may be
      called upon to process Path messages from different customer VPNs
      with non-unique destination addresses.

   o  A PE at the ingress of the provider's backbone may receive Resv
      messages corresponding to different customer VPNs from other PEs,
      and needs to be able to associate those Resv messages with the
      appropriate customer VPNs.

   This document describes a set of procedures to overcome these
   challenges and thus to enable admission control using RSVP over the
   PE-CE links.  We note that similar techniques may be applicable to
   other protocols used for admission control such as the combination of
   the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for QoS Signaling
   ([I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp]) and General Internet Signaling Transport
   (GIST) protocol ([I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp]).

   Additionally, it may be desirable to perform admission control over
   the provider's backbone on behalf of one or more L3VPN customers.
   Core (P) routers in a BGP/MPLS VPN do not have forwarding entries for
   customer routes, and thus cannot natively process RSVP messages for
   customer flows.  Also the core is a shared resource that carries
   traffic for many customers, so issues of resource allocation among



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   customers and trust (or lack thereof) must also be addressed.  This
   draft also specifies procedures for supporting such a scenario.

   This draft deals with establishing reservations for unicast flows
   only.  Because the support of multicast traffic in BGP/MPLS VPNs is
   still evolving, and raises additional challenges for admission
   control, we leave the support of multicast flows for further study at
   this point.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document draws freely on the terminology defined in [RFC2205]
   and [RFC4364].  For convenience, we provide a few brief definitions
   here:

   o  CE (Customer Edge) Router: Router at the edge of a customer site
      that attaches to the network of the VPN provider.

   o  PE (Provider Edge) Router: Router at the edge of the service
      provider's network that attaches to one or more customer sites.

   o  VPN Label: An MPLS label associated with a route to a customer
      prefix in a VPN (also called a VPN route label).

   o  VRF: VPN Routing and Forwarding Table.  A PE typically has
      multiple VRFs, enabling it to be connected to CEs that are in
      different VPNs.


2.  Problem Statement

   The problem space of this document is the support of admission
   control between customer sites when the customer subscribes to a BGP/
   MPLS VPN.  We subdivide the problem into (a) the problem of admission
   control on the PE-CE links (in both directions), and (b) the problem
   of admission control across the provider's backbone.

   For the PE-CE link subproblem, the most basic challenge is that RSVP
   control messages contain IP addresses that are drawn from the
   customer's address space, and PEs must be able to deal with traffic
   from many customers who may have non-unique (or overlapping) address
   spaces.  Thus, it is essential that a PE be able in all cases to
   identify the correct VPN context in which to process an RSVP control
   message.  Much of this draft deals with this issue.

   For the case of making reservations across the provider backbone, we
   observe that BGP/MPLS VPNs do not create any per-customer forwarding
   state in the P (provider core) routers.  Thus, in order to make



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   reservations on behalf of customer-specified flows, it is clearly
   necessary to make some sort of aggregated reservation from PE-PE and
   then map individual, customer-specific reservations onto an aggregate
   reservation.  That is similar to the problem tackled in [RFC3175] and
   [RFC4804], with the additional complications of handling customer-
   specific addressing associated with BGP/MPLS VPNs.

   Finally, we note that RSVP Path messages are normally addressed to
   the destination of a session, and contain the router alert IP option.
   Routers along the path to the destination that are configured to
   process RSVP messages must detect the presence of the router alert
   option to allow them to intercept Path messages.  However, the egress
   PEs of a network supporting BGP/MPLS VPNs receive packets destined
   for customer sites as MPLS-encapsulated packets, and may forward
   those based only on examination of the MPLS label.  Hence, a Path
   message would be forwarded without examination of the IP options and
   would therefore not receive appropriate processing at the PE.  This
   problem of recognizing and processing Path messages is also discussed
   below.

   Figure 1 illustrates the basic model of operation with which this
   document is concerned.

   Figure 1.  Model of Operation for RSVP-based admission control over
   MPLS/BGP VPN

   To establish a unidirectional reservation for a point-to-point flow
   from Sender to Receiver that takes account of resource availability
   on the CE-PE and PE-CE links only, the following steps must take
   place:

   1.   Sender sends a Path message to an IP address of the Receiver.

   2.   Path message is processed by CE1 using normal RSVP procedures
        and forwarded towards the Receiver along the link CE1-PE1.

   3.   PE1 processes Path message and forwards towards the Receiver
        across the provider backbone.

   4.   PE2 processes Path message and forwards towards the Receiver
        along link PE2-CE2.

   5.   CE2 processes Path message using normal RSVP procedures and
        forwards towards Receiver.

   6.   Receiver sends Resv message to CE2.

   7.   CE2 sends Resv message to PE2.

   8.   PE2 processes Resv message (including performing admission
        control on link PE2-CE2) and sends Resv to PE1.

   9.   PE1 processes Resv message and sends Resv to CE1.

   10.  CE1 processes Resv using normal RSVP procedures, performs
        admission control on the link CE1-PE1 and sends Resv message to
        Sender if successful.

   In each of the steps involving Resv messages (6 through 10) the node
   sending the Resv uses the previously established Path state to
   determine the "RSVP Previous Hop (PHOP)" and sends a Resv message to
   that address.  We note that establishing that Path state correctly at
   PEs is one of the challenges posed by the BGP/MPLS environment.


3.  Admission Control on PE-CE Links

   In the following sections we trace through the steps outlined in
   Section 2.1 and expand on the details for those steps where standard
   RSVP procedures need to be extended or modified to support the BGP/
   MPLS VPN environment.  For all the remaining steps described in the
   preceding section, standard RSVP processing rules apply.

   All the procedures described below support both IPv4 and IPv6
   addressing.  In all cases where IPv4 is referenced, IPv6 can be
   substituted with identical procedures and results.  Object
   definitions for both IPv4 and IPv6 are provided in Section 8.

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


3.1.  New Objects of Type VPN-IPv4

   For RSVP signalling within a VPN, certain RSVP objects need to be
   extended.  Since customer IP addresses need not be unique, the
   current types of SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTERSPEC objects are
   no longer sufficient to globally identify RSVP states in P/PE
   routers, since those are currently based on IP addresses.  We propose
   new types of SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTERSPEC objects, which
   contain globally unique VPN-IPv4 format addresses.  The ingress and
   egress PE nodes translate between the regular IPv4 addresses for
   messages to and from the CE, and VPN-IPv4 addresses for messages to
   and from PE routers.  The rules for this translation are described in
   later sections.

   The RSVP_HOP object in a RSVP message currently specifies an IP
   address to be used by the neighboring RSVP hop to reply to the
   message sender.  However, MPLS VPN PE routers (especially those
   separated by Option-B Autonomous System Border Routers -ASBRs) are
   not required to have direct IP reachability to each other.  To solve
   this issue, we propose the use of label switching to forward RSVP
   messages between nodes within a MPLS VPN.  This is achieved by
   defining a new VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object.  Use of the VPN-IPv4
   RSVP_HOP object enables RSVP control plane reachability between any
   two adjacent RSVP hops in a MPLS VPN (e.g. a PE in AS 1 and a PE in
   AS2), regardless of whether they have IP reachability to each other.

   The VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object carries the IPv4 address of the message
   sender and a logical interface handle as before, but in addition
   carries a VPN-IPv4 address which also represents the sender of the
   message.  The message sender MUST also advertise this VPN-IPv4 HOP
   address into BGP, associated with a locally allocated label, and this
   advertisement MUST be propagated by BGP throughout the VPN and to
   adjacent ASes if required to provide reachability to this PE.  Frames
   received by the PE marked with this label MUST be given to the local
   control plane for processing.  When a neighboring RSVP hop wishes to
   reply to a message carrying a VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP, it looks for a BGP
   advertisement of the VPN-IPv4 address contained in that RSVP_HOP.  If
   this address is found and carries an associated label, the
   neighboring RSVP node MUST encapsulate the RSVP message with this
   label and send it via MPLS encapsulation to the BGP next-hop
   associated with the route.  The destination IP address of the message
   is taken from the IP address field of the RSVP_HOP object, as
   described in [RFC2205].  Additionally, the IPv4 address in the
   RSVP_HOP object continues to be used for all other existing purposes,
   including neighbor matching between Path/Resv and SRefresh messages
   ([RFC2961]), authentication ([RFC2747]), etc.

   The VPN-IPv4 address used in the VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object MAY



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   represent an existing address in the VRF that corresponds to the flow
   (e.g. a local loopback or PE-CE link address within the VRF for this
   customer), or MAY be created specially for this purpose.  In the case
   where the address is specially created for RSVP signaling (and
   possibly other control protocols), the BGP advertisement MUST NOT be
   redistributed to, or reachable by, any CEs outside the MPLS VPN.  One
   way to achieve this is by creating a special "control protocols VPN"
   with VRF state on every PE/ASBR, carrying route targets not imported
   into customer VRFs.  In the case where a customer VRF address is used
   as the VPN-IPv4 address, a VPN-IPv4 address in one customer VRF MUST
   NOT be used to signal RSVP messages for a flow in a different VRF.

   If a PE/ASBR is sending a Path message to another PE/ASBR within the
   VPN, and it has any appropriate VPN-IPv4 address for signalling that
   satisfies the requirements outlined above, it MUST use a VPN-IPv4 HOP
   object with this address for all RSVP messages within the VPN.  If a
   PE/ASBR does not have any appropriate VPN-IPv4 address to use for
   signalling, it MAY send the Path message with a regular IPv4 RSVP_HOP
   object.  In this case, the reply will be IP encapsulated.  This
   option is not preferred because there is no guarantee that the
   neighboring RSVP hop has IP reachability to the sending node.  If a
   PE/ASBR receives or originates a Path message with a VPN-IPv4
   RSVP_HOP object, any RSVP_HOP object in corresponding upstream
   messages for this flow (e.g.  Resv, ResvTear) or downstream messages
   (e.g.  ResvError, PathTear) sent by this node within the VPN MUST be
   a VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP.

3.2.  Path Message Processing at Ingress PE

   When a Path message arrives at the ingress PE (step 3 of Section 2.1)
   the PE needs to establish suitable Path state and forward the Path
   message on to the egress PE.  In the following paragraphs we
   described the steps taken by the ingress PE.

   The Path message is addressed to the eventual destination (the
   receiver at the remote customer site) and carries the IP Router Alert
   option, in accordance with [RFC2205].  The ingress PE must recognize
   the router alert, intercept these messages and process them as RSVP
   signalling messages.

   As noted above, there is an issue in recognizing Path messages as
   they arrive at the egress PE (PE 2 in Figure 1).  The approach
   defined here is to address the Path messages sent by the ingress PE
   directly to the egress PE, and send it without IP Router Alert; that
   is, rather than using the ultimate receiver's destination address as
   the destination address of the Path message, we use the loopback
   address of the egress PE as the destination address of the Path
   message.  This approach has the advantage that it does not require



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   any new data plane capabilities for the egress PE beyond those of a
   standard BGP/MPLS VPN PE.  Details of the processing of this message
   at the egress PE are described below in Section 3.3.  The approach of
   addressing a Path message directly to an RSVP next hop (that may or
   may not be the next IP hop) is already used in other environments
   such as those of [RFC4206] and [RFC4804].

   The details of operation at the ingress PE are as follows.  When the
   ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1) receives a Path message from CE1 that is
   addressed to the receiver, the VRF that is associated with the
   incoming interface is identified, just as for normal data path
   operations.  The Path state for the session is stored, and is
   associated with that VRF, so that potentially overlapping addresses
   among different VPNs do not appear to belong to the same session.
   The destination address of the receiver is looked up in the
   appropriate VRF, and the BGP Next-Hop for that destination is
   identified.  That next-hop is the egress PE (PE2 in Figure 1).  A new
   VPN-IPv4 SESSION object is constructed, containing the Route
   Distinguisher (RD) that is part of the VPN-IPv4 route prefix for this
   destination, and the IPv4 address from the SESSION.  In addition, a
   new VPN-IPv4 SENDER_TEMPLATE object is constructed, with the original
   IPv4 address from the incoming SENDER_TEMPLATE plus the RD that is
   used by this PE to advertise that prefix for this customer into the
   VPN.  A new Path message is constructed with a destination address
   equal to the address of the egress PE identified above.  This new
   Path message will contain all the objects from the original Path
   message, replacing the original SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects
   with the new VPN-IPv4 type objects.  The Path message is sent without
   IP Router Alert and contains a RSVP_HOP object constructed as
   specified in Section 3.1.

3.3.  Path Message Processing at Egress PE

   When a Path message arrives at the egress PE, it is addressed to the
   PE itself, and is handed to RSVP for processing.  The router extracts
   the RD and IPv4 address from the VPN-IPv4 SESSION object, and
   determines the local VRF context by finding a matching VPN-IPv4
   prefix with the specified RD that has been advertised by this router
   into BGP.  The entire incoming RSVP message, including the VRF
   information, is stored as part of the Path state.

   Now the RSVP module can construct a Path message which differs from
   the Path it received in the following ways:

   a.  Its destination address is the IP address extracted from the
       SESSION Object;

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   b.  The SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects are converted back to
       IPv4-type by discarding the attached RD

   c.  The RSVP_HOP Object contains the IP address of the outgoing
       interface of the egress PE and an LIH, as per normal RSVP
       processing.

   The router then sends the Path message on towards its destination
   over the interface identified above.  This Path message carries the
   IP Router-Alert option as required by [RFC2205].

3.4.  Resv Processing at Egress PE

   When a receiver at the customer site originates a Resv message for
   the session, normal RSVP procedures apply until the Resv, making its
   way back towards the sender, arrives at the "egress" PE (it is
   "egress" with respect to the direction of data flow, i.e.  PE2 in
   figure 1).  On arriving at PE2, the SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects
   in the Resv, and the VRF in which the Resv was received, are used to
   find the matching Path state stored previously.  At this stage,
   admission control can be performed on the PE-CE link.

   Assuming admission control is successful, the PE constructs a Resv
   message to send to the RSVP HOP stored in the Path state, i.e., the
   ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1).  The IPv4 SESSION object is replaced
   with the same VPN-IPv4 SESSION object received in the Path.  The IPv4
   FILTER_SPEC object is replaced with a VPN-IPv4 FILTER_SPEC object,
   which copies the VPN-IPv4 address from the SENDER_TEMPLATE received
   in the matching Path message.  The RSVP_HOP in the Resv message MUST
   be constructed as specified in Section 3.1.  The Resv message MUST be
   addressed to the IP address contained within the RSVP_HOP object in
   the Path message.  If the Path message contained a VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP
   object, the Resv MUST be MPLS-encapsulated using the label associated
   with that VPN-IPv4 address in BGP, as described in Section 3.1.  If
   the Path message contained an IPv4 RSVP_HOP object, the Resv is
   simply IP-encapsulated and addressed directly to the IP address in
   the RSVP_HOP object.

   If admission control is not successful on the egress PE, a ResvError
   message is sent towards the receiver as per normal RSVP processing.

3.5.  Resv Processing at Ingress PE

   Upon receiving a Resv message at the ingress PE (with respect to data
   flow, i.e.  PE1 in Figure 1), the PE determines the local VRF context
   and associated Path state for this Resv by decoding the received
   SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects.  It is now possible to generate a
   Resv message to send to the appropriate CE.  The Resv message sent to



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   the ingress CE will contain IPv4 SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects,
   derived from the appropriate Path state.  Since we assume in this
   section that admission control over the Provider's backbone is not
   needed, the ingress PE does not perform any admission control for
   this reservation.

3.6.  Other RSVP Messages

   Processing of PathError, PathTear, ResvError, ResvTear and ResvConf
   messages is generally straightforward and follows the rules of
   [RFC2205].  These additional rules must be observed for messages
   transmitted within the VPN (i.e. between the PEs):

   o  The SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTER_SPEC objects must be
      converted from IPv4 to VPN-IPv4 form and back in the same manner
      as described above for Path and Resv messages.

   o  The appropriate type of RSVP_HOP object (VPN-IPv4 or IPv4) must be
      used as described above

   o  Depending on the type of RSVP HOP received from the neighbor, the
      message must be MPLS-encapsulated or IP-encapsulated as described
      above

   o  The matching state & VRF must be determined by decoding the RD and
      IPv4 addresses in the SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects.

   o  The message must be directly addressed to the appropriate PE,
      without using the IP Router Alert option.


4.  Admission Control in Provider's Backbone

   The preceding section outlines how per-customer reservations can be
   made over the PE-CE links.  This may be sufficient in many situations
   where the backbone is well engineered with ample capacity and there
   is no need to perform any sort of admission control in the backbone.
   However, in some cases where excess capacity cannot be relied upon
   (e.g., during failures or unanticipated periods of overload) it may
   be desirable to be able to perform admission control in the backbone
   on behalf of customer traffic.

   Because of the fact that routes to customer addresses are not present
   in the P routers, along with the concerns of scalability that would
   arise if per-customer reservations were allowed in the P routers, it
   is clearly necessary to map the per-customer reservations described
   in the preceding section onto some sort of aggregate reservations.
   Furthermore, customer data packets need to be tunneled across the



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   provider backbone just as in normal BGP/MPLS VPN operation.

   Given these considerations, a feasible way to achieve the objective
   of admission control in the backbone is to use the ideas described in
   [RFC4804].  MPLS-TE tunnels can be established between PEs as a means
   to perform aggregate admission control in the backbone.

   An MPLS-TE tunnel from an ingress PE to an egress PE can be thought
   of as a virtual link of a certain capacity.  The main change to the
   procedures described above is that when a Resv is received at the
   ingress PE, an admission control decision can be performed by
   checking whether sufficient capacity of that virtual link remains
   available to admit the new customer reservation.  We note also that
   [RFC4804] uses the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object to identify the tunnel
   across the backbone, rather than the simple RSVP_HOP object described
   in Section 3.2.  The procedures of [RFC4804] should be followed here
   as well.

   To achieve effective admission control in the backbone, there needs
   to be some way to separate the data plane traffic that has a
   reservation from that which does not.  We assume that packets that
   are subject to admission control on the core will be given a
   particular MPLS EXP value, and that no other packets will be allowed
   to enter the core with this value unless they have passed admission
   control.  Some fraction of link resources will be allocated to queues
   on core links for packets bearing that EXP value, and the MPLS-TE
   tunnels will use that resource pool to make their constraint-based
   routing and admission control decisions.  This is all consistent with
   the principles of aggregate RSVP reservations described in [RFC3175].


5.  Inter-AS operation

   [RFC4364] defines three modes of inter-AS operation for MPLS/BGP
   VPNs, referred to as options A, B and C. In the following sections we
   describe how the scheme described above can operate in each inter-AS
   environment.

5.1.  Inter-AS Option A

   Operation of RSVP in Inter-AS Option A is quite straightforward.
   Each ASBR operates like a PE, and the ASBR-ASBR links can be viewed
   as PE-CE links in terms of admission control.  If the procedures
   defined in Section 3 are enabled on both ASBRs, then admission
   control may be performed on the inter-ASBR links.  In addition, the
   operator of each AS can independently decide whether or not to
   perform admission control across his backbone.  The new objects
   described in this document MUST NOT be sent in any RSVP message



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   between two Option-A ASBRs.

5.2.  Inter-AS Option B

   To support inter-AS Option B, we require some additional processing
   of RSVP messages on the ASBRs.  Recall that, when packets are
   forwarded from one AS to another in option B, the VPN label is
   swapped by each ASBR as a packet goes from one AS to another.  The
   BGP next hop seen by the ingress PE will be the ASBR, and there need
   not be IP visibility between the ingress and egress PEs.  Hence when
   the ingress PE sends the Path message to the BGP next hop of the VPN-
   IPv4 route towards the destination, it will be received by the ASBR.
   The ASBR determines the next hop of the route in a similar way as the
   ingress PE - by finding a matching BGP VPN-IPv4 route with the same
   RD and a matching prefix.

   The provider(s) who interconnect ASes using option B may or may not
   desire to perform admission control on the inter-AS links.  This
   choice affects the detailed operation of ASBRs.  We describe the two
   modes of operation - with and without admission control at the ASBRs
   - in the following sections.

5.2.1.  Admission control on ASBR

   In this scenario, the ASBR performs full RSVP signalling and
   admission control.  The RSVP database is indexed on the ASBR using
   the VPN-IPv4 SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTER_SPEC objects (which
   uniquely identify RSVP sessions and flows as per the requirements of
   [RFC2205]).  These objects are forwarded unmodified in both
   directions by the ASBR.  All other procedures of RSVP are performed
   as if the ASBR was a RSVP hop.  In particular, the RSVP_HOP objects
   sent in Path and Resv messages contain IP addresses of the ASBR,
   which MUST be reachable by the neighbor to whom the message is being
   sent.  Note that since the VPN-IPv4 SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and
   FILTER_SPEC objects satisfy the uniqueness properties required for a
   RSVP database implementation as per [RFC2209], no customer VRF
   awareness is required on the ASBR.

5.2.2.  No admission control on ASBR

   If the ASBR is not doing admission control, it is desirable that per-
   flow state not be maintained on the ASBR.  This requires adjacent
   RSVP hops (i.e. the ingress and egress PEs of the respective ASes) to
   send RSVP messages directly between them.  This is only possible if
   they are MPLS-encapsulated.  The use of the VPN-IPv4 HOP object
   described in Section 3.1 is REQUIRED in this case.

   When an ASBR that is not installing local RSVP state receives a Path



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   message, it looks up the next-hop of the matching BGP route as
   described in Section 3.2, and sends the Path message to the next-hop,
   without modifying any RSVP objects (including the RSVP_HOP).  This
   process is repeated at subsequent ASBRs until the Path message
   arrives at a router that is installing local RSVP state (either the
   ultimate egress PE, or an ASBR configured to perform admission
   control).  This router receives the Path and processes it as
   described in Section 3.3 if it is a PE, or Section 5.2.1 if it is an
   ASBR performing admission control.  When this router sends the Resv
   upstream, it looks up the routing table for a next-hop+label for the
   VPN-IPv4 address in the PHOP, encapsulates the Resv with that label
   and sends it upstream.  This message will be received for control
   processing directly on the upstream RSVP hop (that last updated the
   RSVP_HOP field in the Path message), without any involvement of
   intermediate ASBRs.

   The ASBR is not expected to process any other RSVP messages apart
   from the Path message as described above.  The ASBR also does not
   need to store any RSVP state.  Note that any ASBR along the path that
   wishes to do admission control or insert itself into the RSVP
   signalling flow, may do so by writing its own RSVP_HOP object with
   IPv4 and VPN-IPv4 address pointing to itself.

   If an Option-B ASBR receives a RSVP Path message with an IPv4
   RSVP_HOP, does not wish to perform admission control but is willing
   to install local state for this flow, the ASBR MUST process and
   forward RSVP signalling messages for this flow as described in
   Section 5.2.1 (with the exception that it does not perform admission
   control).  If an Option-B ASBR receives a RSVP Path message with an
   IPv4 RSVP_HOP, but does not wish to install local state or perform
   admission control for this flow, the ASBR MUST NOT forward the Path
   message.  In addition, the ASBR SHOULD send a PathError message of
   Error Code "RSVP over MPLS Problem"_, _Error Value "RSVP_HOP not
   reachable across VPN" (see Section 9) signifying to the upstream RSVP
   hop that the supplied RSVP_HOP object is insufficient to provide
   reachability across this VPN.  This failure condition is not expected
   to be recoverable.

5.3.  Inter-AS Option C

   Operation of RSVP in Inter-AS Option C is also quite straightforward,
   because there exists an LSP directly from ingress PE to egress PE.
   In this case, there is no significant difference in operation from
   the single AS case described in Section 3.  Furthermore, if it is
   desired to provide admission control from PE to PE, it can be done by
   building an inter-AS TE tunnel and then using the procedures
   described in Section 4.

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


6.  Operation with RSVP disabled

   It is often the case that RSVP will not be enabled on the PE-CE
   links.  In such an environment, a customer may reasonably expect that
   RSVP messages sent into the L3 VPN network should be forwarded just
   like any other IP datagrams.  This transparency is useful when the
   customer wishes to use RSVP within his own sites or perhaps to
   perform admission control on the CE-PE links (in CE->PE direction
   only), without involvement of the PEs.  For this reason, a PE SHOULD
   NOT discard or modify RSVP messages sent towards it from a CE when
   RSVP is not enabled on the PE-CE links.  Similarly a PE SHOULD NOT
   discard or modify RSVP messages which are destined for one of its
   attached CEs, even when RSVP is not enabled on those links.  Note
   that the presence of the router alert option in some RSVP messages
   may cause them to be forwarded outside of the normal forwarding path,
   but that the guidance of this paragraph still applies in that case.
   Note also that this guidance applies regardless of whether RSVP-TE is
   used in some, all, or none of the L3VPN network.


7.  Other RSVP procedures

   This section describes modifications to other RSVP procedures
   introduced by MPLS VPNs

7.1.  Refresh overhead reduction

   The following points should be noted regarding RSVP refresh overhead
   reduction ([RFC2961]) across a MPLS VPN:

   o  The hop between the ingress and egress PE of a VPN should be
      considered as traversing one or more non-RSVP hops.  As such, the
      procedures described in Section 5.3 of [RFC2961] relating to non-
      RSVP hops SHOULD be followed.

   o  The source IP address of a SRefresh message MUST match the IPv4
      address signalled in the RSVP_HOP object contained in the
      corresponding Path or Resv message.  The IPv4 address in any
      received VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object MUST be used as the source
      address of that message for this purpose.

7.2.  Cryptographic Authentication

   The following points should be noted regarding RSVP cryptographic
   authentication ([RFC2747]) across a MPLS VPN:






Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   o  The IPv4 address in any received VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object MUST be
      used as the source address of that message for purposes of
      identifying the security association.

   o  Forwarding of Challenge and Response messages MUST follow the same
      rules as described above for hop-by-hop messages.  Specifically,
      if the originator of a Challenge/Response message has received a
      VPN-IPv4 RSVP_HOP object from the corresponding neighbor, it MUST
      use the label associated with that VPN-IPv4 address in BGP to
      forward the Challenge/Response message.

7.3.  RSVP Aggregation

   [RFC3175] and [RFC4860] describe mechanisms to aggregate multiple
   individual RSVP reservations into a single larger reservation on the
   basis of a common DSCP/PHB for traffic classification.  The following
   points should be noted in this regard:

   o  The procedures described in this section apply only in the case
      where the Aggregator and Deaggregator nodes are C/CE devices, and
      the entire MPLS VPN lies within the Aggregation Region.  The case
      where the PE is also an Aggregator/Deaggregator is more complex
      and not considered in this document.

   o  Aggregate RSVP sessions will be treated in the same way as regular
      IPv4 RSVP sessions.  To this end, all the procedures described in
      Section 3 and Section 4 apply to aggregate RSVP sessions.  New
      SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTERSPEC objects are defined in
      Section 8.

   o  End-To-End (E2E) RSVP sessions are passed unmodified through the
      MPLS VPN.  These RSVP messages may be identified by their IP
      protocol (RSVP-E2E-IGNORE, 134).  When the ingress PE receives any
      RSVP message with this IP protocol, it MUST process this frame as
      if it is regular customer traffic and ignore any IP Router-Alert
      flags.  The appropriate VPN and transport labels are applied to
      the frame and it is forwarded towards the remote CE.  Note that
      this message will not be received or processed by any other P or
      PE node.

   o  Any SESSION-OF-INTEREST objects (defined in [RFC4860]) are to be
      conveyed unmodified across the MPLS VPN.

7.4.  Support for CE-CE RSVP-TE

   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-e2e-rsvp-te-reqts] describes a set of requirements
   for the establishment for CE-CE MPLS LSPs across networks offering an
   L3VPN service.  The requirements specified in that draft are similar



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   to those addressed by this document, in that both address the issue
   of handling RSVP requests from customers in a VPN context.  It is
   possible that the solution described here could be adapted to meet
   the requirements of [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-e2e-rsvp-te-reqts].  To the
   extent that this draft uses signalling extensions described in
   [RFC3473] which have already been used for GMPLS/TE, we expect that
   CE-CE RSVP/TE will be incremental work built on these extensions.
   These extensions will be considered in a separate document.


8.  Object Definitions

8.1.  VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 SESSION objects

   The usage of the VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) SESSION Object is described
   in Section 3.2 to Section 3.6.  The VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) SESSION
   object appears in RSVP messages that ordinarily contain a SESSION
   object and are sent between ingress PE and egress PE in either
   direction.  The object MUST NOT be included in any RSVP messages that
   are sent outside of the provider's backbone (except in the inter-AS
   option B and C cases, as described above, when it may appear on
   inter-AS links).

   The VPN-IPv6 SESSION object is analogous to the VPN-IPv4 SESSION
   object, using an VPN-IPv6 address ([RFC4659]) instead of an VPN-IPv4
   address ([RFC4364]).

   The formats of the objects are as follows:


         o    VPN-IPv4 SESSION object: Class = 1, C-Type = TBA

              +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
              |                                                       |
              +                                                       +
              |             VPN-IPv4 DestAddress (12 bytes)           |
              +                                                       +
              |                                                       |
              +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
              | Protocol Id |    Flags    |          DstPort          |

              |                                                       |
              +                                                       +

              .                                                       .
              /                                                       /
              |                                                       |
              +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
              | Protocol Id |     Flags   |          DstPort          |
              +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+


   The VPN-IPv4 DestAddress (respectively VPN-IPv6 DestAddress) field
   contains an address of the VPN-IPv4 (respectively VPN-IPv6) address
   family encoded as specified in [RFC4364] (respectively [RFC4659]).
   The content of this field is discussed in Section 3.2 and
   Section 3.3.

   The protocol ID, flags, and DstPort are identical to the same fields
   in the IPv4 and IPv6 SESSION objects ([RFC2205]).

8.2.  VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE objects

   The usage of the VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) SENDER_TEMPLATE Object is

   SENDER_TEMPLATE object appears in RSVP messages that ordinarily

10.  Security Considerations

   [RFC4364] addresses the security considerations of BGP/MPLS VPNs in
   general.  General RSVP security considerations are discussed in
   [RFC2205].  To ensure the integrity of RSVP, the RSVP Authentication
   mechanisms defined in [RFC2747] and [RFC3097] SHOULD be supported.
   Those protect RSVP message integrity hop-by-hop and provide node
   authentication as well as replay protection, thereby protecting
   against corruption and spoofing of RSVP messages.
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] discusses applicability of
   various keying approaches for RSVP Authentication.  First, we note
   that the discussion about applicability of group keying to an intra-
   provider environment where RSVP hops are not IP hops is relevant to
   securing of RSVP among PEs of a given Service Provider deploying the
   solution specified in the present document.  We note that the RSVP
   signaling in MPLS VPN is likely to spread over multiple
   administrative domains (e.g. the service provider operating the VPN
   service, and the customers of the service).  Therefore the
   considerations in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] about
   inter-domain issues are likely to apply.

   Since RSVP messages travel through the L3VPN cloud directly addressed
   to PE or ASBR routers (without IP Router-Alert), P routers remain
   isolated from RSVP messages signalling customer reservations.
   Providers MAY choose to block PEs from sending IP Router-Alert
   datagrams to P routers as a security practice, without impacting the
   functionality described herein.

   Beyond those general issues, four specific issues are introduced by
   this document: resource usage on PEs, resource usage in the provider
   backbone, PE route advertisement outside the AS, and signalling
   exposure to ASBRs and PEs.  We discuss these in turn.

   A customer who makes resource reservations on the CE-PE links for his
   sites is only competing for link resources with himself, as in



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 30]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   standard RSVP, at least in the common case where each CE-PE link is
   dedicated to a single customer.  Thus, from the perspective of the
   CE-PE links, this draft does not introduce any new security issues.
   However, because a PE typically serves multiple customers, there is
   also the possibility that a customer might attempt to use excessive
   computational resources on a PE (CPU cycles, memory etc.) by sending
   large numbers of RSVP messages to a PE.  In the extreme this could
   represent a form of denial-of-service attack.  In order to prevent
   such an attack, a PE SHOULD support mechanisms to limit the fraction
   of its processing resources that can be consumed by any one CE or by
   the set of CEs of a given customer.  For example, a PE might
   implement a form of rate limiting on RSVP messages that it receives
   from each CE.  We observe that these security risks and measures
   related to PE resource usage are very similar for any control plane
   protocol operating between CE and PE (e.g.  RSVP, routing, multicast)

   The second concern arises only when the service provider chooses to
   offer resource reservation across the backbone, as described in
   Section 4.  In this case, the concern may be that a single customer
   might attempt to reserve a large fraction of backbone capacity,
   perhaps with a co-ordinated effort from several different CEs, thus
   denying service to other customers using the same backbone.
   [RFC4804] provides some guidance on the security issues when RSVP
   reservations are aggregated onto MPLS tunnels, which are applicable
   to the situation described here.  We note that a provider MAY use
   local policy to limit the amount of resources that can be reserved by
   a given customer from a particular PE, and that a policy server could
   be used to control the resource usage of a given customer across
   multiple PEs if desired.  It is RECOMMENDED that an implementation of
   this specification support local policy on the PE to control the
   amount of resources that can be reserved by a given customer/CE.

   Use of the VPN-IPv4 HOP object requires exporting a PE VPN-IPv4 route
   to another AS, and potentially could allow unchecked access to remote
   PEs if those routes were indiscriminately redistributed.  However, as
   described in Section 3.1, no route which is not within a customer's
   VPN should ever be advertised to (or reachable from) that customer.
   If a PE uses a local address already within a customer VRF (like
   PE-CE link address), it MUST NOT send this address in any RSVP
   messages in a different customer VRF.  A "control plane" VPN MAY be
   created across PEs and ASBRs and addresses in this VPN can be used to
   signal RSVP sessions for any customers, but these routes MUST NOT be
   advertised to, or made reachable from, any customer.  An
   implementation of the present document MAY support such operation
   using a "control plane" VPN.  Alternatively, ASBRs MAY implement the
   signalling procedures described in Section 5.2.1, even if admission
   control is not required on the inter-AS link, as these procedures do
   not require any direct P/PE route advertisement out of the AS.



Davie, et al.            Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft               RSVP for L3VPNs                October 2009


   Finally, certain operations described herein (Section 3) require an
   ASBR or PE to receive and locally process a signalling packet
   addressed to the BGP next-hop address advertised by that router.
   This requirement does not strictly apply to MPLS/BGP VPNs [RFC4364].
   This could be viewed as opening ASBRs and PEs to being directly
   addressable by customer devices where they were not open before, and
   could be considered a security issue.  If a provider wishes to
   mitigate this situation, the implementation MAY support the "control
   protocol VPN" approach described above.  That is, whenever a
   signalling message is to be sent to a PE or ASBR, the address of the
   router in question would be looked up in the "control protocol VPN",
   and the message would then be sent on the LSP that is found as a
   result of that lookup.  This would ensure that the router address is
   not reachable by customer devices.

   [RFC4364] mentions use of IPsec both on a CE-CE basis and PE-PE
   basis: "Cryptographic privacy is not provided by this architecture,
   nor by Frame Relay or ATM VPNs.  These architectures are all
   compatible with the use of cryptography on a CE-CE basis, if that is
   desired.  The use of cryptography on a PE-PE basis is for further
   study."

   The procedures specified in the present document for admission
   control on the PE-CE links (Section 3) are compatible with the use of
   IPsec on a PE-PE basis.  The optional procedures specified in the
   present document for admission control in the Service Provider's
   backbone (Section 4) are not compatible with the use of IPsec on a
   PE-PE basis, since those procedures depend on the use of PE-PE MPLS
   TE Tunnels to perform aggregate reservations through the Service
   Provider's backbone.

   [RFC4923] describes a model for RSVP operation through IPsec
   Gateways.  In a nutshell, a form of hierarchical RSVP reservation is
   used where an RSVP reservation is made for the IPsec tunnel and then
   individual RSVP reservations are admitted/aggregated over the tunnel
   reservation.  This model applies to the case where IPsec is used on a
   CE-CE basis.  In that situation, the procedures defined in the
   present document would simply apply "as is" to the reservation
   established for the IPsec tunnel(s).

Appendix A.  Alternatives Considered

   At this stage a number of alternatives to the approach described
   above have been considered.  We document some of the approaches
   considered here to assist future discussion.  None of these has been
   shown to improve upon the approach described above, and the first two
   seem to have significant drawbacks relative to the approach described
   above.

Appendix A.1.  GMPLS UNI approach

   [RFC4208] defines the GMPLS UNI.  In Section 7 the operation of the
   GMPLS UNI in a VPN context is briefly described.  This is somewhat
   similar to the problem tackled in the current document.  The main
   difference is that the GMPLS UNI is primarily aimed at the problem of
   allowing a CE device to request the establishment of an LSP across
   the network on the other side of the UNI.  Hence the procedures in
   [RFC4208] would lead to the establishment of an LSP across the VPN
   provider's network for every RSVP request received, which is not
   desired in this case.

   To the extent possible, the approach described in this document is
   consistent with [RFC4208], while filling in more of the details and
   avoiding the problem noted above.

Appendix A.2.  VRF label approach

   Another approach to solving the problems described here involves the
   use of label switching to ensure that Path, Resv, and other RSVP
   messages are directed to the appropriate VRF.  One challenge with
   such an approach is that [RFC4364] does not require labels to be
   allocated for VRFs, only for customer prefixes, and that there is no
   simple, existing method for advertising the fact that a label is
   bound to a VRF.  If, for example, an ingress PE sent a Path message
   labelled with a VPN label that was advertised by the egress PE for
   the prefix that matches the destination address in the Path, there is
   a risk that the egress PE would simply label-switch the Path directly
   on to the CE without performing RSVP processing.

   A second challenge with this approach is that an IP address needs to
   be associated with a VRF and used as the PHOP address for the Path
   message sent from ingress PE to egress PE.  That address must be
   reachable from the egress PE, and exist in the VRF at the ingress PE.
   Such an address is not always available in today's deployments, so
   this represents at least a change to existing deployment practices.

Appendix A.3.  VRF label plus VRF address approach

   It is possible to create an approach based on that described in the
   previous section which addresses the main challenges of that
   approach.  The basic approach has two parts: (a) define a new BGP
   Extended Community to tag a route (and its associated MPLS label) as
   pointing to a VRF; (b) allocate a "dummy" address to each VRF,
   specifically to be used for routing RSVP messages.  The dummy address
   (which could be anything, e.g. a loopback of the associated PE) would
   be used as a PHOP for Path messages and would serve as the
   destination for Resv messages but would not be imported into VRFs of
   any other PE.
