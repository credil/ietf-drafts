1. Introduction
   This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Interior 
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) Route Convergence.  The applicability of this 
   testing is described in [Po07a] and the new terminology that it 
   introduces is defined in [Po07t].  Service Providers use IGP 
   Convergence time as a key metric of router design and architecture.  
   Customers of Service Providers observe convergence time by packet 
   loss, so IGP Route Convergence is considered a Direct Measure of 
   Quality (DMOQ).  The test cases in this document are black-box tests 
   that emulate the network events that cause route convergence, as 
   described in [Po07a].  The black-box test designs benchmark the data 
   plane and account for all of the factors contributing to convergence 
   time, as discussed in [Po07a].  The methodology (and terminology) for 
   benchmarking route convergence can be applied to any link-state IGP 
   such as ISIS [Ca90] and OSPF [Mo98] and others.  These methodologies 
   apply to IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and IGPs.

2. Existing definitions
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 
   [Br97].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

               Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   This document adopts the definition format in Section 2 of RFC 1242 
   [Br91]. This document uses much of the terminology defined in 
   [Po07t].  This document uses existing terminology defined in other 
   BMWG work.  Examples include, but are not limited to: 
            
             Throughput                [Ref.[Br91], section 3.17] 
             Device Under Test (DUT)   [Ref.[Ma98], section 3.1.1] 
             System Under Test (SUT)   [Ref.[Ma98], section 3.1.2] 
             Out-of-order Packet       [Ref.[Po06], section 3.3.2] 
             Duplicate Packet          [Ref.[Po06], section 3.3.3]
             Packet Loss               [Ref.[Po07t], Section 3.5] 
      
3.  Test Setup	

   3.1 Test Topologies	

   Figure 1 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence 
   due to local Convergence Events such as Link Failure, Layer 2 
   Session Failure, IGP  Adjacency Failure, Route Withdrawal, and route 
   cost change.  These test cases discussed in section 4 provide route 
   convergence times that include the Event Detection time, SPF 
   Processing time, and FIB Update time.  These times are measured 
   by observing packet loss in the data plane at the Tester. 

   Figure 2 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence 
   time due to remote changes in the network topology.  These times 
   are measured by observing packet loss in the data plane at the  
   Tester.  In this topology the three routers are considered a System 
   Under Test (SUT).  A Remote Interface [Po07t] failure on router R2 
   MUST result in convergence of traffic to router R3.  NOTE: All 
   routers in the SUT must be the same model and identically 
   configured.

   Figure 3 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence 
   time with members of an Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) Set.  These 
   times are measured by observing packet loss in the data plane at
   the Tester.  In this topology, the DUT is configured with each 
   Egress interface as a member of an ECMP set and the Tester emulates 
   multiple next-hop routers (emulates one router for each member).

INTERNET-DRAFT          Benchmarking Methodology for      October 2008
               Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence
	
   Figure 4 shows the test topology to measure IGP Route Convergence 
   time with members of a Parallel Link.  These times are measured by 
   observing packet loss in the data plane at the Tester.  In this 
   topology, the DUT is configured with each Egress interface as a 
   member of a Parallel Link and the Tester emulates the single 
   next-hop router.

   3.2 Test Considerations
   3.2.1 IGP Selection
   The test cases described in section 4 MAY be used for link-state
   IGPs, such as ISIS or OSPF.  The Route Convergence test methodology 
   is identical.  The IGP adjacencies are established on the Preferred 
   Egress Interface and Next-Best Egress Interface.

   3.2.2 Routing Protocol Configuration
   The obtained results for IGP Route Convergence may vary if 
   other routing protocols are enabled and routes learned via those 
   protocols are installed.  IGP convergence times MUST be benchmarked
   without routes installed from other protocols.

   3.2.3 IGP Route Scaling
   The number of IGP routes will impact the measured IGP Route 
   Convergence.  To obtain results similar to those that would be 
   observed in an operational network, it is RECOMMENDED that the 
   number of installed routes and nodes closely approximates that 
   of the network (e.g. thousands of routes with tens of nodes).  
   The number of areas (for OSPF) and levels (for ISIS) can impact 
   the benchmark results.	

   3.2.4 Timers
   There are some timers that will impact the measured IGP Convergence 
   time. Benchmarking metrics may be measured at any fixed values for 
   these timers.  It is RECOMMENDED that the following timers be 
   configured to the minimum values listed: 

        Timer                                   Recommended Value
        -----                                   -----------------
        Link Failure Indication Delay           <10milliseconds
        IGP Hello Timer                         1 second
        IGP Dead-Interval                       3 seconds
        LSA Generation Delay                    0 
        LSA Flood Packet Pacing                 0
        LSA Retransmission Packet Pacing        0
        SPF Delay                               0

               Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   3.2.5 Interface Types
   All test cases in this methodology document may be executed with any 
   interface type.  All interfaces MUST be the same media and Throughput 
   [Br91][Br99] for each test case.  The type of media may dictate which 
   test cases may be executed.  This is because each interface type has 
   a unique mechanism for detecting link failures and the speed at which 
   that mechanism operates will influence the measure results.  Media 
   and protocols MUST be configured for minimum failure detection delay 
   to minimize the contribution to the measured Convergence time.  For 
   example, configure SONET with the minimum carrier-loss-delay.  All 
   interfaces SHOULD be configured as point-to-point.

   3.2.6 Packet Sampling Interval
   The Packet Sampling Interval [Po07t] value is the fastest measurable 
   Rate-Derived Convergence Time [Po07t].  The RECOMMENDED value for the 
   Packet Sampling Interval is 10 milliseconds. Rate-Derived Convergence 
   Time is the preferred benchmark for IGP Route Convergence.  This 
   benchmark must always be reported when the Packet Sampling Interval 
   is set <= 10 milliseconds on the test equipment.  If the test 
   equipment does not permit the Packet Sampling Interval to be set as 
   low as 10 milliseconds, then both the Rate-Derived Convergence Time 
   and Loss-Derived Convergence Time [Po07t] MUST be reported.  
   
   3.2.7 Offered Load
   The offered load MUST be the Throughput of the device as defined in 
   [Br91] and benchmarked in [Br99] at a fixed packet size.  At least 
   one packet per route in the FIB for all routes in the FIB MUST be 
   offered to the DUT within the Packet Sampling interval. Packet size 
   is measured in bytes and includes the IP header and payload.  The 
   packet size is selectable and MUST be recorded.  The Forwarding 
   Rate [Ma98] MUST be measured at the Preferred Egress Interface and 
   the Next-Best Egress Interface.  The duration of offered load MUST 
   be greater than the convergence time.  The destination addresses 
   for the offered load MUST be distributed such that all routes are 
   matched and each route is offered an equal share of the total 
   Offered Load.  This requirement for the Offered Load to be 
   distributed to match all destinations in the route table creates 
   separate flows that are offered to the DUT.  The capability of the 
   Tester to measure packet loss for each individual flow (identified 
   by the destination address matching a route entry) and the scale 
   for the number of individual flows for which it can measure packet 
   loss should be considered when benchmarking Route-Specific 
   Convergence [Po07t].

INTERNET-DRAFT          Benchmarking Methodology for      October 2008
               Link-State IGP Data Plane Route Convergence

   3.2.8 Selection of Convergence Time Benchmark Metrics
   The methodologies in the section 4 test cases MAY be applied to 
   benchmark Full Convergence and Route-Specific Convergence with 
   benchmarking metrics First Route Convergence Time, Loss-Derived 
   Convergence Time, Rate-Derived Convergence Time, Reversion 
   Convergence Time, and Route-Specific Convergence Times [Po07t].  

   When benchmarking Full Convergence the Rate-Derived Convergence 
   Time benchmarking metric MAY be measured.  When benchmarking 
   Route-Specific Convergence the Route-Specific Convergence Time 
   benchmarking metric MUST be measured and Full Convergence MAY be
   obtained from max(Route-Specific Convergence Time).  The First 
   Route Convergence Time benchmarking metric MAY be measured when 
   benchmarking either Full Convergence or Route-Specific Convergence.

   3.2.9 Tester Capabilities
   It is RECOMMENDED that the Tester used to execute each test case
   have the following capabilities:
      1. Ability to insert a timestamp in each data packet's IP
         payload.
      2. An internal time clock to control timestamping, time 
         measurements, and time calculations.
      3. Ability to distinguish traffic load received on the Preferred
         and Next-Best interfaces.
      4. Ability to disable or tune specific Layer-2 and Layer-3
         protocol functions on any interface(s).

   For each test case, it is recommended that the reporting table below
   is completed and all time values SHOULD be reported with resolution 
   as specified in [Po07t].

4. Test Cases
   It is RECOMMENDED that all applicable test cases be executed for
   best characterization of the DUT.  The test cases follow a generic 
   procedure tailored to the specific DUT configuration and Convergence 
   Event[Po07t].  This generic procedure is as follows:

      1. Establish DUT configuration and install routes.
      2. Send offered load with traffic traversing Preferred Egress 
         Interface [Po07t].
      3. Introduce Convergence Event to force traffic to Next-Best 
         Egress Interface [Po07t].
      4. Measure First Route Convergence Time.
      5. Measure Full Convergence from Loss-Derived Convergence Time, 
         Rate-Derived Convergence Time, and optionally the 
         Route-Specific Convergence Times.
      6. Wait the Sustained Convergence Validation Time to ensure there 
         no residual packet loss.
      7. Recover from Convergence Event.

         Route Convergence Time and Route-Specific Convergence Times.

      Convergence Event [Po07t] that produces the Convergence Event 
      Instant [Po07t].

      link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic over 
      the Next-Best Egress Interface.  Optionally, Route-Specific 
      Convergence Times [Po07t] MAY be measured. 
   7. Stop offered load.  Wait 30 seconds for queues to drain.  
      Restart offered load.

      the link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic

      Convergence Times [Po07t], as DUT detects the link up event and 
      converges all IGP routes and traffic back to the Preferred Egress

   Packet Pacing, LSA/LSP Generation time, SPF delay, SPF Hold time, 
   SPF Execution Time, Tree Build Time, and Hardware Update Time

   4. Tester increases cost for all IGP routes at DUT's Preferred 
      Egress Interface so that the Next-Best Egress Interface

      Instant [Po07t].

   3. Send offered load at measured Throughput with fixed packet 
      size to destinations matching all IGP routes from Tester to 
      DUT on Ingress Interface [Po07t].
   4. Verify traffic is routed over all members of Parallel Link.
   5. Remove link on Tester's Neighbor Interface [Po07t] connected to 
      one of the DUT's Parallel Link member interfaces.  This is the 
      Convergence Event [Po07t] that produces the Convergence Event 
      Instant [Po07t].
   6. Measure First Route Convergence Time [Po07t] as DUT detects the 
      link down event and begins to converge IGP routes and traffic
      over the other Parallel Link members.  
   7. Measure Rate-Derived Convergence Time [Po07t] as DUT detects the 
      link down event and converges all IGP routes and traffic over 
      the other Parallel Link members.  At the same time measure 
      Out-of-Order Packets [Po06] and Duplicate Packets [Po06].  
      Optionally, Route-Specific Convergence Times [Po07t] MAY be 
      measured. 
   8. Stop offered load.  Wait 30 seconds for queues to drain.  
      Restart offered load.
   9. Restore link on Tester's Neighbor Interface connected to 
      DUT's Parallel Link member interface.
   10. Measure Reversion Convergence Time [Po07t], and optionally 
      measure First Route Convergence Time [Po07t] and 
      Route-Specific Convergence Times [Po07t],  as DUT 
      detects the link up event and converges IGP routes and some 
      distribution of traffic over the restored Parallel Link member.

   Results
   The measured IGP Convergence time is influenced by the Local
   link failure indication, Tree Build Time, and Hardware Update 
   Time [Po07a].

5. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.

6. Security Considerations
   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   the Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking
   is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
   networks.
