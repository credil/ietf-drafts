<section title="Introduction">
 <t>   This document specifies the mapping and notification of defect 
       states between a Pseudowire and the Attachment Circuits (AC) of the 
       end-to-end emulated service. It covers the case whereby the ACs and 
       the PWs are of the same type in accordance to the PWE3 architecture 
       [RFC3985] such that a homogeneous PW service can be constructed. </t> 
 <t>   This document is motivated by the requirements put forth in 
       [RFC4377] and [RFC3916]. Its objective is to standardize the 
       behavior of PEs with respect to defects on PWs and ACs, so that 
       there is no ambiguity about the alarms generated and consequent 
       actions undertaken by PEs in response to specific failure 
       conditions. </t>
 <t>   This document addresses PWs over MPLS, MPLS/IP and L2TPV3/IP PSNs, 
       and ATM, frame relay, TDM, and SONET/SDH PW services. Due to its 
       unique characteristics, the Ethernet PW service is covered in a 
       separate document [ETH-OAM-IWK]. </t>

 <section title="Conventions">
 <t>   The words "defect" and "fault" are used interchangeably to mean any 
       condition that obstructs forwarding of user traffic between the CE 
       endpoints of the PW service.  </t>
 <t>   The words "defect notification" and "defect indication" are used 
       interchangeably to mean any OAM message generated by a PE and sent 
       to other nodes in the network to convey the defect state local to 
       this PE.
 </t>
 <t>   The PW can be carried over three types of Packet Switched Networks 
       (PSNs). An "MPLS PSN" makes use of MPLS Label Switched Paths [LSPs] as 
       the tunneling technology to forward the PW packets. An "MPLS/IP PSN"
       makes use of MPLS-in-IP tunneling [RFC4023], with an MPLS shim 
       header used as PW demultiplexer. An "L2TPv3/IP PSN" makes use of 


       L2TPv3/IP [RFC3931] as the tunneling technology with the L2TPv3/IP 
       Session ID as the PW demultiplexer. </t>
 <t>   If LSP-Ping [RFC4379] is run over a PW as described in [RFC4377], it 
       will be referred to as "VCCV-Ping". If BFD is run over a PW as 
       described in [RFC4377], it will be referred to as "VCCV-BFD"
       [VCCV-BFD]. </t>
 <t>   While PWs are inherently bidirectional entities, defects and OAM 
       messaging are related to a specific traffic direction. We use the 
       terms "upstream" and "downstream" to identify PEs in relation to the 
       traffic direction.  A PE is upstream for the traffic it is 
       forwarding and is downstream for the traffic it is receiving. </t>
 <t>   We use the terms "local" and "remote" to identify native service 
       networks and ACs in relation to a specific PE. The local AC is 
       attached to the PE in question, while the remote AC is attached to 
       the PE at the other end of the PW. </t>
 <t>   A "transmit defect" is any defect that impacts traffic that is meant 
       to be sent or relayed by the observing PE. A "receive defect" is any 
       defect that impacts traffic that is meant to be received by the 
       observing PE. Note that a receive defect also impacts traffic meant 
       to be relayed, and thus can be considered to incorporate two defect 
       states. Thus when a PE enters both receive and transmit defect 
       states of a PW service, the receive defect takes precedence over the 
       transmit defect in terms of the consequent actions. </t>
 <t>   A "forward defect indication" (FDI) is sent in the same direction as the 
       user traffic impacted by the defect. A "reverse defect indication" (RDI)
       is sent in the direction opposite to that of the impacted traffic. </t>
 <t>   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
       document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. </t>

 <t>   The procedures will be described in this document from the viewpoint of 
       PE1, so that N1 is the local native service network and N2 is 
       the remote native service network. PE2 will typically implement the 
       same functionality. Note that PE1 is the upstream PE for traffic 
       originating in the local NS network N1, while it is the downstream 
       PE for traffic originating in the remote NS network N2. </t>

 <t>   The following is a brief description of the defect locations: </t>
 <t><list style="hanging">     
   <t hangText="a."> Defect in NS network N1. This covers any defect in network N1 
              that impacts all or some ACs attached to PE1, and is thus a 
              local AC defect. The defect is conveyed to PE1 and to NS 
              network N2 using NS specific OAM defect indications. </t>
   <t hangText="b."> Defect on a PE1 AC interface (another local AC defect). </t>
   <t hangText="c."> Defect on a PE1 PSN interface. </t>
   <t hangText="d."> Defect in the PSN network. This covers any defect in the PSN 
              that impacts all or some PWs between PE1 and PE2. The defect 
              is conveyed to the PE using a PSN and/or a PW specific OAM 
              defect indication. Note that both data plane defects and 
              control plane defects must be taken into consideration. 
              Although control messages may follow a different path than PW 
              data plane traffic, a control plane defect may affect the PW

              network N1 using the NS OAM defect indication. </t>
 </list></t>             
</section>

<section title="Abstract Defect States">
  <t>  PE1 must track four defect states that reflect the observed states 
       of both directions of the PW service on both the AC and the PW 
       sides. Defects may impact one or both directions of the PW service. </t>


  <t>  The observed state is a combination of defects directly detected by 
       PE1 and defects of which it has been made aware via notifications.  </t>

 </figure>                      


 <t>   PE1 will directly detect or be notified of AC receive or PW receive 
       defects as they occur upstream of PE1 and impact traffic being sent 
       to PE1. As a result, PE1 enters the AC or PW receive defect state. </t> 

 
 <t>   In Figure 2, PE1 may be notified of a receive defect in the AC by 
       receiving a Forward Defect indication, e.g., ATM AIS, from CE1 or an 
       intervening network. This defect notification indicates that user 
       traffic sent by CE1 may not be received by PE1 due to a defect. PE1 
       can also directly detect an AC receive defect if it resulted from a 
       failure of the receive side in the local port or link over which the 
       AC is configured. </t>   

 
 <t>   Similarly, PE1 may detect or be notified of a receive defect in the 
       PW by receiving a Forward Defect indication from PE2. If PW status 
       is used for fault notification, this message will indicate a Local 
       PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit Fault or a Local AC (ingress) 
       Receive Fault at PE2, as described in Section 8.1.1. This defect 
       notification indicates that user traffic sent by CE2 may not be 
       received by PE1 due to a defect. As a result, PE1 enters the PW 
       receive defect state. </t>   


 <t>   Note that a Forward Defect Indication is sent in the same direction 
       as the user traffic impacted by the defect. </t> 

 
 <t>   Generally, a PE cannot detect transmit defects directly and will 
       therefore need to be notified of AC transmit or PW transmit defects 
       by other devices. </t>  

 <t>   In Figure 2, PE1 may be notified of a transmit defect in the AC by 
       receiving a Reverse Defect indication, e.g., ATM RDI, from CE1. This 
       defect relates to the traffic sent by PE1 to CE1 on the AC. </t>   


 <t>   Similarly, PE1 may be notified of a transmit defect in the PW by 
       receiving a Reverse Defect indication from PE2. If PW status is used 
       for fault notification, this message will indicate a Local PSN-
       facing PW (ingress) Receive Fault or a Local Attachment Circuit 
       (egress) Transmit Fault at PE2, as described in Section 8.1.1. This 
       defect impacts the traffic sent by PE1 to CE2. As a result, PE1 
       enters the PW transmit defect state. </t>  


 <t>   Note that a Reverse Defect indication is sent in the reverse 
       direction to the user traffic impacted by the defect. </t> 


 <t>   The procedures outlined in this document define the entry and exit 
       criteria for each of the four states with respect to the set of PW 
       services within the document scope and the consequent actions that 
       PE1 must perform. </t>  


 <t>   When a PE enters both receive and transmit defect states related to 
       the same PW service, then the receive defect takes precedence over 
       transmit defect in terms of the consequent actions. </t> 

  
</section>

<section title="OAM Modes">

 <t>   A homogeneous PW service forwards packets between an AC and a PW of 
       the same type. It thus implements both NS OAM and PW OAM mechanisms. 
       PW OAM defect notification messages are described in Section 8.1 NS 
       OAM messages are described in Appendix A. </t>  
        
 <t>   This document defines two different OAM modes, the distinction being 
       the method of mapping between the NS and PW OAM defect notification 
       messages. </t>   
        
 <t>   The first mode, illustrated in Figure 3, is called the "single 
       emulated OAM loop" mode. Here a single end-to-end NS OAM loop is 
       emulated by transparently passing NS OAM messages over the PW. Note 
       that the PW OAM is shown outside the PW in Figure 3, as it is 
       transported in LDP messages or in the associated channel, not inside 
       the PW itself. </t>

 </figure>                      


 <t>   The single emulated OAM loop mode implements the following behavior: </t>

         
 <t><list style="hanging">     
   <t hangText="a."> The upstream PE (PE1) MUST transparently relay NS OAM 
               messages over the PW. </t>
   <t hangText="b."> The upstream PE MUST signal local defects affecting the AC 
               using a NS defect notification message sent over the PW. In 
               the case that it is not possible to generate NS OAM messages 
               (e.g., because the defect interferes with NS OAM message 
               generation) the PE MUST signal local defects affecting the AC 
               using a PW defect notification message. </t> 
   <t hangText="c."> The upstream PE MUST signal local defects affecting the PW 
               using a PW defect notification message. </t> 
   <t hangText="d."> The downstream PE (PE2) MUST insert NS defect notification 
               messages into its local AC when it detects or is notified of 
               a defect in the PW or remote AC. This includes translating 
               received PW defect notification messages into NS defect 
               notification messages for defects signaled by the upstream 
               PE. </t> 
    </list></t>
     
 <t>   The single emulated OAM loop mode is suitable for PW services that 
       have a widely deployed NS OAM mechanism. This document specifies the 
       use of this mode for ATM PW, TDM PW, and CEP PW services. It is the 
       default mode of operation for all ATM cell-mode PW services and the 
       only mode specified for CEP and SAToP/CESoPSN TDM PW services. It is 
       optional for AAL5 PDU transport and AAL5 SDU transport modes. </t>
        
 <t>   The second OAM mode operates three OAM loops joined at the AC/PW 
       boundaries of the PEs. This is referred to as the "coupled OAM 
       loops" mode and is illustrated in Figure 4. 
       Note that in contrast to Figure 3, NS OAM messages are never
       carried over the PW.</t>

  <t>  This document specifies the coupled OAM loops mode as the default 
       mode for the frame relay, ATM AAL5 PDU transport, and AAL5 SDU 
       transport services. It is an optional mode for ATM VCC cell mode 
       services. This mode is not specified for TDM, CEP, or ATM VPC cell 
       mode PW services. RFC5087 defines a similar but distinct mode, as 
       will be explained in Section 11 below. For the ATM VPC cell mode 
       case a pure coupled OAM loops mode is not possible as a PE MUST 
       transparently pass VC-level (F5) ATM OAM cells over the PW while 
       terminating and translating VP-level (F4) OAM cells. </t>

<section title="PW Defect States and Defect Notifications">
 <section title="PW Defect Notification Mechanisms">
  <t>  For MPLS and MPLS/IP PSNs, a PE that establishes a PW using Label 
       Distribution Protocol [LDP] MUST use the LDP status TLV as the 
       mechanism for AC and PW status and defect notification, as explained 
       in [RFC4447]. Additionally, a PE MAY use VCCV-BFD Connectivity 
       Verification (CV) for fault detection only (CV types 0x04 and 0x10 
       [VCCV-BFD]) but SHOULD notify the remote PE using the LDP Status 
       TLV. </t>
 

  <t>  A PE that establishes a PW using means other than LDP, e.g., by 
       static configuration or by use of BGP, MAY use VCCV-BFD CV (CV types 
       0x08 and 0x20 [VCCV-BFD]) for AC and PW status and defect 
       notification. Note that these CV types SHOULD NOT be used when the 
       PW is established with the LDP control plane. </t> 


  <t>  For a L2TPV3/IP PSN, a PE SHOULD use the Circuit Status Attribute 
       Value Pair [AVP] as the mechanism for AC and PW status and defect 
       notification. In its most basic form, the Circuit Status AVP 
       [RFC3931] in a Set-Link-Info (SLI) message can signal 
       active/inactive AC status. The Circuit Status AVP as described in 
       [RFC 5641] is proposed to be extended to convey status and defects 
       in the AC and the PSN-facing PW in both ingress and egress 
       directions, i.e., four independent status bits, without the need to 
       tear down the sessions or control connection [L2TP-Status]. </t>
 

  <t>  When a PE does not support the Circuit Status AVP, it MAY use the 
       Stop-Control-Connection-Notification [StopCCN] and the Call-
       Disconnect-Notify [CDN] messages to tear down L2TP sessions in a 
       fashion similar to LDP's use of Label Withdrawal to tear down a PW. 
       A PE may use the StopCCN to shutdown the L2TP control connection, 
       and implicitly all L2TP sessions associated with that control 
       connection, without any explicit session control messages. This is 
       useful for the case of a failure which impacts all L2TP sessions 
       (i.e., all PWs) managed by the control connection. It MAY use the 
       CDN message to disconnect a specific L2TP session when a failure 
       affects a specific PW. </t> 


  <t>  Additionally, a PE MAY use VCCV-BFD CV types 0x04 and 0x10 for fault 
       detection only, but SHOULD notify the remote PE using the Circuit 
       Status AVP. A PE that establishes a PW using means other than the 
       L2TP control plane, e.g., by static configuration or by use of BGP, 
       MAY use VCCV-BFD CV types 0x08 and 0x20 for AC and PW status and 
       defect notification. These CV types SHOULD NOT be used when the PW 
       is established via the L2TP control plane. </t>


  <t>  The CV types are defined in Section 8.1.3 of this document. </t>

   <section title="LDP Status TLV">

     <t> [RFC4447] specifies that "Pseudowire forwarding" code point is used 
       to clear all faults. It also specifies that "Pseudowire Not 
       Forwarding" code is used to convey any defect that cannot be 
       represented by the other code points. </t>
  

     <t>   The code points used in the LDP status TLV in a PW status 
       notification message conveys defects from the viewpoint of the

   <t> Note that there are two situations that require PW label withdrawal 
       as opposed to a PW status notification by the PE. The first one is 
       when the PW is taken down administratively in accordance with 
       [RFC4447]. The second one is when the Target LDP session established 
       between the two PEs is lost. In the latter case, the PW labels will 
       need to be re-signaled when the Targeted LDP session is re-
       established. </t>

   <section title="L2TP Circuit Status AVP">
    <t> [RFC3931] defines the Circuit Status AVP in the Set-Link-Info (SLI) 
       message to exchange initial status and status changes in the circuit 
       to which the pseudowire is bound. [L2TP-Status] defines extensions 
       to the Circuit Status AVP that are analogous to the PW Status TLV 
       defined for LDP.  Consequently, for L2TPv3/IP the Circuit Status AVP 
       is used in the same fashion as the PW Status described in the 
       previous section. Extended circuit status for L2TPv3/IP is described 
       in [RFC 5641]. </t>

       messages are sent in-band so as to follow the data plane with 
       respect to the source and destination addresses, IP protocol number 
       and UDP port (when UDP is used). </t> 

   </section>

   <section title="BFD Diagnostic Codes">
     <t>  [BFD] defines a set of diagnostic codes that partially overlap the 
       set of defects that can be communicated through LDP Status TLV or 
       L2TP Circuit Status AVP. This section describes the behavior of the 
       PEs with respect to using one or both of these methods for detecting 
       and propagating defect state. </t>


     <t> In the case of an PW using LDP signaling, the PEs negotiate the use 
       of the VCCV capabilities during the label mapping messages exchange 
       used to establish the two directions of the PW. This is achieved by 
       including a capability TLV in the PW FEC interface parameters TLV. 
       In the L2TPV3/IP case, the PEs negotiate the use of VCCV during the 
       pseudowire session initialization using the VCCV AVP [RFC5085]. </t>


     <t> The CV Type Indicators field in the OAM capability TLV or VCCV AVP 
       defines a bitmask used to indicate the specific OAM capabilities 
       that the PE can use over the PW being established. </t> 


      <t>  A CV type of 0x04 or 0x10 [VCCV-BFD] indicates that BFD is used for 
       PW fault detection only. These CV types MAY be used any time the PW 
       is established using LDP or L2TP control planes. 

       In this mode, only the following diagnostic (Diag) codes specified 
       in [BFD] will be used: </t>
      <t><list style="hanging">     
       <t hangText="  0 -"> No diagnostic </t>

       <t hangText="  1 -"> Control detection time expired </t> 

       <t hangText="  3 -"> Neighbor signaled session down </t> 
       <t hangText="  7 -"> Administratively Down </t>
      </list></t>  


      <t>  A PE MUST use diagnostic code 0 to indicate to its peer PE that is 
       correctly receiving BFD control messages. It MUST use diagnostic 
       code 1 to indicate that to its peer it has stopped receiving BFD 
       control messages and will thus declare the PW to be down in the 
       receive direction. It MUST use diagnostic code 3 to confirm to its 
       peer that the BFD session is going down after receiving diagnostic 
       code 1 from this peer. In this case, it will declare the PW to be 
       down in the transmit direction. A PE MUST use diagnostic code 7 to 
       bring down the BFD session when the PW is brought down 
       administratively. All other defects, such as AC/PW defects and PE 
       internal failures that prevent it from forwarding traffic, MUST be 
       communicated through the LDP Status TLV in the case of MPLS PSN or 
       MPLS/IP PSN, or through the appropriate L2TP codes in the Circuit 
       Status AVP in the case of L2TPV3/IP PSN. </t>

      <t>  A CV type of 0x08 or 0x20 in the OAM capabilities TLV indicates that 
       BFD is used for both PW fault detection and Fault Notification. In 
       addition to the above diagnostic codes, a PE uses the following 
       codes to signal AC defects and other defects impacting forwarding 
       over the PW service: </t>

      <t><list style="hanging">     
       <t hangText="  6 -"> Concatenated Path Down </t> 

       <t hangText="  8 -"> Reverse Concatenated Path Down </t>
      </list></t> 


      <t> As specified in [RFC 5085], a PE negotiates the use of VCCV 
       during PW set-up. When a PW transported over an MPLS-PSN is 
       established using LDP, the PEs negotiate the use of the VCCV 
       capabilities using the optional VCCV Capability Advertisement Sub-
       TLV parameter in the Interface Parameter Sub-TLV field of the LDP PW 
       ID FEC or using an Interface Parameters TLV of the LDP Generalized 
       PW ID FEC. In the case of L2TPv3/IP PSNs, the PEs negotiate the use 
       of VCCV during the pseudowire session initialization using VCCV AVP. </t> 

 
      <t> Note that a defect that causes the generation of the "PW not 
       forwarding code" (diagnostic code 6 or 8) does not necessarily 
       result in the BFD session going down. However, if the BFD session 
       times out, then diagnostic code 1 must be used since it signals a 
       state change of the BFD session itself. In general, when a BFD 
       session changes state, the PEs must use the state change diagnostic 
       codes 0, 1, 3, and 7 in accordance to [BFD] and they MUST override 
       any of the AC/PW status diagnostic codes (codes 6 or 8) that may 
       have been signaled prior to the BFD session changing state. </t> 

      <t> The forward and reverse defect indications used in this document 
          map to the following BFD codes: </t>

      <t><list style="hanging">     
       <t hangText="     "> Forward defect indication corresponds to the logical OR of: </t>

       <t hangText="         *"> Reverse Concatenated Path Down (BFD diagnostic code 08). </t> 

      </list></t>

      <t> These diagnostic codes are used to signal forward and reverse defect 
       states, respectively, when the PEs negotiated the use of BFD as the 
       mechanism for AC and PW fault detection and status signaling 
       notification. As stated in Section 8.1, these CV types SHOULD NOT be 
       used when the PW is established with the LDP or L2TP control plane. </t>

<section title="Procedures for TDM PW Service">
  <t>  The following procedures apply to SAToP ([RFC4553]), CESoPSN 
       ([RFC5086]) and TDMoIP ([RFC5087]). These technologies utilize the 
       single emulated OAM loop mode. RFC 5087 distinguishes between trail-
       extended and trail-terminated scenarios; the former is essentially 
       the single emulated loop model. The latter applies to cases where 
       the NS networks are run by different operators and defect 
       notifications are not propagated across the PW. </t>

  <t>  Since TDM is inherently real-time in nature, many OAM indications 
       must be generated or forwarded with minimal delay. This requirement 
       rules out the use of messaging protocols, such as PW status 
       messages. Thus, for TDM PWs, alternate mechanisms are employed. </t>
 

  <t>  The fact that TDM PW packets are sent at a known constant rate can 
       be exploited as an OAM mechanism. Thus, a PE enters the PW receive 
       defect state whenever a preconfigured number of TDM PW packets do 
       not arrive in a timely fashion. It exits this state when packets 
       once again arrive at their proper rate. </t>

  <t>  Native TDM carries OAM indications in overhead fields that travel 
       along with the data. TDM PWs emulate this behavior by sending urgent 
       OAM messages in the PWE control word. </t>

  <t>  The TDM PWE3 control word contains a set of flags used to indicate 
       PW and AC defect conditions. The L bit is an AC forward defect 
       indication used by the upstream PE to signal NS network defects to 
       the downstream PE. The M field may be used to modify the meaning of 
       receive defects. The R bit is a PW reverse defect indication used by 
       the PE to signal PSN failures to the remote PE. Upon reception of 
       packets with the R bit set, a PE enters the PW transmit defect 
       state. L bits and R bits are further described in [RFC5087]. </t>

<section title="Procedures for CEP PW Service">
  <t>  The following procedures apply to SONET/SDH Circuit Emulation 
       ([RFC4842]). They are based on the single emulated OAM loop mode. </t>

  <t>  Since SONET and SDH are inherently real-time in nature, many OAM 
       indications must be generated or forwarded with minimal delay. This 
       requirement rules out the use of messaging protocols, such as PW 
       status messages. Thus, for CEP PWs alternate mechanisms are 
       employed. </t>

  <t>  The CEP PWE3 control word contains a set of flags used to indicate 
       PW and AC defect conditions. The L bit is a forward defect 
       indication used by the upstream PE to signal to the downstream PE a 
       defect in its local attachment circuit. The R bit is a PW reverse 
       defect indication used by the PE to signal PSN failures to the 
       remote PE. The combination of N and P bits is used by the local PE 
       to signal loss of pointer to the remote PE. </t>
 

  <t>  The fact that CEP PW packets are sent at a known constant rate can 
       be exploited as an OAM mechanism. Thus, a PE enters the PW receive 
       defect state when it loses packet synchronization. It exits this 
       state when it regains packet synchronization. See [RFC4842] for 
       further details. </t>

 <section title="Frame Relay Management">
   <t> The management of Frame Relay Bearer Service (FRBS) connections can

   <t><list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="a."> Based on ITU-T Q.933 Annex A, Link Integrity Verification

   <t> In addition, ITU-T I.620 addresses Frame Relay loopback, but the

       manage Frame Relay interfaces. This document will refer exclusively 
       to Q.933 messages. </t> 
            
   <t> The status of any provisioned Frame Relay PVC may be updated 
       through: </t>  
              
   <t><list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="a."> Frame Relay STATUS messages in response to Frame Relay STATUS 
               ENQUIRY messages; these are mandatory. </t> 
            
      <t hangText="b."> Optional unsolicited STATUS updates independent of STATUS

               on configuration. </t> 
   </list></t> 
             
   <t> In Frame Relay, a Data Link Connection [DLC] is either up or down. 
       There is no distinction between different directions. To achieve 
       commonality with other technologies, down is represented as a 
       receive defect. </t> 
        
   <t> Frame relay connection management is not implemented over the PW 
       using either of the techniques native to FR, therefore PW mechanisms 
       are used to synchronize the view each PE has of the remote Native 
       Service/Attachment Circuit [NS/AC]. A PE will treat a remote NS/AC 
       failure in the same way it would treat a PW or PSN failure; that is 
       using AC facing FR connection management to notify the CE that FR is 
       down. </t>
 </section> 

 <section title="ATM Management">
   <t> ATM management and OAM mechanisms are much more evolved than those 
       of Frame Relay.  There are five broad management-related categories, 
       including fault management (FT), Performance management (PM), 
       configuration management (CM), Accounting management (AC), and 
       Security management (SM). [I.610] describes the functions for 
       the operation and maintenance of the physical layer and the ATM 
       layer, that is, management at the bit and cell levels [I.610]. 
       Because of its scope, this document will concentrate on ATM fault 

       management functions. Fault management functions include the 
       following: </t> 
             
   <t><list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="a."> Alarm indication signal (AIS). </t>  
      <t hangText="b."> Remote Defect indication (RDI). </t>  
      <t hangText="c."> Continuity Check (CC). </t> 
      <t hangText="d."> Loopback (LB). </t>  
    </list></t> 
            
   <t> Some of the basic ATM fault management functions are described as 
       follows: Alarm indication signal (AIS) sends a message in the same 
       direction as that of the signal, to the effect that an error has 
       been detected. </t> 
            
   <t> Remote defect indication (RDI) sends a message to the transmitting 
       terminal that an error has been detected. Alarms related to the 
       physical layer are indicated using path AIS/RDI. Virtual path 
       AIS/RDI and virtual channel AIS/RDI are also generated for the ATM 
       layer. </t>  
             
   <t> OAM cells (F4 and F5 cells) are used to instrument virtual paths and 
       virtual channels respectively with regard to their performance and 
       availability. OAM cells in the F4 and F5 flows are used for 
       monitoring a segment of the network and end-to-end monitoring. OAM 
       cells in F4 flows have the same VPI as that of the connection being 
       monitored. OAM cells in F5 flows have the same VPI and VCI as that 
       of the connection being monitored.  The AIS and RDI messages of the 
       F4 and F5 flows are sent to the other network nodes via the VPC or 
       the VCC to which the message refers. The type of error and its 
       location can be indicated in the OAM cells. Continuity check is 
       another fault management function. To check whether a VCC that has 
       been idle for a period of time is still functioning, the network 
       elements can send continuity-check cells along that VCC. </t>

   <t> A PE can detect packet loss resulting from congestion through 
       several methods. If a PE uses the sequence number field in the PWE3 
       Control Word for a specific Pseudowire [RFC3985] and [RFC4385], it 
       has the ability to detect packet loss.  Translation of congestion

   <t> There are congestion alarms that are raised in the node and to the
