   enhanced Optical Transport Networking (OTN) flexibility. Several 
   recent documents have proposed ways to modify GMPLS signaling 
   protocols to support these new OTN features.  

   It is important that a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS 
   signaling and routing protocols. This solution must support ODUk 
   multiplexing capabilities, address all of the new features, be 
   acceptable to all equipment vendors, and be extensible considering 
   continued OTN evolution.  

   This document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) addressing ODUk multiplexing and new 
   features including ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to include Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex 
   (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and ODU), Wavelength (OCh, Lambdas) Switching, 
   and Spatial Switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port 
   or fiber). [RFC3471] presents a functional description of the 
   extensions to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling 
   required to support Generalized MPLS.  RSVP-TE-specific formats and 
   mechanisms and technology specific details are defined in [RFC3473]. 

   With the evolution and deployment of G.709 technology, it is 
   necessary that appropriate enhanced control technology support be 
   provided for G.709. [RFC4328] describes the control technology 
   details that are specific to foundation G.709 Optical Transport 
   Networks (OTN), as specified in the ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G709-
   V1], for ODUk deployments without multiplexing. 

   In addition to increasing need to support ODUk multiplexing, the 
   evolution of OTN has introduced additional containers and new 
   flexibility. For example, ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 containers and ODUflex 
   are developed in [G709-V3]. 

   In addition, the following issues require consideration: 

      -  Support for hitless adjustment of ODUflex, which is to be 
         specified in ITU-T G.hao. 

      -  Support for Tributary Port Number. The Tributary Port Number 
         has to be negotiated on each link for flexible assignment of

         tributary ports to tributary slots in case of LO-ODU over HO-
         ODU (e.g., ODU2 into ODU3).  

   Therefore, it is clear that [RFC4328] has to be updated or superceded 
   in order to support ODUk multiplexing, as well as other ODU 
   enhancements introduced by evolution of OTN standards.  

   This document updates [RFC4328] extending the G.709 ODUk traffic 
   parameters and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible and scalable. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. GMPLS Extensions for the Evolving G.709 - Overview 

   New features for the evolving OTN, for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 
   and ODUflex containers are specified in [G709-V3]. The corresponding 
   new signal types are summarized below: 

      - Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk): 
         . OTU4 

      - Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 
         . ODU0 
         . ODU2e 
         . ODU4 
         . ODUflex 

   A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) is also 
   described in [G709-V3]. Thus, there are now two TS granularities for 
   the foundation OTN ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers. The TS granularity 
   at 2.5 Gbps is used on legacy interfaces while the new 1.25 Gbps will 
   be used for the new interfaces. 

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4), 
   the evolving OTN [G.709-V3] encompasses the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 
   0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k > j), as described in Section 
   3.1.2 of [OTN-frwk]. 

   Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) of OPUk (OPUk-Xv, k = 1/2/3, X = 1...256) 
   are also supported by [OTN-V3]. Note that VCAT of OPU0 / OPU2e / OPU4 
   / OPUflex are not supported per [OTN-V3].

   [RFC4328] describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control 
   for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN) [G709-V1]. However, 
   [RFC4328] needs to be updated because it does not provide the means 
   to signal all the new signal types and related mapping and 
   multiplexing functionalities. Moreover, it supports only the 
   deprecated auto-MSI mode which assumes that the Tributary Port Number 
   is automatically assigned in the transmit direction and not checked 
   in the receive direction. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and presents a new OTN label format which is very flexible 
   and scalable. Additionally, procedures about Tributary Port Number 
   assignment through control plane are also provided in this document. 

3.1. Requirements for supporting services over hierarchical OTN network 

   [Editor's Note] The section 3.1 about requirements will be moved to 
   the framework document after discussion. 

   1.[R1] Support signaling mechanism to instantiate ODUj service layer 
     on an ODUk link via single stage muxing.  

     An ODUj LSP could involve zero (j=k) or one stage (j<k) 
     multiplexing on a given ODUk link. Here both Control-plane and 
     Data-plane entities are created for the ODUj service layer. ODUk 
     link could be a point-to-point OTUk link or an H-LSP. This is the 
     most foundational and important requirement the control plane 
     should support. 

   2.[R2] Support signaling mechanism to instantiate ODUj LSP involving 
     one or more intermediate ODU layers (either pre-existing or not) 
     which cross multiple ODUk links.

     Figure 1 shows an example where the ODU0 LSP is multiplexed into an 
     intermediate ODU2, which crosses three ODU links between N2 and N5.

     There are two typical scenarios requesting two or more stage 
     multiplexing crossing multiple ODUk links: 

     -  Tunnel scenario: Assume that N3 and N4 in figure 1 are legacy 
        nodes which don't support ODU0 or ODUflex cross-connection. In 
        order to create ODU0 or ODUflex service between N1 and N6, an 
        intermediate ODU2 connection can be created between N2 and N5. 
        Then, the ODU0 or ODUflex can be multiplexed into this ODU2 
        connection. In this case, N3 and N4 only need to perform ODU2 
        cross-connection and are not aware of ODU0 or ODUflex service 
        inside. 

     -  Carrier-in-carrier scenario: Assume that N2, N3, N4 and N5 in 
        figure 1 belong to carrier A, while N1 and N6 belong to carrier 
        B. Carrier B may lease an ODU2 pipe between N2 and N5, which is 
        pre-provisioned by carrier A, to carry LO ODU services between 
        N1 and N6.  

     More specifically, this requirement can be further divided into two 
     items: 

     [R2.1] Support signaling mechanism to trigger the creation of one 
     or more intermediate ODU layers over multiple ODUk links based on 
     the ODUj LSP creation request. 

     [R2.2] Support signaling mechanism to instantiate ODUj service 
     layer on multiple ODUk links where one or more intermediate ODU 
     layers may be pre-existing. 

   3.[R3] Support signaling mechanism to instantiate ODUj LSP involving 
     one or more intermediate ODU layers (either pre-existing or not) on 
     one hop ODUk link.  

     More specifically, this requirement can be further divided into two 
     items: 

     [R3.1] Support signaling mechanism to instantiate one or more 
     intermediate layers on one hop ODUk link in order to support the 
     ODUj service layer.  

     An ODUj LSP could involve two or more stage multiplexing on a given 
     ODUk link. These intermediate layers may be implicitly created as a 
     part of ODUj service LSP creation. In this case, both control plane 
     and data plane entities will be created for the ODUj service layer. 
     However, intermediate ODU layer(s) (implicitly created) will have 
     data plane representation only.

     [R3.2] Support signaling mechanism to instantiate ODUj service 
     layer on an ODUk link where one or more intermediate ODU layers may 
     be pre-existing.  

     An ODUj LSP could involve two or more stage multiplexing on a given 
     ODUk link. These intermediate layers may be pre-existing as a 
     result of another LSP creation on the same ODU hierarchy or 
     explicitly configured through management interface.  

   4.[R4] Support controllable and manageable capability for the 
     intermediate ODU layers which cross one or more hops of ODUk links 
     and which is used for carrying ODUj services. 

     Once the intermediate ODU layers are created by control plane (may 
     be triggered by the ODUj service or by management plane), they 
     should be under the control of control plane or management plane. 
     The following typical scenarios should be considered: 

     -  The control/management plane should have the capability to 
        reroute the intermediate ODU layers to recover all the contained 
        ODUj layer services to improve the recovery performance after 
        network failure occurs in the intermediate ODU layers. 

     -  The control/management plane should have the capability to 
        delete an empty intermediate ODU connection (i.e., without any 
        ODUj service inside it) to release the bandwidth resource of 
        ODUk link. For example, the management plane may request the 
        control plane to delete an empty intermediate ODU2 in an ODU4 
        link so that the ODU4 link has enough bandwidth resource to 
        carry a new ODU3 service. 

   5.[R5] Support signaling mechanism where ODUj service LSP creation 
     may involve varying mux hierarchies on each hop.  

     An end-to-end ODUj service LSP creation may involve zero or more 
     stage ODU multiplexing on every hop in the path. Basically, the 
     scenarios discussed in R1 to R3 could be associated with any of the 
     hops involved. 

   6.[R6] Support signaling mechanism for egress control of OTN 
     interfaces.  

     An egress interface of an ODUj LSP could involve single or multiple 
     stage multiplexing. Egress Label sub-object defined in [RFC-4003] 
     must be used to signal hierarchical multiplexing information 
     pertaining to the egress interface of the LSP.

   The traffic parameters for G.709 are defined as follows:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   The Signal Type should be extended to cover the new Signal Type 
   introduced by the evolving OTN. The new Signal Type is extended as

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields are used 
   together to represent the actual bandwidth of ODUflex, where: 

   -  The Bit_Rate field indicates the nominal bit rate of ODUflex(CBR) 
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number 
      (referring to [RFC4506] and [IEEE]).

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-08.txt                 July 2011 


   -  The Tolerance field indicates the bit rate tolerance (part per 
      million, ppm) of the ODUflex(CBR) encoded as an unsigned integer, 
      which is bounded in 0~100ppm. 

   For example, for an ODUflex(CBR) service with Bit_Rate = 2.5Gbps and 
   Tolerance = 100ppm, the actual bandwidth of the ODUflex is: 

              2.5Gbps * (1 - 100ppm) ~ 2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) 

   In case of other ODUk signal types, the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields 
   are not necessary and MUST be filled with 0. 

   The usage of the NMC, NVC and Multiplier (MT) fields are the same as 
   [RFC4328]. 

4.1. Usage of ODUflex(CBR) Traffic Parameter 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the information of Bit_Rate and Tolerance in 
   the ODUflex traffic parameter is used to determine the total number 
   of tributary slots N in the HO ODUk link to be reserved. Here:  

         N = Ceiling of 

   ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate * (1 + ODUflex(CBR) bit rate tolerance) 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
       ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

    
   Therefore, a node receiving a Path message containing ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter can allocate precise number of tributary slots and 
   set up the cross-connection for the ODUflex service. 

   Table 1 below shows the actual bandwidth of the tributary slot of 
   ODUk (in Gbps), referring to [G709-V3]. 

                   Table 1 - Actual TS bandwidth of ODUk 

      ODUk       Minimum          Nominal          Maximum 
      ------------------------------------------------------- 
      ODU2    1.249 384 632    1.249 409 620    1.249 434 608 
      ODU3    1.254 678 635    1.254 703 729    1.254 728 823 
      ODU4    1.301 683 217    1.301 709 251    1.301 735 285 

      Note that: 

      Minimum bandwidth of ODUTk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance)

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-08.txt                 July 2011 


    
      Maximum bandwidth of ODTUk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 + HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

      Where: HO OPUk bit rate tolerance = 20ppm 

   For different ODUk, the bandwidths of the tributary slot are 
   different, and so the total number of tributary slots to be reserved 
   for the ODUflex(CBR) may not be the same on different HO ODUk links. 
   This is why the traffic parameter should bring the actual bandwidth 
   information other than the NMC field. 

    

4.2. Example of ODUflex(CBR) Traffic Parameter 

   This section gives an example to illustrate the usage of ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter. 

   As shown in Figure 2, assume there is an ODUflex(CBR) service 
   requesting a bandwidth of (2.5Gbps, +/-100ppm) from node A to node C. 
   In other words, the ODUflex traffic parameter indicates that Signal 
   Type is 33 (ODUflex(CBR)), Bit_Rate is 2.5Gbps and Tolerance is 
   100ppm.

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 
      100ppm), and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU4 
      equals 1.301 683 217Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots 
      N1 to be reserved on this link is: 

      N1 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.301 683 217) = 2 

   -  On the HO ODU2 link between node B and C: 

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 
      100ppm), and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU2 
      equals 1.249 384 632Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots 
      N2 to be reserved on this link is: 

      N2 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.249 384 632) = 3 

5. Generalized Label 

   [RFC3471] has defined the Generalized Label which extends the 
   traditional label by allowing the representation of not only labels 
   which travel in-band with associated data packets, but also labels 
   which identify time-slots, wavelengths, or space division multiplexed 
   positions. The format of the corresponding RSVP-TE Generalized Label   
   object is defined in the Section 2.3 of [RFC3473]. 

   However, for different technologies, we usually need use specific 
   label rather than the Generalized Label. For example, the label 
   format described in [RFC4606] could be used for SDH/SONET, the label 
   format in [RFC4328] for G.709. 

   [RFC 6107] defines using hierarchical LSP for MLN. The H-LSPs can be 
   setup manually or dynamically (induced FAs) for multi-stage 
   multiplexing scenarios.  Service creation in hierarchical OTN network 
   can be achieved in following 2 ways. 

5.1. New definition of Single-stage ODUk Generalized Label 

   In order to be compatible with new types of ODU signal and new types 
   of tributary slot, the following new ODUk label format is defined:

   In case of LO ODUj mapped into OTUk (j=k), this field is not 
   necessary and should be ignored. 

   TPN (16 bits): indicates the Tributary Port Number (TPN) for the 
   assigned Tributary Slot(s).  

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, only the 
         lower 6 bits of TPN field is significant and the other bits of 
         TPN MUST be set to 0. 

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU4, only the lower 7 
         bits of TPN field is significant and the other bits of TPN MUST 
         be set to 0.  

      -  In case of ODUj mapped into OTUk (j=k), the TPN is not needed 
         and this field MUST be set to 0. 

   As per [G709-V3], The TPN is used to allow for correct demultiplexing 
   in the data plane. When an LO ODUj is multiplexed into HO ODUk 
   occupying one or more TSs, a new TPN value is configured at the two 
   end of the HO ODUk link and is put into the related MSI byte(s) in 
   the OPUk overhead at the (traffic) ingress end of the link, so that 
   the other end of the link can learn which TS(s) is/are used by the LO 
   ODUj in the data plane. 

   According to [G709-V3], the rules of TPN assignment should be as the 
   following tables:

   Note that in the case of "Flexible", the value of TPN is not relevant 
   to the TS number as per [G709-V3].  

   Bit Map (variable): indicates which tributary slots in HO ODUk that 
   the LO ODUj will be multiplexed into. The sequence of the Bit Map is 
   consistent with the sequence of the tributary slots in HO ODUk. Each 
   bit in the bit map represents the corresponding tributary slot in HO 
   ODUk with a value of 1 or 0 indicating whether the tributary slot 
   will be used by LO ODUj or not. 

   The size of the bit map equals to the total number of the tributary 
   slots of HO ODUk, which is deduced by the ODU(T)k and T fields. 

   In case of an ODUk mapped into OTUk, it's no need to indicate which 
   tributary slots will be used, so the size of Bit Map is 0. 

   Padded bits are added behind the Bit Map to make the whole label a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary. Padded bit MUST be set to 0 and 
   MUST be ignored.

5.1.2. Label Distribution Procedure 

   This document does not change the existing label distribution 
   procedures [RFC4328] for GMPLS except that the new ODUk label should 
   be processed as follows. 

   When a node receives a generalized label request for setting up an 
   ODUj LSP from its upstream neighbor node, the node should generate an 
   ODU label according to the signal type of the requested LSP and the 
   free resources (i.e., free tributary slots of ODUk) that will be 
   reserved for the LSP, and send the label to its upstream neighbor 
   node.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then set the bits to 1 in 
   the Bit Map field corresponding to the reserved tributary slots. The 
   node should also assign a valid TPN, which does not collided with 
   other TPN value used by existing LO ODU connections in the selected 
   HO ODU link, and configure the expected multiplex structure 
   identifier (ExMSI) using this TPN. Then, the assigned TPN is filled 
   into the label. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the node only needs to fill the ODUj 
   and the ODUk fields with corresponding values in the label. Other 
   bits are reserved and MUST be set to 0. 

   When receiving an ODU label from its downstream neighbor node, the 
   node should learn which ODU signal type is multiplexed or mapped into 
   which ODU signal type by analyzing the ODUj and the ODUk fields.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type

   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then obtain which tributary 
   slots in ODUk are reserved by its downstream neighbor node according 
   to the position of the bits that are set to 1 in the Bit Map field, 
   so that the node can multiplex the ODUj into the reserved tributary 
   slots of ODUk after the LSP is established. The node should also get 
   the TPN value assigned by its downstream neighbor node from the label, 
   and fill the TPN into the related MSI byte(s) in the OPUk overhead in 
   the data plane, so that the downstream neighbor node can check 
   whether the TPN received from the data plane is consistent with the 
   ExMSI and determine whether there is any mismatch defect. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the size of Bit Map field is 0 and 
   no additional procedure is needed. 

   Note that the procedures of other label related objects (e.g., 
   Upstream Label, Label Set) are similar as described above. 

   Note also that the TPN in the label_ERO may not be assigned (i.e., 
   TPN field = 0) if the TPN is requested to be assigned locally.  

5.1.2.1. Notification on Label Error 

   When receiving an ODUk label from the neighbor node, the node should 
   check the integrity of the label. An error message containing an 
   "Unacceptable label value" indication ([RFC3209]) should be sent if 
   one of the following cases occurs: 

   -  The ODUj field does not match with the Traffic Parameters; 

   -  The OD(T)Uk field does not match with the type of the selected 
      link;  

   -  The selected link only supports 2.5Gbps TS granularity while the T 
      field in the label indicates the 1.25Gbps TS granularity; 

   -  The label includes an invalid TPN value that breaks the TPN 
      assignment rules; 

   -  Not enough bits of Bit Map, or Bit Map with non-zero padding bits; 

   -  The reserved resources (i.e., the number of "1" in the Bit Map 
      field) do not match with the Traffic Parameters. 

5.1.3. Supporting Virtual Concatenation and Multiplication 

   As per [VCAT], the VCGs can be created using Co-Signaled style or 
   Multiple LSPs style. 
 
 
Zhang                   Expires January 2012                 [Page 17] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-08.txt                 July 2011 


   In case of Co-Signaled style, the explicit ordered list of all labels 
   reflects the order of VCG members, which is similar to [RFC4328]. In 
   case of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (NVC > 1), the 
   first label indicates the components of the first virtually 
   concatenated signal; the second label indicates the components of the 
   second virtually concatenated signal; and so on. In case of 
   multiplication of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (MT > 1), 
   the first label indicates the components of the first multiplexed 
   virtually concatenated signal; the second label indicates components 
   of the second multiplexed virtually concatenated signal; and so on. 

   In case of Multiple LSPs style, multiple control plane LSPs are 
   created with a single VCG and the VCAT Call can be used to associate 
   the control plane LSPs. The procedures are similar to section 6 of 
   [VCAT]. 

5.1.4. Supporting Multiplexing Hierarchy  

   As described in [OTN-FRWK], one ODUj connection can be nested into 
   another ODUk (j<k) connection, which forms the multiplexing hierarchy 
   in the ODU layer. This is useful if there are some intermediate nodes 
   in the network which only support ODUk but not ODUj switching. 

   For example, in Figure 3, assume that N3 is a legacy node which only 
   supports [G709-V1] and does not support ODU0 switching. If an ODU0 
   connection between N1 and N5 is required, then we can create an ODU2 
   connection between N2 and N4 (or ODU1 / ODU3 connection, depending on 
   policies and the capabilities of the two ends of the connection), and 
   nest the ODU0 into the ODU2 connection. In this way, N3 only needs to 
   perform ODU2 switching and does not need to be aware of the inner 
   ODU0.

   -  The outer ODU2 connection is created in advance based on network 
      planning, which is treated as a Forwarding Adjacency (FA). Then 
      the inner ODU0 can be created using the resource of the ODU2 FA. 
      In this case, the outer ODU2 and inner ODU0 connections are 
      created separately, and the normal ODU connection creation 
      procedure described in this document can be used. 

   -  Using the multi-layer network signaling described in [RFC4206], 
      [RFC6107] and [RFC6001] (including related modifications, if 
      needed). That is, when the signaling message for ODUO connection 
      arrives at N2, a new RSVP session between N2 and N4 is triggered 
      to create the ODU2 connection. This ODU2 connection is treated as 
      an FA after it is created. And then the signaling procedure for 
      the ODU0 connection can be continued using the resource of the 
      ODU2 FA. 

5.1.5. Supporting One-hop Multiplexing Hierarchy via Single Session  

5.1.5.1. Multiplexing Hierarchy and Solution Alternatives 

   In order to support instantiating ODUj LSP involving one or more 
   intermediate ODU layers on an ODUk link (i.e., the scenario described 
   in Requirement 3 of Section 3.1), there are two approaches to achieve 
   the objective. The existing approach is the hierarchical LSP (H-LSP) 
   approach described in Section 5.5, and another one is to use the 
   multi-stage label approach. 

   For the multi-stage label approach, the whole multiplexing structure 
   on the ODUk link (i.e., ODUj service multiplexed into one or more 
   intermediate ODU layers and then multiplexed into ODUk link) is 
   included in the signaling message which is used for creating the ODUj 
   service. After receiving the message, both ends of the ODUk link will 
   construct the multi-stage multiplexing in the data plane. In this way, 
   creation of intermediate ODU layers is treated as part of creation of 
   the ODUj service, without any intermediate ODU FA on the ODUk link. 
   Note that the ODUk link can either be mapped to an OTUk link directly, 
   or be a multi-hop FA created in advance crossing multiple OTU links 
   (using H-LSP mechanism). 

5.1.5.2. Multi Stage Label Format 

   In this document, a new optional object named MULTI-STAGE LABEL 
   Object is introduced to indicate how the intermediate ODU layers are 
   multiplexed into ODUk link in the one-hop multi-stage multiplexing 
   scenario. The format of this object is shown below (The Class-Num and 
   the C-Type of this new object are TBD):

   Num MUX Stages: This field indicates the number of multiplexing 
   stages specified by the label. 

   Tributary Slot Info: This field has the same format as the ODUk label 
   format described in Section 5.1. In the case of n-step multiplexing 
   (e.g., ODUj into ODUi1 into ODUi2 ... into ODUi(n-1) into ODUk 
   multiplexing), The Tributary Slot Info (Stage-2) indicates how ODUi1 
   is multiplexed into ODUi2; the Tributary Slot Info (Stage-3) 
   indicates how ODUi2 is multiplexed into ODUi3 ... and the Tributary 
   Slot Info (Stage-n) indicates how ODUi(n-1) is multiplexed into the 
   ODUk link. Note that how ODUj is multiplexed into ODUi1 is indicated 
   by the generalized label and is not included in this object. 

   Note that the MULTI-STAGE LABEL Object is not necessary and must not 
   be included in the signaling message in case  the signaling message 
   is used for creating only one ODU layer connection via single stage 
   muxing. One example is to instantiate ODUj service on an ODUk link 
   via single stage muxing. Another example is to use H-LSP mechanism to 
   instantiate ODUj service involving one or more intermediate ODU FAs, 
   where multiple RSVP sessions will be created separately, each of 
   which is used to create one ODU-FA layer connection In such cases, 
   the generalized label is used without the multi-stage label, as 
   described in Section 5. 

    

5.1.5.3. Label format for NVC or Multiplier > 1 

   For NVC or Multiplier field value > 1, the multi-stage label format 
   defined in Section 6.2 needs to be repeated NVC/multiplier times.

5.1.5.4. Usage of Multi-stage Label in Multi Stage Muxing 

   When an ODUj LSP is requested where one or more intermediate ODU 
   layers are involved on an ODUk link, the multi-stage label together 
   with the generalized label can be used to indicate the multi-stage 
   multiplexing structure. The generalized label, as described in 
   Section 5, is used to indicate how the ODUj service is multiplexed 
   into the first intermediate ODU layer and the multi-stage label is 
   used to indicate how the intermediate ODU layers are multiplexed into 
   the ODUk link. 

   Take Figure 4 as an example. Assume on an OTU3 Link, a restrictive 
   MUX hierarchy is supported on the associated interfaces. In order to 
   switch ODU1 on this Link, ODU3 and ODU2 need to be terminated on the 
   same span as the OTU3 link.

   In this example, the generalized label is used to indicate how the 
   ODU1 service is multiplexed into the intermediate ODU2, the 
   procedures are the same as described in Section 5. An example 
   generalized label is shown below, assuming that the ODU1 is 
   multiplexed into the 2nd and the 4th tributary slot of ODU2, wherein 
   the type of the tributary slot is 1.25Gbps, and the TPN value is 1:

   Service ODU layer requires termination of more than one HO-ODUs on a 
   given OTU/ODU Link.  

   Multi stage label allows implicit creation of intermediate ODU layers 
   for supporting the instantiation of service ODU layer on a given hop, 
   thus eliminating the need for one hop H-LSPs pertaining to 
   intermediate ODU layers. 

   If higher order ODU layers spans more than one hop due to switching 
   restrictions, H-LSP needs to be used in tandem with multi-stage Label 
   to facilitate end to end service creation.

5.2.3. Usage of Multi-stage Label  

   Multi-stage Label is needed when switching of an ODU Layer requires 
   termination of more than one HO-ODUs on a given OTU/ODU Link. This 
   eliminates the need for creating H-LSPs whose span matches its parent 
   TE-Link.

   Example-1: 

   Assume on an OTU3 Link, a restrictive MUX hierarchy (as shown in 
   figure 6) is supported on the associated interfaces. In order to 
   switch ODU1 on this Link, ODU3 and ODU2 need to be terminated on the 
   same span as the OTU3 link. If multi-stage Label is not supported, H-
   LSP need to be created for ODU3 and ODU2 layers (or just ODU2 layer 
   at the minimum) in order to support ODU1 LSP.  Creation of ODU3 and 
   ODU2 H-LSP on top of OTU3 Link on the same span is not really 
   required as bandwidth management for all ODU layers can still be 
   managed on the OTU3 Link itself.  

   Multi-stage Label helps in implicit creation of ODU3 and ODU2 layers 
   as part of ODU1 LSP setup and thus eliminates the need for the 
   creation of the H-LSP on every hop.

   Note: Multi-stage Label is NOT intended to facilitate the creation of 
   H-LSP or Hierarchical LSP. It is basically used to eliminate the need 
   for H-LSP in some obvious scenarios.  

5.2.4. Label Distribution Rules 

   This document does not change the existing label distribution 
   procedures defined in [RFC4328] except that the new ODU label should 
   be processed as follows. 

   A. Sending Side 

   When Generalized Label Request is received on given node for setting 
   up an ODU LSP from its upstream neighbor, it reserves the bandwidth 
   required for the ODU Layer being switched and also the terminating 
   HO-ODUs layers involved. It sends upstream label and suggested label 
   (if applicable) to the downstream node and downstream label via PATH 
   Message and downstream label to the upstream node via RESV Message.  

   Note that Label can also be explicitly specified by source node. 

   The encoding of Generalized Label is as follows: 

   Case-1: ODUk mapping into OTUk 
   Number of MUX stages = 0 
   Tributary Slot information is not included.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-08.txt                 July 2011 


   Case-2: ODUj mux into ODUk 
   Number of MUX Stages = 1.  
   Stage-1: Length = <number of TSs on ODUk>.  
            TPN = <specified as per Section 5> 
            TS BitMap = <TSs reserved for ODUj are set to 1> 

   Case-3 ODUh mux into ODUj into ODUk  
   Number of MUX Stages = 2.  
   Stage-1: Length = <number of TSs on ODUk>.  
            TPN = <specified as per Section 5> 
            TS BitMap = <TSs reserved for ODUj are set to 1> 
   Stage-2: Length = <number of TSs on ODUj>.  
            TPN = <specified as per Section 5> 
            TS BitMap = <TSs reserved for ODUh are set to 1> 

   B. Receiving Side 

   The decoding of the Generalized Label is as follows: 

   Case-1: ODUk mapping into OTUk 
   For ODUk to OTUk mapping, the Tributary Slot Information is not 
   expected. 

   Case-2: ODUj mux into ODUk 
   For ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, one MUX stage Label is expected. 
   The node extracts the Bit Map field in Tributary Slot Info using the 
   Length field. The position of Bit in the Bitmap interpreted as the 
   Tributary Slot Number. The value stored in the bit indicates if it is 
   reserved for the ODUj. 

   Case-3: ODUh mux into ODUj into ODUk 
   For ODUh mux into ODUj into ODUk, two MUX stage Label is expected. 
   Each stage is further decoded as explained in case-2 above. 

5.2.5. Examples 

   Example-1: ODUj LSP over OTUk Links 

   Consider the network topology shown in the Figure 8 below:

5.3. Control Plane Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   Since the [RFC4328] has been deployed in the network for the nodes 
   that support [G709-V1] (herein we call them "legacy nodes"), backward 
   compatibility SHOULD be taken into consideration when the new nodes 
   (i.e., nodes that support [G709-V3]) and the legacy nodes are 
   interworking. 

   For backward compatibility consideration, the new node SHOULD have 
   the ability to generate and parse legacy labels. 

   o  For the legacy node, it always generates and sends legacy label to 
      its upstream node, no matter the upstream node is new or legacy, 
      as described in [RFC4328]. 

   o  For the new node, it will generate and send legacy label if its 
      upstream node is a legacy one, and generate and send new label if 
      its upstream node is a new one. 

   One backwards compatibility example is shown in Figure 9:

                Figure 9 - Backwards compatibility example 

   As described above, for backward compatibility considerations, it is 
   necessary for a new node to know whether the neighbor node is new or 
   legacy. 

   One optional method is manual configuration. But it is recommended to 
   use LMP to discover the capability of the neighbor node automatically, 
   as described in [OTN-LMP].  

   When performing the HO ODU link capability negotiation: 

   o  If the neighbor node only support the 2.5Gbps TS and only support 
      ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, the neighbor node should be treated as a legacy 
      node. 

   o  If the neighbor node can support the 1.25Gbps TS, or can support 
      other LO ODU types defined in [G709-V3]), the neighbor node should 
      be treated as new node. 

   o  If the neighbor node returns a LinkSummaryNack message including 
      an ERROR_CODE indicating nonsupport of HO ODU link capability 
      negotiation, the neighbor node should be treated as a legacy node. 

6. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations to the 
   existing GMPLS signaling protocols. Referring to [RFC3473], further 
   details of the specific security measures are provided. Additionally, 
   [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and

       The traffic parameters, which are carried in the G.709 
       SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects, do not require any new object 
       class and type based on [RFC4328]: 

       o G.709 SENDER_TSPEC Object: Class = 12, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

       o G.709 FLOWSPEC Object: Class = 9, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

   -  Generalized Label Object: 

       The new defined ODU label (session 5) is a kind of generalized 
       label. Therefore, the Class-Num and C-Type of the ODU label is 
       the same as that of generalized label described in [RFC3473], 
       i.e., Class-Num = 16, C-Type = 2.
