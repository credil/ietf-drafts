INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


1. Introduction

   The base TRILL protocol standard [RFCtrill] provides a TRILL Header
   options feature and describes minimal hooks to safely support that
   feature. But, except for the first two bits, it does not specify the
   structure of the options extension to the TRILL Header nor the
   details of any particular options. This draft specifies that format
   and some initial options: a special Flow ID field, ECN (Explicit
   Congestion Notification) extended header flags, and a test/pad
   option.

   Section 2 below describes the general principles of operation,
   format, and ordering of TRILL Header Options. Other than the special
   Flow ID option, TRILL Header options are of two kinds: extended
   header flags and TLV (Type, Length, Value) encoded options.

   Section 3 describes a specific extended flag option while Section 4
   describes a specific TLV encoded option.



1.1 Conventions used in this document

   The terminology and acronyms defined in [RFCtrill] are used herein
   with the same meaning.

   In this documents, "IP" refers to both IPv4 and IPv6.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


2. TRILL Header Options

   The base TRILL Protocol includes an option feature for extension of
   the TRILL Header (see [RFCtrill] Sections 3.5 and 3.8).  The 5-bit
   Op-Length header field gives the length of the extension to the TRILL
   Header in units of 4 octets, which allows up to 124 octets of header
   extension. If Op-Length is zero there is no header extension present;
   else, this area follows immediately after the Ingress Rbridge
   Nickname field of the TRILL Header. The optional extensions area
   consists of an extended flags area possibly followed by TLV options.
   Each TLV option present is 32-bit aligned. There is a special Flow ID
   option that may also occur in the extended flags area.

   As described below, provision is made for both hop-by-hop options,
   which might affect any RBridge that receives a TRILL Data frame
   containing such an extension, and ingress-to-egress options, which
   would only necessarily affect the RBridge(s) where a TRILL frame is
   decapsulated. Provision is also made for both "critical" and "non-
   critical" options. Any RBridge receiving a frame with a critical hop-
   by-hop option that it does not implement MUST discard the frame
   because it is unsafe to process the frame without understanding the
   critical option. Any egress RBridge receiving a frame with a critical
   ingress-to-egress option it does not implement MUST drop the frame if
   it is a known unicast frame; if it is a multi-destination TRILL Data
   frame with a critical ingress-to-egress option that the RBridge does
   not implement, then it MUST NOT be egressed at that RBridge but it is
   still forwarded on the distribution tree. Non-critical options can be
   safely ignored.

   Any option indicating a significant change in the structure or
   interpretation of later parts of the frame which, if the option were
   ignored, could reasonably cause a failure of service or violation of
   security policy MUST be a critical option. If such an extension
   affects any fields that transit RBridges will examine, it MUST be a
   hop-by-hop critical option.

   TLV options also have a "mutability" flag that has a different
   meaning for ingress-to-egress and for hop-by-hop.

   For an ingress-to-egress option, the mutability flag indicates
   whether the value associated with the option can change at a transit
   RBridge (mutable options) or cannot so change (immutable options).
   For example, an ingress-to-egress security option could protect the
   value of an immutable ingress-to-egress option. But such a security
   option generally could not protect a mutable value as a transit
   RBridge could change that value but might not have the keys to
   recompute a signature or authentication code to take a changed value
   into account.

   For a non-critical hop-by-hop option, the mutability flag indicates


D. Eastlake, et al                                              [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


   whether a transit RBridge that does not implement the option is
   permitted (mutable) or not permitted (immutable) to remove the
   option. A transit RBridge is not required to remove a hop-by-hop
   option that it does not implement.

   For critical hop-by-hop options, the mutability flag is meaningless.
   If the RBridge does not implement the critical hop-by-hop option, it
   MUST drop the frame. If it does implement the critical hop-by-hop
   option, it will know whether or not it may/should/must remove it.
   For critical hop-by-hop options, the mutability flag is set to zero
   ("immutable") on transmission and ignored on receipt.

      Note: Most RBridges implementations are expected to be optimized
      for simple and common cases of frame forwarding and processing.
      Although the hard limit on the header options area length, the
      32-bit alignment of TLV options, and the presence of critical
      option summary bits, as described below, are intended to assist in
      the efficient hardware based processing of frames with a TRILL
      header options area, nevertheless the inclusion of options,
      particularly TLV options, may cause frame processing using a "slow
      path" with inferior performance to "fast path" processing. Limited
      slow path throughput of such frames could cause them to be
      discarded.



2.1 RBridge Option Handling Requirements

   The requirements given in this section are in addition to the option
   handling requirements in [RFCtrill].

   All RBridges MUST be able to check whether there are any critical
   options present that are necessarily applicable to their processing
   of the frame as detailed below.  If they do not implement all such
   critical options present, they MUST discard the frame or, in some
   circumstances as described above for certain multi-destination
   frames, continue to forward the frame but MUST NOT egress the frame.

   Transit RBridges MUST transparently forward all immutable ingress-to-
   egress header options in frames that they forward. Any changes made
   by a transit RBridge to a mutable ingress-to-egress option value MUST
   be a change permitted by the specification of that option.

   In addition, a transit RBridge:

   o  MAY add, if space is available, or remove hop-by-hop options as
      specified for such options;
   o  MAY change the value and/or length of a mutable ingress-to-egress
      TLV option as permitted by that option's specification and
      provided there is enough room if lengthening it;


D. Eastlake, et al                                              [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


   o  MUST adjust the length of the options area, including changing Op-
      Length in the TRILL header, as appropriate for any changes it has
      made;
   o  MUST NOT add, remove, or re-order ingress-to-egress options.
   o  with regard to any non-critical hop-by-hop options that the
      transit RBridge does not implement, it MAY remove them if they are
      mutable but MUST transparently copy them when forwarding a frame
      if they are immutable.



2.2 No Critical Surprises

   RBridges advertise the ingress-to-egress options they support in
   their IS-IS LSP and advertise the hop-by-hop options they support at
   a port on the link connected to that port.  An RBridge is not
   required to support any options.

   Unless an RBridge advertises support for a critical option, it will
   not normally receive frames with that option.

   An RBridge SHOULD NOT add a critical option to a frame unless,
   -  for a critical hop-by-hop option, it has determined that the next
      hop RBridge or RBridges that will accept the frame support that
      option, or
   -  for a critical ingress-to-egress option, it has determined that
      the RBridge or RBridges that will egress the frame support that
      option.

   "SHOULD NOT" is specified since there may be cases where it is
   acceptable for those frames, particularly for the multi-destination
   case, to be discarded by any RBridges that do not implement the
   option.



2.3 Options Format

   If any options are present in a TRILL Header, as indicated by a non-
   zero Op-Length field, the first 32 or 64 bits of the options area
   consist of extended header flags and the Flow ID, as described below.
   The remainder of the options area, if any, after this initial 32 or
   64 bits, consists of TLV (Type Length Value) options aligned on
   32-bit boundaries. Section 2.3.2 specifies the format of a TLV
   option. Section 2.3.3 describes the marshaling of TLV options.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


2.3.1 Extended Header Flags Area

   The first 32 bits of the Options Area are organized as follows:

      |  0    1   2   3-4  5-7  8-10 11-12  13   14   15 | 16 - 31 |
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+---------+
      |CHbH|CItE|MEF |CHHF|NHHF|CIEF|NIEF |NHHT|CIET|NIET| Flow ID |
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+---------+

                  Figure 1: Options Area Initial 32 Bits

   Any RBridge adding an options area to a TRILL Header must set these
   32 bits to zero except when permitted or required to set one or more
   of them as specified. The meanings of these bits are listed in the
   table below and then further described.

   Bit(s)   Description
   ---------------------
     0    CHbH: Critical Hop-by-Hop option(s) are present.
     1    CItE: Critical Ingress-to-Egress option(s) are present.
     2    MEF: More Extended Flags, indicates that an additional 32-bit
          extended flags area is present as described below.
    3-4   CHHF: Critcial Hob-by-Hop extended Flag bits.
    5-7   NHHF: Non-critical Hop-by-Hop extended Flag bits.
    8-10  CIEF: Critical Ingress-to-Egress extended Flag bits.
   11-12  NIEF: Non-critical Ingress-to-Egress extended Flag bits.
    13    NHHT: Non-critical Hop-by-Hop TLV option(s) are present.
    14    CIET: Critical Ingress-to-Egress TLV option(s) are present.
    15    NIET: Non-critical Ingress-to-Egress TLV option(s) are
          present.
   16-31   Flow ID if non-zero.

   All extended flags are considered mutable except the critical hop-by-
   hop extended flags.

   For TRILL Data frames with options present, any transit RBridge MUST
   transparently copy bits 8 through 12, except as permitted by an
   option implemented by that RBridge, but MAY either copy or clear any
   of the bits 5 through 7. Even if a transit RBridge removes all TLV
   options from a TRILL Header when allowed to do so, it MUST NOT
   eliminate the options area in a forwarded frame if any of bits 3, 4,
   or 8 through 12 remain non-zero; however, if there are no TLV options
   and all of bits 2 through 31 are zero, then the summary bits will
   also be zero and the transit RBridge MAY eliminate the Options area
   in the frame, setting Op-Length to zero.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


2.3.1.1 Critical Summary Bits

   The top two bits of the options area, bits 0 and 1 above, are called
   the critical summary bits. They summarize the presence of critical
   options as follows:

   CHbH: If the CHbH (Critical Hop by Hop) bit is one, one or more
      critical hop-by-hop options are present in the options area.
      Transit RBridges that do not support all of the critical hop-by-
      hop options present, for example an RBridge that supported no hop-
      by-hop options, MUST drop the frame. If the CHbH bit is zero, the
      frame is safe, from the point of view of options processing, for a
      transit RBridge to forward, regardless of what options that
      RBridge does or does not support. A transit RBridge that supports
      none of the options present MUST transparently forward the options
      area when it forwards a frame, except that it MAY remove mutable
      hop-by-hop options.

   CItE: If the CItE (Critical Ingress to Egress) bit is a one, one or
      more critical ingress-to-egress options are present in the options
      area. If it is zero, no such options are present.  If either CHbH
      or CItE is non-zero, egress RBridges that do not support all
      critical options present, for example an RBridge that supports no
      options, MUST drop the frame.  If both CHbH and CItE are zero, the
      frame is safe, from the point of view of options, for any egress
      RBridge to process, regardless of what options that RBridge does
      or does not support.

   The critical summary bits enable efficient processing of TRILL Data
   frames by RBridges that support no critical options and by transit
   RBridges that support no critical hop-by-hop options. Such RBridges
   need only check whether Op-Length is non-zero and, if it is, the top
   one or two bits just after the fixed portion of the TRILL Header.



2.3.1.2 MEF, More Extended Flags

   Bit 2, if set, indicates there are an additional 32 bits of extended
   flags. They are organized as shown below. The start of the TLV
   options, if any, is moved to after these additional bit options.

     |    32 - 39    |    40 - 47    |    48 - 55    |    56 - 63    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


2.3.1.3 Specific Initial Bit Extended Flags

   CHHB, bits 3 and 4, are Critical Hob-by-Hop Bits.

   NHHB, bits 5 through 7, are Non-critical Hop-by-Hop Bits.

   CIEB, bits 8 through 10, are Critical Ingress-to-Egress Bits.

   NIEB, bits 11 and 12, are Non-critical Ingress-to-Egress Bits.

   The bits above are available for indicating extended header flags,
   except for two NHHF allocated by Section 3.1 below.



2.3.1.4 TLV Summary Bits

   It is anticipated that in most cases the interpretation of TLV
   encoded options in TRILL data frames will be handled by slow path
   software. To minimize unnecessary resort to the slow path, the TLV
   summary bits, plus a special check for critical hop-by-hop TLV
   options, enable an RBridge to quickly determine if any TLV encoded
   options of the category or categories it implements are present.

   Bits 13-15, the NHHT, CIET, and NIET bits, indicate the presence
   later in the TRILL Header of TLV encoded Non-critical Hop-by-Hop,
   Critical Ingress-to-Egress, and Non-critical Ingress-to-Egress TLV
   options respectively.

   There is no Critical Hop-by-Hop TLV flag bit because the presence of
   one or more such TLV options can be determined by examining Op-Length
   and, if Op-Length and the MEF bit indicate that there are TLV options
   beyond the extended flags area, examining the top two bits of the
   first options area byte after the extended flags area. The ordering
   restrictions on TLV options require that, if any Critical Hop-by-Hop
   TLV options are present, the appear first in the TLV options area.
   Thus it is adequate to check only if the first TLV option present is
   a Critical Hop-by-Hop option, which can be determined from the top
   two bits of its first byte.



2.3.1.5 Flow ID

   In connection with the multi-pathing of frames, frames that are part
   of the same order-dependent flow need to follow the same path.
   Methods to determine flows are beyond the scope of the this document;
   however, it may be useful, once the flow of a unicast frame has been
   determined, to preserve and transmit that information for use by
   subsequent RBridges.


D. Eastlake, et al                                              [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


   The Flow ID option is a specially encoded non-critical hop-by-hop
   option that appears in bits 16 through 31 of the initial bit encoded
   options area. Its presence is indicated by a non-zero value in that
   field.

   It is considered hop-by-hop because it can be added or changed by a
   transit RBridge and transit RBridges can use it to make forwarding
   decisions. Because the ingress RBridge may know the most about a
   frame, it is expected that this option would most commonly be added
   at the ingress RBridge. Once set non-zero in a frame, the option
   SHOULD NOT be removed, set to zero, or changed unless, for example, a
   campus is divided into regions such that different Flow IDs would
   make sense in different regions.



2.3.2 TLV Option Format

   TRILL Header options, other than the extended header flags and Flow
   ID described above, are TLV encoded, with some flag bits in the Type
   and Length octets, in the format show in Figure 3.

      | 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9|10|    11-15     |
      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+---
      |IE|NC|      Type             |MT|   Length     | value...
      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+---

                      Figure 3. Option TLV Structure

   The highest order bit of the first octet (IE) is zero for hop-by-hop
   options and one for ingress-to-egress options.  Hop-by-hop options
   are potentially applicable to every RBridge that receives the frame.
   Ingress-to-egress options are only inserted at the ingress RBridge
   and are applicable at egress RBridges. Ingress-to-egress options MAY
   also be examined and acted upon by transit RBridges as specified in
   the particular option.

   The second highest order bit of the first octet (NC) is zero for
   critical options and one for non-critical options.

   Bit 10 in the second octet (MT) is zero for immutable options and one
   for mutable options. The IE, NC, Type, and MT fields themselves MUST
   NOT be changed even for a mutable option.

   The eight-bit Type code extends from bit 2 through bit 9. The option
   Type may constrain the values of the IE, NC, and MT bits. For
   example, a certain Type might require that the option be marked as a
   hop-by-hop, non-critical, mutable option. If the IE, NC, or MT bits
   have a value not permitted by the option Type specification for an
   option that an RBridge must act on (any critical ingress-to-egress

   option at an egress RBridge and any critical hop-by-hop option), the
   RBridge MUST discard the frame. If these bits have a value not
   permitted by for the Type for an option that an RBridge may ignore
   (any ingress-to-egress option at a transit RBridge and any non-
   critical option), the RBridge MAY discard the frame. "MAY" is chosen
   in this case to minimize the checking burden.

   The Length field is an unsigned quantity giving the length of the
   option value in units of four octets.  It gives the size of the
   option including the initial two Type and Length octets.  The Length
   field MUST NOT be such that the option value extends beyond the end
   of the total options area as specified by the TRILL Header Op-Length.
   Thus, the value 31 is reserved and, when such a value is noticed in a
   frame, the frame MUST be discarded.



2.3.3 Marshaling of Options

   In a TRILL Header with options, those options start immediately after
   the Ingress RBridge Nickname and fill the options area. TLV options
   are 32-bit aligned.

   TLV options start immediately after the initial four or eight octets
   of extended flags area and MUST appear in ascending order by the
   value of the eleven high order bits (bits 0 through 10) of the Type
   and Length octets considered as an unsigned integer in network byte
   order. There MUST NOT be more than one option in a frame with any
   particular value of this eleven high order bits. Thus the TLV options
   MUST be ordered as follows: (1) critical hop-by-hop options, (2) non-
   critical hop-by-hop options, (3) critical ingress-to-egress options,
   and (4) non-critical ingress-to-egress options. Frames that violate
   this paragraph are erroneous, will produce unspecified results, and
   MAY be discarded. "MAY" is chosen to minimize the format-checking
   burden on transit RBridges.

   If any options are present, those options, both flag and TLV, MUST be
   correctly summarized into the CHbH, CItE, and TLV summary bits.



2.4 Conflict of Options

   It is possible for options to conflict. Two or more options can be
   present in a frame that direct an RBridge processing the frame to do
   conflicting things or to change its interpretation of later parts of
   the frame in conflicting ways. Such conflicts are resolved by
   applying the following rules in the order given:

   1. Any frame containing options that require mutually incompatible


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


      changes in way later parts of the frame, after the options area,
      are interpreted or structured MUST be discarded. (Such options
      will be critical options, normally hop-by-hop critical options.)

   2. Critical options override non-critical options.

   2. Within each of the two categories of critical and non-critical
      options, the option appearing first in lexical order in the frame
      always overrides an option appearing later in the frame. Thus a
      conflict between an extended flag and a TLV option is always
      resolved in favor of the extended flag. Extended flags with lower
      bit numbers are considered to have occurred before extended flags
      with higher bit numbers.

                      Table 1. Extended Flag Options



3.1 The ECN Option

   RBridges MAY implement an ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)
   option [RFC3168]. If implemented, it SHOULD be enabled by default but
   can be disable on a per RBridge basis by configuration.

   RBridges that do not implement this option or on which it is disabled
   simply (1) set bits 6 and 7 of the extended flags area to zero when
   they add an options area to a TRILL Header and (2) transparently copy
   those bits, if an options area is present, when they forward a frame
   with a TRILL Header.

   An RBridge that implements the ECN option does the following, which
   correspond to the recommended provisions of [RFC6040], when that
   option is enabled:

   o  When ingressing an IP frame that is ECN enabled (non-zero ECN
      field), it MUST add an options area to the TRILL Header and copy
      the two ECN bits from the IP header into extended header flags 6
      and 7.
   o  When ingressing a frame for a non-IP protocol, where that protocol
      has a means of indicating ECN that is understood by the RBridge,
      it MAY add an options area to the TRILL Header with the ECN bits
      set from the ingressed frame.


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL Header Options


   o  When forwarding a frame encountering congestion at an RBridge, if
      an options area is present with extended flags 6 and 7 indicating
      ECN-capable transport, the RBridge MUST modify them to the
      congestion experienced value.
   o  When egressing an IP frame, the RBridge MUST set the outgoing
      native IP frame ECN field to the codepoint at the intersection of
      the values for that field in the encapsulated IP frame (row) and
      the TRILL extended Header ECN field (column) in Table 3 below or
      drop the frame in the case where the TRILL header indicates
      congestion experienced but the encapsulated native IP frame
      indicates a not ECN-capable transport. (Such frame dropping is
      necessary because IP transport that is not ECN-capable requires
      dropped frames to sense congestion.)
   o  When egressing a non-IP protocol frame with a means of indicating
      ECN that is understood by the RBridge, it MAY set the ECN
      information in the egressed native frame by combining that
      information in the TRILL extended header and the encapsulated non-
      IP native frame as specified in Table 3.

   The following table is modified from [RFC3168] and shows the meaning
   of bit values in TRILL Header extended flags 6 and 7, bits 6 and 7 in
   the IPv4 TOS Byte, and bits 6 and 7 in the IPv6 Traffic Class Octet:

      Binary  Meaning
      ------  -------
        00     Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)
        01     ECT(1) (ECN-Capable Transport(1))
        10     ECT(0) (ECN-Capable Transport(0))
        11     CE (Congestion Experienced)

                    Table 2. ECN Field Bit Combinations

   Table 3 below (adapted from [RFC6040]) shows how, at egress, to
   combine the ECN information in the extended TRILL Header ECN field
   with the ECN information in an encapsulated frame to produce the ECN
   information to be carried in the resulting native frame.

        +---------+-----------------------------------------------+
        | Inner   |       Arriving TRILL Header ECN Field         |
        | Native  +---------+------------+------------+-----------+

   An RBridge detects congestion either by monitoring its own queue
   depths or from participation in a link-specific protocol. An RBridge
   implementing the ECN option MAY be configured to add congestion
   experienced marking using ECN to any frame with a TRILL Header that
   encounters congestion even if the frame was not previously marked as
   ECN-capable or did not have an options area.

4. Specific TLV Option

   The table below shows the state of TRILL Header TLV option Type
   assignment. See Section 6 for IANA Considerations.

          Type        Purpose           Section
         ---------------------------------------
          0x00       reserved
          0x00-0x7F  available
          0x80       Test/Pad            4.1
          0x81-0xFE  available
          0xFF       reserved

                         Table 4. TLV Option Types


   The following subsection specifies a particular TRILL TLV option.



4.1 Test/Pad Option

   This option is intended for testing and padding.

   A specific meaning for this option with the critical flag set will
   not be defined so, in that form, it MUST always be treated as an
   unknown critical option. If the critical flag is not set, the option
   does nothing. In either case, it may be any length that will fit.
   Thus, for example, in the non-critical form, it can be used to cause
   the encapsulated frame staring right after the options area to be
   64-bit aligned or for testing purposes.

      o  Type is 0x80.
      o  Length is variable. The value is ignored.
      o  IE may be zero or one.  This option has both hop-by-hop and
         ingress-to-egress versions.
      o  NC is zero for the pad option and one for the test option.
         +  The non-critical version of this option does nothing.
         +  The critical version of this option MUST always be treated
            as an unknown critical option.
      o  MT may be zero or one except that it must be zero if the other
         flags indicate the options is a critical hop-by-hop option.
         This option may be flagged as mutable or immutable.

5. Additions to IS-IS

   RBridges use IS-IS PDUs to inform other RBridges which options they
   support. The specific IS-IS PDUs, TLVs, or sub-TLVs used to encode
   and advertise this information are specified in a separate document.
   Support for critical options MUST be advertised. Support for non-
   critical options MAY be advertised unless the specification of a
   particular non-critical option imposes a requirement higher than
   "MAY" for the advertising of that option by RBridges that implement
   it.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA will create two subregistries within the TRILL registry. A
   "TRILL Extended Header Flags" subregistry that is initially populated
   as specified in Table 1 in Section 3.  And a "TRILL TLV Option Types"
   subregistry that is initially populated as specified in Table 4 in
   Section 4. References in both of those tables to sections of this
   document are to be replaced in the IANA subregistries by references
   to this document as an RFC.

   New TRILL bit options and TLV option types are allocated by IETF
   Review [RFC5226].




7. Security Considerations

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see [RFCtrill].

   In order to facilitate authentication, options SHOULD be specified so
   they do not have alternative equivalent forms. Authentication of
   anything with alternative equivalent forms almost always requires
   canonicalization that an authenticating RBridge ignorant of the
   option would be unable to do and that may be complex and error prone
   even for an RBridge knowledgeable of the option. It is best for any
   option to have a unique encoding.

Change History

   The sections below summarize changes between successive versions of
   this draft. RFC Editor: Please delete this section before
   publication.



Version 00 to 02

   Change the requirement for TLV option ordering to be strictly ordered
   by the value of the top nine bits of their first two bytes so that
   the MT bit is included.

   Specify meaning of mutability bit for hop-by-hop options.

   Fix length of Flow ID Value at 2.

   Require that options that may significantly affect the interpretation
   or format of subsequent parts of the frame be critical options.



Version 02 to 03

   Move Test/Pad option into this document from the More Options draft
   and move the More Flags option from this document into the More
   Options draft.

   Prohibit multiple occurrences of a TLV option in a frame.



Version 03 to 04

   Restructure the bit encoded options area so that the initial 32 bits
   include a 16 bit Flow ID, various TLV-option-present bits, and a more
   extended flags bit that means another 32 bits of extended flags are
   present.

   Change the Length of TLV encoded options so that it is in units of 4
   bytes, not 1, resulting in a bigger Type field.

   Update Explicit Congestion Notification to follow RFC 6040.

   Rename "bit encoded options" to be "extended header flags" or
   "extended flags".
