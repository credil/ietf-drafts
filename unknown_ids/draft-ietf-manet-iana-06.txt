Internet-Draft                 MANET-IANA                   October 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by
   one or more protocols that conform to [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb],
   MANET protocols.  The following well-known numbers are required: a
   UDP port number, an IP protocol number, and a link-local multicast
   group address.  All interoperable protocols running on these well-
   known IANA allocations MUST confirm to [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].
   [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb] provides a common format that enables one
   or more MANET protocols to share the IANA allocations defined in this
   document unambiguously.


2.  UDP Port Number for MANET Protocols

   MANET routers require a well-known UDP port number [IANAPort] to send
   and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The title of this UDP
   port is "manet".  The value of this UDP port is TBD1.


3.  IP Protocol Number for MANET Protocols

   MANET routers require a well-known IP protocol number [IANAProtocol]
   to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The title of
   this IP protocol number is "manet".  The value of this IP protocol
   number is TBD2.


4.  Link-local Multicast Group for MANET Routers

   MANET routers require a well-known link-local multicast address
   [RFC4291] to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The
   name of the multicast address to reach link-local (LL) MANET routers
   is "LL-MANET-Routers".

   For IPv4, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is
   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers is 224.0.0.TBD3 to appear
   in the [IANAv4Multicast] registry.

   For IPv6, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is
   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD4
   to appear in the [IANAv6Multicast] registry.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by
   one or more MANET protocols that conform to

   [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].  Specifically, the following well-known
   numbers have been assigned: a UDP port (Section 2), an IP protocol
   number (Section 3), and a link-local multicast group address
   (Section 4).

   Action 1:

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "PORT NUMBERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers

   sub-registry "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS"

   Keyword Decimal Description References

   ------- ------- ----------- ----------

   manet [TBD1]/udp MANET Protocols [I-D.ietf-manet-iana]

   Action 2:

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "PROTOCOL NUMBERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers

   sub-registry "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS"

   Keyword Decimal Description References

   ------- ------- ----------- ----------

   manet TBD2 MANET Protocols [I-D.ietf-manet-iana]

   Action 3:

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "Internet Multicast Addresses" registry located at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses

   sub-registry "224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255 (224.0.0/24)

   Local Network Control Block Date registered"

   224.0.0.TBD3 LL-MANET-Routers [I-D.ietf-manet-iana]

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the following
   assignments in the "INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION 6 MULTICAST ADDRESSES"
   registry located at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses

   sub-registry "Fixed Scope Multicast Addresses"

   sub-sub-registry "Link-Local Scope"

   FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:TBD4 LL-MANET-Routers [I-D.ietf-manet-iana]


6.  Security Considerations

   The security issues associated with using the same UDP port/multicast
   address/IP protocol number for multiple protocols are addressed in
   [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].  The security considerations for each
   protocol using these IANA allocations are addressed in each
   protocol's specification.
