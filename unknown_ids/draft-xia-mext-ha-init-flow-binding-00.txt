Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6     April 2009


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] allows a mobile node to bind a
   particular flow to a care-of address without affecting other flows
   using the same home address.  Binding Update (BU)/Binding
   Acknowledgement(BA) messages are extended to enable the mobile node
   to add, modify, remove and refresh flow binding in a home agent.  The
   operations are always initiated by the mobile node.

   In some cases, the home agent would like to initiate flow binding
   operations.  E.g, the home agent revokes a flow binding because of
   accounting insufficiency of the mobile node; for the mobile equipped
   with multiple interfaces, the home agent moves a flow binding from
   one interface to another based on network resource availability; the
   home agent provisions default flow binding rules to the mobile node
   based on the mobile node's default profile.

   This document defines two new Mobility Headers for the home agent to
   control flow binding in the mobile node.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC3775] and [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Default Flow Binding Provisioning

   Michael purchases a dual mode phone equipped with both 3GPP and WiFi
   interfaces.  He also signs a Service Level Agreement(SLA) with an
   operator including the following information:

   o  3GPP access takes priority of WiFi when providing VoIP service.
      That is, the 3GPP network is always used when Michael makes a call
      if the network is accessible.
   o  WiFi access is primarily selected to serve IPTV service.
   o  Peer-to-peer (p2p) download is only allowed through WiFi access.

   Michael's default profile can be downloaded from AAA server through
   the home agent to its mobile node when registering.

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6     April 2009


3.2.  Flow Binding Revocation

   The operator also provides a package to Michael, for example,
   unlimited call and 8 hours free Video-on-Demand (VoD).  Michael is a
   movie fan, and every month he uses up all the 8 hours.  The operator
   has no choice but cutting his ongoing VoD while still providing
   unlimited call service.

3.3.  Inter-Interface Flow Binding Movement

   Michael stays home using WLAN access for voice call and downloading.
   However, it happens that the operator is carrying on a routine
   maintenance of its WiFi devices.  The operator then moves all the
   call and downloading to its 3GPP interface.  Once the maintenance is
   finished, the operator then moves the service back to WiFi interface.


4.  Protocol Operation

   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] makes use of Binding Update (BU)
   /Binding Acknowledgement(BA) signalling to add, modify, remove and
   refresh flow binding in a home agent.  That is, flow binding
   operations are always initiated from the mobile node.  The mechanism
   specified in this document is complementary to the method described
   in [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].  It is assumed that the home agent
   has already created Binding Cache entries for the mobile node before
   launching flow binding operations.

   In this document, two new Mobility Headers are defined, that is, Flow
   Binding Indication(FBI) Section 5.1.1 and Flow Binding
   Acknowledgement(FBA)Section 5.1.2.  FBI is used by the home agent to
   initiate flow binding operations, while FBA is used for acknowledging
   FBI.

4.1.  Adding flow bindings

   Adding the flow binding implies associating a flow with a particular
   care-of address for the mobile node.  The care-of address concerned
   with the flow binding is present in the destination address of the
   packet or the alternate care-of address option.  Alternatively, the
   care-of address may be indicated by the BID (Binding Identification
   number) described in [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa] which is pointing
   to an existing care-of address, and the BID is included in the
   Binding Reference sub-option of the Flow Attribute option defined in
   Section 5.2.1.

   When adding a new flow binding, the home agent sends a FBI with a
   Flow Attribute option to the mobile node.  The Flow Attribute option



Xia & Sarikaya          Expires October 24, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6     April 2009


   includes a unique FID.  The PRO field of the option MUST indicate an
   Adding operation.  The FID needs only be unique for the receiver of
   the adding message, i.e. the same FID can be used across different
   receivers of adding messages.  A lifetime value is included to
   indicate the remaining lifetime of the flow binding.

4.2.  Deleting flow bindings

   When removing a flow binding, the home agent sends a FBI with a Flow
   Attribute option in which PRO field indicates Deleting operation.
   The Flow Attribute option includes a unique FID for the mobile node
   to locate the flow binding and remove it.

4.3.  Modifying flow bindings

   When modifying a flow binding (either the care-of address or other
   attributes of the flow), the home agent sends the mobile node a FBI
   message with Flow Attribute option.  The option includes the FID for
   the binding being modified.  A flow description option may come with
   the Flow Attribute option to contain the new attributes needed to
   classify the flow.  Hence, flow modification is essentially a process
   where an existing flow definition is removed and a new flow (included
   in the option) is added and given the same FID as the flow that was
   removed.

4.4.  Refreshing flow bindings

   A flow binding is refreshed by simply including the Flow Attribute
   option with Refreshing PRO field in the FBI message.  The message
   should be sent before the expiration of the flow binding.  The
   message updates existing bindings with new information.  Hence, all
   information previously sent in the last refreshing message need to be
   resent, otherwise such information will be lost.

4.5.  Moving flow bindings

   The home agent can move a flow associated to one interface of the
   multi-interfaced mobile node to another by sending a FBI message to
   the mobile node.  A Flow Attribute option in which PRO field is set
   to Moving is included.  The address of the target interface is also
   included in the Flow Attribute option.

4.6.  Switching flow bindings

   Here are some example scenarios where a home agent signals to the
   mobile node that it should acquire a new home agent for some specific
   flows:




Xia & Sarikaya          Expires October 24, 2009                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6     April 2009


   o  The home agent is overloaded.
   o  An operator may wish to balance the load among home agents.
   o  Operators do periodic maintenance in order to maintain reliability
   o  ... ...

   The home agent sends the mobile node a FBI with Flow Attribute option
   to indicate that the mobile node should bind a flow to a new home
   agent.  The alternative home agent addresses are included for the
   mobile node to initiate the flow binding to a new home agent.

4.7.  Acknowledging flow bindings

   The mobile node sends FBA message to acknowledge the reception of
   Adding, Deleting, Modifying, Refreshing, Moving, or Switching of a
   flow binding.  On receiving messages with the Flow Attribute
   option(s), the mobile node should copy each Flow Attribute to the
   Flow Binding Acknowledgement(FBA) messages.


5.  Flow Binding messages and options

5.1.  Mobility Header

   The messages described below follow the Mobility Header format
   specified in Section 6.1 of [RFC3775]:

         The Flow Identifier field is an 16-bit unsigned integer that
         includes the identifier for the flow binding.  This field is
         used to refer to an existing binding or to create a new
         binding.

      Status

         This field indicates the success or failure of the flow binding
         operation for the particular flow in the option. Values from 0
         to 127 indicate success; Values of 128 and higher indicate failure.
         This field is only relevant when included in the Flow Binding
         Acknowledgement message and must be ignored in the Flow Binding
         Indication message.

      Reserved

         This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the
         sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

      Lifetime

         16-bit unsigned integer. One time unit is 4 seconds. Except Deleting
         and Switching processing where the lifetime field is ignored, the
         lifetime in other PROs has the following meanings:

            Adding,  the time remaining before the flow binding expired
            Modifying, the lifetime of the modified flow binding
            Refreshing, the lifetime of the refreshed flow binding
            Moving, the lifetime of the moved flow binding

      Sub-options

         One or more sub-options may be included. These variable length
         options are defined in later sections.

      Flow Description

         Variable length field including attributes defining a flow.

            sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

         Home Agent Addresses

            Alternative home agent addresses to which the mobile node
            is going to switch its flow bindings.


5.2.3.  Target Care-of-Address sub-option

   This section introduces the Target Care-of-Address, which may be
   included in the Flow Attribute option.  This sub-option is used to
   indicate the mobile node to move a flow binding from one interface to
   another.
