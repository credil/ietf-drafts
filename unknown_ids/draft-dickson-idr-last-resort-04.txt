Abstract

   This Internet Draft describes a new well-known BGP community,
   LAST_RESORT.

   This community provides a simple and easily deployable solution to
   BGP "wedgies".

   Initial deployment is expected to be achieved by voluntary use in the
   network operator community-at-large.

   Long-term adoption via software enforcement of the well-known aspect
   of the community, will improve global behavior, and simplify router
   configurations.

Author's Note

   This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related
   draft(s) being placed on the Standards Track for idr.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [4].

   Intended Status: Proposed Standard.


1.  Background

   Even when all the best current practises are observed, operational
   problems may be experienced when running a BGP network.

   One particularly thorny problem is BGP "wedgies" [1].

   While not often articulated, the common problem is the use of local
   policy settings within AS boundaries, which often override the
   original intent of "backup" BGP announcements.

   It is somewhat ironic that such local policies are often achieved by
   use of BGP Communities, and that the lack of a common choice, i.e.
   "well known", community, is one source of the problem.

1.1.  The Local Policy Problem

   The BGP "wedgie" problem occurs as a result of "intended policy"
   information not being available.  Specifically, this is the lack of
   an explicit global mechanism for expressing de-preferring
   announcements via "back-up" providers.  In essence, local policy
   could be described as "not well informed".


2.  Proposed Change: A New BGP Well-Known Community

   To solve the problem, a new BGP well-known standard Community,
   LAST_RESORT, is proposed.  This is a new value to be assigned by
   IANA.

3.  Changes to BGP Behavior

   A BGP speaker receiving a prefix from an EBGP neighbor with
   LAST_RESORT MUST assign the lowest-possible preference value of
   LOCAL_PREFERENCE.  This LOCAL_PREFERENCE MUST NOT be able to be over-
   ridden without first removing the LAST_RESORT community from the
   prefix.  A BGP speaker receiving a prefix from an IBGP neighbor with
   LAST_RESORT MUST ignore the LAST_RESORT community.

   The distinction between EBGP and IBGP ensures backwards
   compatibility, particularly when a heterogeneous set of routers in an
   AS doing IBGP exists.

   The restriction preventing overriding LAST_RESORT ensures that local
   policy mechanisms do not interfere with LAST_RESORT.  This also
   facilitates ease in deployment, as most router configurations would
   not require modification.

   Note that this order of evaluation, with local policy before
   LAST_RESORT, means that the only way to apply local policy to routes
   with LAST_RESORT, is to strip LAST_RESORT on ingress, then apply
   local policy, then set LAST_RESORT again on egress.

   This restriction is by design, so that AS-wide policy remains
   consistent even in a heterogenous environment of routers that may or
   may not understand LAST_RESORT.


4.  LAST_RESORT - Basic Method

   The main reason for establishing the LAST_RESORT Community is to
   permit the global implementation of "backup only" announcements,
   whose purpose and intent are clear and unambiguous.  It is not to
   facilitate change of policies, or to circumvent local policies.
   Rather, it is to make possible the implementation of policies where
   those have been negotiated by two or more parties.

   Currently, there are several documented scenarios in the "Wedgies"
   RFC [1] where the mutually desired policy is either unable to be
   implemented, or does not deterministically reach the desired state.

   Application of the LAST_RESORT Community on announcements sent to a
   backup provider, permits these problems to be resolved.

   The same prefix is announced to both the primary and backup provider.
   When announced to the primary provider, the LAST_RESORT Community is
   NOT set.  When announced to the backup provider, the LAST_RESORT
   Community IS set.

   The propagation of the LAST_RESORT instance will be limited by the
   availability of paths, and inhibited by the existence of paths which
   do not have LAST_RESORT applied to them.

   In Figure 1 (of Appendix A), the LAST_RESORT instance will be seen by
   the backup provider, and be passed with LAST_RESORT to the backup
   provider's transit provider.  The latter will prefer any other
   instance without LAST_RESORT, even if it has policy for applying a
   LOCAL_PREFERENCE to the received prefix instances.  Should the other
   instance be withdrawn, the LAST_RESORT will be selected and
   subsequently propagated.


5.  Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations beyond those already present in
   BGP are introduced.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to assign a new code point from BGP Well-Known
   Communities for LAST_RESORT.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The author wishes to acknowledge the helpful guidance of Joe Abley
   and Tony Li.  The author also wishes to acknowledge the assistance
   and suggestions of Joel M. Halpern in simplifying the original
   "Backup-only" concept to that of a BGP community, and of Olivier
   Bonaventure in clarifying the LOCAL_PREFERENCE mechanisms.

Appendix A.  BGP Wedgie Examples

   The following examples from RFC 4264 [1] show the effects of the
   proposed changes, in resolving "wedgie" issues.

   +----+                +----+
   |AS 3|----------------|AS 4|
   +----+ peer      peer +----+

   |AS 2|                  |

     |provider             |

                                 Figure 1

   In Figure 1 above, the announcement via the backup link is sent with
   LAST_RESORT.
   o  AS 4 sends AS_PATH "4 1" to AS 3.
   o  AS 2 receives the LAST_RESORT path from AS 1, and sends AS_PATH "2
      1" to AS 3, also with LAST_RESORT.
   o  AS 3 and AS 4 exchange their respective "best" paths.
   o  AS 3 prefers the path "4 1" over "2 1" because "2 1" is
      LAST_RESORT.
   o  AS 3 sends a withdrawal of the LAST_RESORT path to AS 4.
   o  AS 3 sends its "best", AS_PATH "3 4 1" to AS 2.
   This state will be reached regardless of sequence of disconnects and
   reconnects.

                                 Figure 2

   In Figure 2 above, the announcements via the backup links will work
   the same as in Example 1.

   In Figure 3 above, the announcements via both backup links will
   result in:

   o  AS 2 selecting its best path via "3 4 1" (the only path it hears
      from AS 3)
   o  AS 2 hearing one of two paths from AS 5:
      *  "5 3 4 1"
      *  LAST_RESORT with path "5 1"
   o  AS 2 hearing a LAST_RESORT directly from AS 1
   Any announcement that AS 3 hears from AS 2 will always be marked
   LAST_RESORT.  (The same will be true of AS 5.)  Thus, any combination
   of break/restore on any links in any order, will always result in the
   desired state being reached.
