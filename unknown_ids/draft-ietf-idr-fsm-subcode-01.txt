1. Introduction 

   This document defines several subcodes for BGP [RFC4271] Finite 
   State Machine Error that could provide more information to help 
   network operators in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating 
   network events. This information is also helpful to developers in 
   lab situations. 

2. Definition of Finite State Machine Error Subcodes 

   This document defines following subcodes for BGP Finite State 
   Machine Error:  

     0 - Unspecific Error

Internet-Draft              BGP FSM Error Subcode       September 2011 
    

     1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State 

     2 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State 

     3 - Receive Unexpected Message in Established State 

3. Usage of FSM Error Subcodes 

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message 
   (KEEPALIVE/UPDATE/ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenSent 
   state, it MUST send to the neighbor a Notification message with the 
   Error Code Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive 
   Unexpected Message in OpenSent State". The Data field is a 1-octet 
   unsigned integer which indicates type of the unexpected message.  

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (OPEN/UPDATE/ROUTE-
   REFRESH message) on a session in OpenConfirm state, it MUST send to 
   the neighbor a Notification message with the Error Code Finite State 
   Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in 
   OpenConfirm State". The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned integer 
   which indicates type of the unexpected message.  

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (OPEN message) on a 
   session in Established state, it MUST send to the neighbor a 
   Notification message with the Error Code Finite State Machine Error 
   and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in Established 
   State". The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned integer which indicates 
   type of the unexpected message. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not change the security properties of BGP. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries 
   under its control. 

   This document defines Error Subcodes 0 - 3 for BGP Finite State 
   Machine Error.  

     0 - Unspecific Error  

     1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State  

     2 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State
