   asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key size and signature format for
   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure subscribers that generate
   digital signatures on certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists, and

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies:

      *  the digital signature algorithm and parameters;
      *  the hash algorithm and parameters;
      *  the public and private key formats; and,
      *  the signature format
   used by Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) subscribers when
   they apply digital signatures to certificates, Certificate Revocation
   Lists (CRLs), and signed objects (e.g., Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs) and manifests).  Relying Parties (RPs) also use this document
   when verify RPKI subscribers' digital signatures [ID.ietf-sidr-arch].

   This document is referenced by other RPKI profiles and
   specifications, including the RPKI Certificate Policy (CP)
   [ID.ietf-sidr-cp], the RPKI Certificate Profile
   [ID.ietf-sidr-res-certs], the SIDR architecture [ID.ietf-sidr-arch],
   and the signed object template for the RPKI
   [ID.ietf-sidr-signed-object].  Familiarity with these documents is
   assumed.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.


2.  Algorithms

   Two cryptographic algorithms are used in the RPKI:

      *  The signature algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, and signed
         objects is RSA Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1
         Version 1.5 (sometimes referred to as "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5") from
         Section 5 of [RFC4055].

      *  The hashing algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, and signed
         objects is SHA-256 [SHS].  Hash algorithms are not identified
         by themselves in certificates and CRLs instead they are
         combined with the digital signature algorithm (see below).
         When used in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData,
         the hash algorithm (in this case, the hash algorithm is

Internet-Draft           RPKI Algorithm Profile            November 2010


         sometimes called a message digest algorithm) is identified by
         itself.  For CMS SignedData, the object identifier and
         parameters for SHA-256 in [RFC5754] MUST be used when
         populating the digestAlgorithms and digestAlgorithm fields.


         NOTE: The exception to the above hashing algorithm is the use
         of SHA-1 [SHS] when CAs generate authority and subject key
         identifiers [ID.ietf-sidr-res-certs].

   When used to generate and verify digital signatures the hash and
   digital signature algorithms are referred together, i.e., "RSA PKCS#1
   v1.5 with SHA-256" or more simply "RSA with SHA-256".  The Object
   Identifier (OID) sha256withRSAEncryption from [RFC4055] MUST be used.

   Locations for this OID are as follows:

      In the certificate, the OID appears in the signature and
      signatureAlgorithm fields [RFC4055];- In the CRL, the OID appears
      in the signatureAlgorithm field [RFC4055]; and,- In CMS
      SignedData, the OID appears in each SignerInfo signatureAlgoithm
      field [RFC3370] using the OID from above.


3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats

   The RSA key pairs used to compute the signatures MUST have a 2048-bit
   modulus and a public exponent (e) of 65,537.

3.1.  Public Key Format

   The Subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo
   [RFC5280].  It has two sub-fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey.
   The values for the structures and their sub-structures follow:

   algorithm (which is an AlgorithmIdentifier type):
      The object identifier for RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 with SHA-256 MUST be
      used in the algorithm field, as specified in Section 5 of
      [RFC4055].  The value for the associated parameters from that
      clause MUST also be used for the parameters field.

   subjectPublicKey:
      RSAPublicKey MUST be used to encode the certificate's
      subjectPublicKey field, as specified in [RFC4055].

Internet-Draft           RPKI Algorithm Profile            November 2010


3.2.  Private Key Format

   Local Policy determines private key format.


4.  Signature Format

   The structure for the certificate's signature field is as specified
   in Section 1.2 of [RFC4055].  The structure for the Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData's signature field is as specified in
   [RFC3370].


5.  Additional Requirements

   It is anticipated that the RPKI will require the adoption of updated
   key sizes and a different set of signature and hash algorithms over
   time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic
   security to protect the integrity of signed products in the RPKI.
   This profile should be updated to specify such future requirements,
   as and when appropriate.

   CAs and RPs SHOULD be capable of supporting a transition to allow for
   the phased introduction of additional encryption algorithms and key
   specifications, and also accommodate the orderly deprecation of
   previously specified algorithms and keys.  Accordingly, CAs and RPs
   SHOULD be capable of supporting multiple RPKI algorithm and key
   profiles simultaneously within the scope of such anticipated
   transitions.  The recommended procedures to implement such a
   transition of key sizes and algorithms is not specified in this
   document.


6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC4055], [RFC5280], and
   [ID.ietf-sidr-res-certs] a apply to certificate and CRLs.  The
   Security Considerations of [RFC5754] apply to signed objects.  No new
   security are introduced as a result of this specification.


7.  IANA Considerations

   [There are no IANA considerations in this document.]
