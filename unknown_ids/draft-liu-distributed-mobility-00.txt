           Distributed mobility management Problem Statement
                   draft-liu-distributed-mobility-00

Abstract

   Current mobility solutions normally introduce an anchor point in the
   network, eg HA in MIPv6, LMA in PMIPv6, GGSN in 3GPP.  The anchor
   point is used to maintain the mapping between the stable IP address
   (eg Home address in MIPv6) and the current routable IP address (eg
   CoA in MIPv6).  In the hierarchical architecture, since the anchor
   point normally locates in the top of the hierarchical architecture,
   there will no scalability issue.  But in the more flat architecture,
   the anchor point will be much lower compared with hierarchical
   architecture; this will introduce some issues if traditionally
   mobility protocol is used.

1.  Introduction

   As the mobile network is evolving towards the more flat architecture,
   traditional mobility protocol is not suitable for this architecture.
   For example, in the LIPA/SIPTO architecture which is discussed in
   3GPP, the gateway function is located near the base station.  In this
   architecture, if the anchor point locates in the gateway, the
   frequently handover between base station may cause more signaling
   overhead compared with hierarchical architecture.

   The triangle routing issue will become more severe in flat
   architecture, since there will be many UE under one gateway roaming
   to other gateways.  In this condition, the visiting gateway will need
   to establish the mobility tunnel back the original access gateway of
   the UE.

   Due to the triangle routing issue, the traffic could not break out
   locally.

   1) Signaling overhead

   As figure 1 illustrated, in the flat network architecture, the
   mobility anchor point may locates near the base station if
   traditional mobility protocol is used.  The UE's handover between
   base stations may cause frequently handover between anchor points.

   2) Triangle routing

   The triangle routing problem will become more severe in the flat
   architecture if traditional mobility protocol is used.  The mobility
   tunnel needs to be connection back to the anchor point where the UE
   is first access to the network and get the IP address allocation.

   For example, if a user opens his mobile phone to see a video
   streaming program at office and then take a subway to get home.  When
   the user gets back to home, the mobility tunnel still need to connect
   back to the anchor point where locates near his office.  This will
   lead all the traffic goes back to the gateway near his office to
   access the Internet instead of locally break out from the base
   station which near his home.

   Local break out

   As the speed of wireless Internet access is increasing rapidly, if
   all the Internet traffic need to go through the core network, it will
   give much pressure to the mobile operator's core network and may
   decline the user experience due to the latency cause by the long
   route to the destination.  It is preferred that the Internet access
   traffic could break out locally, it means that the Internet traffic
   beak out from a gateway which locates near the base station.  To
   ensure the local break, the gateway should have the IP address
   allocation function.  It is also preferred that the network should
   provide mobility in the local break out scenario, so the gateway
   should be the anchor point of mobility.  It is preferred that when UE
   roams to other base station the traffic could break out locally and
   also maintain the session continuity.  That will be a challenge if
   use traditional mobility protocols.

4.  4. Considerations of distributed mobility solutions

   Based on the above analysis, there may be a need for developing new
   mobility solutions for the flat architecture, the solution may be
   called distributed mobility solutions since the mobility anchor
   function is distributed compared with the centralized mobility anchor
   point of traditional mobility protocol.

   The distributed mobility solutions should make less change to the
   existing network entity.  It is preferred that there is no change
   requirement to the UE and transparent to the application layer.  The
   details of distributed mobility solution requirements will be further
   identified.

   In the above figure, Phone A with UID:3100 initiates a session with
   B.

   NAT device's SIP ALG works as a SIP proxy, it behaves like SIP entity
   between the SIP servers in the private network and in the public
   network.  The SIP ALG function in the NAT device translates the
   corresponding section of SIP message and creates an SIP-ALG mapping
   table.  The SIP-ALG mapping table is used during the sip session and
   will be deleted when the session is terminated.  The SIP-ALG mapping
   table uses Call-ID as index.  The call-ID could remain unchanged or
   changed during the translation.  The SIP-ALG mapping table contains
   the following section:

   Call-ID_IN

   Call_-D_OUT

   Vias.IN

   Vias.OUT

   From.IN

   From.OUT

   To.IN

   To.OUT

   Contact.IN

   Contact.OUT

   SDP.oField.IP_IN

   SDP.oField.IP.OUT

   SDP.cField.IP_IN

   SDP.cField.IP_OUT

   SDP.mField.port.IN

   SDP.mField.port.OUT

   Time_count

   The translation algorithm is as follows:

   When the SIP ALG function identifies the SIP messages that need to be
   translated, it performs the following function:

   Translate the IP address/domain name in the SIP request message into
   the SIP server's IP address that locates in the public network.

   Record the Via section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's Vias_IN entry
   and translates the proxy's private IP address and port number to its
   corresponding public IP address and port number.

   Record From section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's From_IN entry and
   translates the UE's private IP address and port number to its
   corresponding public IP address and port number.

   Record To section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's To_IN entry.

   Record Call-ID to the SIP-ALG mapping table's Call-ID_IN section and
   generates a new Call-ID and create a Call-ID_OUT entry in the mapping
   table.

   Record the Contact section to the SIP-ALG mapping table's Contact_IN
   entry and translates the UE's private IP address and port number to
   its corresponding public IP address and port number.

   Translates SDP section's o and c section's IP address into
   corresponding public IP address. m section's port number to public
   port number.  Then creates SDP_oField_IP_IN, SDP_cField_IP_IN,
   SDP_mField_port_IN entries.

   NAT devices forwards the translated SIP message to the next SIP
   server.

   Clear the timeout_Count section of the SIP-ALG mapping table.

   When translates the incoming SIP message that comes from the public
   network.  SIP-ALG function in the NAT device should first query the
   SIP-ALG mapping table using Call-ID as index to see if there is an
   mapping entry exists.  If there is a mapping entry exists, then
   translates the Via/Contact section of the SIP message and the m
   section of the SDP message using the SIP-ALG mapping table.  Then
   forward the translated SIP message to the corresponding SIP entity.

   As an example, the NAT device should create the following mapping
   information:

   Call_ID_IN 1234@192.168.139.100

   Call_ID_OUT 5678@210.72.128.100

   Vias_IN SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.0.10:5060 SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.139.100:

5.  Deployment Considerations

   SIP ALG always located in the IP address translator.

   Most SIP networks deploy SBCs to assist with NAT traversal, SIP ALG
   functionality need to be implemented inside SBC.

   If there is no SBC present during SIP communication, NAT is the right
   position to implement ALG in the network side.

   If the host based translation is provided, ALG need to be implemented
   in the host side (SIP endpoint) if there is no other advanced NAT
   traversal solution support such as ICE.
