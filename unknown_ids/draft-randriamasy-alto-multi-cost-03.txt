                            Multi-Cost ALTO
                  draft-randriamasy-alto-multi-cost-03

Abstract

   IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer
   traffic Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service", an
   "Endpoint Cost Service" and an "Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service" and
   thus incentives for application clients to connect to ISP preferred
   Endpoints.  These services provide a view of the Network Provider
   (NP) topology to overlay clients.

   The present draft proposes a light way to extend the information
   provided by the current ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the
   possibilities of the Application Clients in two ways: firstly by
   providing a better mapping of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the
   growing diversity of Content Networking Applications and to the
   network conditions, secondly by producing a more robust choice of
   multiple Endpoints, helping thus out for efficient Multi-Path
   transfer.

   There are 2 parts in this draft: the first part initiates protocol
   extensions to support requests on multiple Cost Types in one single
   transaction.  These first extensions also integrate the discussions
   within the ALTO Working Group and focus on the Endpoint Cost Service.
   The second part proposes two use cases motivating further definitions
   of additional CostTypes and Cost Attributes related to timeframe and
   validity period.

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                   July 2011


1.  Introduction

   IETF is designing a new service called ALTO that provides guidance to
   P2P applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a
   set of candidates that are able to provide a desired resource.  This
   guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and
   efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the
   topological distance.  The ultimate goal is to improve Quality of
   Experience (QoE) in the application while reducing resource
   consumption in the underlying network infrastructure.  The ALTO
   protocol conveys the Internet View from the perspective of a Provider
   Network region that spans from a region to one or more Autonomous
   System (AS).  Together with this Network Map, it provides the
   Provider determined Cost Map between locations of the Network Map.
   Last, it provides the Ranking of Endpoints w.r.t. their routing cost.

   The term Network Provider in this document includes both ISPs, who
   provide means to transport the data and Content Delivery Network
   (CDN) operators who care for the dissemination, persistent storage
   and possibly identification of the best/closest content copy.

   The last ALTO protocol draft see [ID-alto-protocol], gives the
   possibility to query multiple Endpoint properties at once (see
   S.7.7.4.1).  However section 7.7.3.2 on Cost Map states about both
   parameters Cost Type and Cost Mode that: "This parameter MUST NOT be
   specified multiple times".  The ALTO requirements draft, see
   [ID-ALTO-Requirements7] also states in REQ.  ARv05-14: "The ALTO
   client protocol MUST support the usage of several different rating
   criteria types".  In the current protocol draft, there is no
   specified way to get values for several Cost Types altogether.
   Currently, the costs are provided in a scalar form, one by one.  So
   that an ALTO Client wanting information for several Cost Types must
   place a request and receive a response as many times as desired Cost
   Types.  However, vector costs provide a robust and natural input to
   multi-path connections and getting all costs in one single query/
   response transaction saves time and ALTO traffic, thus ressources,
   thus energy.

   The ALTO Problem Statement, see [RFC5693] and the ALTO requirements
   draft, see [RFC5693] stress that: "information that can change very
   rapidly, such as transport-layer congestion, is out of scope for an
   ALTO service.  Such information is better suited to be transferred
   through an in-band technique at the transport layer instead", as
   "ALTO is not an admission control system "and does not necessarily
   know about the instant load of endpoints and links.  However, longer
   term statistics or empirical ratings on performance oriented
   information may still be useful for a reliable choice of candidate
   endpoints.  In addition, given the QoE requirements of nowadays and

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                   July 2011


   future Internet applications, more and more NPs compute and store
   such information to optimize their traffic.  Last, specific ALTO
   servers can be specified for mobile core networks, which have a
   smaller scale and can afford and take advantage of using smaller
   time-scale network information.

   Adding QoE-enabling metrics to the Network Provider established
   routing cost could meet the interests of both the end users and the
   Providers.  Besides, keeping the shortest or cheapest possible path,
   in addition, saves resources, time and energy.


2.  Scope

   This draft generalizes the case of a P2P client to include the case
   of a CDN client, a GRID application client and any Client having the
   choice in several connection points for data or resource exchange.
   To do so, it uses the term "Application Client" (AC).

   This draft focuses on the use case where the ALTO client is embedded
   in the Application Client.  For P2P applications, the use case where
   the ALTO Client is embedded in the P2P tracker is also applicable.

   It is assumed that Applications likely to use the ALTO service have a
   choice in connection endpoints as it is the case for most of them.
   The ALTO service is managed by the Network Provider and reflects its
   preferences for the choice of endpoints.  The NP defines in
   particular the network map, the routing cost among Network Locations,
   and which ALTO services are available at a given ALTO server.

   The solution proposed in this draft is applicable to fixed networks.
   It is also meant for smaller networks such as mobile networks.


3.  Terminology

   Endpoint (EP): can be a Peer, a CDN storage location, a Party in a
   resource sharing swarm such as a computation Grid or an online multi-
   party game.

   Endpoint Discovery (EP Discovery) : this term covers the different
   types of processes used to discover different types of endpoints.

   Network Service Provider: includes both ISPs, who provide means to
   transport the data and Content Delivery Network (CDN) who care for
   the dissemination, persistent storage and possibly identification of
   the best/closest content copy.

   Application Client (AC): this term generalizes the case of a P2P
   client to include the case of a CDN client and of any Client having
   the choice in several connection points for data or resource
   exchange.


4.  Proposed ALTO protocol updates for multi-cost transactions

   This section is to be completed and proposes first updates of the
   ALTO protocol to support Multi Cost ALTO Services or provide
   additional ALTO information.  It integrates discussions on he ALTO
   mailing list and its goal is to initiate further discussions and
   protocol update proposals.

   If an ALTO client desires several Cost Types, instead of placing as
   many requests as costs, it may request and receive all the desired
   cost types in one single transaction.  The correspondence between the
   components and the cost types MUST be indicated in the ALTO request.

   The ALTO server then, provided it supports the desired cost, and
   provided it supports multi-cost ALTO transactions, sends one single
   response where for each {source, destination} pair.  The cost values
   are arranged in a vector, whose component each corresponds to a
   specified Cost Type.  The correspondence between the components and
   the cost types MUST be indicated either in the ALTO response or
   available via the resource directory.

   The ALTO services impacted by the Multi-Cost extensions are:

   o  Information Resources Directory,

   o  Cost Map Service,

   o  Cost Map Filtering Service,

   o  Endpoint Cost Lookup Service.

   This draft focuses on the case of the Endpoint Cost Lookup Service

4.3.  ALTO Status Codes for Multi-Cost ALTO

   If the Multi-cost Service is not supported for either the Cost Map or
   the Endpoint Service, then the ALTO server sends an ALTO status code
   7 corresponding to HTTP status code 501 indicating "Invalid cost
   structure".  The ALTO client may then needs to place as many requests
   as needed Cost Types, and the ALTO server sends as many cost maps or
   EP cost as needed.

   To the attribute Cost Mode in S.5.1 should be associated a rule
   stipulating that when multiple cost types are requested, then the
   requested Cost Mode SHOULD be numerical.


5.  Use cases for further Cost Types and Endpoint Properties

   The current ALTO protocol [ID-alto-protocol] specification requests
   the creation of two registries maintained by IANA.  The ALTO Cost
   Type registry ensures that the Cost Types that are represented by an
   ALTO Cost Map are unique identifiers, and it further contains
   references to the semantics of the Cost Type.  The current



Randriamasy & Schwan    Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               multi-cost ALTO                   July 2011


   specification registers 'routingcost' as a generic measure for
   routing traffic from a source to a destination.  In a similar way the
   ALTO Endpoint Property Registry ensures uniquenes of ALTO Endpoint
   Property identifiers and provides references to particular semantics
   of the allocated Enpoint Properties.  Currently the 'pid' identifier
   is registered, which serves as an identifier that allows aggregation
   of network endpoints into network regions.  Both registries accept
   new entries after Expert Review [[ID-alto-protocol]].  New entries
   are requested to be conform to the respective syntactical
   requirements, and must include information about the new identifier,
   the intended semantics as well as security considerations.

   The current protocol specification concentrates on the basic use case
   of optimizing routing costs in NSPs networks.  Upcoming use cases
   however will require both, new Cost Types and new Endpoint
   Properties.  The goal of this section is to describe further forward
   looking use case scenarios that are likely to benefit from ALTO, and,
   in future iterations, to convey new Cost Types and Endpoint
   Properties that are likely to be beneficial for ALTO clients in these
   scenarios.

5.1.  Delay Sensitive Overlay Applications

   The ALTO working group has been created to allow P2P applications and
   NSPs a mutual cooperation, in particular because P2P bulk file-
   transfer applications have created a huge amount of intra-domain
   traffic.  By aligning overlay topologies according to the
   'routingcost' of the underlying network both layers are expected to
   benefit in terms of reduced costs and improved Quality-of-Experience.

   However other types of overlay applications might benefit from a
   different set of path metrics.  In particular for real-time sensitive
   applications, such as gaming, interactive video conferencing or
   medical services, creating an overlay topology with respect to a
   minimized delay is preferable.  However it is very hard for a NSP to
   give accurate guidance for this kind of realtime information, instead
   probing through end-to-end measurements on the application layer has
   proven to be the superior mechanism.  Still, a NSP might give some
   guidance to the overlay application, for example by providing
   statisically preferable paths with respect to the time of a day.
   Also static information like hopcount can be seen as an indicator for
   the delay that can be expected.  In the following iterations this
   draft will thus analyse which metrics can realisticaly be provided
   through ALTO to give delay sensitive applications guidance for peer
   selection.

5.2.  CDN Surrogate Selection

   A second use case is motivated through draft
   [draft-jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases-01].  The request router in today's
   CDNs makes a decision about to which surrogate or cache node a
   content request should be forwarded to.  Typically this decision is
   based on locality aspects, i.e. the surrogate node which is closest
   to the client is preferred by the request router.  An ALTO server
   hereby is one promising option to allow NSPs to give guidance to the
   CDN about which cache node would be preferable according to the view
   of the network by the 'routingcost' Cost Type.  Providing this kind
   of information is in particular important as one trend is to place
   cache nodes deeper into the network, which results in the need for
   finer grained information.

   While distance today is the predominant metric used for routing
   decisions, other metrics might allow sophisticated request routing
   strategies.  For example the load a cache node sees in terms of CPU
   utilization, memory usage or bandwidth utilization might influence
   routing decisions for load-balancing reasons.  There exist numerous
   ways of gathering and feeding this kind of information into the
   request routing mechanism.  As ALTO is likely to become a
   standardized interface to provide network topology information, for
   simplicity other information that is used by a request router could
   be provided by the ALTO server as well.  In the next iterations of
   this draft we will analyse which of these metrics is suitable to be
   provided as Cost Type or Endpoint Property for the use case of CDN
   Surrogate Selection and propose to register them in the respective
   registries.


6.  Proposed additional Properties and Costs

   To be further specified

6.1.  Scoping ALTO information

   One way for the NSP to provide guidance on highly dynamic network
   state information such as delay and load is to provide them in the
   form of statistics or as a numerical coarse grain indicator.  It is
   important to have the possibility to reflect that the provided values
   are applicable for a given time period, for example business hours,
   and are subject to changes over time.

   The following attributes can be associated to the applicable ALTO
   information:

   o  an age attribute indicating when the information was generated.

   o  for statistical costs a time period attribute indicating over
      which duration the statistics were collected.

   o  a validity attribute indicating when the provided values should be
      refreshed.  By defaut, this parameter can be set to infinity.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Information for the ALTO Endpoint property registry maintained by the
   IANA and related to the new Endpoints supported by the acting ALTO
   server.  These definitions will be formulated according to the syntax
   defined in Section on "ALTO Endpoint Property Registry" of
   [ID-alto-protocol],

   Information for the ALTO Cost Type Registry maintained by the IANA
   and related to the new Cost Types supported by the acting ALTO
   server.  These definitions will be formulated according to the syntax
   defined in Section on "ALTO Cost Type Registry" of
   [ID-alto-protocol],

7.1.  Information for IANA on proposed Cost Types

   When a new ALTO Cost Type is defined, accepted by the ALTO working
   group and requests for IANA registration MUST include the following
   information, detailed in Section 11.2: Identifier, Intended
   Semantics, Security Considerations.

7.2.  Information for IANA on proposed Endpoint Propeeries

   Likewise, an ALTO Endpoint Property Registry could serve the same
   purposes as the ALTO Cost Type registry.  Application to IANA
   registration for Endpoint Properties would follow a similar process.
