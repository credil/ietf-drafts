Abstract

   There are scenarios in which home agent initiated flow binding
   operations towards the mobile node is needed such as revoking a flow
   binding or moving a flow from one interface to another because of
   network resource availability.  This document defines two new
   Mobility Headers and three new options to perform home agent
   initiated interactions for flow bindings in a mobile node.

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6   October 2009


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] allows a mobile node to bind a
   particular flow to a care-of address without affecting other flows
   using the same home address.  Binding Update (BU)/Binding
   Acknowledgement(BA) messages are extended for the mobile node to add,
   modify, remove and refresh flow binding in a home agent.  The
   operations are always initiated by the mobile node.

   In some cases, the home agent would like to initiate flow binding
   operations. e.g, the home agent revokes a flow binding for reasons
   such as accounting insufficiency of the mobile node; for the mobile
   node equipped with multiple interfaces, the home agent moves a flow
   binding from one interface to another based on network resource
   availability; the home agent provisions default flow binding rules to
   the mobile node based on the mobile node's default profile.

   This document defines two new Mobility Headers for the home agent to
   control flow binding in the mobile node.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC3775] and [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Default Flow Binding Provisioning

   Michael purchases a dual mode phone equipped with both 3GPP and WiFi
   interfaces.  He also signs a Service Level Agreement(SLA) with an
   operator including the following information:

   o  3GPP access takes priority over WiFi access when providing Voice-
      over-IP (VoIP) service.  That is, the 3GPP network is always used
      when Michael makes a call if the network is accessible.
   o  WiFi access is primarily selected to serve IPTV service.
   o  Peer-to-peer (p2p) download is only allowed through WiFi access.

   Michael's default profile can be downloaded from AAA server through
   the home agent to its mobile node when registering.

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6   October 2009


3.2.  Flow Binding Revocation

   The operator also provides a package to Michael, for example,
   unlimited call and 8 hours of free Video on Demand (VoD).  Michael is
   a movie fan, and every month he uses up all the 8 hours.  The
   operator has no choice but cutting his ongoing VoD while still
   providing unlimited call service.

3.3.  Inter-Interface Flow Binding Movement

   Michael stays home using WLAN access for call and downloading.
   However, the operator does its routine maintenance of its WiFi
   devices.  The operator then moves all the calls and downloading to
   its 3GPP interface.  Once the maintenance is over, the operator then
   moves back the service.


4.  Protocol Operation

   [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] makes use of Binding Update (BU)
   /Binding Acknowledgement(BA) signalling to add, modify, remove and
   refresh flow binding in a home agent.  That is, flow binding
   operations are always initiated from the mobile node.  The mechanism
   specified in this document is complementary to the method described
   in [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].  It is assumed that the home agent
   has already created Binding Cache entries for the mobile node before
   launching flow binding operations.

   In this document, two new Mobility Headers are defined, that is, Flow
   Binding Indication(FBI) Section 5.1.1 and Flow Binding
   Acknowledgement(FBA)Section 5.1.2.  FBI is used by the home agent to
   initiate flow binding operations, while FBA is used for acknowledging
   FBI.

4.1.  Adding flow bindings

   Adding the flow binding implies associating a flow with a particular
   care-of address for the mobile node.  The care-of address concerned
   with the flow binding is present in the destination address of the
   packet or the alternate care-of address option.  Alternatively, the
   care-of address may be indicated by the Binding Identification number
   (BID) described in [RFC5648] which is pointing to an existing care-of
   address, and the BID is included in the Binding Reference sub-option
   of the Flow Attribute option defined in Section 5.2.1.

   When adding a new flow binding, the home agent sends a FBI with a
   Flow Attribute option to the mobile node.  The Flow Attribute option
   includes a unique Flow Identifier (FID).  The PRO field of the option



Xia & Sarikaya           Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6   October 2009


   MUST indicate an Add operation.  The FID needs only be unique for the
   receiver of the message that adds a flow, i.e. the same FID can be
   used across different receivers of the message.  A lifetime value is
   included to indicate the remaining lifetime of the flow binding.

4.2.  Deleting flow bindings

   When removing a flow binding, the home agent node sends a FBI with a
   Flow Attribute option which PRO field indicates Delete operation.
   The Flow Attribute option includes a unique FID for the mobile node
   to locate the flow binding and remove it.

4.3.  Modifying flow bindings

   When modifying a flow binding (either the care-of address or other
   attributes of the flow), the home agent sends the mobile node a FBI
   message with Flow Attribute option.  The option includes the FID for
   the binding being modified.  A Flow Description Option may come with
   the Flow Attribute Option and contain the new attributes needed to
   classify the flow such as in [I-D.ietf-mext-binary-ts].  Hence, flow
   modification is essentially a process where an existing flow
   definition is removed and a new flow (included in the option) is
   added and given the same FID as the flow that was removed.

4.4.  Refreshing flow bindings

   A flow binding is refreshed by simply including the Flow Attribute
   option with Refresh PRO field in the FBI message.  The message should
   be sent before the expiration of the flow binding.  The message
   updates existing bindings with new information.  Hence, all
   information previously sent in the last refreshing message need to be
   resent, otherwise such information will be lost.

4.5.  Moving flow bindings

   The home agent can move a flow associated to one interface of the
   multi-interfaced mobile node to another by sending a FBI message to
   the mobile node.  A Flow Attribute option whose PRO field is set to
   Move is included.  The address of the target interface is also
   included in the Flow Attribute option.

4.6.  Switching flow bindings

   Here are some example scenarios where a home agent signal to the
   mobile node that it should acquire a new home agent for some specific
   flows:





Xia & Sarikaya           Expires April 22, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6   October 2009


   o  The home agent is overloaded.
   o  An operator may wish to balance the load among home agents.
   o  Operators do periodic maintenance in order to maintain
      reliability.
   o  Some other scenarios.

   The home agent sends the mobile node a FBI with Flow Attribute Option
   to indicate that the mobile node should bind a flow to a new home
   agent.  The alternative home agent addresses are included for the
   mobile node to initiate the flow binding to a new home agent.

4.7.  Acknowledging flow bindings

   The mobile node sends FBA message to acknowledge the reception of FBI
   to Add, Delete, Modify, Refresh, Move, or Switch a flow binding.  On
   receiving messages with Flow Attribute Option(s), the mobile node
   should copy each Flow Attribute Option to the Acknowledgement
   messages.

4.8.  Handling of the Flow Bindings List

   Flow bindings list defined in [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] needs to
   be modified after each protocol operation defined above as follows:

   If FBI contains a flow binding add operation and if the corresponding
   FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST add a new entry
   to the flow bindings list.  FID, Flow Descriptor, FID-PRI and Action
   fields are taken from the Flow Attribute Option.  BID is copied from
   the Binding Reference sub-option.  Active/Inactive Flag is set to
   Active.  Note that if BID is not available it may be replaced by
   Care-of-Address.

   If FBI contains a flow binding delete operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then delete the
   entry.

   If FBI contains a flow binding modify operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   delete the list entry corresponding to this flow and then add a new
   entry setting the values as defined in the Flow Attribute Option.

   If FBI contains a flow binding refresh operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then set Active/
   Inactive Flag to Active.

   If FBI contains a flow binding move operation and if the

Internet-Draft  HA Initiated Flow Binding for Mobile IPv6   October 2009


   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then change the
   BID value to the Care-of-Address in Flow Attribute Option.

   If FBI contains a flow binding switch operation and if the
   corresponding FBA has a status code equal to zero, home agent MUST
   locate the list entry corresponding to this flow and then delete the
   entry.

   Option Type

      TBD
   Option Len

      Length of the option in 8-octet units
   PRO

      This is a 4-bit field that describes the required processing for
      the option.  It can be assigned one of the following values:
   0  Reserved
   1  Add a flow binding
   2  Delete a flow binding
   3  Modify  a flow binding
   4  Refresh  a  flow binding
   5  Move a flow binding
   6  Switch a flow binding  to alternative home agents
   All other values are reserved
   PRI

      This is a 8-bit priority field to indicate the priority of a
      particular option.  This field is needed in cases where two
      different flow descriptions in two different options overlap.  The
      priority field decides which policy should be in those cases.  A

      lower number in this field indicates a higher priority.
   FID

      The Flow Identifier field is an 16-bit unsigned integer that
      includes the identifier for the flow binding.  This field is used
      to refer to an existing binding or to create a new binding.
   Status

      This field indicates the success or failure of the flow binding
      operation for the particular flow in the option.  Values from 0 to
      127 indicate success; Values of 128 and higher indicate failure.
      This field is only relevant when included in the Flow Binding
      Acknowledgement message and must be ignored in the Flow Binding
      Indication message.
   Reserved

      This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the
      sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.
   Lifetime

      16-bit unsigned integer.  One time unit is 4 seconds.  Except for
      Delete and Switch processing in which the lifetime field is
      ignored, the lifetime in other PROs has the following meaning:
           Add, the time remaining before the flow binding expired
           Modify, the lifetime of the modified flow binding Refresh,
           the lifetime of the refreshed flow binding Move, the lifetime
           of the moved flow binding
   Sub-options

      One or more sub-options may be included.  These variable length
      options are defined in later sections.
   Flow Description

      Variable length field including attributes defining a flow.

5.2.2.  Alternate Home Agent sub-option

   This section introduces the Alternate Home Agent sub-option, which
   may be included in the Flow Attribute option.  This sub-option is
   used to indicate the mobile node to switch a flow binding from one
   home agent to another.

   Home Agent Addresses

      Alternative home agent addresses to which the mobile node is going
      to switch its flow bindings.

5.2.3.  Target Care-of-Address sub-option

   This section introduces the Target Care-of-Address, which may be
   included in the Flow Attribute Option.  This sub-option is used to
   indicate the mobile node to move a flow binding from one interface to
   another.
