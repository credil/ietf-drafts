    <section
      title="Introduction">
      <t>About the purpose for DKIM, <xref
          target="RFC4871" /> states: <list>
          <t>The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain
            to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting message
            signer identity...</t>
        </list>Hence, DKIM has a signer that produces a signed message, a
        verifier that confirms the signature and an assessor that consumes the
        validated signing domain. so the simple purpose of DKIM is to
        communicate an identifier to a receive-side assessor module. The
        identifier is in the form of a domain name that refers to a
        responsible identity. For DKIM to be interoperable and useful, signer
        and assessor must share the same understanding of the details about
        the identifier.</t>

      <t>However the specification defines two, potentially different
        identifiers that are carried in the DKIM-Signature: header field and
        might be delivered to a receiving processing module that consumes
        validated payload. The DKIM specification fails to clearly define what
        is "payload" to be delivered to a consuming module, versus what is
        internal and merely in support of achieving payload delivery. </t>
      <t>This currently leaves signers and assessors with the potential for
        having differing -- and therefore non-interoperable -- interpretations
        of how DKIM operates.</t>

      <t>This erratum resolves this confusion. It defines new labels for the
        two values, clarifies their nature, and specifies and their
        relationship. </t>

            from the Signer to a recipient-side Identity Assessor a single,
            Signing Domain Identifier (SDID) that identifies a responsible
            identity. The SDID MUST be the
            value of the d= tag. DKIM MAY optionally provide a single
            responsible User Agent Identifier (UAID); if the UAID is present,
            it MUST be the value of the i= tag.</t>
          <t> The SDID MUST correspond to a valid DNS name under which the
            DKIM key record is published.</t>
          <t> The UAID is specified as having the same syntax as an email
            address, but is not required to have the same semantics. Notably,
            the domain name is not required to be registered in the DNS -- so
            it might not resolve in a query -- and the Local-part MAY be drawn
            from a namespace that does not contain the user's mailbox. The
            details of the structure and semantics for the namespace are
            determined by the Signer. Any knowledge or use of those details by
            verifiers or assessors is outside the scope of the DKIM Signing
            specification. The Signer MAY
            choose to use the same namespace for its UAIDs as its users' email
            addresses, or MAY choose other means of representing its users.
            However, the signer SHOULD use the same UAID for each message
            intended to be evaluated as being within the same sphere of
            responsibility, if it wishes to offer receivers the option of
            using the UAID as a finer grained, stable identifier than the
            SDID. </t>
          <t> Hence, DKIM delivers to receive-side Identity Assessors
            responsible Identifiers that are individual, opaque values. Their
            sub-structures and particular semantics are not publicly defined
            and, therefore, cannot be assumed by an Identity Assessor.</t>
          <t> A receive-side DKIM verifier MUST communicate the Signing Domain
            Identifier (d=) to a consuming Identity Assessor module and MAY
            communicate the User Agent Identifier (i=) if present. </t>
          <t> To the extent that a receiver attempts to intuit
            any structured semantics for either of the identifiers, this is a
            heuristic function that is outside the scope of DKIM's
            specification and semantics. Hence it is relegated to a
            higher-level service, such as a delivery handling filter that
            integrates a variety of inputs and performs heuristic analysis of
            them. </t>
