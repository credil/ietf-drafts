Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


Abstract

   This document contains definitions for the different states that
   documents (viz. Internet-Drafts) may experience while associated
   with an IETF working group.  The first state occurs when an Internet
   Draft (I-D) is submitted for consideration as a working group item.
   The last state is either when the I-D is sent to the IESG for
   publication, or declared as "dead".

   The purpose of this Internet-Draft is to serve as a basis for the
   definition of requirements to extend the IETF Datatracker tool so
   that the community may monitor the status and progression of I-Ds
   through IETF working groups.

   For completeness, Appendix A has definitions for all of the I-D
   states which are already coded into the Datatracker.  These states
   describe the progression and status of I-Ds after they have been
   submitted to the IESG for publication.

1. Introduction

   The IETF Datatracker is a web-based system for managing information
   about Internet-Drafts (I-Ds), RFCs and several other important
   aspects of the IETF process [IDTRACKER].  A limitation of the
   Datatracker is that its database contains very little information
   about the status of Internet Drafts prior to the time they are



Juskevicius           Expires September 2, 2010                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


   submitted to the IESG for publication.  Only one non-IESG state is
   currently defined and coded into the tool: "I-D Exists".

   Section 3 of this I-D proposes definitions for an additional set of
   document states, namely every state that a document written for
   consideration by an IETF Working Group (WG) may experience during
   its progression though a WG.

   The purpose of defining WG document states is to enable community
   discussion on them and consensus on a state diagram to illustrate
   the state transitions preferred by most WGs to progress I-Ds.

   A desired outcome of this initiative is to reach consensus on a set
   of requirements to extend the Datatracker so that WG Chairs and
   other members of the community could monitor the status of I-Ds as
   they progress through IETF working groups.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3. Definitions of Possible WG Document States

   The IETF Datatracker tool has minimal information about the status
   of I-Ds at the WG level today.  Prior to someone asking that an I-SD
   be published, the only state tracked by the tool is "I-D Exists".
   The Datatracker has no other status information about any WG
   document.

   In order for the Datatracker to be record WG document state, new WG
   document states and substates need to be defined, agreed and then
   coded into the front-end of the tool.

   Section 3.1 defines the possible states that could apply to I-Ds
   that have been submitted to an IETF working group.  Section 3.2
   illustrates the relationships between the states in diagram form.
   Section 3.3 defines additional terms which may be useful to flag
   various WG document substates.  Section 3.4 lists the all of the
   "intended maturity levels" which could be applied to a WG document.

3.1. WG Document States

   This subsection defines all of the different states that MAY apply
   to any I-D written as a contribution into an IETF working group.

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


  3.1.1. Candidate WG Document

     An I-D that is under consideration for becoming a working group
     document as a "Candidate WG Document".  A document being in this
     state does not imply any consensus, and does not imply any
     precedence or selection.  The purpose of this state is simply to
     indicate that someone has asked for an existing I-D to be
     considered for acceptance as a working group document.

  3.1.2. Active WG Document

     An "Active WG Document" is an I-D that has been adopted by a
     working group, and is being actively developed.

  3.1.3. Not a WG Document

     This document is not a WG Document.  An I-D may be in this state
     for a variety of reasons.  Some examples are:

     - the I-D was a "Candidate WG Document" but was rejected by the
       WG; or
     - the I-D is an IAB or IRTF document, an individual submission,
       or an independent submission not intended to become a WG
       document.

  3.1.4. Parked WG Document

     A "Parked WG Document" is an I-D which has lost its author or
     editor, is waiting for another document to be written or for a
     review to be completed, or cannot currently be progressed by the
     working group for some other reason.

  3.1.5. In WG Last Call

     A document "In WG Last Call" is an I-D for which a WG last call
     has been issued, and is in progress.

  3.1.6. WG Last Call Completed

     After a WG last call is completed, any comments received SHOULD be
     evaluated before the I-D is progressed.  During the evaluation
     period, the I-D is in a "WG Last Call Completed" state.  After the
     evaluation, the document MAY return to being an "Active WG
     Document" again (i.e. to be refined or rewritten) or be "Parked"
     for a variety of reasons, or be progressed into "Waiting for
     Document Shepherd Write-Up".

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


     Many members of the community desire additional information when
     the result of a WG Last Call is "Revised I-D Needed".  See section
     3.3 for "annotation tags" which may be used to provide such
     additional information.

  3.1.7. Waiting for WG Document Shepherd Write-Up

     The working group last call has been completed and the document is
     awaiting the document shepherd to submit his/her write-up.

  3.1.8. Submitted to IESG for Publication

     The document has been submitted to the IESG for publication (and
     has not returned to the WG for further action).  The document may
     be under consideration by the IESG, it may have been approved and
     be in the RFC Editor's queue, or it may have been published as an
     RFC; this state does not distinguish between different states that
     may occur after the document has left the working group.

  3.1.9. Dead WG Document

     A "Dead WG Document" is an I-D that used to a WG document, but has
     been abandoned.  Note that this is not always a final state.  If
     consensus is subsequently achieved in the working group, a "Dead
     WG Document" can be resurrected.

3.2. Straw Man WG Document State Diagram

   Figure 1 illustrates all of the different states defined in section
   3.1, and most of the state transitions that an I-D MAY experience
   during its tenure as a WG Document.

   State transitions which are rare (e.g. an I-D going from "Parked" to
   "Dead") are not illustrated in the diagram, however the lack of an
   explicit path between two states in the diagram does not mean that
   such a transition is impossible.

3.3. WG Document Substates

   In addition to identifying the state that every WG Document is in,
   it would be informative for the Datatrack to record associated
   substates or conditions which may affect each WG Document at
   different time.  The substates do not change the state of WG
   documents, but they can be used, for example, to help the community
   understand why a document is in the state it is in, and/or to
   indicate the next action needed for the document.

   Each of the substates defined herein may be appropriate to indicate
   the substate of a WG Document at different times.

  3.3.1. Awaiting Cross-Area Review

     This is a valid substate for "Active" and "Parked" WG Documents.
     It means that someone (e.g. an author or editor of the document,
     or a WG Chair) has initiated a cross-area review of the document,
     and the review has not (yet) been completed.

     Documents tagged with this annotation SHOULD remain in this
     substate until the review is complete and possibly until the
     issues raised in the review are addressed.

  3.3.2. Awaiting MIB Doctor Review

     This is a valid substate for "Active" and "Parked" WG Documents.
     It means that someone (e.g. an author or editor of the document,
     or the a WG Chair) has initiated a review of the document by a MIB
     Doctor, and the review has not (yet) been completed.

     Documents tagged with this annotation SHOULD remain in this
     substate until the review is complete and possibly until the
     issues raised in the review are addressed.

  3.3.3. Awaiting Security Review

     This is a valid substate for "Active" and "Parked" WG Documents.
     It means that someone (e.g. an author or editor of the document,
     or a WG Chair) has initiated a review of security considerations
     in the document, and the review has not (yet) been completed.

     Documents tagged with this annotation SHOULD remain in this
     substate until the review is complete and possibly until the
     issues raised in the review are addressed.

  3.3.4. Awaiting Other Review

     This is a valid substate for "Active" and "Parked" WG Documents.
     It means that someone (e.g. an author or editor of the document,
     or a WG Chair) has initiated some other review of the document
     (e.g. sent it to another Standards Development Organization (SDO)
     for comments via a formal or informal liaison process [MPLSTPDP])
     and the review has not (yet) been completed.

  3.3.5. Awaiting Merge with Other Document

     This is a valid substate for "Active" and "Parked" WG Documents.
     It means that a decision has been made by someone (e.g. the
     document's authors, editors, or the WG Chairs) to have the I-D
     merged with one or more other I-Ds from the same (or other) WG.

     If the result of the "merge" operation is a brand new I-D having a
     different title, then the old I-D may be declared as being "Dead".
     In this case the substate annotation should be changed from
     "Awaiting Merge with Other Document" to "Other - see Comment Log"
     and a description of what happened should be entered in the log
     for posterity.

     If the result of the "merge" operation is a revision to the I-D,
     then this substate should be cleared as soon as the the revised I-
     D is submitted to the IETF by its authors or editors.

  3.3.6. Author or Editor Needed

     This substate is applicable to "Parked", "Dead" and (sometimes)
     "Active" WG Documents.  It means the I-D has lost a primary author
     or editor, and that further work on the I-D can not continue in an
     effective or efficient manner without a new author or editor being
     found.

  3.3.7. Held due to Dependency on other Document

     This substate is most often associated with "Parked" WG Documents.
     It means that work to complete the I-D is on-hold because of one
     or more dependencies on other documents.  A typical example is
     where an I-D includes normative references to other IETF
     documents, but all of other documents have not (yet) been
     published as RFCs.


  3.3.8. Held due to IESG concerns on this Document

     This is a valid substate for "Active" and "Parked" WG Documents,
     and I-Ds which are in the "WG Last Call Completed" state.  This
     annotation is an indicator that one or more IESG members have
     expressed concerns about the document (e.g. during discussions
     leading up to a WG Last Call, or during the WG Last Call), and


Juskevicius           Expires September 2, 2010                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


     that the document MUST NOT be submitted to the IESG for
     publication until the concerns are addressed.

     Once in this substate, WG Documents SHOULD continue to be tagged
     with this indicator until the IESG concerns are resolved, even if
     the main state of the I-D changes (e.g. from "Active" to "Parked"
     (or "Dead") or vice-versa).

  3.3.9. Revised I-D Needed - based on WG consensus

     This is a valid substate for "Active", "Parked", and "Dead" WG
     Documents.  This annotation means that rough consensus was
     developed in the working group that the I-D needs to be revised if
     it is to be progressed.  This annotation can also indicate when an
     I-D is already in the process of being revised.  This substate
     SHOULD be reset when the revised version of the I-D is submitted
     to the WG.

  3.3.10. Revised I-D Needed - based on WG last call

     This is a valid substate for "WG Last Call Completed", "Active",
     "Parked", and/or "Dead" WG Documents.  This annotation means the
     I-D was sent for WG Last Call and the consensus after the Last
     Call is that the WG Document MUST be revised before it may
     progress any further.


  3.3.11. Doc Shepherd Follow-up

     This substate annotation indicates when a shepherd for the WG
     Document is actually working on the write-up required to submit
     the document (to the IESG) for publication.  It is often the case
     that too many I-Ds can arrive in a Shepherd's queue in too short a
     time, and the Shepherd can not create write-ups for all of them
     simultaneously.  This substate tag SHOULD be used to distinguish
     between I-Ds  waiting for write-up (i.e. I-Ds for which the write-
     ups have not yet been started), and I-Ds for which the write-ups
     are already underway.


  3.3.12. Other - see Comment Log

     This annotation tag is a catch-all to indicate that someone (e.g.
     an author or editor of the document, the WG Chair, an AD) has
     entered one or more comments about the current state of the I-D
     into the IETF Datatracker.

3.4. Intended Maturity Level of WG Documents

   In addition to the substate annotation tags defined in section 3.3,
   the intended maturity level of every WG Document SHOULD also be
   tracked.  The definition of the maturity levels are as in sections 4
   and 5 of RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  They are:

     *  "Experimental"
     *  "Informational"
     *  "Best Current Practice"
     *  "Proposed Standard"
     *  "Draft Standard"
     *  "Full Standard"
     *  "Historic"


4. Security Considerations

   This document does not propose any new internet mechanisms, and has
   no security implications for the internet.



5. IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any new number assignments from IANA,
   and does not define any new numbering spaces to be administered by
   IANA.

   RFC-Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

Appendix A: "IESG Document" States

   This Appendix describes the status information currently stored in
   the IETF Datatracker tool for every I-D submitted to the IESG for
   publication.  The terms and definitions herein are as in [IDSTATES].

   It must be noted that I-Ds sent to the IESG for publication (termed
   "IESG Documents" in the Appendix) do not stay with the IESG until
   they day they are published as RFCs.  After evaluation, the IESG may
   declare that some I-Ds deserve a "Do Not Publish" label, while
   others should be "Dead".  Some I-Ds get sent back to their
   originators (WGs or otherwise), and the rest go into the RFC Editor
   queue.

A.1. Definition of "IESG Document" States

A.1.1. I-D Exists

   This is the initial (default) state for all Internet-Drafts.  Such
   documents are not tracked by the IESG as no request has been made of
   the IESG to do anything with an I-D in this state.

A.1.2. Publication Requested

   A formal request has been made to advance/publish the document,
   following the procedures in Section 7.5 of RFC 2418 [RFC2418]; the
   request could be from a WG Chair, from an individual through the RFC
   Editor, etc.  Note: the Secretariat (iesg-secretary@ietf.org) is
   copied on these requests to ensure that the request makes it into
   the Datatracker.  A document in this state has not (yet) been
   reviewed by an Area Director (AD) nor has any official action been
   taken on it yet (other than to note that its publication has been
   requested).

A.1.3. AD Evaluation

   A specific AD (e.g. the "Area Advisor" for the WG) has begun his/her
   review of the document to verify that it is ready for advancement.
   The shepherding AD is responsible for doing any necessary review
   before starting an IETF Last Call or sending the document directly
   to the IESG as a whole.

A.1.4. Expert Review

   An AD sometimes asks for an external review by an outside party as
   part of evaluating whether a document is ready for advancement.
   MIBs, for example, are reviewed by the "MIB doctors".  Other types


Juskevicius           Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


   of reviews may also be requested (e.g., security, operations
   impacts, etc.).  Documents remain in this state until the review is
   completed and possibly until the issues raised in the review are
   addressed.  Specific details on the nature of the review may be
   found in the "note" field associated with this state (i.e. within
   the Datatracker).

A.1.5. Last Call Requested

   The AD has requested that the Secretariat start an IETF Last Call,
   but the actual Last Call message has not been sent yet.

A.1.6. In Last Call

   The document is currently waiting for IETF Last Call to complete.
   Last Calls for WG documents typically last 2 weeks, and those for
   individual submissions last 4 weeks.

A.1.7. Waiting for Writeup

   Before a standards-track or BCP document is formally considered by
   the entire IESG, the AD must write-up a protocol action.  The
   protocol action is included in the approval message that the
   Secretariat sends out when the document is approved for publication
   as an RFC.

A.1.8. Waiting for AD Go-Ahead

   As a result of the IETF Last Call, comments may need to be responded
   to and a revision of the I-D may be needed as well. The AD is
   responsible for verifying that all Last Call comments have been
   adequately addressed and that the (possibly revised) document is in
   the I-D directory and ready for consideration by the IESG as a
   whole.

A.1.9. IESG Evaluation

   The document is now (finally!) being formally reviewed by the entire
   IESG.  Documents are discussed in email or during a bi-weekly IESG
   telechat.  In this phase, each AD reviews the document and airs any
   issues she/he may have.  Unresolvable issues are documented as
   "discuss" comments that can be forwarded to the authors/WG.  See the
   description of substates in Section A.2 for additional details about
   the current state of the IESG discussion.

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


A.1.10. IESG Evaluation - Defer

   During a telechat, one or more ADs requested an additional 2 weeks
   to review the document. A defer is designed to be an exception
   mechanism, and can only be invoked once, the first time the document
   comes up for discussion during a telechat.

A.1.11. Approved-announcement to be sent

   The IESG has approved the document for publication, but the
   Secretariat has not yet sent out an official approval message.

A.1.12. Approved-announcement sent

   The IESG has approved the document for publication, and the
   Secretariat has sent out the official approval message to the RFC
   editor.

A.1.13. RFC Ed Queue

   The document is in the RFC editor Queue (as confirmed by
   http://www.rfc-editor.org/queue.html)

A.1.14. RFC Published

   The I-D has been published as an RFC.

A.1.15. DNP-waiting for AD note

   Do Not Publish: The IESG recommends against publishing the document,
   but the writeup explaining its reasoning has not yet been produced.
   DNPs apply primarily to individual submissions received through the
   RFC editor.  More information on who has the action item should be
   recorded in the "note" field associated with this state (i.e. within
   the Datatracker).

A.1.16. DNP-announcement to be sent

   The IESG recommends against publishing the document.  A writeup
   explaining the IESG's reasoning has been produced, but the
   Secretariat has not yet sent out the official "do not publish"
   recommendation message.

A.1.17. AD is Watching

   An AD is aware of the document and has chosen to place the document
   in a separate state in order to keep a closer eye on it (for


Juskevicius           Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


   whatever reason).  Documents in this state are still not being
   actively tracked in the sense that no formal request has been made
   to publish or advance the document.  The sole difference between
   this state and "I-D Exists" is that an AD has chosen to put it in a
   separate state, to make it easier to keep track of (for his or her
   own reasons).

A.1.18. Dead

   The document is "dead" and is no longer being tracked (e.g., it has
   been replaced by another document having a different name, it has
   been withdrawn, etc.).

A.2. "IESG Document" Substates

A.2.1. Point Raised - writeup needed

   IESG discussions on the document have raised some issues that need
   to be brought to the attention of the authors/WG, but those issues
   have not been written down yet. (It is common for discussions during
   a telechat to result in such situations.  An AD may raise a possible
   issue during a telechat and only decide as a result of that
   discussion whether the issue is worth formally writing up and
   bringing to the attention of the authors/WG).  A document stays in
   the "Point Raised - writeup needed" state until *ALL* IESG comments
   that have been raised have been documented.

A.2.2. AD Followup

   "AD Followup" is a generic substate indicating that the shepherding
   AD has the action to determine appropriate next steps.  In
   particular, the appropriate steps (and the corresponding next state
   or substate) depend entirely on the nature of the issues that were
   raised and can only be decided with active involvement of the
   shepherding AD.

   Examples include:

   - if another AD raises an issue, the shepherding AD may first
   iterate with the other AD to get a better understanding of the exact
   issue.  Or, the shepherding AD may attempt to argue that the issue
   is not serious enough to bring to the attention of the authors/WG.

   - if a documented issue is forwarded to a WG, some further iteration
   may be needed before it can be determined whether a new revision is
   needed or whether the WG response to an issue clarifies the issue
   sufficiently.

Internet-Draft      Working Group Document States            March 2010


   - when a new revision appears, the shepherding AD will first look at
   the changes to determine whether they believe all outstanding issues
   have been raised satisfactorily, prior to asking the ADs who raised
   the original issues to verify the changes.

A.2.3. External Party

   The document is awaiting review or input from an external party
   (i.e, someone other than the shepherding AD, the authors, or the
   WG). See the "note" field for more details on who has the action.

A.2.4. Revised I-D Needed

   An updated I-D is needed to address the issues that have been
   raised.
