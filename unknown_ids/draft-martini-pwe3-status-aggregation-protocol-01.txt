Abstract

   This document describes a method includes generating an aggregated
   pseudowire status message on Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   network Label Switched Path (LSP). The method for transmitting the
   pseudowire (PW) status information is not new, however these protocol
   extension allows a Service Provider (SP) to reliably use the PW
   static status messages on individual PWs. The aggregated pseudowire
   status message configured to verify a current status of all
   pseudowires on the LSP.

1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   When PWs use an Multi Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) network as the
   Packet Switched Network (PSN), are setup according to [RFC4447]
   static configuration mode, the PW status information is propagated
   using the method described in [PW-STATUS]. There are 2 basic modes of
   operation described in [PW-STATUS] section 5.3: Periodic
   retransmission of non-zero status messages, and a simple acknowledge
   of PW status (sec 5.3.1 of [PW-STATUS]).  The LSP level protocol
   described below applies to the case then Pw status is acknowledged

   immediately with a requested refresh value of zero. (no refresh) In
   this case the PW status refresh reduction protocol is necessary for
   several reasons , such as:

        -i. Greatly increase the scalability of the PW status protocol
            by reducing the amount of messages that a PE needs to
            periodically send to it's neighbors.
       -ii. Detect a remote PE restart.
      -iii. If the local state is lost for some reason, the PE needs to
            be able to request a status refresh from the remote PE
       -iv. Optionally detect a remote PE provisioning change.


2.1. Terminology

   FEC: Forwarding Equivalence Class

   LDP: Label Distribution Protocol

   LSP: Label Switching Path

   MS-PW: Multi-Segment Pseudowire

   PE: Provider Edge

   PW: Pseudowire

   SS-PW: Single-Segment Pseudowire

   S-PE: Switching Provider Edge Node of MS-PW

   T-PE: Terminating Provider Edge Node of MS-PW


3. PW status refresh reduction protocol

   PW status refresh reduction protocol consists of a simple message
   that is sent at the LSP level using the MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel.

   A PE using the PW status refresh reduction protocol MUST send the PW
   status refresh reduction Message as soon as a PW is configured on a
   particular LSP.  The message is then re-transmitted at a locally
   configured interval indicated in the refresh timer field. If no
   acknowledgment is received, the protocol does not reach active state,
   and the PE SHOULD NOT send any PW status messages with a refresh
   timer of zero as described in [PW-STATUS] section 5.3.1.

3.1. Protocol states

   The protocol can be in 3 possible states: INACTIVE, STARTUP, and
   ACTIVE.


3.1.1. INACTIVE

   This state is entered when the protocol is turned off. this state is
   entered if all PW on a specific LSP are unprovisioned, or the feature
   is unprovisioned.


3.1.2. STARTUP

   In this state the PE transmits periodic PW status refresh messages,
   with the Ack Session ID set to 0. The PE remains in this state until
   a PW status refresh message is received with the correct local
   session ID in the Ack Session ID Field. This state can be exited to
   the ACTIVE or INACTIVE state.


3.1.3. ACTIVE

   This state is entered once the PE receives a PW status refresh
   message with the correct local session ID in the Ack Session ID Field
   within 3.5 times the refresh timer field value of the last PW status
   refresh message transmitted. This state is immediately exited as
   follows:

        -i. A valid PW status refresh message is not received within 3.5
            times the current refresh timer field value. (assuming a
            timer transition procedure is not in progress) New state:
            STARTUP
       -ii. A PW status refresh message is received with the wrong, or a
            zero value, Ack Session ID field value. New state: STARTUP
      -iii. All PWs using the particular LSP are unprovisioned, or the
            protocol is disabled. New state: INACTIVE


3.2. Timer value change transition procedure

   If a PE needs to change the refresh timer value field while the PW
   refresh reduction protocol is in the ACTIVE state, the following
   procedure must be followed:






Martini & Swallow                                               [Page 4]

Internet Draftdraft-martini-pwe3-status-aggregation-protocol-01.txtctober 25, 2010


        -i. A PW status refresh message is transmitted with the new
            timer value.
       -ii. If the new value is greater then the original one the PE
            will operate on the new timer value immediately.
      -iii. If the new value is smaller then the original one, the PE
            will operate according to the original timer value for a
            period 3.5 times the original timer value, or until the
            first valid PW status refresh message is received.

            A PE receiving a PW status refresh message with a new timer
            value, will immediately transmit an acknowledge PW status
            refresh message, and start operating according to the new
            timer value.


4. PW status refresh reduction Message

   The packet containing the refresh reduction message is constructed as
   follows: (omitting link layer information)

    0                   1                   2                   3
