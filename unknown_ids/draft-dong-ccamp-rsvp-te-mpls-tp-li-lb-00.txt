Internet-Draft        RSVP-TE Extensions for LI&LB             July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The requirements of Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) are
   specified in [RFC5860].  [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb] defines in-band
   Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) functions, it leverages the
   Generic Associated Channel (GACH) and Generic Associated Channel
   Label (GAL) [RFC5586] or Label Switching Path "Ping" (LSP-Ping) to
   perform LI and LB functions.  In-band LI and LB is suitable for the
   scenarios where control plane is not used.

   When a control plane is used for establishing MPLS-TP LSPs, it's
   natural to use and extend the control plane protocol to implement LI
   and LB functions.  Since LI and LB would modify the forwarding plane
   of an LSP, without the involvement of control plane this may result
   in inconsistency of the LSP information between control plane and
   data plane.  Besides, with control plane mechanisms, it does not need
   to rely on the TTL expiration to make the LI/LB commands to reach
   particular MIP or MEP.

   This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE to implement LI and LB
   for MPLS-TP LSPs when MPLS-TP control plane is used.  The mechanisms
   defined in this document are complementary to
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb].


2.  Extensions to RSVP-TE

   In this document, Path and Resv message are used to implement LI
   function, and Notify message is used for LB functions.  Two new flags
   (Lock bit and Loopback bit) are defined in ADMIN_STATUS Object
   [RFC3471] [RFC3473] that can be carried in Path/Resv and Notify
   message.

   Format of extended ADMIN_STATUS Object is as below:
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |            Length             | Class-Num(196)|   C-Type (1)  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |R|                        Reserved           |K|B|H|L|I|C|T|A|D|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Lock (K): When this bit is set in Path message, it indicates that
   local actions related to the "Lock" mode should be taken.  When this
   bit is set in Resv or Notify message, it indicates that the LSP is
   put in "Lock" mode.

   Loopback (B): When this bit is set in Notify message sent from the
   ingress node, it indicates that the target node of this message
   SHOULD perform loopback function for this LSP.  When this bit is set
   in Notify message sent to the ingress node, it indicates the node
   originating this message is in "Loopback" mode.

   Reflect (R): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]
   Handover (H): 1 bit - see [RFC5852]
   Lockout (L): 1 bit - see [RFC4872]
   Inhibit Alarm Indication (I): 1 bit - see [RFC4783]
   Call Control (C): 1 bit - see [RFC4974]
   Testing (T): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]
   Administratively down (A): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]
   Deletion in progress (D): 1 bit - see [RFC3471]


3.  Operations

3.1.  Lock Instruct

   When a MEP wants to put an LSP in lock mode, it MUST send a Path
   message with the Lock (K) bit and the Reflect (R) bit in ADMIN_STATUS
   Object set.  The intermediate nodes do not need to take action on
   this message and SHOULD forward it unchanged to the downstream.

   On receipt of this Path message, the receiving MEP node SHOULD try to
   take the LSP out of service.  If the receiving MEP locks the LSP
   successfully, it SHOULD send a Resv message with the Lock (K) bit in
   ADMIN_STATUS Object set.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a PathErr message
   with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value "Lock
   Failure", and the following Resv message SHOULD be sent with the Lock
   (K) bit cleared.  Though the intermediate nodes do not need to take
   actions during this procedure, they would be aware of whether the LSP
   is put in Lock mode or not.

   When an LSP is put in lock mode, the subsequent Path and Resv
   messages SHOULD keep the Lock (K) bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object set.

   When a MEP wants to take the LSP out of the lock mode, it MUST send a
   Path message with the Lock (K) bit cleared.  The intermediate nodes
   do not need to take action on this message and SHOULD forward it
   unchanged to the downstream.

   On receipt of this Path message, the receiving MEP node SHOULD try to
   bring the LSP back to service.  If the receiving MEP unlocks the LSP
   successfully, it SHOULD send a Resv message with the Lock (K) bit in
   ADMIN_STATUS Object cleared.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a PathErr
   message with the Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value

   "Unlock Failure", and the following Resv message SHOULD be sent with
   the Lock (K) bit set.

3.2.  Loopback

   Notify message is used to support signaling of Loopback request.

   When a MEP wants to put an LSP in loopback mode, it MUST send a
   Notify message with the Reflect (R) bit, the Loopback (B) Bit and the
   Lock (K) bit in ADMIN_STATUS Object set.  The destination address of
   this Notify message SHOULD be set to the MIP or MEP which is required
   to loopback the traffic.  The ERROR_SPEC object is not relevant in
   loopback request and MUST carry the Error Code zero ("Confirmation")
   to indicate that there is no error.

   On receipt of this Notify message, the receiver node SHOULD try to
   put the LSP in loopback mode.  If the receiver node puts the LSP into
   loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD send a Notify message back to
   the MEP node, with both the Loopback (B) Bit and the Lock (K) bit in
   ADMIN_STATUS Object set, and the ERROR_SPEC object MUST carry the
   Error Code zero.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notify message with the
   Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value "Loopback Failure".

   When a MEP wants to take the LSP out of the loopback mode, it MUST
   send a Notify message with the Lock (K) bit set and the Loopback (B)
   Bit cleared.  The destination address of this Notify message SHOULD
   be set to the MIP or MEP which is performing the loopback action for
   this LSP.

   On receipt of this Notify message, the receiving node SHOULD try to
   put the LSP back to normal operation.  If the receiving node put the
   LSP into normal operation successfully, it SHOULD send a Notify
   message back to the MEP node, with the Lock (K) Bit set and the
   Loopback (B) Bit cleared , and the ERROR_SPEC object MUST carry the
   Error Code zero.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notify message with the
   Error Code "OAM Problem" and the new Error Value "Exit Loopback
   Failure".


4.  IANA Considerations

   Two bits ("Lock" (K) and "Loopback" (B)) need to be allocated in the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object.

   Four new Error Values need to be allocated for Error Code "OAM
   Problem": "Lock Failure", "Unlock Failure", "Loopback Failure", "Exit
   Loopback Failure".
