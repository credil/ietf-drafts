      <t>This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements for the purpose of exchanging structured information in close to real time between any two or more network-aware entities.  XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a variety of applications can be built.  The framework includes methods for stream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions.</t>

  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <section title="Overview" anchor="intro-overview">
      <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an application profile of the Extensible Markup Language <xref target="XML"/> for streaming XML data in close to real time between any two (or more) network-aware entities.  XMPP is typically used to exchange messages, share presence information, and engage in structured request-response interactions.  The basic syntax and semantics of XMPP were developed originally within the Jabber open-source community, mainly in 1999.  In late 2002, the XMPP Working Group was chartered with developing an adaptation of the core Jabber protocol that would be suitable as an IETF instant messaging (IM) and presence technology.  As a result of work by the XMPP WG, <xref target='RFC3920'/> and <xref target='RFC3921'/> were published in October 2004, representing the most complete definition of XMPP at that time.</t>
      <t>As a result of extensive implementation and deployment experience with XMPP since 2004, as well as more formal interoperability testing carried out under the auspices of the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF), this document reflects consensus from the XMPP developer community regarding XMPP's core XML streaming technology.  In particular, this document incorporates the following backward-compatible changes from RFC 3920:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Incorporated corrections and errata</t>
          <t>Added examples throughout</t>
          <t>Clarified and more completely specified matters that were underspecified</t>
          <t>Modified text to reflect updated technologies for which XMPP is a using protocol, e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)</t>
          <t>Defined several additional stream, stanza, and SASL error conditions</t>
          <t>Removed the deprecated DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism <xref target='DIGEST-MD5'/> as a mandatory-to-implement technology</t>
          <t>Added the TLS plus the SASL PLAIN mechanism <xref target='PLAIN'/> as a mandatory-to-implement technology</t>
          <t>Defined of optional support for multiple resources over the same connection</t>
          <t>Transferred historical documentation for the server dialback protocol from this specification to a separate specification</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Therefore, this document defines the core features of XMPP 1.0, thus obsoleting RFC 3920.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: <xref target="XMPP-IM"/> defines the XMPP features needed to provide the basic instant messaging and presence functionality that is described in <xref target="IMP-REQS"/>.</t></list></t>

    <section title="Functional Summary" anchor="intro-summary">
      <t>This non-normative section provides a developer-friendly, functional summary of XMPP; refer to the sections that follow for a normative definition of XMPP.</t>
      <t>The purpose of XMPP is to enable the exchange of relatively small pieces of structured data (called "XML stanzas") over a network between any two (or more) entities.  XMPP is implemented using a client-server architecture, wherein a client needs to connect to a server in order to gain access to the network and thus be allowed to exchange XML stanzas with other entities (which can be associated with other servers).  The process whereby a client connects to a server, exchanges XML stanzas, and ends the connection is:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Determine the hostname and port at which to connect</t>
          <t>Open a TCP connection</t>
          <t>Open an XML stream</t>
          <t>Complete TLS negotiation for channel encryption (recommended)</t>
          <t>Complete SASL negotiation for authentication</t>
          <t>Bind a resource to the stream</t>
          <t>Exchange an unbounded number of XML stanzas with other entities on the network</t>
          <t>Close the XML stream</t>
          <t>Close the TCP connection</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Within XMPP, one server can optionally connect to another server to enable inter-domain or inter-server communication.  For this to happen, the two servers need to negotiate a connection between themselves and then exchange XML stanzas; the process for doing so is:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Determine the hostname and port at which to connect</t>
          <t>Open a TCP connection</t>
          <t>Open an XML stream</t>
          <t>Complete TLS negotiation for channel encryption (recommended)</t>
          <t>Complete SASL negotiation for authentication *</t>
          <t>Exchange an unbounded number of XML stanzas both directly for the servers and indirectly on behalf of entities associated with each server (e.g., connected clients)</t>
          <t>Close the XML stream</t>
          <t>Close the TCP connection</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>* Note: Depending on local service policies, it is possible that a deployed server will use the older server dialback protocol to provide weak identity verification in cases where SASL negotiation would not result in strong authentication (e.g., because TLS negotiation was not mandated by the peer server, or because the certificate presented by the peer server during TLS negotiation is self-signed and thus provides only weak identity); for details, see <xref target='XEP-0220'/>.</t></list></t>
      <t>In the section following discussion of XMPP architecture, this document specifies how clients connect to servers and specifies the basic semantics of XML stanzas.  However, this document does not define the "payloads" of the XML stanzas that might be exchanged once a connection is successfully established; instead, those payloads are defined by various XMPP extensions.  For example, <xref target='XMPP-IM'/> defines extensions for basic instant messaging and presence functionality.  In addition, various specifications produced in the XSF's XEP series <xref target='XEP-0001'/> define extensions for a wide range of more advanced functionality.</t>

  <section title="Architecture" anchor="arch">
    <t>XMPP provides a technology for the asynchronous, end-to-end exchange of structured data by means of direct, persistent XML streams among a distributed network of globally-addressable, presence-aware clients and servers.  Because this architectural style involves ubiquitous knowledge of network availability and a conceptually unlimited number of concurrent information transactions in the context of a given client-to-server or server-to-server session, we label it "Availability for Concurrent Transactions" (ACT) to distinguish it from the "Representational State Transfer" <xref target="REST"/> architectural style familiar from the World Wide Web.  Although the architecture of XMPP is similar in important ways to that of email (see <xref target='EMAIL-ARCH'/>), it introduces several modifications to facilitate communication in close to real time.  The salient features of this ACTive architectural style are as follows.</t>
    <section title="Global Addresses" anchor="arch-addresses">
      <t>As with email, XMPP uses globally-unique addresses (based on the Domain Name System) in order to route and deliver messages over the network.  All XMPP entities are addressable on the network, most particularly clients and servers but also various additional services that can be accessed by clients and servers.  In general, server addresses are of the form "domain.tld" (e.g., "im.example.com"), accounts hosted at a server are of the form "localpart@domain.tld" (e.g., "juliet@im.example.com"), and a particular connected device or resource that is currently authorized for interaction on behalf of an account is of the form "localpart@domain.tld/resource" (e.g., "juliet@im.example.com/balcony").  For historical reasons, XMPP addresses are often called Jabber IDs or JIDs.  Because the formal specification of the XMPP address format depends on internationalization technologies that are in flux at the time of writing, the format is defined in <xref target="XMPP-ADDR"/> instead of this document.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Presence" anchor="arch-presence">
      <t>XMPP includes the ability for an entity to advertise its network availability or "presence" to other entities.  Such availability for communication is signalled end-to-end via dedicated communication primitives in XMPP (the &lt;presence/&gt; stanza).  Although knowledge of network availability is not strictly necessary for the exchange of XMPP messages, it facilitates real-time interaction because the originator of a message can know before initiating communication that the intended recipient is online and available.  XMPP presence is defined in <xref target="XMPP-IM"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Persistent Streams" anchor="arch-streams">
      <t>Availability for communication is also built into point-to-point connections (e.g., a discrete client-to-server or server-to-server connection) through the use of direct, persistent XML streams between the entity that initiated the connection (either a client or a server) and the entity that received the connection (a server).  Thus either party to a stream knows that it can immediately push data to the other party for immediate routing or delivery.  XML streams are defined under <xref target="streams"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Structured Data" anchor="arch-data">
      <t>The basic unit of meaning in XMPP is not an XML stream (which simply provides the transport for point-to-point communication) but an XML "stanza", which is essentially a fragment of XML that is sent over a stream.  The root element of a stanza includes routing attributes (such as "from" and "to" addresses) and the child elements of the stanza contain a payload for delivery to the intended recipient.  XML stanzas are defined under <xref target="stanzas"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Distributed Network" anchor="arch-network">
      <t>In practice, XMPP consists of a network of clients and servers that inter-communicate (however, communication between any two given deployed servers is strictly OPTIONAL).  Thus, for example, the user &lt;juliet@im.example.com&gt; associated with the server &lt;im.example.com&gt; might be able to exchange messages, presence, and other structured data with the user &lt;romeo@example.net&gt; associated with the server &lt;example.net&gt;.  This pattern is familiar from messaging protocols that make use of global addresses, such as the email network (see <xref target="SMTP"/> and <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>).  As a result, end-to-end communication in XMPP is logically peer-to-peer but physically client-to-server-to-server-to-client, as illustrated in the following diagram.</t>

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: Architectures that employ <xref target='streams'>XML streams</xref> and <xref target="stanzas">XML stanzas</xref> but that establish peer-to-peer connections directly between clients using technologies based on <xref target='LINKLOCAL'/> have been deployed, but such architectures are not described in this specification and are best described as "XMPP-like"; for details, see <xref target='XEP-0174'/>.  In addition, XML streams can be established end-to-end over any reliable transport, including extensions to XMPP itself; however, such methods are out of scope for this specification.</t></list></t>
      <t>The following paragraphs describe the responsibilities of clients and servers on the network.</t>
      <t>A CLIENT is an entity that establishes an XML stream with a server by authenticating using the credentials of a local account and that then completes <xref target='bind'>resource binding</xref> in order to enable delivery of XML stanzas between the server and the client over the negotiated stream.  The client then uses XMPP to communicate with its server, other clients, and any other entities on the network, where the server is responsible for delivering stanzas to local entities or routing them to remote entities.  Multiple clients can connect simultaneously to a server on behalf of the same local account, where each client is differentiated by the resourcepart of an XMPP address (e.g., &lt;localpart@domain/home&gt; vs. &lt;localpart@domain/work&gt;), as defined under <xref target='XMPP-ADDR'/> and <xref target='bind'/>.</t>
      <t>A SERVER is an entity whose primary responsibilities are to:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Manage <xref target="streams">XML streams</xref> with local clients and deliver <xref target="stanzas">XML stanzas</xref> to those clients over the negotiated streams; this includes responsibility for ensuring that a client needs to authenticate with the server before being granted access to the XMPP network.</t>
          <t>Subject to local service policies on server-to-server communication, manage <xref target="streams">XML streams</xref> with remote servers and route <xref target="stanzas">XML stanzas</xref> to those servers over the negotiated streams.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Depending on the application, the secondary responsibilities of an XMPP server can include:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Storing XML data that is used by clients (e.g., contact lists for users of XMPP-based instant messaging and presence applications as defined in <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>); in this case, the relevant XML stanza is handled directly by the server itself on behalf of the client and is not routed to a remote server or delivered to a local entity.</t>
          <t>Hosting local services that also use XMPP as the basis for communication but that provide additional functionality beyond that defined in this document or in <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>; examples include multi-user conferencing services as specified in <xref target='XEP-0045'/> and publish-subscribe services as specified in <xref target='XEP-0060'/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="TCP Binding" anchor="tcp">
    <section title="Scope" anchor="tcp-scope">
      <t>As XMPP is defined in this specification, an initiating entity (client or server) MUST open a Transmission Control Protocol <xref target='TCP'/> connection at the receiving entity (server) before it negotiates XML streams with the receiving entity.  The parties then maintain that TCP connection for as long as the XML streams are in use.  The rules specified in the following sections apply to the TCP binding.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Hostname Resolution" anchor="tcp-resolution">
      <t>Before opening the TCP connection, the initiating entity first MUST resolve the Domain Name System (DNS) hostname associated with the receiving entity and determine the appropriate TCP port for communication with the receiving entity.  The process is:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Attempt to resolve the hostname using (a) a <xref target="DNS-SRV"/> Service of "xmpp-client" (for client-to-server connections) or "xmpp-server" (for server-to-server connections) and (b) a Proto of "tcp", resulting in resource records such as "_xmpp-client._tcp.example.net." or "_xmpp-server._tcp.im.example.com.".  The result of the SRV lookup will be one or more combinations of a port and hostname, which hostnames the initiating entity MUST resolve according to returned SRV record weight (if the result of the SRV lookup is a single RR with a Target of ".", i.e. the root domain, the initiating entity MUST abort SRV processing but SHOULD attempt a fallback resolution as described below).  The initiating entity uses the IP address(es) from the first successfully resolved hostname (with the corresponding port number returned by the SRV lookup) in order to connect to the receiving entity.  If the initiating entity fails to connect using one of the IP addresses, the initiating entity uses the next resolved IP address to connect.  If the initiating entity fails to connect using all resolved IP addresses, then the initiating entity repeats the process of resolution and connection for the next hostname returned by the SRV lookup.</t>
           <t>If the SRV lookup aborts or fails, the fallback SHOULD be a normal IPv4 or IPv6 address record resolution to determine the IP address, where the port used is the "xmpp-client" port of 5222 for client-to-server connections or the "xmpp-server" port 5269 for server-to-server connections.</t>
           <t>For client-to-server connections, the fallback MAY be a <xref target='DNS-TXT'/> lookup for alternative connection methods, for example as described in <xref target='XEP-0156'/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: If the initiating entity has been explicitly configured to associate a particular hostname (and potentially port) with the original hostname of the receiving entity (say, to "hardcode" an association between an original hostname of example.net and a configured hostname and of webcm.example.com:80), the initiating entity SHALL use the configured name instead of performing the foregoing resolution process on the original name.</t></list></t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: Many XMPP servers are implemented in such a way that they can host additional services (beyond those defined in this specification and <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>) at hostnames that are subdomains of the hostname of the main XMPP service (e.g., conference.example.net for a <xref target='XEP-0045'/> service associated with the example.net XMPP service) or subdomains of the first-level domain of the underlying host (e.g., muc.example.com for a <xref target='XEP-0045'/> service associated with the im.example.com XMPP service).  If an entity from a remote domain wishes to use such additional services, it would generate an appropriate XML stanza and the remote domain itself would attempt to resolve the service's hostname via an SRV lookup on resource records such as "_xmpp-server._tcp.conference.example.net." or "_xmpp-server._tcp.muc.example.com.".  Therefore if a service wishes to enable entities from remote domains to access these additional services, it needs to advertise the appropriate "_xmpp-server" SRV records in addition to the "_xmpp-server" record for its main XMPP service.</t></list></t>
    </section>
    <section title="Client-to-Server Communication" anchor="tcp-c2s">
      <t>A client is subordinate to a server.  As a result, a client authenticates to the server but the server does not necessarily authenticate to the client.  Therefore the server MUST allow the client to share a single, bidirectional TCP connection for XML stanzas sent from client to server and from server to client (i.e., the inital stream and response stream as specified under <xref target='streams'/>).</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Server-to-Server Communication" anchor="tcp-s2s">
      <t>Any two given servers are peers.  As a result, each peer MUST authenticate with the other.  This can be accomplished in one of two ways:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Through one-way authentication on two, unidirectional TCP connections: one for XML stanzas sent from the first server to the second server and another, initiated by the second server, for XML stanzas from the second server to the first server (this is the "legacy" approach in the absence of mutual authentication).</t>
          <t>Through mutual authentication on a single, bidirectional TCP connection (this is possible using TLS and SASL with certificates, however methods for explicitly signalling the use of a single, bidirectional TCP connection are out of scope for this specification).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>This rule applies only to <xref target='stanzas'>XML stanzas</xref>.  Therefore during <xref target='tls'>STARTTLS negotiation</xref> and <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref> the servers would use one TCP connection, but after stream setup that TCP connection would be used only for the initiating server to send XML stanzas to the receiving server.  In order for the receiving server to send XML stanzas to the initiating server, the receiving server would need to reverse the roles and negotiate an XML stream from the receiving server to the initiating server.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Reconnection" anchor="tcp-reconnect">
      <t>It can happen that an XMPP server goes offline while servicing TCP connections from local clients and from other servers.  Because the number of such connections can be quite large, the reconnection algorithm employed by entities that seek to reconnect can have a significant impact on software and network performance.  The following guidelines are RECOMMENDED:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>The time to live (TTL) specified in Domain Name System records MUST be honored, even if DNS results are cached; if the TTL has not expired, an entity that seeks to reconnect MUST NOT re-resolve the server hostname before reconnecting.</t>
          <t>The time that expires before an entity first seeks to reconnect MUST be randomized (e.g., so that all clients do not attempt to reconnect exactly 30 seconds after being disconnected).</t>
          <t>If the first reconnection attempt does not succeed, an entity MUST back off increasingly on the time between subsequent reconnection attempts, e.g. in accordance with the exponential backoff principle.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: Because it is possible that a disconnected entity cannot determine the cause of disconnection (e.g., because there was no explicit stream error) or does not need a new stream for immediate communication (e.g., because the stream was idle and therefore timed out), it SHOULD NOT assume that is needs to reconnect immediately.</t></list></t>
    </section>
    <section title="Reliability" anchor="streams-reliability">
      <t>The use of long-lived TCP connections in XMPP implies that the sending of XML stanzas over XML streams can be unreliable, since the parties to a long-lived TCP connection might not discover a connectivity disruption in a timely manner.  At the XMPP application layer, long connectivity disruptions can result in undelivered stanzas.  Although the core XMPP technology defined in this specification does not contain features to overcome this lack of reliability, there exist XMPP extensions for doing so (e.g., <xref target='XEP-0198'/>).</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Other Bindings" anchor="tcp-other">
      <t>There is no necessary coupling of an XML stream to a TCP connection.  For example, two entities could connect to each other via another transport, such as <xref target="HTTP"/> as specified in <xref target="XEP-0124"/> and <xref target='XEP-0206'/>.  Although this specification neither encourages nor discourages other bindings, it defines only a binding of XMPP to TCP.</t>

    <section title="Overview" anchor="streams-overview">
      <t>Two fundamental concepts make possible the rapid, asynchronous exchange of relatively small payloads of structured information between presence-aware entities: XML streams and XML stanzas.  These terms are defined as follows.</t>

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Definition of XML Stream:"><iref item='XML Stream'/>An XML STREAM is a container for the exchange of XML elements between any two entities over a network.  The start of an XML stream is denoted unambiguously by an opening STREAM HEADER (i.e., an XML &lt;stream&gt; tag with appropriate attributes and namespace declarations), while the end of the XML stream is denoted unambiguously by a closing XML &lt;/stream&gt; tag.  During the life of the stream, the entity that initiated it can send an unbounded number of XML elements over the stream, either elements used to negotiate the stream (e.g., to complete <xref target='tls'>TLS negotiation</xref> or <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref>) or XML stanzas.  <iref item='Initial Stream'/>The INITIAL STREAM is negotiated from the initiating entity (typically a client or server) to the receiving entity (typically a server), and can be seen as corresponding to the initiating entity's "connection" or "session" with the receiving entity.  <iref item='Response Stream'/>The initial stream enables unidirectional communication from the initiating entity to the receiving entity; in order to enable information exchange from the receiving entity to the initiating entity, the receiving entity MUST negotiate a stream in the opposite direction (the RESPONSE STREAM).</t>
          <t hangText="Definition of XML Stanza:"><iref item='XML Stanza'/>An XML STANZA is a discrete semantic unit of structured information that is sent from one entity to another over an XML stream, and is the basic unit of meaning in XMPP.  An XML stanza exists at the direct child level of the root &lt;stream/&gt; element; the start of any XML stanza is denoted unambiguously by the element start tag at depth=1 of the XML stream (e.g., &lt;presence&gt;), and the end of any XML stanza is denoted unambiguously by the corresponding close tag at depth=1 (e.g., &lt;/presence&gt;).  The only XML stanzas defined herein are the &lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt; elements qualified by the default namespace for the stream, as described under <xref target="stanzas"/>; for example, an XML element sent for the purpose of <xref target='tls'>TLS negotiation</xref> or <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref> is not considered to be an XML stanza, nor is a stream error or a stream feature.  An XML stanza MAY contain child elements (with accompanying attributes, elements, and XML character data) as necessary in order to convey the desired information, which MAY be qualified by any XML namespace (see <xref target='XML-NAMES'/> as well as <xref target='stanzas-extended'/> herein).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Consider the example of a client's connection to a server.  In order to connect to a server, a client initiates an XML stream by sending a stream header to the server, optionally preceded by a text declaration specifying the XML version and the character encoding supported (see <xref target="xml-declaration"/> and <xref target="xml-encoding"/>).  Subject to local policies and service provisioning, the server then replies with a second XML stream back to the client, again optionally preceded by a text declaration.  Once the client has completed <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref> and <xref target='bind'>resource binding</xref>, the client can send an unbounded number of XML stanzas over the stream.  When the client desires to close the stream, it simply sends a closing &lt;/stream&gt; tag to the server  as further described under <xref target='streams-close'/>.</t>
      <t>In essence, then, an XML stream acts as an envelope for all the XML stanzas sent during a connection.  We can represent this in a simplistic fashion as follows.</t>

      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: Those who are accustomed to thinking of XML in a document-centric manner might view a client's connection to a server as consisting of two open-ended XML documents: one from the client to the server and one from the server to the client.  On this analogy, the two XML streams can be considered equivalent to two "documents" (matching production [1] content of <xref target='XML'/>) that are built up through the accumulation of XML stanzas, the root &lt;stream/&gt; element can be considered equivalent to the "document entity" for each "document" (as described in Section 4.8 of <xref target='XML'/>), and the XML stanzas sent over the streams can be considered equivalent to "fragments" of the "documents" as described in <xref target='XML-FRAG'/>.  However, this perspective is merely an analogy; XMPP does not deal in documents and fragments but in streams and stanzas.</t></list></t>

    <section title="Stream Negotiation" anchor="streams-negotiation">
      <section title="Overview" anchor="streams-negotiation-overview">
        <t>Because the receiving entity for a stream acts as a gatekeeper to the domains it services, it imposes certain conditions for connecting as a client or as a peer server.  At a minimum, the initiating entity needs to authenticate with the receiving entity before it is allowed to send stanzas to the receiving entity, typically using SASL as described under <xref target='sasl'/>.  However, the receiving entity can consider conditions other than authentication to be mandatory, such as encryption using TLS as described under <xref target='tls'/>.  The receiving entity informs the initiating entity about such conditions by communicating STREAM FEATURES: the set of particular protocol interactions that are mandatory for the initiating entity to complete before the receiving entity will accept XML stanzas from the initiating entity (e.g., authentication), as well as any protocol interactions that are voluntary but that might improve the handling of an XML stream (e.g., establishment of application-layer compression).</t>
        <t>The existence of conditions for connecting implies that streams need to be negotiated.  The order of layers (TCP, then TLS, then SASL, then XMPP; see <xref target='security-layers'/>) implies that stream negotiation is a multi-stage process.  Further structure is imposed by two factors: (1) a given stream feature might be made available only to certain entities or only after certain other features have been negotiated (e.g., resource binding is made available only after SASL authentication), and (2) stream features can be either mandatory-to-negotiate or voluntary-to-negotiate.  Finally, for security reasons the parties to a stream need to discard knowledge that they gained during the negotiation process after successfully completing the protocol interactions defined for certain features (e.g., TLS in all cases and SASL in the case when a security layer might be established); this is done by flushing the old stream context and exchanging new stream headers over the existing TCP connection.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Stream Features Format" anchor="streams-negotiation-features">
        <t>If the initiating entity includes the 'version' attribute set to a value of at least "1.0" in the initial stream header, after sending the response stream header the receiving entity MUST send a &lt;features/&gt; child element (prefixed by the streams namespace prefix) to the initiating entity in order to announce any conditions for continuation of the stream negotiation process.  Each condition takes the form of a child element of the &lt;features/&gt; element, qualified by a namespace that is different from the streams namespace and the default namespace.</t>
        <t>If a particular stream feature is or can be mandatory-to-negotiate, the definition of that feature needs to either declare that the feature is always mandatory-to-negotiate (e.g., this is true of resource binding for XMPP clients) or specify a way for the receiving entity to flag the feature as mandatory-to-negotiate for this interaction (e.g., this is done for TLS by including an empty &lt;required/&gt; element in the advertisement for that stream feature).</t>
        <t>For security reasons, certain stream features necessitate the initiating entity to send a new initial stream header upon successful negotiation of the feature (e.g., TLS in all cases and SASL in the case when a security layer might be established).  If this is true of a given stream feature, the definition of that feature needs to declare that a stream restart is expected after negotiation of the feature.</t>
        <t>A &lt;features/&gt; element that contains at least one mandatory feature indicates that the stream negotiation is not complete and that the initiating entity MUST negotiate further features.</t>

        <t>A &lt;features/&gt; element MAY contain more than one mandatory feature.  This means that the initiating entity can choose among the mandatory features.  For example, perhaps a future technology will perform roughly the same function as TLS, so the receiving entity might advertise support for both TLS and the future technology.</t>
        <t>A &lt;features/&gt; element that contains only voluntary features indicates that the stream negotiation is complete and that the initiating entity is cleared to send XML stanzas, but that the initiating entity MAY negotiate further features if desired.</t>

      <section title="Restarts" anchor="streams-negotiation-restart">
        <t>On successful negotiation of a feature that necessitates a stream restart, both parties MUST consider the previous stream to be replaced but MUST NOT terminate the underlying TCP connection; instead, the parties MUST reuse the existing connection, which might be in a new state (e.g., encrypted as a result of TLS negotiation).  The initiating entity then MUST send a new initial stream header, which SHOULD be preceded by an XML declaration as described under <xref target='xml-declaration'/>.  When the receiving entity receives the new initial stream header, it MUST generate a new stream ID (instead of re-using the old stream ID) before sending a new response stream header (which SHOULD be preceded by an XML declaration as described under <xref target='xml-declaration'/>).</t>
        <t>For the sake of backward compatibility, the receiving entity MUST accept stream restarts at any stage in the stream negotiation process even if the receiving entity has not indicated that a stream restart is mandatory at that stage.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Resending Features" anchor="streams-negotiation-resend">
        <t>After completing negotiation of any stream feature (even stream features that do not necessitate a stream restart), the receiving entity MUST send an updated list of stream features to the initiating entity, where the list MAY be empty if there are no further features to be advertised.</t>
        <t>At any time after stream establishment and before closing of the stream, the receiving entity MAY send additional or modified stream feature advertisements to the initiating entity (e.g., because a new feature has been enabled).</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Completion of Stream Negotiation" anchor="streams-negotiation-complete">
        <t>The receiving entity indicates completion of the stream negotiation process by sending to the initiating entity either an empty &lt;features/&gt; element or a &lt;features/&gt; element that contains only voluntary features.  After doing so, the receiving entity MUST NOT send additional stream features to the initiating entity (if the receiving entity has new features to offer, it can simply close the stream using a &lt;reset/&gt; stream error and then advertise the new features when the initiating entity reconnects, preferably closing existing streams in a staggered way so that not all of the initiating entities reconnect at once).  Once stream negotiation is complete, the initiating entity is cleared to send XML stanzas over the stream for as long as the stream is maintained by both parties.</t>
        <t>The initiating entity MUST NOT attempt to send <xref target="stanzas">XML stanzas</xref> to entities other than itself (i.e., the client's connected resource or any other authenticated resource of the client's account) or the server until stream negotiation has been completed.  However, if it does attempt to do so, the receiving entity MUST NOT accept such stanzas and MUST return a &lt;not-authorized/&gt; stream error.  This rule applies to XML stanzas only (i.e., &lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt; elements qualified by the default namespace) and not to XML elements used for stream negotiation (e.g., elements used to complete <xref target='tls'>TLS negotiation</xref> or <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref>).</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Determination of Addresses" anchor="streams-negotiation-address">
        <t>After the parties to an XML stream have completed the appropriate aspects of stream negotiation (typically <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref> and, if appropriate, <xref target="bind">resource binding</xref>) the receiving entity for a stream MUST determine the initiating entity's JID.</t>
        <t>For server-to-server communication, the initiating server's JID MUST be the authorization identity (as defined by <xref target="SASL"/>), either (1) as directly communicated by the initiating server during <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref> or (2) as derived by the receiving server from the authentication identity if no authorization identity was specified during <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref>.  In the absence of SASL negotiation (e.g., when the older server dialback protocol is used as specified in <xref target='XEP-0220'/>), the receiving server MAY consider the authentication identity to be the 'from' address on the initial stream header (preferably only the stream header sent after TLS negotiation, because otherwise the 'from' address can be spoofed).</t>
        <t>For client-to-server communication, the client's bare JID (&lt;localpart@domain&gt;) MUST be the authorization identity (as defined by <xref target="SASL"/>), either (1) as directly communicated by the client during <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref> or (2) as derived by the server from the authentication identity if no authorization identity was specified during <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref>.  The resourcepart of the full JID (&lt;localpart@domain/resource&gt;) MUST be the resource negotiated by the client and server during <xref target="bind">resource binding</xref>.</t>
        <t>The receiving entity MUST ensure that the resulting JID (including localpart, domainpart, resourcepart, and separator characters) conforms to the canonical format for XMPP addresses defined in <xref target='XMPP-ADDR'/>; to meet this restriction, the receiving entity MAY replace the JID sent by the initiating entity with the canonicalized JID as determined by the receiving entity.</t>

      <section title="Handling of Idle Streams" anchor="streams-close-idle">
        <t>An XML stream can become idle, i.e., neither entity has sent XMPP traffic over the stream for some period of time.  The idle timeout period is a matter of implementation and local service policy;  however, it is RECOMMENDED to be liberal in accepting idle streams, since experience has shown that doing so improves the reliability of communications over XMPP networks.  In particular, it is typically more efficient to maintain a stream between two servers than it is to aggressively timeout such a stream, especially with regard to synchronization of presence information as described in <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>; therefore it is RECOMMENDED to maintain such a stream since experience has shown that server-to-server streams are cyclical and typically need to be re-established every 24 to 48 hours if they are timed out.</t> 
        <t>An XML stream can appear idle at the XMPP level because the underlying TCP connection has become idle (e.g., a client's network connection has been lost).  One common method for preventing a TCP connection from going idle or for detecting an idle TCP connection is to send a space character (U+0020) over the TCP connection between XML stanzas, which is allowed for XML streams as described under <xref target='xml-whitespace'/>; <iref item='Whitespace Keepalive'/>the sending of such a space character is properly called a WHITESPACE KEEPALIVE (although the term "whitespace ping" is often used, in fact it is not a ping since no "pong" is possible).  Other connection-testing methods include the application-level pings described in <xref target="XEP-0199"/> and the more comprehensive stream management protocol described in <xref target="XEP-0198"/>.  Implementers are advised to support whichever connection-testing methods they deem appropriate, but to carefully weigh the network impact of such methods against the benefits of discovering idle streams in a timely manner.  The length of time between the use of any particular connection test is a matter of implementation and local service policy; however, it is RECOMMENDED that any such test be performed not more than once every 60 seconds.</t>
        <t>To close an idle stream with a local client or remote server, a server MUST close the stream without error as explained under <xref target="streams-close-withouterror"/>.</t>

        <t>The version of XMPP specified herein is "1.0"; in particular, XMPP 1.0 encapsulates the stream-related protocols as well as the basic semantics of the three defined XML stanza types (&lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;).</t>
        <t>The numbering scheme for XMPP versions is "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;".  The major and minor numbers MUST be treated as separate integers and each number MAY be incremented higher than a single digit.  Thus, "XMPP 2.4" would be a lower version than "XMPP 2.13", which in turn would be lower than "XMPP 12.3".  Leading zeros (e.g., "XMPP 6.01") MUST be ignored by recipients and MUST NOT be sent.</t>
        <t>The major version number will be incremented only if the stream and stanza formats or obligatory actions have changed so dramatically that an older version entity would not be able to interoperate with a newer version entity if it simply ignored the elements and attributes it did not understand and took the actions specified in the older specification.</t>
        <t>The minor version number will be incremented only if significant new capabilities have been added to the core protocol (e.g., a newly defined value of the 'type' attribute for message, presence, or IQ stanzas).  The minor version number MUST be ignored by an entity with a smaller minor version number, but MAY be used for informational purposes by the entity with the larger minor version number (e.g., the entity with the larger minor version number would simply note that its correspondent would not be able to understand that value of the 'type' attribute and therefore would not send it).</t>
        <t>The following rules apply to the generation and handling of the 'version' attribute within stream headers:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>The initiating entity MUST set the value of the 'version' attribute in the initial stream header to the highest version number it supports (e.g., if the highest version number it supports is that defined in this specification, it MUST set the value to "1.0").</t>
            <t>The receiving entity MUST set the value of the 'version' attribute in the response stream header to either the value supplied by the initiating entity or the highest version number supported by the receiving entity, whichever is lower.  The receiving entity MUST perform a numeric comparison on the major and minor version numbers, not a string match on "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;".</t>
            <t>If the version number included in the response stream header is at least one major version lower than the version number included in the initial stream header and newer version entities cannot interoperate with older version entities as described, the initiating entity SHOULD generate an &lt;unsupported-version/&gt; stream error.</t>
            <t>If either entity receives a stream header with no 'version' attribute, the entity MUST consider the version supported by the other entity to be "0.9" and SHOULD NOT include a 'version' attribute in the response stream header.</t>

  <section title="STARTTLS Negotiation" anchor="tls">
    <section title="Overview" anchor="tls-overview">
      <t>XMPP includes a method for securing the stream from tampering and eavesdropping.  This channel encryption method makes use of the Transport Layer Security <xref target="TLS"/> protocol, specifically a "STARTTLS" extension that is modelled after similar extensions for the <xref target="IMAP"/>, <xref target="POP3"/>, and <xref target="ACAP"/> protocols as described in <xref target="USINGTLS"/>.  The XML namespace name for the STARTTLS extension is 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls'.</t>
      <t>Support for STARTTLS is REQUIRED in XMPP client and server implementations.  An administrator of a given deployment MAY necessitate the use of TLS for client-to-server communication, server-to-server communication, or both.  A deployed client SHOULD use TLS to secure its stream with a server prior to attempting the completion of <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref>, and deployed servers SHOULD use TLS between two domains for the purpose of securing server-to-server communication.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Stream Negotiation Rules" anchor="tls-rules">
      <section title="Mandatory-to-Negotiate" anchor="tls-rules-mtn">
        <t>If the receiving entity advertises only the STARTTLS feature or if the receiving entity includes the &lt;required/&gt; child element, the parties MUST consider TLS as mandatory-to-negotiate.  If TLS is mandatory-to-negotiate, the receiving entity SHOULD NOT advertise support for any stream feature except STARTTLS during the initial stage of the stream negotiation process, because further stream features might depend on prior negotiation of TLS given the order of layers in XMPP (e.g., the particular SASL mechanisms offered by the receiving entity will likely depend on whether TLS has been negotiated).</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Restart" anchor="tls-rules-restart">
        <t>After TLS negotiation, the parties MUST restart the stream.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Data Formatting" anchor="tls-rules-data">
        <t>During STARTTLS negotiation, the entities MUST NOT send any whitespace as separators between XML elements (i.e., from the last character of the &lt;starttls/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls' namespace at depth=1 of the stream as sent by the initiating entity until the last character of the &lt;proceed/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls' namespace at depth=1 of the stream as sent by the receiving entity).  This prohibition helps to ensure proper security layer byte precision.  Any such whitespace shown in the STARTTLS examples provided in this document is included only for the sake of readability.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Order of Negotiation" anchor="tls-rules-order">
        <t>If the initiating entity chooses to use TLS, STARTTLS negotiation MUST be completed before proceeding to <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref>; this order of negotiation is necessary to help safeguard authentication information sent during SASL negotiation, as well as to make it possible to base the use of the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism on a certificate (or other credentials) provided during prior TLS negotiation.</t>

  <section title="SASL Negotiation" anchor="sasl">
    <section title="Overview" anchor="sasl-overview">
      <t>XMPP includes a method for authenticating a stream by means of an XMPP-specific profile of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer protocol (see <xref target="SASL"/>).  SASL provides a generalized method for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols, and XMPP uses an XML namespace profile of SASL that conforms to the profiling requirements of <xref target="SASL"/>.</t>
      <t>Support for SASL negotiation is REQUIRED in XMPP client and server implementations.</t>

    <section title="Stream Negotiation Rules" anchor="sasl-rules">
      <section title="Mandatory-to-Negotiate" anchor="sasl-rules-mtn">
        <t>The parties to a stream MUST consider SASL as mandatory-to-negotiate.</t>

        <t>After SASL negotiation, the parties MUST restart the stream.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Mechanism Preferences" anchor="sasl-rules-preferences">
        <t>Any entity that will act as a SASL client or a SASL server MUST maintain an ordered list of its preferred SASL mechanisms according to the client or server, where the list is ordered by the perceived strength of the mechanisms.  A server MUST offer and a client MUST try SASL mechanisms in the order of their perceived strength.  For example, if the server offers the ordered list "PLAIN DIGEST-MD5 GSSAPI" or "DIGEST-MD5 GSSAPI PLAIN" but the client's ordered list is "GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5", the client MUST try GSSAPI first and then DIGEST-MD5 but MUST never try PLAIN (since PLAIN is not on its list).</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Mechanism Offers" anchor="sasl-rules-offers">
        <t>If the receiving entity considers <xref target='tls'>TLS negotiation</xref> to be mandatory before use of a particular SASL authentication mechanism will be acceptable, the receiving entity MUST NOT advertise that mechanism in its list of available SASL authentication mechanisms prior to successful TLS negotiation.</t>
        <t>If during prior TLS negotiation the initiating entity presented a certificate that is acceptable to the receiving entity for purposes of strong identity verification in accordance with local service policies, the receiving entity MUST offer the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism to the initiating entity during SASL negotiation (refer to <xref target="SASL"/>) and SHOULD prefer that mechanism to enable mutual authentication.  However, the EXTERNAL mechanism MAY be offered under other circumstances as well.</t>
        <t>See <xref target="security-mandatory"/> regarding mechanisms that MUST be supported; naturally, other SASL mechanisms MAY be supported as well.  Best practices for the use of several SASL mechanisms in the context of XMPP are described in <xref target='XEP-0175'/> and <xref target='XEP-0178'/>.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Data Formatting" anchor="sasl-rules-data">
        <t>The following data formattting rules apply to the SASL negotiation:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>During SASL negotiation, the entities MUST NOT send any whitespace as separators between XML elements (i.e., from the last character of the &lt;auth/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl' namespace at depth=1 of the stream as sent by the initiating entity until the last character of the &lt;success/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl' namespace at depth=1 of the stream as sent by the receiving entity).  This prohibition helps to ensure proper security layer byte precision.  Any such whitespace shown in the SASL examples provided in this document is included only for the sake of readability.</t>
            <t>Any XML character data contained within the XML elements MUST be encoded using base64, where the encoding adheres to the definition in Section 4 of <xref target="BASE64"/> and where the padding bits are set to zero.</t>
            <t>As formally specified in the XML schema for the 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl' namespace under <xref target='schemas-sasl'/>, the receiving entity MAY include one or more application-specific child elements inside the &lt;mechanisms/&gt; element to provide information that might be needed by the initiating entity in order to complete successful SASL negotiation using one or more of the offered mechanisms; however, the syntax and semantics of all such elements are out of scope for this specification.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Security Layers" anchor="sasl-rules-layers">
        <t>Upon successful SASL negotiation that involves negotiation of a security layer, both the initiating entity and the receiving MUST discard any application-layer state (i.e, state from the XMPP layer, excluding state from the TLS negotiation or SASL negotiation).</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Simple Username" anchor="sasl-rules-username">
        <t>Some SASL mechanisms have the concept of a "simple username" (e.g., CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and SCRAM).  The exact form of the simple username in any particular mechanism is a local matter, and a simple username does not necessarily map to an application identifier such as a JID or a JID component.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Authorization Identity" anchor="sasl-rules-authzid">
        <t>An authorization identity is an optional identity specified by the initiating entity, which is typically used by an administrator to perform some management task on behalf of another user.  If the initiating entity wishes to act on behalf of another entity and the selected SASL mechanism supports transmission of an authorization identity, the initiating entity MUST provide an authorization identity during SASL negotiation.  If the initiating entity does not wish to act on behalf of another entity, it MUST NOT provide an authorization identity.  As specified in <xref target="SASL"/>, the initiating entity MUST NOT provide an authorization identity unless the authorization identity is different from the default authorization identity derived from the authentication identity.  If provided, the value of the authorization identity MUST be a bare JID of the form &lt;domain&gt; (i.e., an XMPP domainpart only) for servers and a bare JID of the form &lt;localpart@domain&gt; (i.e., localpart and domainpart) for clients.</t>
        <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: The authorization identity communicated during SASL negotiation is used to determine the canonical address for the initiating client or server according to the receiving server, as described under <xref target='streams-negotiation-address'/>.</t></list></t>
      </section>
      <section title="Realms" anchor="sasl-rules-realms">
        <t>The receiving entity MAY include a realm when negotiating certain SASL mechanisms.  If the receiving entity does not communicate a realm, the initiating entity MUST NOT assume that any realm exists.  The realm MUST be used only for the purpose of authentication; in particular, an initiating entity MUST NOT attempt to derive an XMPP hostname from the realm information provided by the receiving entity.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Round Trips" anchor="sasl-rules-roundtrips">
        <t><xref target='SASL'/> specifies that a using protocol such as XMPP can define two methods by which the protocol can save round trips where allowed for the SASL mechanism:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>When the SASL client (the XMPP "initiating entity") requests an authentication exchange, it can include "initial response" data with its request if appropriate for the SASL mechanism in use.  In XMPP this is done by including the initial response as the XML character data of the &lt;auth/&gt; element.</t>
            <t>At the end of the authentication exchange, the SASL server (the XMPP "receiving entity") can include "additional data with success" if appropriate for the SASL mechanism in use.  In XMPP this is done by including the additional data as the XML character data of the &lt;success/&gt; element.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>For the sake of protocol efficiency, it is RECOMMENDED for XMPP clients and servers to use these methods, however they MUST support the less efficient modes as well.</t>
      </section>

    <section title="Process" anchor="sasl-process">
      <t>The process for SASL negotiation is as follows.</t>
      <section title="Exchange of Stream Headers and Stream Features" anchor="sasl-process-stream">
        <t>If SASL negotiation follows successful <xref target='tls'>STARTTLS negotation</xref>, then the SASL negotiation occurs over the encrypted stream that has already been negotiated.  If not, the initiating entity resolves the hostname of the receiving entity as specified under <xref target='tcp'/>, opens a TCP connection to the advertised port at the resolved IP address, and sends an initial stream header to the receiving entity; if the initiating entity is capable of STARTTLS negotiation, it MUST include the 'version' attribute set to a value of at least "1.0" in the initial stream header.</t>

  <section title="Resource Binding" anchor="bind">
    <section title="Overview" anchor="bind-overview">
      <t>After a client authenticates with a server, it MUST bind a specific resource to the stream so that the server can properly address the client.  That is, there MUST be an XMPP resource associated with the bare JID (&lt;localpart@domain&gt;) of the client, so that the address for use over that stream is a full JID of the form &lt;localpart@domain/resource&gt; (including the resourcepart).  This ensures that the server can deliver XML stanzas to and receive XML stanzas from the client in relation to entities other than the server itself, as explained under <xref target="rules"/> (the client could exchange stanzas with the server itself before binding a resource since the full JID is needed only for addressing outside the context of the stream negotiated between the client and the server, but this is not commonly done).</t>
      <t><iref item='Connected Resource'/>After a client has bound a resource to the stream, it is referred to as a CONNECTED RESOURCE.  A server SHOULD allow an entity to maintain multiple connected resources simultaneously, where each connected resource is associated with a distinct XML stream and differentiated from the other connected resources by a distinct resourcepart; however, a server MUST enable the administrator of an XMPP service to limit the number of connected resources in order to prevent certain denial of service attacks as described under <xref target='security-dos'/>.</t>
      <t>If, before completing the resource binding step, the client attempts to send an XML stanza to an entity other than the client's account or the server, the server MUST NOT process the stanza and MUST either ignore the stanza or return a &lt;not-authorized/&gt; stream error to the client.</t>
      <t>Support for resource binding is REQUIRED in XMPP client and server implementations.</t>

      <t>A resourcepart can be security-critical.  For example, if a malicious entity can guess a client's resourcepart then it might be able to determine if the client (and therefore the controlling principal) is online or offline, thus resulting in a presence leak as described under <xref target='security-leak'/>.  To prevent that possibility, a client can either (1) generate a random resourcepart on its own or (2) ask the server to generate a resourcepart on its behalf, which MUST be random (see <xref target="RANDOM"/>).  When generating a random resourcepart, it is RECOMMENDED that the resourcepart be a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), for which the format specified in <xref target='UUID'/> is RECOMMENDED.</t>

        <t><iref item='Presence Stanza'/>The &lt;presence/&gt; stanza can be seen as a specialized broadcast or "publish-subscribe" mechanism, whereby multiple entities receive information (in this case, network availability information) about an entity to which they have subscribed.  In general, a publishing entity (client) SHOULD send a presence stanza with no 'to' attribute, in which case the server to which the entity is connected SHOULD broadcast that stanza to all subscribed entities.  However, a publishing entity MAY also send a presence stanza with a 'to' attribute, in which case the server SHOULD route or deliver that stanza to the intended recipient.

        <t><iref item='IQ Stanza'/>Info/Query, or IQ, is a request-response mechanism, similar in some ways to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol <xref target="HTTP"/>.  The semantics of IQ enable an entity to make a request of, and receive a response from, another entity.  The data content of the request and response is defined by the schema or other structural definition associated with the XML namespace that qualifies the direct child element of the IQ element (see <xref target='stanzas-extended'/>), and the interaction is tracked by the requesting entity through use of the 'id' attribute.  Thus, IQ interactions follow a common pattern of structured data exchange such as get/result or set/result (although an error can be returned in reply to a request if appropriate):</t>

          <t>If the generated stanza included an 'id' attribute then it is REQUIRED for the error stanza to also include an 'id' attribute, where the value of the 'id' attribute MUST match that of the generated stanza.</t>
          <t>An error stanza MUST contain an &lt;error/&gt; child element.</t>
          <t>An &lt;error/&gt; child MUST NOT be included if the 'type' attribute has a value other than "error" (or if there is no 'type' attribute).</t>

    <section title="Extended Content" anchor="stanzas-extended">
      <t><iref item='Extended Content'/>Although the message, presence, and IQ stanzas provide basic semantics for messaging, availability, and request-response interactions, XMPP uses XML namespaces (see <xref target='XML-NAMES'/> to extend the basic stanza syntax for the purpose of providing additional functionality.</t>
      <t>A message or presence stanza MAY contain one or more optional child elements specifying content that extends the meaning of the message (e.g., an XHTML-formatted version of the message body as described in <xref target="XEP-0071"/>), and an IQ stanza of type "get" or "set" MUST contain one such child element.  Such a child element MAY have any name and MUST possess a namespace declaration (other than "jabber:client", "jabber:server", or "http://etherx.jabber.org/streams") that defines all data contained within the child element.  Such a child element is called an "extension element".  An extension element can be included either at the direct child level of the stanza or in any mix of levels.</t>
      <t>Similarly, "extension attributes" are allowed.  That is: a stanza itself (i.e., the &lt;iq/&gt;, &lt;message/&gt;, and &lt;presence/&gt; elements qualified by the "jabber:client" or "jabber:server" namespace declared as the default namespace for the stream) and any child element of such a stanza (whether a child element qualifed by the default namespace or an extension element) MAY also include one or more attributes that are qualified by XML namespaces that are different from the default namespace or the reserved "xml" prefix (including the "empty namespace" if the attribute is not prefixed).  For the sake of backward compatibility and maximum interoperability, an entity that generates a stanza SHOULD NOT include such attributes in the stanza itself or in child elements of the stanza that are qualified by the default namespace (e.g., the message &lt;body/&gt; element).</t>
      <t>An extension element or extension attribute is said to be EXTENDED CONTENT and the namespace name for such an element or attribute is said to be an EXTENDED NAMESPACE.</t>
      <t>To illustrate these concepts, several examples follow.</t>
      <t>The following stanza contains one direct child element whose extended namespace is 'jabber:iq:roster':</t>

      <t>The following stanza contains two child elements, one of which is qualified by the default namespace and one of which is qualified by an extended namespace; the extension element in turn contains a child elememnt that is qualified by a different extended namespace.</t>

      <t>It is conventional in the XMPP community for implementations to not generate namespace prefixes for elements that are qualified by extended namespaces.  However, if an implementation generates such namespace prefixes then it MUST include the namespace declaration in the stanza itself or a child element of the stanza, not in the stream header (see <xref target='streams-ns-other'/>).</t>
      <t>Routing entities (typically servers) SHOULD try to maintain prefixes when serializing XML stanzas for processing, but receiving entities MUST NOT rely on the prefix strings having any particular value.</t>
      <t>Support for any given extended namespace is OPTIONAL on the part of any implementation.  If an entity does not understand such a namespace, the entity's expected behavior depends on whether the entity is (1) the recipient or (2) an entity that is routing the stanza to the recipient.</t>
      <t><list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Recipient:">If a recipient receives a stanza that contains an element or attribute it does not understand, it MUST silently ignore that particular XML data, i.e., it MUST NOT process it or present it to a user or associated application (if any).  In particular:

            <t>If an entity receives a message or presence stanza that contains XML data qualified by a namespace it does not understand, the portion of the stanza that qualified by the unknown namespace MUST be ignored.</t>
            <t>If an entity receives a message stanza whose only child element is qualified by a namespace it does not understand, it MUST ignore the entire stanza.</t>
            <t>If an entity receives an IQ stanza of type "get" or "set" containing a child element qualified by a namespace it does not understand, the entity MUST return an IQ stanza of type "error" with an error condition of &lt;service-unavailable/&gt;.</t>

    <section title="Stanza Size" anchor="stanza-size">
      <t>XMPP is optimized for the exchange of relatively large numbers of relatively small stanzas.  A client or server MAY enforce a maximum stanza size.  The maximum stanza size MUST NOT be smaller than 10000 bytes, from the opening "&lt;" character to the closing "&gt;" character.  If an entity receives a stanza that exceeds its maximum stanza size, it MUST return a &lt;not-acceptable/&gt; stanza error or a &lt;policy-violation/&gt; stream error.</t>

  <section title="Server Rules for Processing XML Stanzas" anchor="rules">
    <t>An XMPP server MUST ensure in-order processing of XML stanzas between any two entities.  This includes stanzas sent by a client to its server for direct processing by the server (e.g., in-order processing of a roster get and initial presence as described in <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>).</t>
    <t>Beyond the requirement for in-order processing, each server implementation will contain its own logic for processing stanzas it receives.  Such logic determines whether the server needs to ROUTE a given stanza to another domain, DELIVER it to a local entity (typically a connected client associated with a local account), or HANDLE it directly within the server itself.  The following rules apply.</t>
    <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: Particular XMPP applications MAY specify delivery rules that modify or supplement the following rules; for example, a set of delivery rules for instant messaging and presence applications is defined in <xref target="XMPP-IM"/>.</t></list></t>
    <section title="No 'to' Address" anchor="rules-noto">
      <section title="Overview" anchor="rules-noto-overview">
        <t>If the stanza possesses no 'to' attribute, the server MUST handle it directly on behalf of the entity that sent it, where the meaning of "handle it directly" depends on whether the stanza is message, presence, or IQ.  Because all stanzas received from other servers MUST possess a 'to' attribute, this rule applies only to stanzas received from a local entity (such as a client) that is connected to the server.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Message" anchor="rules-noto-message">
        <t>If the server receives a message stanza with no 'to' attribute, it MUST treat the message as if the 'to' address were the bare JID &lt;localpart@domain&gt; of the sending entity.</t>

            <t>If the IQ stanza is of type "get" or "set" and the server understands the namespace that qualifies the payload, the server MUST handle the stanza on behalf of the sending entity or return an appropriate error to the sending entity.  While the meaning of "handle" is determined by the semantics of the qualifying namespace, in general the server will respond to the IQ stanza of type "get" or "set" by returning an appropriate IQ stanza of type "result" or "error", responding as if the server were the bare JID of the sending entity.  As an example, if the sending entity sends an IQ stanza of type "get" where the payload is qualified by the 'jabber:iq:roster' namespace (as described in <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>), then the server will return the roster associated with the sending entity's bare JID to the particular resource of the sending entity that requested the roster.</t>
            <t>If the IQ stanza is of type "get" or "set" and the server does not understand the namespace that qualifies the payload, the server MUST return an error to the sending entity, which MUST be &lt;service-unavailable/&gt;.</t>

  <section title="XML Usage" anchor="xml">
    <section title="Restrictions" anchor="xml-restrictions">
      <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) defines a class of data objects called XML streams as well as the behavior of computer programs that process XML streams.  XMPP is an application profile or restricted form of the Extensible Markup Language <xref target='XML'/>, and a complete XML stream (including start and end stream tags) is a conforming XML document.</t>
      <t>However, XMPP does not deal with XML documents but with XML streams.  Because XMPP does not require the parsing of arbitrary and complete XML documents, there is no requirement that XMPP needs to support the full feature set of <xref target="XML"/>.  In particular, the following features of XML are prohibited in XMPP:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>comments (as defined in Section 2.5 of <xref target="XML"/>)</t>
          <t>processing instructions (Section 2.6 therein)</t>
          <t>internal or external DTD subsets (Section 2.8 therein)</t>

        </list>
      </t>
      <t>An XMPP implementation MUST behave as follows with regard to these features:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>An XMPP implementation MUST NOT inject characters matching such features into an XML stream.</t>
          <t>If an XMPP implementation receives characters matching such features over an XML stream, it MUST return a stream error, which SHOULD be &lt;restricted-xml/&gt; but MAY be &lt;bad-format/&gt;.</t>

    <section title="XML Namespace Names and Prefixes" anchor="xml-ns">
      <t>XML namespaces (see <xref target="XML-NAMES"/>) are used within XMPP streams to create strict boundaries of data ownership.  The basic function of namespaces is to separate different vocabularies of XML elements that are structurally mixed together.  Ensuring that XMPP streams are namespace-aware enables any allowable XML to be structurally mixed with any data element within XMPP.  XMPP-specific rules for XML namespace names and prefixes are defined under <xref target='streams-ns'/> for XML streams and <xref target='stanzas-extended'/> for XML stanzas.</t>

      <t>An XMPP entity MUST NOT generate data that is not namespace-well-formed.  An XMPP server MUST NOT route or deliver data that is not namespace-well-formed, and MUST return a stanza error of &lt;not-acceptable/&gt; or a stream error of &lt;xml-not-well-formed/&gt; in response to the receipt of such data.</t>

      <t>A server is not responsible for ensuring that XML data delivered to a client or routed to another server is valid, in accordance with the definition of "valid" provided in Section 2.8 of <xref target='XML'/>.  An implementation MAY choose to accept or provide only validated data, but such behavior is OPTIONAL.  A client SHOULD NOT rely on the ability to send data that does not conform to the schemas, and SHOULD ignore any non-conformant elements or attributes on the incoming XML stream.</t>

    <section title="Inclusion of XML Declaration" anchor="xml-declaration">
      <t>Before sending a stream header, an implementation SHOULD send an XML declaration (matching production [23] content of <xref target='XML'/>).

Implementations MUST NOT attempt to use any other encoding.  If one party to an XML stream detects that the other party has attempted to send XML data with an encoding other than UTF-8, it MUST return a stream error, which SHOULD be &lt;unsupported-encoding/&gt; but MAY be &lt;bad-format/&gt;.</t>
      <t>Note: Because it is mandatory for an XMPP implementation to support all and only the UTF-8 encoding and because UTF-8 always has the same byte order, an implementation MUST NOT send a byte order mark ("BOM") at the beginning of the data stream.  If an entity receives the Unicode character U+FEFF anywhere in an XML stream (including as the first character of the stream), it MUST interpret that character as a zero width no-break space, not as a byte order mark.</t>

See <xref target="security-certificates"/> regarding certificate validation procedures.</t>
      <t>Implementations MUST support high security.  Service provisioning SHOULD use high security, subject to local security policies.</t>

Instead, if the connecting entity is a user-oriented client then it MUST either (1) automatically terminate the connection with a bad certificate error or (2) show the certificate (including the entire certificate chain) to the user and give the user the choice of terminating the connecting or accepting the certificate temporarily (i.e., for this connection attempt only) or permanently (i.e., for all future connection attempts) and then continuing with the connection; if a user permanently accepts a certificate in this way, the client MUST cache the certificate (or some non-forgeable representation such as a hash value) and in future connection attempts behave as in Sub-Case #3.  (It is the resposibility of the human user to verify the hash value or fingerprint of the certificate with the peer over a trusted communication layer.)  If the connecting entity is an XMPP server or an automated client, the application SHOULD terminate the connection (with a bad certificate error) and log the error to an appropriate audit log; an XMPP server or automated client MAY provide a configuration setting that disables this check, but MUST enable the check by default.</t>

      <t>The SASL protocol for authenticating XML streams (defined under <xref target='sasl'/>) provides a reliable mechanism for validating that a client connecting to a server is who it claims to be.</t>
      <t>Client-to-server communication MUST NOT proceed until the DNS hostname asserted by the server has been resolved as specified under <xref target='tcp'/>.  If there is a mismatch between the hostname to which a client attempted to connect (e.g., "example.net") and the hostname to which the client actually connects (e.g., "x1.example.net"), the client MUST warn a human user about the mismatch and the human user MUST approve the connection before the client proceeds; however, the client MAY also allow the user to add the presented hostname to a configured set of accepted hostnames to expedite future connections.</t>

    <section title="SASL Downgrade Attacks" anchor="security-downgrade">
      <t>Because the initiating entity chooses an acceptable SASL mechanism from the list presented by the receiving entity, the initiating entity depends on the receiving entity's list for authentication.  This dependency introduces the possibility of a downgrade attack if an attacker can gain control of the channel and therefore present a weak list of mechanisms.  To help prevent this attack, the parties SHOULD protect the channel using TLS before attempting SASL negotiation.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Server-to-Server Downgrade Attacks" anchor="security-dialback">
      <t>Before RFC 3920 defined TLS plus SASL EXTERNAL with certificates for encryption and authentication of server-to-server streams, the only method for weak identity verification of a peer server was server dialback as defined in <xref target='XEP-0220'/>.  Even when <xref target='DNSSEC'/> is used, dialback provides only weak identity verification and provides no confidentiality or integrity.  At the time of this writing, server dialback is still the most widely-used technique for some level of assurance over server-to-server streams.  This reality introduces the possibility of a downgrade attack from TLS + SASL EXTERNAL to dialback if an attacker can gain control of the channel and therefore convince the initiating server that the receiving server does not support TLS or does not have an appropriate certificate.  To help prevent this attack, the parties SHOULD protect the channel using TLS before proceeding, even if the presented certificates are self-signed or otherwise untrusted.</t>

    <section title="Lack of SASL Channel Binding to TLS" anchor="security-channel">
      <t>The SASL framework itself does not provide a method for binding SASL authentication to a security layer providing confidentiality and integrity protection that was negotiated at a lower layer.  Such a binding is known as a "channel binding" (see <xref target='CHANNEL'/>).  Some SASL mechanisms provide channel bindings.  However, if a SASL mechanism does not provide a channel binding, then the mechanism cannot provide a way to verify that the source and destination end points to which the lower layer's security is bound are equivalent to the end points that SASL is authenticating; furthermore, if the end points are not identical, then the lower layer's security cannot be trusted to protect data transmitted between the SASL-authenticated entities.  In such a situation, a SASL security layer SHOULD be negotiated that effectively ignores the presence of the lower-layer security.</t>

    <section title="Use of base64 in SASL" anchor="security-base64">
      <t>Both the client and the server MUST verify any base64 data received during <xref target='sasl'>SASL negotiation</xref>.  An implementation MUST reject (not ignore) any characters that are not explicitly allowed by the base64 alphabet; this helps to guard against creation of a covert channel that could be used to "leak" information.</t>
      <t>An implementation MUST NOT break on invalid input and MUST reject any sequence of base64 characters containing the pad ('=') character if that character is included as something other than the last character of the data (e.g., "=AAA" or "BBBB=CCC"); this helps to guard against buffer overflow attacks and other attacks on the implementation.</t>
      <t>While base 64 encoding visually hides otherwise easily recognized information (such as passwords), it does not provide any computational confidentiality.</t>

The victim can be a network server, client or router, a network link or an entire network, an individual Internet user or a company doing business using the Internet, an Internet Service Provider (ISP), country, or any combination of or variant on these.</t>

      <t><xref target='XEP-0205'/> provides a detailed discussion of potential denial of service attacks against XMPP systems and best practices for preventing such attacks.  The recommendations include:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>A server implementation SHOULD enable a server administrator to limit the number of TCP connections that it will accept from a given IP address at any one time.  If an entity attempts to connect but the maximum number of TCP connections has been reached, the receiving server MUST NOT allow the new connection to proceed.</t>
          <t>A server implementation SHOULD enable a server administrator to limit the number of TCP connection attempts that it will accept from a given IP address in a given time period.  (While it is possible to limit the number of connections at the TCP layer rather than at the XMPP application layer, this is not advisable because limits at the TCP layer might result in an inability to access non-XMPP services.)  If an entity attempts to connect but the maximum number of connections has been reached, the receiving server MUST NOT allow the new connection to proceed.</t>
          <t>A server MUST NOT process XML stanzas from clients that have not yet provided appropriate authentication credentials and MUST NOT process XML stanzas from peer servers whose identity it has not either authenticated via SASL or weakly verified via server dialback (see <xref target='XEP-0220'/>).</t>
          <t>A server implementation SHOULD enable a server administrator to limit the number of connected resources it will allow an account to bind at any one time.  If a client attempts to bind a resource but it has already reached the configured number of allowable resources, the receiving server MUST return a &lt;resource-constraint/&gt; stanza error.</t>
          <t>A server implementation SHOULD enable a server administrator to limit the size of stanzas it will accept from a connected client or peer server.  If a connected resource or peer server sends a stanza that violates the upper limit, the receiving server SHOULD NOT process the stanza and instead SHOULD return a &lt;not-allowed/&gt; stanza error.  Alternatively (e.g., if the sender has sent an egregiously large stanza), the server MAY instead return a &lt;policy-violation/&gt; stream error.</t>
          <t>A server implementation SHOULD enable a server administrator to limit the number of XML stanzas that a connected client is allowed to send to distinct recipients within a given time period.  If a connected client sends too many stanzas to distinct recipients in a given time period, the receiving server SHOULD NOT process the stanza and instead SHOULD return an &lt;unexpected-request/&gt; stanza error.</t>
          <t>A server implementation SHOULD enable a server administrator to limit the amount of bandwidth it will allow a connected client or peer server to use in a given time period.</t>
          <t>A server implementation MAY enable a server administrator to limit the types of stanzas (based on the extended content "payload") that it will allow a connected resource or peer server send over an active connection.  Such limits and restrictions are a matter of deployment policy.</t>
          <t>A server implementation MAY refuse to route or deliver any stanza that it considers to be abusive, with or without returning an error to the sender.</t>

    <section title="Presence Leaks" anchor="security-leak">
      <t>One of the core aspects of XMPP is presence: information about the network availability of an XMPP entity (i.e., whether the entity is currently online or offline).  A PRESENCE LEAK occurs when an entity's network availability is inadvertently and involuntarily revealed to a second entity that is not authorized to know the first entity's network availability.</t>
      <t>Although presence is discussed more fully in <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>, it is important to note that an XMPP server MUST NOT leak presence.  In particular at the core XMPP level, real-time addressing and network availability is associated with a specific connected resource; therefore, any disclosure of a connected resource's full JID comprises a presence leak.  To help prevent such a presence leak, a server MUST NOT return different stanza errors if a potential attacker sends XML stanzas to the entity's bare JID (&lt;localpart@domain&gt;) or full JID (&lt;localpart@domain/resource&gt;).</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Directory Harvesting" anchor="security-harvesting">
      <t>When a server generates an error stanza in response to receiving a stanza for a user account that does not exist, the use of the &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; stanza error condition can help protect against dictionary attacks, since this is the same error condition that is returned if, for instance, the namespace of an IQ child element is not understood, or if offline message storage or message forwarding is not enabled for a domain.  However, subtle differences in the exact XML of error stanzas, as well as in the timing with which such errors are returned, can enable an attacker to determine the network presence of a user when more advanced blocking technologies are not used (see for instance <xref target='XEP-0016'/> and <xref target='XEP-0191'/>).</t>

<abstract>
<t>Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space.&lt;/t>&lt;t> Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>&lt;p>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for providing authentication and data security services in connection-oriented protocols via replaceable mechanisms. It provides a structured interface between protocols and mechanisms. The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing mechanisms and allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms. The framework also provides a protocol for securing subsequent protocol exchanges within a data security layer.&lt;/p>&lt;p> This document describes how a SASL mechanism is structured, describes how protocols include support for SASL, and defines the protocol for carrying a data security layer over a connection. In addition, this document defines one SASL mechanism, the EXTERNAL mechanism.&lt;/p>&lt;p> This document obsoletes RFC 2222. [STANDARDS TRACK]&lt;/p></t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text passwords over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS). There are some significant security concerns with that mechanism, which could be addressed by the use of a challenge response authentication mechanism protected by TLS.  Unfortunately, the challenge response mechanisms presently on the standards track all fail to meet requirements necessary for widespread deployment, and have had success only in limited use.  This specification describes a family of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses the security concerns and meets the deployability requirements.  When used in combination with TLS or an equivalent security layer, a mechanism from this family could improve the status-quo for application protocol authentication and provide a suitable choice for a mandatory-to-implement mechanism for future application protocol standards.</t></abstract>

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<t>The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed to support remote storage and access of program option, configuration and preference information.  The data store model is designed to allow a client relatively simple access to interesting data, to allow new information to be easily added without server re-configuration, and to promote the use of both standardized data and custom or proprietary data.  Key features include "inheritance" which can be used to manage default values for configuration settings and access control lists which allow interesting personal information to be shared and group information to be restricted.</t></abstract></front>

<t>On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to various services. Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-text password mechanism using "anonymous" as the user name and using optional trace information, such as an email address, as the password. As plain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.

<t>While the Domain Name System (DNS),is generally used to store predefined types of information (e.g., addresses of hosts), it is possible to use it to store information that has not been previously classified.</t>
<t>This paper describes a simple means to associate arbitrary string information (ASCII text) with attributes that have not been defined by the DNS.  It uses DNS TXT resource records to store the information.  It requires no change to current DNS implementations.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

<t>The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), Version 2, as defined in, provides security services to callers in a generic fashion, supportable with a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing source-level portability of applications to different environments. This specification defines GSS-API services and primitives at a level independent of underlying mechanism and programming language environment, and is to be complemented by other, related specifications:</t>
<t>documents defining specific parameter bindings for particular language environments</t>
<t>documents defining token formats, protocols, and procedures to be implemented in order to realize GSS-API services atop particular security mechanisms</t>
<t>This memo obsoletesmaking specific, incremental changes in response to implementation experience and liaison requests.

<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems.  It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers .  A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990.  This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .

<t>Presence and Instant Messaging have recently emerged as a new medium of communications over the Internet.  Presence is a means for finding, retrieving, and subscribing to changes in the presence information (e.g.  "online" or "offline") of other users.  Instant messaging is a means for sending small, simple messages that are delivered immediately to online users.</t>
<t>Applications of presence and instant messaging currently use independent, non-standard and non-interoperable protocols developed by various vendors.  The goal of the Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol (IMPP) Working Group is to define a standard protocol so that independently developed applications of instant messaging and/or   presence can interoperate across the Internet.  This document defines a minimal set of requirements that IMPP must meet.</t></abstract></front>

<t>&lt;p>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources.&lt;/p>&lt;p> The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs.&lt;/p></t></abstract></front>

    <section title="Contact Addresses" anchor="contact">
      <t>Consistent with <xref target='MAILBOXES'/>, an organization that offers an XMPP service SHOULD provide an Internet mailbox of "XMPP" for inquiries related to that service, where the host portion of the resulting mailto URI MUST be the organization's domain, not the domain of the XMPP service itself (e.g., the XMPP service might be offered at im.example.com but the Internet mailbox would be &lt;xmpp@example.com&gt;).</t>

    <section title="Differences From RFC 3920" anchor="diffs">
      <t>Based on consensus derived from implementation and deployment experience as well as formal interoperability testing, the following substantive modifications were made from RFC 3920.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Moved specification of the XMPP address format to a separate document.</t>
          <t>Recommended or mandated use of the 'from' and 'to' attributes on stream headers.</t>
          <t>More fully specified stream closing handshake.</t>
          <t>Specified recommended stream reconnection algorithm.</t>
          <t>Specified return of &lt;restricted-xml/&gt; stream error in response to receipt of prohibited XML features.</t> 
          <t>Specified that the SASL SCRAM mechanism is a mandatory-to-implement technology.</t>
          <t>Specified that TLS plus the SASL PLAIN mechanism is a mandatory-to-implement technology for client-to-server connections.</t>
          <t>Specified that support for the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism is required for servers but only recommended for clients (since end-user X.509 certificates are difficult to obtain and not yet widely deployed).</t>
          <t>Removed the hard two-connection rule for server-to-server streams if mutual authentication is successful.</t>
          <t>More clearly specified the certificate profile for both public key certificates and issuer certificates.</t>
          <t>Added the &lt;reset/&gt; streams error condition to handle expired/revoked certificates or the addition of security-critical features to an existing stream.</t>
          <t>Added the &lt;account-disabled/&gt;, &lt;credentials-expired/&gt;, &lt;encryption-required/&gt;, &lt;malformed-request/&gt;, and &lt;transition-needed/&gt; SASL error conditions to handle error flows mistakenly left out of RFC 3920 or discussed in RFC 4422 but not in RFC 2222.</t>
          <t>Added the &lt;not-modified/&gt; stanza error condition to enable potential ETags usage.</t>
          <t>Removed unnecessary requirement for escaping of characters that map to certain predefined entities, which do not need to be escaped in XML.</t>
          <t>Clarified the process of DNS SRV lookups and fallbacks.</t>
          <t>Clarified the handling of SASL security layers.</t>
          <t>Clarified the handling of stream features, regularized use of the &lt;required/&gt; child element, and defined use of the &lt;optional/&gt; child element.</t>
          <t>Clarified the handling of data that violates the well-formedness definitions for XML 1.0 and XML namespaces.</t>
          <t>Specified the security considerations in more detail, especially with regard to presence leaks and denial of service attacks.</t>
          <t>Moved historical documentation of the server dialback protocol from this specification to a separate specification maintained by the XMPP Standards Foundation.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In addition, numerous changes of an editorial nature were made in order to more fully specify and clearly explain XMPP.</t>
