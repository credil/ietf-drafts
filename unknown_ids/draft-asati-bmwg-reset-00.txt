Internet-Draft                    Reset                   November 2009

1. Introduction

   A forwarding device may get reset (automatically or manualy) and
   subsequently may experience an outage. It is deemed useful to know
   how long a device would take to recover after such an event.

   However, the answer to this question is no longer simple and
   straight-forward as the modern forwarding devices employ many
   hardware advancements (distributed forwarding etc.) and software
   advancements (graceful restart etc.) that influence the recovery
   time after the reset.

   Additionally, there are other factors that influence the recovery
   time after the reset:

     1. Type of reset - Hardware (line-card crash etc.) vs. Software
        (protocol reset, process crash etc.)

     2. Manual vs. Automatic reset

     3. Local vs. Remote reset

     4. Scale - Number of line cards present vs. in-use

     5. Scale - Number of physical and logical interfaces

     6. Scale - Number of routing protocol instances

   In summary, there are varieties of reset triggers that may produce
   different results depending on the procedures. Hence, clarity and
   consistency in reset procedures (above & beyond what's specified in
   RFC2544) are crucial to derive the meaningful results.

   This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset
   during benchmarking of forwarding devices, and provides clarity and
   consistency in reset procedures beyond what's specified in RFC2544.
   These procedures may be used by other benchmarking documents such as
   RFC2544, RFC5180, RFCmpls etc.

1.1. Scope

   This document focuses on only the reset criterion of benchmarking,
   and presumes that it would be beneficial to RFC2544, RFC5180,
   RFCmpls, and other BMWG benchmarking efforts.

2. Key Words to Reflect Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make
   the intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While
   this document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards
   track document.



3. Reset Test

   This section contains the description of the tests that are related
   to the characterization of DUT's MPLS traffic forwarding. There are
   two types of reset:

     1. Hardware resets

     2. Software resets

   Section 3.1 describes various hardware resets, whereas section 3.2
   describes various software resets.



3.1. Hardware Reset

   To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from the hardware
   reset

3.1.1. RP reset (graceful restart)

   Objective

     .

3.1.2. LC reset

   Objective

     .

3.2. Software Reset

   To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from the software
   reset

3.2.1. Process reset

   Objective

     .

3.2.2. OS reset

3.2.3. Routing protocol reset

   Objective

     .



4. Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities, as described in this memo, are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Furthermore, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis,
   relying solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically
   for benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security
   arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in
   production networks.

   There are no specific security considerations within the scope of
   this document.
