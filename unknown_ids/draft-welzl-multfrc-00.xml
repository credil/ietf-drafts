			<t>This document specifies the MulTFRC congestion control mechanism.
			MulTFRC is derived from TFRC and can be
			implemented by carrying out a few small and simple changes to
			the original mechanism. Its behavior differs
			from TFRC in that it emulates a number of TFRC flows with more
			flexibility than what would be practical or
			even possible using multiple real TFRC flows. Additionally, MulTFRC better
			preserves the original features of TFRC than multiple real TFRCs do.

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				"TCP-friendliness", the requirement for a flow to behave under
				congestion like a flow produced by a conformant TCP (introduced
				by the name of "TCP-compatibility" in <xref target="RFC2309" />),
				has been put into question in recent years (cf. <xref target="Bri07" />).
				As an illustrative example, consider the fact that not all
				data transfers are of equal importance to a user. A user may
				therefore want to assign different priorities to different flows
				between two hosts, but TCP(-friendly) congestion control would
				always let these flows use the same sending rate. Users and
				their applications are already bypassing TCP-friendliness in
				practice: since multiple TCP flows can better saturate
				a bottleneck than a single one, some applications open multiple
				connections as a simple workaround. The <xref target="All03">"GridFTP"</xref>
			protocol explicitly provides this function as a performance improvement.
			</t>

			<t>
				Some research efforts were therefore carried out to develop
				protocols where a weight can directly be applied to the congestion
				control mechanism,
				allowing a flow to be as aggressive as a number of parallel TCP flows at
				the same time. The first, and best
				known, such protocol is <xref target="Cro+98">MulTCP</xref>, which
				emulates N TCPs in a rather simple fashion. Improved versions were
				later published, e.g. <xref target="Hac+04">Stochastic TCP</xref>
				and <xref target="Kuo+08">Probe-Aided (PA-)MulTCP</xref>. These protocols
			could be called "N-TCP-friendly", i.e. as TCP-friendly as N TCPs.
			</t>

			<t>
			MulTFRC, defined in this document, does with <xref target="RFC5348">TFRC</xref> what MulTCP does
			with TCP. In <xref target="Dam+09" />, it was shown that MulTFRC
			achieves its goal of emulating N flows better than MulTCP (and
			improved versions of it) and has a number of other benefits. For
			instance, MulTFRC with N=2 is more
			reactive than two real TFRC flows are, and it has a smoother sending
			rate than two real MulTFRC flows do. Moreover, since it is only one
			mechanism, a protocol that uses MulTFRC can send a single data stream
			with the congestion control behavior of multiple data streams
			without the need to split the data and spread it over separate
			connections. Naturally, N real TFRC flows also have N times the header
			overhead of a MulTFRC flow with the same value of N.
			</t>

			<t>
				The core idea of TFRC is to achieve TCP-friendliness by explicitly
				calculating an equation which approximates the steady-state throughput
				of TCP and sending as much as the calculation says. The core idea of
				MulTFRC is to replace this equation in TFRC with the algorithm
				from <xref target="Dam+08" />, which approximates the steady-state
				throughput of N TCP flows. MulTFRC can be implemented via
				a few simple changes to the TFRC code. It is therefore defined
				here by specifying how it differs from the <xref target="RFC5348">TFRC
				specification</xref>.

		<section title="Specification">
			<t>
			This section lists the changes to <xref target="RFC5348" /> that must be
			applied to turn TFRC into MulTFRC. The small number of
			changes ensures that many original properties of a single TFRC flow are
			preserved, which is often the most appropriate choice (e.g. it
			would probably not make sense for a MulTFRC flow to detect a data-limited
			interval differently than a single TFRC would). It also makes MulTFRC
			easy to understand and implement. Experiments have shown that these
			changes are enough to attain the desired effect.

				The same algorithm is used here for calculating the average loss interval. For the number of lost packets in

				Section 6.3.1 of <xref target="RFC5348" /> discusses how the loss history is initialized 
				after the first loss event. TFRC approximates the rate to be the maximum value of X_recv 
				so far, assuming that a higher rate introduces loss. Therefore j for this rate is 
				approximated by 1 and the number of packets lost in the first interval is set to 1. This is accomplished by the following change.
				The first sentence of the fourth paragraph (in section 6.3.1) is:
				<figure>
					<artwork>
TFRC does this by finding some value, p, for which the throughput
equation in Section 3.1 gives a sending rate within 5% of X_target,
given the round-trip time R, and the first loss interval is then set
to 1/p.

					</artwork>

				<t>
				The second last paragraph in section 6.3.1 ends with:
				<figure>
					<artwork>
Thus, the TFRC receiver calculates the loss interval that would be 
required to produce the target rate X_target of 0.5/R packets per 
second, for the round-trip time R, and uses this synthetic loss 
interval for the first loss interval.  The TFRC receiver uses 0.5/R 
packets per second as the minimum value for X_target when 
initializing the first loss interval.

		<section title="Usage Considerations">
			<t>
			The "weighted fairness" service provided by a protocol
			using MulTFRC is quite different from the service provided
			by traditional Internet transport protocols. This section
			intends to answer some questions that this new service
			may raise.
			</t>

			<section title="Which applications should use MulTFRC?">
				<t>
					Like TFRC, MulTFRC is suitable for applications
					that require a smoother sending rate than standard TCP.
					Since it is likely that these would be
					multimedia applications, TFRC has largely been associated
					with them (and <xref target='RFC5348' />
					mentions "streaming media" as an example). Since timely
					transmission is often more important for them
					than reliability, multimedia applications usually do not
					keep retransmitting
					packets until their successful delivery is ensured.
					Accordingly, TFRC usage was specified for the Datagram
					Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <xref target='RFC4342' />,
				but not for reliable data transfers.
				</t>

				<t>MulTFRC, on the other hand, provides an altogether
				different service. For some applications, a smoother
				sending rate may not be particularly desirable but
				might also not be considered harmful, while the ability
				to emulate the congestion control of N flows may be
				useful for them. This could include reliable transfers
				such as the transmission of files. Possible reasons
				to use MulTFRC for file transfers include the assignment
				of priorities according to user preferences, increased
				efficiency with N > 1, and the implementation of low-priority
				"scavenger" services.
				</t>
				
			</section>

			<section title="Setting N" anchor="sec_setting_n" >
				<t>N MUST be set at the beginning of a transfer; it
				MUST NOT be changed while a transfer is ongoing.
				The effects of changing N during the lifetime of
				a MulTFRC session on the dynamics of the mechanism
				are yet to be investigated; in particular, it is
				unclear how often N could safely be changed, and
				how "safely" should be defined in this context.
				Further research is required to answer these questions.
				</t>
				<t>
					N is a positive floating point number which can also
					take values between 0 and 1, making MulTFRC
					applicable as a mechanism for what has been called a
					"Lower-than-Best-Effort" (LBE) service. Since it does
					not reduce its sending rate early as delay increases
					like some alternative proposals for such a service do
					(e.g. <xref target="Kuz+06">TCP-LP</xref>,
					<xref target="Ven+02">TCP Nice</xref> or
					<xref target="Liu+07">4CP</xref>), it can probably
				be expected to
				be more aggressive than these mechanisms if they share
				a bottleneck at the same time. This also means that
				MulTFRC is less likely to be prone to starvation.
				</t>

				<t>Setting N to 1 is also possible. In this case, the
				only difference between TFRC and MulTFRC is that the
				underlying model of TFRC assumes that all remaining
				packets following a dropped packet in a "round"
				(less than one round-trip time apart) are
				also dropped, whereas the underlying model of MulTFRC
				does not have this assumption. Whether it
				is correct or not depends on the specific network
				situation; large windows and other queuing schemes
				than Drop-Tail make it less likely for
				the assumption to match reality. This document does
				not make any recommendation about which mechanism
				to use if only one flow is desired.
				</t>
				
				<t>
				Since TCP has been extensively studied, and the aggression
				of its congestion control mechanism is emulated by TFRC,
				we can look at the behavior of a TCP aggregate in order
				to find a reasonable upper limit for N in MulTFRC.
				From <xref target="Alt+06" />, N TCPs (assuming
				non-sychronized loss events over connections) can saturate
				a bottleneck link by roughly 100-100/(1+3N) percent. This means
				that a single flow can only achieve 75% utilization, whereas
				3 flows already achieve 90%. The theoretical gain that can
				be achieved by adding a flow declines with the total number
				of flows - e.g., while going from 1 to 2 flows is a 14.3%
				performance gain, the gain becomes less than 1% beyond 6 flows
				(which already achieve 95% link utilization). Since the
				link utilization of MulTFRC can be expected to be roughly
				the same as the link utilization of multiple TCPs, the
				approximation above also holds for MulTFRC. Thus,
				setting N to a much larger value than the values mentioned
				above will only yield a marginal benefit in isolation but
				can significantly affect other traffic. Therefore, the
				maximum value that a user can set for MulTFRC SHOULD NOT
				exceed 6.
				</t>


			</section>


		</section>


		<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
				<t>
It is well known that a single uncontrolled UDP flow
can cause significant harm to a large number of TCP flows
that share the same bottleneck. This potential danger
is due to the total lack of congestion control.
Because this problem is well known, and because UDP is easy
to detect, UDP traffic will often be rate limited by
service providers.
</t>

<t>
	If MulTFRC is used within a protocol such as DCCP,
which will normally not be considered harmful and
will therefore typically not be rate-limited, its
tunable aggression could theoretically make it
possible to use it for a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
attack. In order to avoid such usage, the maximum
value of N MUST be restricted. If, as recommended
in this document, the maximum value for N is
restricted to 6, the impact of MulTFRC on TCP is
roughly the same as the impact of 6 TCP flows would
be. It is clear that the conjoint congestion control
behavior of 6 TCPs is far from being such an attack.
</t>

<t>
	With transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP or DCCP,
users can already be more aggressive than others by
opening multiple connections. If MulTFRC is used
within a transport protocol, this effect becomes
more pronounced - e.g., 2 connections with N set to
6 for each of them roughly exhibit the same congestion
control behavior as 12 TCP flows. The N limit SHOULD
therefore be implemented as a system wide parameter
such that the sum of the N values of all MulTFRC
connections does not exceed it. Alternatively, the
number of connections that can be opened could be
restricted.

					<abstract>
				<t>This document specifies TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). TFRC is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment. It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for applications such as streaming media where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 3448 and updates RFC 4342.

				This memo presents two recommendations to the Internet community

				concerning measures to improve and preserve Internet performance.

				It presents a strong recommendation for testing, standardization,

				and widespread deployment of active queue management in routers,

				to improve the performance of today's Internet.  It also urges a

				concerted effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment

				of router mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows that are

				not sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.
