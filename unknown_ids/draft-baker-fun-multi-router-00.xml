    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This note explores the ramifications of a multi-router or multihomed
      small network, such as a residential or SOHO network. It has relevance
      to the IETF CPE Router discussion in the IPv6 Operations Working Group,
      numbering and renumbering in the "renum" effort, and scoping of the
      "fun" effort.</t>

      <t>Much of the commentary in this draft applies equally to <xref
      target="RFC0791">IPv4</xref> or <xref target="RFC2460">IPv6</xref>. As
      such, the protocol will simply be called "IP" unless there is a reason
      to distinguish. References will be IPv6-related unless there is a reason
      for an IPv4-specific reference.</t>

      <section anchor="definitions" title="Definitions">
        <t>I don't think I'm introducing new terms, but let me state the
        definitions of the terms I'm using for clarity. <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="LAN:">A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network of link
            layer interfaces that can directly communicate without the use of
            a router. Example of LANs include IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, IEEE 802.11
            WiFi, and IEEE 802.15.1 and IEEE 802.15.4 WPANs.</t>

            <t hangText="Subnet:">A Subnet is a set of IP interfaces connected
            by a LAN. It by definition has a prefix, which serves as a locator
            in routing. Multiple subnets may use the same LAN, and the
            membership of those subnets may or may not be congruent.</t>

            <t hangText="LAN Switch:">A LAN switch connects different physical
            media (wired or wireless) in a LAN, switching packets to make them
            appear to be a single LAN from the perspective of the systems
            attached to it.</t>

            <t hangText="Host:">With respect to a given subnet, a host is a
            system that has an address in it and may originate traffic using
            that address, but does not switch packets between it and other
            subnets. See <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>.</t>

            <t hangText="Router:">With respect to a given subnet, a router is
            a system that has an address in it, may originate traffic using
            that address, and additionally switches packets between it and
            other subnets. See <xref target="RFC2460"></xref>.</t>

            <t hangText="CPE Router:">The Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
            Router is the router on the customer premises that connects it to
            another network. The term is often used in the context of a
            Managed Service, which is a service in which an upstream network
            own and operates the router. In residential broadband networks, it
            is more common for the customer to own the router. For the
            purposes of this document, the term "CPE" simply means that it is
            on the customer's premises.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="usecase" title="Use Cases">
        <t>The <xref target="RFC6204">Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer
        Edge Routers</xref> postulate a very simple network: a single router
        connecting a single subnet to a single upstream ISP. In general, one
        would expect that router to also implement a simple firewall
        implementing the <xref target="RFC6092">Recommended Simple Security
        Capabilities</xref>.</t>

        <t>However, it is common, and in the future perhaps normal, for
        residential and SOHO networks to be more complex, with separate
        domains for <list style="symbols">
            <t>domain-wide wired and/or wireless LANs with IP subnets,</t>

            <t>offices with differing corporate security requirements for the
            residents,</t>

            <t>networks with different PHY/MAC layers supporting the Smart
            Grid HAN or medical telemetry, and</t>

            <t>networks for entertainment such as home-wide audio systems or
            high definition TV.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In addition, there is evidence that individual residences are
        likely to be multihomed, in the sense of having multiple upstream
        networks. There are at least three obvious cases: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>One obvious case is a home using traditional broadband (DSL or
            Cable Modem) and additionally using 3GPP or LTE as an
            upstream.</t>

            <t>Another is a home equipped with a Smart Grid Energy Services
            Interface (ESI); such a home could be assigned a prefix by the
            utility for use in communications through the Advanced Metering
            Infrastructure (AMI). This is not an "ISP" in the usual sense of
            the term, as it provides limited services and only communicates to
            the relevant utility. It is, however, an "upstream" network in the
            sense that it allocates a prefix to the home and provides services
            for hire.</t>

            <t>A third, which has been proposed in Japan, is a Content
            Delivery Network (CDN) that delivers entertainment via IP, and
            allocates a prefix to the home for communication with it. Again,
            this is not an "ISP" in the usual sense of the term, as it
            provides limited services and only communicates to the CDN
            servers. It is, however, an "upstream" network in the sense that
            it allocates a prefix to the home and provides services for
            hire.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>As such services are deployed, it is reasonable to expect that the
        typical residence or SOHO will be multihomed.</t>

        <t>If one takes <xref target="RFC6204"></xref>'s view of such a
        network, one gets a picture something like <xref
        target="router0"></xref> (in that picture, consider "ISP" to be a
        generalized upstream network, not specifically one that delivers
        Internet access as a service). From the perspective of some, this
        would be a wireless LAN, or at most a wired LAN and a wireless LAN
        bridged together.</t>

        <t>The model in <xref target="router0"></xref> has some obvious
        problems, however. Cisco Systems, for example, requires that
        telecommuter's offices have a security guard (firewall or separate
        Internet access) between the office and the home. There are known
        cases in which husband and wife or roommates each work for different
        companies and each company has such an information security guideline.
        In addition, especially with a single SSID 802.11 implementation, one
        could readily imagine HD TV crowding out other uses, or BitTorrent
        crowding out the A/V uses. Separating the uses into separate LANs for
        manageability and service isolation, and especially with the Smart
        Grid's Home Area Network having a different physical interface (IEEE
        802.15.4 being a prominent option), such a network begins to look like
        <xref target="router1"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Modulo the 802.15.4 interface, such routers exist today, providing
        multiple 802.3 and 802.11 LANs and routing between their subnets.
        However, such a router begins to look like the IT counterpart to a
        Swiss Army knife, and networks are constrained by their interface
        count and type. An alternative would be to build the network out of
        two-port routers, as in <xref target="router2"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="sect2" title="Issues">
      <t>Three obvious questions arise in such networks: <list style="symbols">
          <t>How does routing, including routing between interior routers and
          to exit routers, actually work? What features are needed?</t>

          <t>How does the network identify and number its subnets?</t>
        </list></t>

      <section anchor="routing" title="Routing in a small network">
        <t>A brief analysis of the advertised features of commercial
        residential routers - products designed for use by the uninitiated in
        their homes - found that almost without exception, they support <xref
        target="RFC2453">RIP Version 2</xref>. At least one was found that
        supports <xref target="RFC1058">RIP Version 1</xref>, and one that
        supports <xref target="RFC2328">OSPF Version 2</xref>. By analogy, it
        seems rational to expect residential and SOHO routers for IPv6 to
        support <xref target="RFC2080">RIPng</xref>, and possibly <xref
        target="RFC5340">OSPF</xref>.</t>

        <t>The issues in distance vector routing, which are discussed in some
        detail in <xref target="RFC1058"></xref>, primarily relate to bogus
        information that has not been removed from the routing system,
        especially during a "count to infinity" event. Such events happen in
        networks that have parallel connectivity, which is usually implemented
        for robustness. The network in <xref target="router2"></xref> does not
        have parallel paths, and so would be unlikely to have that issue. More
        generally, an outage in a small network would likely result in the
        network administrator resetting the router in question. So RIPng
        should be adequate for the purpose.</t>

        <t>Another issue that arises, however, has to do with upstream <xref
        target="RFC2827">Ingress Filtering</xref>. In a network with a router
        per upstream network, one would really like to direct traffic intended
        for a specific upstream network to the correct router. If hosts select
        the correct source address using <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC3704"></xref> addresses that in part by suggesting that
        such routers redirect traffic to each other; a better approach would
        be to have a routing protocol that looks at {source, destination}
        address pairs and routes traffic to the appropriate exit.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="numbering" title="Assigning Subnet Numbers">
        <t>In order for an upstream network such as an ISP or utility to
        assign a prefix to a small network, the CPE router must support <xref
        target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> and its <xref target="RFC3633">IPv6
        Prefix Options</xref>. This enables the CPE Router to obtain a prefix
        from its upstream network, be it an ISP, a content delivery service,
        or a utility, and begin to use it.</t>

        <t>If, for example, an ISP allocated a global prefix to the CPE, one
        would expect the CPE to allocate a default unicast route (in IPv6, a
        route to 2000::/3, which is to say "all unicast addresses", as opposed
        to ::/0, which would include link-local addresses, ULAs, and multicast
        traffic) toward the ISP. In the more limited cases of a CDN or
        utility, it may be appropriate for the upstream prefix to be more
        limited - it might recommend an upstream route to exactly the CDN
        service, or the address of a single anycast server/service.</t>

        <t>Within the small network, one would also hope for a way to assign
        subnet numbers; as others have suggested, this could build on the same
        capability as in <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>. If the CPE router has
        a prefix shorter than /64, other routers within the domain could ask
        it for /64s and have them assigned by the same mechanism. A hand-wave
        description would have any small-network router<list style="numbers">
            <t>Come up as a host on each interface, emitting an RS and
            awaiting an RA from another router. On any interface that
            calculates its address using SLAAC, one would expect the router to
            use the same prefix(es) that it learned.</t>

            <t>If no address is allocated on an interface via SLAAC within
            some interval, perhaps sixty microfortnights, the router could
            request a prefix using the mechanisms in <xref
            target="RFC3315"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>. For
            the ISP-facing CPE Router, this would result in a prefix shorter
            than /64; within the domain, it should result in a /64. In the
            ISP-facing case, one would expect the router to allocate a /64 to
            each of its non-ISP-facing interfaces and immediately emitting an
            RA; routers in those subnets would then create addresses using
            SLAAC.</t>

            <t>If an additional interval of (perhaps) sixty microfortnights
            elapses, and the router has an IPv6 address on one or more of its
            interfaces, one could imagine the router requesting a new /64 on
            one of its addressed interfaces and assigning it to an
            un-addressed interface.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This procedure has an obvious race condition: if there are two
        routers on the same LAN, they could both request a prefix and
        simultaneously apply it. While not incorrect (IPv6 allows for multiple
        subnets on a LAN), it is inefficient. Two obvious mechanisms exist to
        counter this. If an SPF-based protocol such as OSPF or IS-IS is in
        use, and only the designated router requests a prefix, there will be a
        minimum number of subnets on the LAN. Alternatively, if the DHCPv6
        server allocates prefixes with some non-trivial inter-assignment
        interval, the LANs should similarly have a minimum number of
        subnets.</t>

    <section title="Possible Requirements">
      <t>As the document is written, various possible requirements have popped
      up. These include at least the following.</t>

      <section anchor="sdroute" title="Source/Destination Routing">
        <t><xref target="routing"></xref> notes that it would be nice to have
        a routing protocol that steered traffic toward an appropriate exit.
        Stated generally, it would be nice to have a routing protocol that
        could generate routes *from* a source *to* a destination, as opposed
        to being simply *to* a destination.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Subnet assignment">
        <t>A subnet assignment procedure such as described in <xref
        target="numbering"></xref> is needed. That section shows a "hand-wavy"
        mechanism, but the mechanism needs to be worked out in detail.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Recommended upstream route">
        <t><xref target="numbering"></xref> notes that it would be nice to
        have a way for the upstream network that provides a prefix to a
        customer also be able to give it a recommended upstream route. One
        obvious solution would be a DHCPv6 option that indicated some number
        of tuples, each consisting of <list style="symbols">
            <t>A source prefix (which could be ::/0, the prefix assigned to
            the small network, or something else)</t>

            <t>A destination prefix (which could be ::/0, 2000::/3, or a more
            specific appropriate to the service such as an anycast address or
            a data center prefix for a specific service offered by the
            ISP)</t>

            <t>A set of DSCP values, which could be "any" or any more specific
            subset</t>

            <t>One or more next hop router addresses</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If source/destination routing is implemented as described in <xref
        target="sdroute"></xref>, it might want to be able to specify that
        such datagrams must come *from* the prefix it assigned to the network.
        This could be implemented using a routing protocol, but that is a big
        change to the way residential broadband networks usually work; a more
        acceptable approach may be a DHCPv6 option.</t>
