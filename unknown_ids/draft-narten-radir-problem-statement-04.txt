Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


1.  Introduction

   Note: This version of the document (-04) is identical to version -03,
   but was resubmitted after -03 expired.

   Prompted in part by the October, 2006 IAB workshop on Routing &
   Addressing [RFC4984], there has been a renewed focus on the problem
   of routing scalability within the Internet.  The issue itself is not
   new, with discussions dating back at least 10-15 years [GSE, ROAD].

   This document attempts to define the "problem", with the aim of
   describing the essential aspects so that the community has a way of
   evaluating whether proposed solutions actually address or impact the
   underlying problem or "pain points" in a significant manner.

2.  Terms and Definitions

   Control Plane:  The routing setup protocols, their associated state
      and the activity needed to create and maintain the data structures
      used to forward packets from one network to another.  The term is
      defined broadly to include all protocols and activities needed to
      construct and maintain the forwarding tables used to forward
      packets.

   Control Plane Load:  The actual load associated with operating the
      Control Plane.  The higher the control plane load, the higher the
      cost of operating the control plane (in terms of hardware,
      bandwidth, power, etc.).  The terms "routing load" and "control
      plane load" are used interchangeably throughout this document.

   Control Plane Cost:  The overall cost associated with operating the
      Control Plane.  The cost consists of capital costs (for hardware),
      bandwidth costs (for the control plane signalling) and any other
      ongoing operational cost associated with operating and maintaining
      the control plane.

   Default Free Zone (DFZ):  That part of the Internet where routers
      maintain full routing tables.  Many routers maintain only partial
      tables, having explicit routes for "local" destinations (i.e.,
      prefixes) plus a "default" for everything else.  For such routers,
      building and maintaining routing tables is relatively simple
      because the amount of information learned and maintained can be
      small.  In contrast, routers in the DFZ maintain complete
      information about all reachable destinations, which currently
      number in the hundreds of thousands of entries.

   Routing Information Base (RIB):  The data structures a router
      maintains that hold the information about destinations and paths
      to those destinations.  The amount of state information maintained
      is dependent on a number of factors, including the number of
      individual prefixes learned from peers, the number of BGP peers,
      the number of distinct paths interconnecting destinations, etc.
      In addition to maintaining information about active paths used for
      forwarding, the RIB may also include information about unused
      ("backup") paths.

   Forwarding Information Base (FIB):  The actual table consulted while
      making forwarding decisions for individual packets.  The FIB is a
      compact, optimized subset of the RIB, containing only the
      information needed to actually forward individual packets, i.e.,
      mapping a packet's destination address to an outgoing interface
      and next-hop.  The FIB only stores information about paths
      actually used for forwarding; it typically does not store



Narten                    Expires June 18, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


      information about backup paths.  The FIB is typically constructed
      from specialized hardware components, which have different (and
      higher) cost properties than the hardware typically used to
      maintain the RIB.

   Traffic Engineering (TE):  In this document, "traffic engineering"
      refers to the current practice of inbound, inter-AS traffic
      engineering.  TE is accomplished by injecting additional, more-
      specific routes into the routing system and/or increasing the
      frequency of routing updates in order to arrange for inbound
      traffic at the boundary of an Autonomous system (AS) to travel
      over a different path than it otherwise would.

   Provider Aggregatable (PA) address space:  Address space that an end
      site obtains from an upstream ISP's address block.  The main
      benefit of PA address space is that reachability to all of a
      provider's customers can be achieved by advertising a single
      "provider aggregate" address prefix into the DFZ, rather than
      needing to announce individual prefixes for each customer.  An
      important disadvantage is a requirement that the customer return
      those addresses (and renumber) when changing providers.

   Provider Independent (PI) address space:  Address space that an end
      site obtains directly from a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for
      addressing its devices.  The main advantage (for the end site) is
      that it does not have to return those addresses (and renumber its
      site) upon changing providers.  However, PI address blocks are not
      aggregatable and thus each individual PI assignment results in an
      individual prefix being injected into the DFZ.

   Site:  Any topologically and administratively distinct entity that
      connects to the Internet.  A site can range from a large
      enterprise or ISP to a small home site.

3.  Background

   Within the DFZ, both the size of the RIB and FIB and the overall
   update rate have historically increased at a greater than linear
   rate.  Specifically:

   o  The number of individual prefixes that are being propagated into
      the DFZ over time has been and continues to increase at a faster-
      than-linear rate.  The term "super-linear" has been used to
      characterize the growth.  The exact nature of the growth is much
      debated (e.g., quadratic, polynomial, etc.), but growth is clearly
      faster than linear [XXX].  The reasons behind the rate increase
      are varied and discussed below.  Because each individual prefix
      requires resources to process, any increase in the number of
      prefixes produces a corresponding increase in control plane load
      of the routing system.  Each individual prefix that appears in
      routing updates requires state in the RIB (and possibly the FIB)
      and consumes processing and other resources when updates related
      to the prefix are received.

   o  The overall rate of routing updates is increasing [1], requiring
      routers to process updates at an increased rate or converge more
      slowly if they cannot.  The rate increase of the control plane
      load is driven by a number of factors (discussed below) [xxx-do we
      really discuss this issue sufficiently below?].  Further study is
      needed to better understand the factors behind the increasing
      update rate.  For example, it appears that a disproportionate
      increase in observed updates originates from a small percentage of
      the total number of advertised prefixes.

   The super-linear growth in the routing load presents a scalability
   challenge for current and/or future routers.  While there appears to
   be general agreement that we will be able to build routers (i.e.,
   hardware & software) actually capable of handling the control plane
   load, both today and going forward, there is considerable debate
   about the cost.  In particular, will it be possible for ISPs that
   currently (or would like to) maintain routes as part of the DFZ be
   able to afford to do so, or will only the largest (and a shrinking
   number) of top tier ISPs be able to afford the investment and cost of
   operating the control plane while being a part of the DFZ?

   Finally, the scalability challenge is aggravated by the lack of any
   firm limiting architectural upper-bound on the growth rate of the
   routing load and a weakening of social constraints that historically
   have helped restrain the growth rate so far.  Going forward, there is
   considerable uncertainty (some would say doubt) whether future growth
   rates will continue to be sufficiently constrained so that router
   development can keep up at an acceptable price point.

3.1.  Technical Aspects

   The technical challenge of building routers relates to the resources
   needed to process a larger and increasingly dynamic amount of routing
   information.  More specifically, routers must maintain an increasing
   amount of associated state information in the RIB, they must be
   capable of populating a growing FIB, they must perform forwarding
   lookups at line rates (while accessing the FIB) and they must be able
   to initialize the RIB and FIB at boot time.  Moreover, this activity
   must take place within acceptable time frames (i.e., paths for
   individual destinations must converge and stabilize within an
   acceptable time period).  Finally, the hardware needed to achieve
   this cannot have unreasonable power consumption or cooling demands.

3.2.  Business Considerations

   While the IETF does not (and cannot) concern itself with business
   models or the profitability of the ISP community, the cost of running
   the routing subsystem as a whole is directly influenced by the
   routing architecture of the Internet, which clearly is the IETF's
   business.  Thus, it is useful to consider the overall business
   environment that underlies operation of the DFZ routing
   infrastructure.  The DFZ is run entirely by the private sector with
   no overall governmental oversight or regulatory framework to oversee
   or even influence what routes are propagated where, who must carry
   them, etc.  ISPs decide (on their own) which routing updates to
   accept and how (if at all) to process them.  Thus, there is no
   overall authority that can limit the number of prefixes that are
   injected into the DFZ or that insure that any particular prefixes are
   accepted at all.  Today, the system functions because the set of
   entities that comprise the DFZ are (generally) able to accept the
   prefixes that are being advertised and some loose best practices have
   emerged that are generally followed (e.g., minimum prefix sizes that
   are routed coupled with RIR policies that place limitations on who
   may obtain PI prefixes).

   In general the Internet would benefit if the cost of the (routing)
   infrastructure did not grow too rapidly as the Internet grows, since
   a lower infrastructure cost makes it possible to provide Internet
   service at a lower cost to a larger number of users.  That said, some
   types of Internet growth tie directly to revenue opportunities or
   cost savings for an ISP (e.g., adding more users/customers,
   increasing bandwidth, technological advances, providing new or
   additional services, etc.).  Upgrading or changing infrastructure is
   most feasible (and expected) when supported by a workable cost
   recovery model.  Hence limiting the cost of self-induced scaling is a
   nice-to-have benefit, but not a requirement.




Narten                    Expires June 18, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


   On the other hand, it is problematic when the infrastructure cost for
   an ISP grows (rapidly) due to factors outside of its own control,
   e.g., resulting from overall Internet growth external to the ISP.  If
   an ISP that does not add new customers, upgrade the bandwidth for
   their customers, or provide new services needs to upgrade or replace
   their infrastructure in unexpected ways, then they have are no
   natural cost recovery mechanisms.  This is in essence what is
   happening with the scaling of the global routing table.  An ISP that
   is part of the DFZ may need to upgrade its routers to handle an
   increased routing load just to maintain the same level of service
   with respect to their current customers and services.

   Even if it is technically possible to build routers capable of
   meeting the technical and operational requirements, it is also
   necessary that the overall cost to build, maintain and deploy such
   equipment meet reasonable business expectations.  ISPs, after all,
   are run as businesses.  As such, they must be able to plan, develop
   and construct viable business plans that provide an acceptable return
   on investment (i.e., one acceptable to investors).

3.3.  Alignment of Incentives

   Today's growth pattern is influenced by the scaling properties of the
   current routing system.  If the routing system had better scaling
   properties, we would be able support and enable more widespread usage
   of such services as multihoming and traffic engineering.  The current
   system simply would not be handle to the routing load if everyone
   were to choose to multihome.  There are millions of potential end
   sites that would benefit from being able to multihome.  This compares
   with a low few hundred thousand prefixes being carried today.
   Broader availability of multihoming is limited by barriers imposed by
   operational practices that try to strike a balance between the amount
   of multihoming and preservation of routing slots.  It is desirable
   that the routing and addressing system exert the least possible back
   pressure on end user applications and deployment scenarios, to enable
   the broadest possible use of the Internet.

   One aspect of the current architecture is a misalignment of cost and
   benefit.  Injecting individual prefixes into the DFZ creates a small
   amount of "pain" for those routers that are part of the DFZ.  Each
   individual prefix adds only a small cost to the routing load, but the
   aggregate sum of all prefixes is significant, and leads to the core
   problem at hand.  Those that inject prefixes into the DFZ do not
   generally pay the cost associated with the individual prefix -- it is
   carried by the routers in the DFZ.  But the originator of the prefix
   receives the benefit.  Hence, there is misalignment of incentives
   between those receiving the benefit and those bearing the cost of
   providing the benefit.  Consequently, incentives are not aligned

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


   properly to produce a natural feedback loop to balance the cost and
   benefit of maintaining routing tables.

3.4.  Table Growth Targets

   A precise target for the rate of table size or routing update
   increase that should reasonably be supported going forward is
   difficult to state in quantitative terms.  One target might simply be
   to keep the growth at a stable, but manageable growth rate so that
   the increased router functionality can roughly be covered by
   improvements in technology (e.g., increased processor speeds,
   reductions in component costs, etc.).

   However, it is highly desirable to significantly bring down (or even
   reverse) the growth rate in order to meet user expectations for
   specific services.  As discussed below, there are numerous pressures
   to deaggregate routes.  These pressures come from users seeking
   specific, tangible service improvements that provide "business-
   critical" value.  Today, some of those services simply cannot be
   supported to the degree that future demand can reasonably be expected
   because of the negative implications on DFZ table growth.  Hence,
   valuable services are available to some, but not all potential
   customers.  As the need for such services becomes increasingly
   important, it will be difficult to deny such services to large
   numbers of users, especially when some "lucky" sites are able to use
   the service and others are not.

4.  Pressures on Routing Table Size

   There are a number of factors behind the increase in the quantity of
   prefixes appearing in the DFZ.  From a theoretical perspective, the
   number of prefixes in the DFZ can be minimized through aggressive
   aggregation [RFC4632].  In practice, strict adherence to the CIDR
   principles is difficult.

4.1.  Traffic Engineering

   Traffic engineering (TE) is the act of arranging for certain Internet
   traffic to use or avoid certain network paths (that is, TE attempts
   to place traffic where capacity exists, or where some set of
   parameters of the path is more favorable to the traffic being placed
   there).

   Outbound TE is typically accomplished by using internal IGP metrics
   to choose the shortest exit for two equally good BGP paths.
   Adjustment of IGP metrics controls how much traffic flows over
   different internal paths to specific exit points for two equally good
   BGP paths.  Additional traffic can be moved by applying some policy
   to depreference or filter certain routes from specific BGP peers.
   Because outbound TE is achieved via a site's own IGP, outbound TE
   does not impact routing outside of a site.

   Inbound TE is performed by announcing a more-specific route along the
   preferred path that "catches" the desired traffic and channels it
   away from the path it would take otherwise (i.e., via a larger
   aggregate).  At the BGP level, if the address range requiring TE is a
   portion of a larger address aggregate, network operators implementing
   TE are forced to de-aggregate otherwise aggregatable prefixes in
   order to steer the traffic of the particular address range to
   specific paths.

   TE is performed by both ISPs and customer networks, for three primary
   reasons:

   o  First, to match traffic with network capacity, or to spread the
      traffic load across multiple links (frequently referred to as
      "load balancing").

   o  Second, to reduce costs by shifting traffic to lower cost paths or
      by balancing the incoming and outgoing traffic volume to maintain
      appropriate peering relations.

   o  Finally, TE is sometimes deployed to enforce certain forms of
      policy (e.g., government traffic may not be permitted to transit
      through other countries).

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


   TE impacts route scaling in two ways.  First, inbound TE can result
   in additional prefixes being advertised into the DFZ.  Second,
   Network operators usually achieve traffic engineering by "tweaking"
   the processing of routing protocols to achieve desired results, e.g.,
   by sending updates at an increased rate.  In addition, some devices
   attempt to automatically find better paths and then advertise those
   preferences through BGP, though the extent to which such tools are in
   use and contributing to the control plane load is unknown.

   In today's highly competitive environment, providers require TE to
   maintain good performance and low cost in their networks.

4.2.  Multihoming

   Multihoming refers generically to the case in which a site is served
   by more than one ISP [RFC4116].  Multihoming is used to provide
   backup paths (i.e., to remove single points of failure), to achieve
   load-sharing, and to achieve policy or performance objectives (e.g.,
   to use lower latency or higher bandwidth paths).  Multihoming may
   also be a requirement due to contract or law.

   Multihoming can be accomplished using either PI or PA address space.
   A multihomed site advertises its site prefix into the routing system
   of each of its providers.  For PI space, the site's PI space is used,
   and the prefix is propagated throughout the DFZ.  For PA space, the
   PA site prefix may (or may not) be propagated throughout the DFZ,
   with the details depending on what type of multihoming is sought.

   If the site uses PA space, the PA site prefix allocated from one of
   its providers (whom we'll call the Primary Provider) is used.  The PA
   site prefix will be aggregatable by the Primary Provider but not the
   others.  To achieve the same level of multihoming as described in the
   case with PI addresses above, the PA site prefix will need to be
   injected into the routing system of all of its ISPs, and throughout
   the DFZ.  In addition, because of the longest-match forwarding rule,
   the Primary Provider must also advertise and propagate the individual
   PA site prefix; otherwise, the path via the primary provider (as
   advertised via the aggregate) will never be selected due to the
   longest match rule.  For the type of multihoming described here,
   where the PA site prefix is propagated throughout the DFZ, the use of
   PI vs. PA space has no impact on the control plane load.  The
   increased load is due entirely to the need to propagate the site's
   individual prefix throughout the DFZ.

   The demand for multihoming is increasing [2].  The increase in
   multihoming demand is due to the increased reliance on the Internet
   for mission and business-critical applications (where businesses
   require 7x24 availability for their services) and the general

   decrease in cost of Internet connectivity.

4.3.  End Site Renumbering

   It is generally considered painful and costly to renumber a site,
   with the cost proportional to the size and complexity of the network
   and most importantly, to the degree that addresses are stored in
   places that are difficult in practice to update.  When using PA
   space, a site must renumber when changing providers.  Larger sites
   object to this cost and view the requirement to renumber akin to
   being held "hostage" to the provider from which PA space was
   obtained.  Consequently, many sites desire PI space.  Having PI space
   provides independence from any one provider and makes it easier to
   switch providers (for whatever reason).  However, each individual PI
   prefix must be propagated throughout the DFZ and adds to the control
   plane load.

   It should be noted that while larger sites may also want to
   multihome, the cost of renumbering drives some sites to seek PI
   space, even though they do not multihome.

4.4.  Acquisitions and Mergers

   Acquisitions and mergers take place for business reasons, which
   usually have little to do with the network topologies of the impacted
   organizations.  When a business sells off part of itself, the assets
   may include networks, attached devices, etc.  A company that
   purchases or merges with other organizations may quickly find that
   its network assets are numbered out of many different and
   unaggragatable address blocks.  Consequently, an individual
   organization may find itself unable to announce a single prefix for
   all of their networks without renumbering a significant portion of
   its network.

   Likewise, selling off part of a business may involve selling part of
   a network as well, resulting in the fragmentation of one address
   block into two (or more) smaller blocks.  Because the resultant
   blocks belong to different organizations, they can no longer be
   advertised by a single aggregate and the resultant fragments may need
   to be advertised individually into the DFZ.

4.5.  RIR Address Allocation Policies

   ISPs and multihoming end sites obtain address space from RIRs.  As an
   entity grows, it needs additional address space and requests more
   from its RIR.  In order to be able to obtain additional address space
   that can be aggregated with the previously-allocated address space,
   the RIR must keep a reserve of space that the requester can grow into



Narten                    Expires June 18, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


   in the future.  But any reserved address space cannot be used for any
   other purpose (i.e., assigned to another organization).  Hence, there
   is an inherent conflict between holding address space in reserve to
   allow for the future growth of an existing allocation holder and
   using address space efficiently.  In IPv4, there has been a heavy
   emphasis on conserving address space and obtaining efficient
   utilization.  Consequently, insufficient space has been held in
   reserve to allow for the growth of all sites and some allocations
   have had to be made from discontiguous address blocks.  That is, some
   sites have received discdontiguous address blocks because their
   growth needs exceeded the amount of space held in reserve for them.
   For IPv6, a greater emphasis has been placed on aggregation.

4.6.  Dual Stack Pressure on the Routing Table

   The recommended IPv6 deployment model is dual-stack, where IPv4 and
   IPv6 are run in parallel across the same links.  This has two
   implications for routing.  First, although alternative scenarios are
   possible, it seems likely that many routers will be supporting both
   IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously and will thus be managing both IPv4 and
   IPv6 routing tables within a single router.  Second, for sites
   connected via both IPv4 and IPv6, both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes will
   need to be propagated into the routing system.  Consequently, dual-
   stack routers will maintain both an IPv4 and IPv6 route to reach the
   same destination.

   It is possible to make some simple estimates on the approximate size
   of the IPv6 tables that would be needed if all sites reachable via
   IPv4 today were also reachable via IPv6.  In theory, each autonomous
   system (AS) needs only a single aggregate route.  This provides a
   lower bound on the size of the fully-realized IPv6 routing table.
   (As of July 2007, [3] states there are 25,836 active ASes in the
   routing system.)

   A single IPv6 aggregate will not allow for inbound traffic
   engineering.  End sites will need to advertise a number of smaller
   prefixes into the DFZ if they desire to gain finer grained control
   over their IPv6 inbound traffic.  This will increase the size of the
   IPv6 routing table beyond the lower bound discussed above.  There is
   reason to expect the IPv6 routing table will be smaller than the
   current IPv4 table, however, because the larger initial assignments
   to end sites will minimize the de-aggregation that occurs when a site
   must go back to its upstream address provider or RIR and receive a
   second, non-contiguous assignment.

   It is possible to extrapolate what the size of the IPv6 Internet
   routing table would be if widespread IPv6 adoption occurred, from the
   current IPv4 Internet routing table.  Each active AS (25,836) would

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


   require at least one aggregate.  In addition, the IPv6 Internet table
   would also carry more-specific prefixes for traffic engineering.
   Assume that the IPv6 Internet table will carry the same number of
   more specifics as the IPv4 Internet table.  In this case one can take
   the number of IPv4 Internet routes and subtract the number of CIDR
   aggregates that they could easily be aggregated down to.  As of July
   2007, the 229,789 routes can be easily aggregated down to 150,018
   CIDR aggregates [3].  That difference yields 79,771 extra more-
   specific prefixes.  Thus if each active AS (25,836) required one
   aggregate, and an additional 79,771 more specifics were required,
   then the IPv6 Internet table would be 105,607 prefixes.

4.7.  Internal Customer Routes

   In addition to the Internet routing table, networks must also carry
   their internal routing table.  Internal routes are defined as more-
   specific routes that are not advertised to the DFZ.  This primarily
   consists of prefixes that are a more-specific of a provider aggregate
   (PA) and are assigned to a single homed customer.  The DFZ need only
   carry the PA aggregate in order to deliver traffic to the provider.
   However, the provider's routers require the more-specific route to
   deliver traffic to the end site.

   This could also consist of more-specific prefixes advertised by
   multihomed customers with the "no-export" BGP community.  This is
   useful when the fine grained control of traffic to be influenced can
   be contained to the neighboring network.

   For a large ISP, the internal IPv4 table can be between 50,000 and
   150,000 routes.  During the dot com boom some ISPs had more internal
   prefixes than there were in the Internet table.  Thus the size of the
   internal routing table can have significant impact on the scalability
   and should not be discounted.

4.8.  IPv4 Address Exhaustion

   The IANA and RIR free pool of IPv4 addresses will be exhausted within
   a few years.  As the free pool shrinks, the size of the remaining
   unused blocks will also shrink and unused blocks previously held in
   reserve for expansion of existing allocations or otherwise not used
   due to their smaller size will be allocated for use.  Consequently,
   as the community looks to use every piece of available address space
   (no matter how small) there will be an increasing pressure to
   advertise additional prefixes in the DFZ.

5.  Pressures on Control Plane Load

   This section describes a number of trends and pressures that are
   contributing to the overall routing load.  The previous section
   described pressures that are increasing the size of the routing
   table.  Even if the size could be bounded, the amount of work needed
   to maintain paths for a given set of prefixes appears to be
   increasing.

5.1.  Interconnection Richness

   The degree of interconnectedness between ASes has increased in recent
   years.  That is, the Internet as whole is becoming "flatter" with an
   increasing number of possible paths interconnecting sites [4].  As
   the number of possible paths increase, the amount of computation
   needed to find a best path also increases.  This computation comes
   into effect whenever a change in path characteristics occurs, whether
   from a new path becoming available, an existing path failing, or a
   change in the attributes associated with a potential path.  Thus,
   even if the total number of prefixes were to stay constant, an
   increase in the interconnection richness implies an increase in the
   resources needed to maintain routing tables.

5.2.  Multihoming

   Multihoming places pressure on the routing system in two ways.
   First, an individual prefix for a multihomed site (whether PI or PA)
   must be propagated into the routing system, so that other sites can
   find a good path to the site.  Even if the site's prefix comes out of
   a PA block, an individual prefix for the site needs to be advertised
   so that the most desirable path to the site can be chosen when the
   path through the aggregate is sub-optimal.  Second, a multihomed site
   will be connected to the Internet in more than one place, increasing
   the overall level of interconnection richness.  If an outage occurs
   on any of the circuits connecting the site to the Internet, those
   changes will be propagated into the routing system.  In contrast, a
   singly-homed site numbered out of a Provider Aggregate places no
   additional control plane load in the DFZ as the details of the
   connectivity status to the site are kept internal to the provider to
   which it connects.

5.3.  Traffic Engineering

   The mechanisms used to achieve multihoming and inbound Traffic
   Engineering are the same.  In both cases, a specific prefix is
   advertised into the routing system to "catch" traffic and route it
   over a different path than it would otherwise be carried.  When
   multihoming, the specific prefix is one that differs from that of its



Narten                    Expires June 18, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


   ISP or is a more-specific of the ISP's PA.  Traffic Engineering is
   achieved by taking one prefix and dividing it into a number of
   smaller and more-specific ones, and advertising them in order to gain
   finer-grained control over the paths used to carry traffic covered by
   those prefixes.

   Traffic Engineering increases the number of prefixes carried in the
   routing system.  In addition, when a circuit fails (or the routing
   attributes associated with the circuit change), additional load is
   placed on the routing system by having multiple prefixes potentially
   impacted by the change, as opposed to just one.

5.4.  Questionable Operational Practices?

   Some operators are believed to engage in operational practices that
   increase the load on the routing system.

5.4.1.  Rapid shuffling of prefixes

   Some networks try to assert fine-grained control of inbound traffic
   by modifying route announcements frequently in order to migrate
   traffic to less loaded links quickly.  The goal of this is to achieve
   higher utilization of multiple links.  In addition, some route
   selection devices actively measure link or path utilization and
   attempt to optimize inbound traffic by withholding or depreferencing
   certain prefixes in their advertisements.  In short, any system that
   actively measures load and modifies route advertisements in real time
   increases the load on the routing system, as any change in what is
   advertised must ripple through the entire routing system.

5.4.2.  Anti-Route Hijacking

   In order to reduce the threat of accidental (or intentional)
   hijacking of its address space by an unauthorized third party, some
   sites advertise their space as a set of smaller prefixes rather than
   as one aggregate.  That way, if someone else advertised a path for
   the larger aggregate (or a small piece of the aggregate), it will be
   ignored in favor of the more-specific announcements.  This increases
   both the number of prefixes advertised, and the number of updates.

5.4.3.  Operational Ignorance

   It is believed that some undesirable practices result from operator
   ignorance, where the operator is unaware of what they are doing and
   the impact that has on the DFZ.

   The default behavior of most BGP configurations is to automatically
   propagate all learned routes.  That is, one must take explicit



Narten                    Expires June 18, 2010                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft  Routing and Addressing Problem Statement   December 2009


   configuration steps to prevent the automatic propagation of learned
   routes.  In addition, it is often significant work to figure out how
   to (safely) aggregate routes (and which ones to aggregate) in order
   to reduce the number of advertisements propagated elsewhere.  While
   vendors could provide additional configuration "knobs" to reduce
   leakage, the implementation of additional features increases
   complexity and some operators may fear that the new configuration
   will break their existing routing setup.  Finally, leaking routes
   unnecessarily does not generally harm those with the
   misconfiguration, hence, there is less motivation to address the
   problem.

5.5.  RIR Policy

   RIR address policy has direct impact on the control plane load
   because address policy determines who is eligible for a PI assignment
   (which impacts how many are given out in practice) and the size of
   the assignment (which impacts how much address space can be
   aggregated within a single assignment).  If PI assignments for end
   sites did not exist, then those end sites would not advertise their
   own prefix directly into the global routing system; instead their
   address block would be covered by their provider's aggregate.  That
   said, RIRs have adopted PI policies in response to community demand,
   for reasons described elsewhere (e.g., to support multihoming and to
   avoid the need to renumber).  In short, RIR policy can be seen as a
   symptom rather than a root cause.

6.  Summary

   As discussed in previous sections, in the current operating
   environment, an ISP may experience an overall increase in the routing
   load due entirely to external factors outside of its control.  These
   external pressures can make it increasingly difficult for ISPs to
   recover control plane related costs associated with the growth of the
   Internet.  Moreover, real business and user needs are creating
   increasing pressure to use techniques that increase the control plane
   load for ISPs operating within the DFZ.  While the system largely
   works today, there is a real risk that the current cost and incentive
   structures will be unable to keep control plane costs manageable
   (within the context of then-available routing hardware) over the next
   decades.  The Internet would strongly benefit from a routing and
   addressing model designed with this in mind.  Thus, in the absence of
   a business model that better supports such cost recovery, there is a
   need for an approach to routing and addressing that fulfils the
   following criteria:

   1.  Provides sufficient benefits to the party bearing the costs of
       deploying and maintaining the technology to recover the cost for
       doing so.

   2.  Reduces the growth rate of the DFZ control plane load.  In the
       current architecture, this is dominated by the routing, which is
       dependent on:

       A.  The number of individual prefixes in the DFZ

       B.  The update rate associated with those prefixes.

       Any change to the control plane architecture must result in a
       reduction in the overall control plane load, and shouldn't simply
       shift the load from one place in the system to another, without
       reducing the overall load as a whole.

   3.  Allows any end site wishing to multihome to do so

   4.  Supports ISP and enterprise TE needs

   5.  Allows end sites to switch providers while minimizing
       configuration changes to internal end site devices.

   6.  Provides end-to-end convergence/restoration of service at least
       comparable to that provided by the current architecture

   The problem statement in this document has purposefully been scoped
   to focus on the growth of the routing control plane load of operating

   the DFZ.  Other problems that may seem related, but do not directly
   impact the route scaling problem are not considered to be "in scope"
   at this time.  For example, Mobile IP [RFC3344] [RFC3775] and NEMO
   [RFC3963] place no pressures on the routing system.  They are layered
   on top of existing IP, using tunneling to forward packets via a
   care-of addresses.  Hence, "improving" these technologies (e.g., by
   having them leverage a solution to the multihoming problem), while a
   laudable goal, is not considered a part of this problem statement.
