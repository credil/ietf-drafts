Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements              October 2009


Abstract

   DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) is going to develop a
   protocol that is used by a P2P application client to control its
   shared resource in the in-network storage, as well as store/retrieve
   the resource to/from the in-network storage.  This document
   enumerates requirements that should be considered during the design
   and implementation of this protocol.

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements              October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document itemizes the following requirements:

      General system requirements;

      Access to In-network storage;

      Control of In-network storage;

      Error handling and security.

   This document will be updated to be aligned with problem statement.


2.  Terminology and Concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms defined in
   [I-D.song-decade-problem-statement].


3.  DECADE Requirements

3.1.  General Requirements

   DRv00-1:  A In-network storage Access protocol (IAP) MUST be
             developed to support data read and write from DECADE client
             to In-network storage.

   DRv00-2:  The In-network storage Access protocol (IAP) MAY support
             data read and write between In-network storages.

   DRv00-3:  The In-network storage Access protocol (IAP) SHOULD be
             based on the end-to-end principle; that is, it allows the
             users to decide on how to manage their shares of resources.

   DRv00-4:  In-network storage Access protocol SHOULD provide a
             resource control mechanism to support resource control from
             DECADE client to In-network storage.

3.2.  In-network Storage Access Protocol

3.2.1.  In-network Storage Access

   DRv00-5:  DECADE client MUST be able to initiate a session with the
             in-network storage using In-network storage Access Protocol
             (IAP).

   DRv00-6:  In-network storage MUST implement the In-network storage
             Access Protocol (IAP) for receiving messages including
             content storage and deletion, and for sending corresponding
             response.

   DRv00-7:  Client that uses DECADE in-network storage MUST implement
             IAP for handling messages including content storage and
             deletion, and for receiving corresponding response.

   DRv00-8:  In-network storage SHOULD support concurrent transfer.  For
             example, an in-network storage MUST support upload to
             /download from multiple in-network storages or DECADE
             clients.

   DRv00-9:  IAP SHOULD enable a client to make decisions on whether to
             download content directly to itself or to its in-network
             storage, or first to its in-network storage and then to
             itself.

3.2.2.  Authorization

   DRv00-10:  DECADE Client SHOULD be able to authorize individual peers
              to retrieve the content stored on its in-network storage.

   DRv00-11:  DECADE Client SHOULD be able to authorize individual peers
              to store content into its in-network storage.

   DRv00-12:  In-network storage MUST check the authorization of a
              client before it stores or retrieves content.

3.2.3.  Management and Resource Control

   DRv00-13:  A DECADE client SHOULD be able to retrieve current
              resource usage and quota on its in-network storage.

   DRv00-14:  A DECADE client is RECOMMENDED to assign priority,
              bandwidth and connections quota to peers accessing the
              content in its in-network storage.

Internet-Draft             DECADE Requirements              October 2009


   DRv00-15:  A DECADE client is RECOMMENDED to assign priority,
              bandwidth, connections and storage quota to peers storing
              content in its in-network storage.

   DRv00-16:  A DECADE server implementing in-network storage MAY
              support a time to live value for stored content.

   DRv00-17:  A DECADE client MUST be able to delete content stored on
              its in-network storage when it no longer wants the content
              to be distributed.  However, it's up to the client to
              decide whether to delete the content or to leave it alone
              until the content is expired.

3.2.4.  Error Handling and Overload Protection

   DRv00-18:  Any application designed to use DECADE SHOULD be designed
              to handle the scenarios that no in-network storage can be
              found or the in-network storage rejects its requests,
              e.g., due to connectivity problems or in an overload
              situation.

   DRv00-19:  In-network storage, which is operating close to its
              capacity limit, SHOULD be able to reject requests.

   DRv00-20:  In-network storage, which is operating close to its
              capacity limit, and is not able to provide DECADE service
              for the content that is already stored on it, SHOULD try
              to reply with a status message to requesting DECADE
              clients about its overloading state.

3.3.  Transport Requirements

   DRv00-21:  DECADE MAY contain options to support application-type
              specific optimizations for data transmissions between
              DECADE clients and in-network storage, or between in-
              network storage.  The types include streaming, file-
              sharing, and web browsing.


4.  Security Considerations

   In-network storage can be a target of Denial of service (DoS)
   attacks.  Thus, access control and resource control should be
   considered.  In-network storage can also be a complicity of content
   stealing if there is no authorization and authentication.

   There should be a mechanism to guarantee safe transmission of
   authorization messages.

5.  Discussion

   Sometimes, several logical in-network storages could be deployed on
   the same physical network device.  In this case, in-network storages
   on the same physical network device can communicate and transfer data
   through internal communication messages.  However in-network storages
   deployed on different physical network devices SHOULD communicate
   with in-network storage Access Protocol (IAP).

   To provide fairness among clients, in-network storage should assign
   storage/bandwidth/connection quota for users.  Or else a few clients
   might occupy large amounts of resources on the in-network storage,
   while others starve.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration with this document.
