2.  Problem statement

   Consider the SIP [2] trapezoid shown in Figure 1.

           +---+                      /    /

      alice@example.com          bob@example.net


                          Figure 1: SIP Trapezoid

   An user, alice@example.com, invites bob@example.net for a multimedia
   communication session.  Her user agent routes the request to a proxy,
   in her domain.  Assume also that example.com is a large organization
   that maintains several SIP proxies, and normal request forwarding
   rules cause her invitation to be sent to an outbound proxy, Proxy-
   A.example.com.  This proxy uses RFC 3263 [7] resolution to discover
   that Proxy-B.example.net offers TLS support and can accept the
   request on behalf of the example.net domain.  Proxy-A establishes a
   TLS connection to Proxy-B, each proxy presents a X.509 certificate to
   authenticate and protect the confidentiality of the connection.  This
   is the basic mututal authentication model explored in depth in [8].

Internet-Draft                   SIP EKU                       July 2008


   However, there arise certain cases where one SIP proxy needs to know
   whether it has reached an authoritative proxy in target SIP domain.
   For instance, billing transactions may be triggered when an
   authoritative SIP proxy in one domain sends messages to its
   equivalent in another domain.  In Figure 1, Proxy-A.example.com
   performs certain DNS queries to arrive at Proxy-B.example.net.
   Because of the answers to the DNS queries, Proxy-A has a certain
   expectation that Proxy-B is a valid proxy in the example.net domain
   and is authorized to receive inbound requests targeted to that
   domain.

   The problem for Proxy-B is different:  it accepts a connection from a
   specific host (Proxy-A.example.com) but what it needs to determine is
   whether or not that connection can be treated as coming
   authoritatively from a particular SIP domain.  If Proxy-B receives a
   certificate tha only contains the identity "sip:Proxy-A.example.com",
   it is unable to make a determination that Proxy-A is authorized to
   act as a SIP outbound proxy for the example.com domain (note that
   example.com domain may use different inbound proxies, so SIP DNS
   resolution of "sip:example.com" may not lead to "Proxy-
   A.example.com".)  Certificate usage in SIP cannot require that every
   outbound proxy for a domain also serve as its inbound proxy.  Thus,
   there is a need for an extra attribute that allows an inbound proxy
   to know that its peer is an authorized proxy for that domain.  This
   document discusses such an attribute as part of the X.509 certificate
   exchanged by the proxies when a TLS connection is first established.


3.  Restricting usage to SIP

   This memo defines a certificate profile for binding a SIP domain name
   to an entity.  A SIP domain name is frequently textually identical to
   the same DNS name used for other purposes.  For example, the DNS name
   example.com may serve as a SIP domain name, an email domain name, and
   web service name.  Since these different services within a single
   organization might be administered independently and hosted
   separately, it should be possible to create a certificate that binds
   the DNS name to its usage as a SIP domain name without creating the
   implication that the usage is also valid for some other purpose.
   RFC5280 [3] section 4.2.1.12 defines a mechanism for this purpose:
   an "Extended Key Usage" attribute.  Certificates whose purpose is to
   bind a SIP domain identity without binding other non-SIP identities
   MUST include an id-kp-SIPdomain attribute.

3.1.  Extended Key Usage values for SIP domains

   RFC 5280 [3] specifies the EKU X.509 certificate Extension for use in
   the Internet.  The extension indicates one or more purposes for which



Lawrence & Gurbani      Expires January 12, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                   SIP EKU                       July 2008


   the certified public key may be used.  The EKU extension can be used
   in conjunction with the key usage extension, which indicates how the
   public key in the certificate may be used, in a more basic
   cryptographic way.

   The EKU extension syntax is repeated here for convenience:

         ExtKeyUsageSyntax  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

         KeyPurposeId  ::=  OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   This specification defines the KeyPurposeId id-kp-sipDomain.

         id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=
            { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
              security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) 3 }

         id-kp-sipDomain  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp VALUE-TBD }

   Inclusion of this KeyPurposeId in a certificate indicates that any
   DNS subject names in the certificate are intended to identify the
   holder as authoritative for a SIP service in the domain named by the
   subjectAltName values.  Whether or not to include this restriction is
   up to the certificate issuer, but if it is included, it SHOULD be
   marked as critical.

      This is so that implementations that understand this extension
      will honor it while those that do not are not impeded by its
      presence.

   See Section 4 for how the presence of an id-kp-sipDomain value
   affects the interpretation of the certificate.


4.  Using the SIP EKU in a certificate

   Section 7.1 of [8] contains two steps for finding an identity (or a
   set of identities) in an X.509 certificate.  In order to determine
   whether the SIP entity presenting the certificate is authoritative
   for its domain, implementations MUST perform the step given below
   first, and then proceed with the steps in Section 7.1 of [8].

   The Extended Key Usage value(s), if any, MUST be examined to
   determine whether or not the certificate is valid for use in SIP
   (note that in the steps below, we assume that the certificate is
   otherwise valid following the checks in RFC5280 [3]):

Internet-Draft                   SIP EKU                       July 2008


   o  If the certificate does not contain any EKU values (the Extended
      Key Usage extension does not exist), it is a matter of local
      policy whether or not to accept the certificate for use as a SIP
      certificate.

   o  If the certificate contains the id-kp-sipDomain EKU extension,
      then the certificate MUST be acceptable as valid for use as a SIP
      certificate.

   o  If the certificate does not contain the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value,
      but does contain the id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU value, it is a
      matter of local policy whether or not to accept it for use as a
      SIP certificate.

   o  If the certificate does not contain the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value,
      but does contain either the id-kp-serverAuth or id-kp-clientAuth
      EKU values, it is a matter of local policy whether or not to
      accept it for use as a SIP certificate.

         id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth EKU values are defined in
         Section 4.2.1.12 of RFC 5280 [3].

   o  If EKU extension exists but does not contain any of the id-kp-
      sipDomain, id-kp-anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth, or id-kp-
      clientAuth EKU values, then the certificate MUST NOT be considered
      acceptable as being authoritative for the domain portion of the
      SIP domain identities contained in the certificate.

         The term "SIP domain identity" is defined in RFC XXXX [8].


5.  Guidelines for a Certification Authority

   The procedures and practices employed by the certification authority
   MUST ensure that the correct values for the EKU extension and
   subjectAltName are inserted in each certificate that is issued.  For
   certificates that indicate authority over a SIP domain, but not over
   services other than SIP, certificate authorities SHOULD include the
   id-kp-sipDomain EKU extension.


6.  Security Considerations

   This memo defines an EKU X.509 certificate extension that enables the
   holder of a certificate to be authoritative for a SIP service
   belonging to an autonomous domain.  Relying parties may execute
   applicable policies (such as those related to billing) on receiving a
   certificate with the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value.  An id-kp-sipDomain

Internet-Draft                   SIP EKU                       July 2008


   EKU value does not introduce any new security or privacy concerns.
   At the very most, it simply allows the relying party to know that the
   holder of the certificate is authoritative for the SIP service in a
   certain domain.  In the absence of the id-kp-sipDomain EKU value,
   this information can be collected over time by a peer in any case.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The id-kp-sipDomain purpose requires an object idenitifier (OID).
   The objects are defined in an arc delegated by IANA to the PKIX
   working group.  No further action is necessary by IANA.
