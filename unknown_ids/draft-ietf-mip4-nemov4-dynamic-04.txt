2.  Introduction

   The base NEMOv4 specification [RFC5177] defines extensions to Mobile
   IPv4 [RFC3344] for mobile networks.  This specification adds support
   for dynamic allocation of mobile prefixes by the home agent.

3.  Dynamic Mobile Prefix allocation

   The following extension is defined according to this specification.

3.1.  Mobile Client Considerations

   [RFC5177] defines that the prefix field of the mobile network request
   extension can not be set to zero.  This mechanism works only in
   combination with the explicit mode of operation defined in [RFC5177].

   According to this specification, a mobile client MAY include one or
   more mobile network request extensions with the prefix field set to
   zero.  Such mobile network request extensions indicate that the
   mobile client requests mobile network prefix(es) to be assigned to it
   by the home agent.  In this case, the mobile client MAY set the
   prefix length field of such extensions to zero or to a length of its
   choice as a hint to the home agent.  According to this specification,
   mobile network request extensions with the prefix field set to zero
   MAY be included in a registration request message either during
   initial registration or during a subsequent registration.

   When a mobile client receives a registration reply it MUST process it
   as defined in MIPv4 [RFC3344] and [RFC5177].  If one or more network
   acknowledgement extension are included with the Code field set to
   "Success" the mobile client SHOULD treat the prefixes in the
   corresponding prefix fields as allocated prefixes and create the
   appropriate bindings as defined in [RFC5177].

   If in response to a registration request with a mobile network
   request extension with the prefix field set to zero, a mobile client
   receives a registration reply with a network acknowledgement
   extensiona including Code field set to 1 "invalid prefix", it may use
   it as a hint that the home agent does not support dynamic prefix
   allocation.

3.2.  Home Agent Considerations

   A home agent receiving a mobile network request extension with the
   prefix field set to zero MAY return a mobile network acknowledgement
   extension [RFC5177] with the prefix field set to the prefix allocated
   to the mobile client.  The length of that prefix is at the discretion
   of the home agent.  The home agent MAY take into account the prefix
   length hint if one is included in the mobile network request
   extension.  Once the home agent allocates a prefix it MUST maintain
   the prefix registration table as defined in [RFC5177].  Alternatively
   the home agent MAY return a mobile network acknowledgement extension
   with the Code field set to one of the negative codes defined in
   [RFC5177].

   Dynamic mobile prefix allocation as defined in this specification MAY
   be combined with dynamic home address allocation as defined in
   [RFC5177].  In other words the home address field of the registration
   request message MAY be set to zero while the message also includes
   one or more mobile network request extensions with the prefix field
   also set to zero.

   Once the home agent allocates a prefix it MUST maintain the prefix
   registration table as defined in [RFC5177].  The lifetime of the
   allocated prefix will be equal to the lifetime of the binding cache
   entry

   For dynamic prefix allocation the mobile client's home address MAY be
   used to identify the client if it is not set to zero.  Otherwise, as
   defined in the NAI extension [RFC2794] of MIPv4 [RFC2794], the NAI
   extension needs to be included in the registration request, in which
   case the same extension SHOULD be used to identify the mobile client
   for prefix allocation purposes.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification operates in the security constraints and
   requirements of MIPv4 [RFC3344], NAI [RFC2794] and [RFC5177].

   Home agent implementations SHOULD take steps to prevent address
   exhaustion attacks.  One way to limit the effectiveness of such an
   attack is to limit the number and size of prefixes any one mobile
   router can be allocated.
