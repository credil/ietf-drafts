Internet-Draft        ISATAP and 6to4 Routing Loops         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Recent research [USENIX09] has pointed out the existence of some
   security vulnerabilities in the design of the automatic tunnels
   ISATAP [RFC5214] and 6to4 [RFC3056].  These vulnerabilities allow a
   specially crafted packet to loop back and forth between ISATAP
   routers or 6to4 relays thereby overloading them.

   In automatic tunnels a packet's egress node's IPv4 address is
   computationally derived from the destination IPv6 address of the
   packet.  This feature eliminates the need to keep an explicit routing
   table at the tunnel's end points.  In particular, the end points do
   not have to be updated as peers join and leave the tunnel.  In fact,
   the end points of an automatic tunnel do not know which other end
   points are currently part of the tunnel.  However, all end points
   operate on the implicit assumption that once a packet arrives at the
   tunnel, its destination indeed is part of the tunnel.  This
   assumption poses a security vulnerability since it may result in an
   inconsistency between a tunnel's overlay IPv6 routing state and the
   native IPv6 routing state there by allowing a routing loop to be
   formed.

   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a packet which
   is routed over a tunnel to a node that is not participating in that
   tunnel.  This node may forward the packet out of the tunnel to a
   native IPv6 network.  In that network, the packet is routed back to
   the ingress point that forwards it back into the tunnel.
   Consequently, the packet will loop in and out of the tunnel.

   A loop terminates only when the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header of
   the packet is zeroed out.  The maximum value that can be assigned to
   this field is 255.  Note that when the packet is tunneled over IPv4
   routers, the Hop Limit does not decrease.  Every attack packet will
   traverse each hop along the loop 255/N times, where N is the number
   of IPv6 routers on the loop.  As a result, the loops can be used as
   traffic amplification tools with a ratio of 255/N. The number of IPv6
   routers on the loop is determined the positions of the two victims.
   The closer the two victims are, the larger the amplification ratio
   will be.


2.  Detailed Descriptions of the Attacks

   This section details three attacks that exemplify how the security
   vulnerability described above may be exploited.
