Abstract

   This document describes a method (464XLAT) for IPv4 connectivity
   across IPv6 network by combination of stateful translation and

Internet-Draft                   464XLAT                    October 2011


1.  Introduction

   On the 3rd of Feb 2011, IANA unallocated IPv4 address pool was
   exhausted.  And each RIR unallocated IPv4 address pool will be
   exhausted in the near future.  In this situation, it will be
   difficult for most ISPs to assign IPv4 global address to end users.
   This means the IPv4 Internet can not be scaling up in a conventional
   way.

   This document describes an IPv4 over IPv6 Translating solution as one
   of the measures of IPv4 address exhaustion and encouragement of IPv6
   deployment.

   This method (464XLAT) in this document is using twice IPv4/IPv6
   translation standardized in [RFC6145] and [RFC6146].  It does not
   need DNS64 [RFC6147] technology for the purpose of providing IPv4
   over IPv6 service by this method.  Therefore, we can reach IPv4
   single stack hosts that can not be resolved in DNS, for example, the
   IPv4 hosts without A Resource Record.  And, it is capable in
   providing IPv4/IPv6 translation service once, which will be needed in
   the future.  This feature is one of the advantages, because this can
   be an encouragement to gradually transition to IPv6.

   In conclusion, this method is a combination of existing technologies
   and a use case of service provided for Internet access service
   providers.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   PLAT:   PLAT is Provider side translator(XLAT).  A stateful
           translator complies with [RFC6146] that performs 1:N
           translation.  It translates global IPv6 address to global
           IPv4 address, and vice versa.

   CLAT:   CLAT is Customer side translator(XLAT).  A stateless
           translator complies with [RFC6145] that performs 1:1
           translation.  It algorithmically translates private IPv4
           address to global IPv6 address, and vice versa.  It has also
           IPv6 router function that can forward IPv6 packet for IPv6
           hosts in end-user network.  And furthermore, it has DNS Proxy

           function with IPv6 transport that provides name resolution
           for IPv4 hosts and IPv6 hosts in end-user network.  It does
           not need DNS64 [RFC6147] and ALG.  It is a simple and
           reasonable implementation.


4.  Network Architecture

   464XLAT method is shown in the following figure.

     v4p : IPv4 Private
     v4g : IPv4 Global

5.  Applicability

   When ISP has IPv6 access network infrastructure and 464XLAT, ISP can
   provide IPv4 service to end users.

   If the IXP or another provider operates the PLAT, all ISPs have to do
   is to deploy IPv6 access network.  All ISPs do not need IPv4
   facilities.  They can migrate quickly their operation to an IPv6-only
   environment.  Incidentally, Japan Internet Exchange(JPIX) is
   providing 464XLAT trial service since July 2010.

6.  Implementation Considerations

6.1.  IPv6 Address Format

   IPv6 address format in 464XLAT is presented in the following format.


       +-----------------------------------------------+---------------+
       |              XLAT prefix(96)                  |    IPv4(32)   |
       +-----------------------------------------------+---------------+

                      IPv6 Address Format for 464XLAT

   Source address and destination address have IPv4 address embedded in
   the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 address.  The format is defined in
   Section 2 of [RFC6052].  However, 464XLAT does not use the Well-Known
   Prefix "64:ff9b::/96".

6.2.  DNS Proxy Implementation

   CLAT perform DNS Proxy for IPv4 hosts and IPv6 hosts in end-user
   network.  It MUST provide name resolution with IPv6 transport.  It
   does not need DNS64 [RFC6147] function.

6.3.  IPv6 Fragment Header Consideration

   In the 464XLAT environment, the PLAT and CLAT SHOULD include an IPv6
   Fragment Header, since IPv4 host does not set the DF bit.  However,
   the IPv6 Fragment Header has been shown to cause operational
   difficulties in practice due to limited firewall fragmentation
   support, etc.  Therefore, the PLAT and CLAT may provide a
   configuration function that allows the PLAT and CLAT not to include
   the Fragment Header for the non-fragmented IPv6 packets.  At any
   rate, both behaviors SHOULD match.

6.4.  Auto Prefix Assignment

   Source IPv6 prefix assignment in CLAT is via DHCPv6 prefix delegation
   or another method.  Destination IPv6 prefix assignment in CLAT is via
   some method. (e.g., DHCPv6 option, TR-069, DNS, HTTP, etc.)


7.  Deployment Considerations

   Even if the Internet access provider for consumers is different from
   the PLAT provider (another Internet access provider or Internet
   exchange provider, etc.), it can implement traffic engineering
   independently from the PLAT provider.  Detailed reasons are below.

Internet-Draft                   464XLAT                    October 2011


   1.  The Internet access provider for consumers can figure out IPv4
       source address and IPv4 destination address from translated IPv6
       packet header, so it can implement traffic engineering based on
       IPv4 source address and IPv4 destination address (e.g. traffic
       monitoring for each IPv4 destination address, packet filtering,
       for each IPv4 destination address, etc.).  The Tunneling method
       don't have such a advantage, without any deep packet inspection
       for decapsulating tunnel packets.

   2.  If the Internet access provider for consumers can assign IPv6
       prefix greater than /64 for each subscriber, this 464XLAT method
       can separate IPv6 prefix for native IPv6 packets and XLAT prefix
       for IPv4/IPv6 translation packets.  Accordingly, it can identify
       the type of packets ("native IPv6 packets" and "IPv4/IPv6
       translation packets"), and implement traffic engineering based on
       IPv6 prefix.

   And this 464XLAT method have two capabilities.  One is a IPv6 -> IPv4
   -> IPv6 translation for sharing IPv4 global addresses, another is a
   IPv4 -> IPv6 translation for reaching IPv6 only servers from IPv4
   only clients that can not support IPv6.  IPv4 only clients will
   remain for a while.


8.  Security Considerations

   To implement a PLAT, see security considerations presented in Section
   5 of [RFC6146].

   To implement a CLAT, see security considerations presented in Section
   7 of [RFC6145].  And furthermore, the CLAT SHOULD perform Bogon
   filter, and SHOULD have IPv6 firewall function as a IPv6 router.  It
   is useful function for native IPv6 packet and translated IPv6 packet.
   The CLAT SHOULD check IPv6 packet received from WAN interface.  If
   the packet is invalid prefix (i.e., it is not XLAT prefix), then
   SHOULD silently drop the packet.  In addition, the CLAT SHOULD check
   IPv4 packet after the translation.  If the packet is not match
   private IPv4 address of LAN, then SHOULD silently drop the packet.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
