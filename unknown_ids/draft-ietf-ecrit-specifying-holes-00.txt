Internet-Draft           Service Boundary Holes                June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The LoST protocol [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] describes a protocol that's
   primary purpose is to map service and locations to destination
   addresses.  LoST does this by provisioning boundary maps or areas
   against service URNs.  The boundary is a polygon made up of sets of
   geodetic coordinates specifying an enclosed area.  In some
   circumstances an area enclosed by a polygon, also known as an
   exterior polygon, may contain exception areas, or holes, that for the
   same service must yield a different destination to that described by
   the larger area.  This document describes how holes SHOULD be
   specified in service boundaries defined using a GML encoding for the
   polygons and their internal elements (holes).  GML polygons are based
   on elements defined in [ISO-19107].

3.  Specifying Holes

   Holes related to an exterior boundary polygon MUST adhere to the
   following rules:

   Rule 1:   Two holes MUST NOT have more than one point of
             intersection.  If two or more holes share a common set of
             boundaries then to the primary polygon these represent a
             single hole in the service.  The internal elements (holes)
             should have common boundaries removed and a single hole
             created irrespective of whether the excluded area is itself
             made up of multiple service boundaries.

   Rule 2:   A hole MUST NOT have more than one point of intersection
             with the outer-boundary of the primary (exterior) polygon.
             If more than one point of intersection occurs the primary
             polygon is either doesn't have a hole, it has an inlet as
             in Figure 3, or the primary polygon SHOULD be expressed as
             two polygons as in Figure 4.

5.  Holes in GML Polygons

   A hole is specified in the polygon by defining an interior boundary.
   The points defining the internal boundary define the area represented
   by the hole in the primary (exterior) polygon.  The shaded area in
   Figure 6 is represented by the 4 points of the interior boundary
   specified in Figure 7.

6.  Service Boundary Specification and Selection Algorithm

   A service boundary is represented by a polygon that may have many
   vertices.  The enclosed area of the polygon represents the area in
   which a service, expressed as a service URN, maps to a single URI.
   [I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-lost-sync] describes how LoST servers may
   synchronize with one another and provides examples of possible
   boundary exchanges and data formats.  At the time of writing there is
   no standard format for service provisioning data into a LoST server,
   the format described in [I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-lost-sync] is used for
   the example in this section.

   Figure 6 shall be used to illustrate two service boundaries.  The
   first service boundary A->F shall be referred to as area-A, and the
   second service boundary w->z shall be referred to as area-w.  Further
   more area-A is directly represented by the GML encoding provided in
   Figure 7.  Area-w is represented as a hole in area-A by the interior
   boundary.  Since area-w is also a service boundary, a separate
   polygon describing this area is also required and is shown in
   Figure 8.


   <gml:Polygon srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">

   If this data were in a LoST server and was required in a neighbouring
   LoST server, the data transfer using the format in
   [I-D.schulzrinne-ecrit-lost-sync] would look similar to Figure 9.

                 Figure 9: Service Boundary Specifications

   It is considered likely that LoST servers will need to provide
   responses sufficiently quickly to allow real-time queries to be
   performed as part of an emergency call routing flow.  It is for this
   reason that databases supporting native geospatial query techniques
   are desirable and that service boundary specifications that are
   easily mapped to internal data structures are preferred.  The format
   described in this memo makes support for this operation easy, while
   allowing an arbitrary number of holes in a service boundary to be
   specified.

   Each primary polygon is stored in the geospatial database and mapped
   to a service URN and destination URI.  Holes may be stored as
   polygons in a separate table and mapped to the primary polygon.  When
   a location is found to map to a polygon, the exceptions table can be
   checked to see if the primary polygon contains any coverage holes.
   In general no holes will exist for a service boundary, so this check
   results in almost no overhead and the service mapping can be
   returned.  Where one or more holes are found to exist, the provided
   location is checked against each hole.  If the location is found to
   exist in one of the specified holes then the primary polygon can be
   discarded, and searching of the service boundary database can
   continue.
