1. Introduction 
    
   This document provides an applicability statement on the use of 
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and 
   mechanisms to Basic Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs) as 
   specified in [RFC4847].

   The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic Mode and the 
   Enhanced Mode. The Basic Mode of operation does not feature any 
   exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network and the 
   customer domain, while the Enhanced Mode of operation features 
   exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network and the 
   customer domain. 
    
   The main GMPLS protocols and mechanisms applicable to the L1VPN Basic 
   Mode are [L1VPN-BM], [L1VPN-BGP-DISC], and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC], along 
   with several other documents referenced within this document. 
    
   Note that discussion in this document is focused on areas where GMPLS 
   protocols and mechanisms are relevant. 
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in 
   [RFC3031], [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [RFC4202], [RFC4026] and 
   [RFC4847]. 
    
2. Basic Mode Overview 
    
   As described in [RFC4847], in the Basic Mode service model, there is 
   no routing exchange between the Customer Edge (CE) and the Provider 
   Edge (PE). CE-CE L1VPN connections (i.e., CE-CE VPN connection in 
   RFC4847) are set up by GMPLS signaling between the CE and the PE, and 
   then across the provider network. A L1VPN connection is limited to 
   the connection between CEs belonging to the same L1VPN. 
    
   Note that in L1VPNs, routing operates within the provider network and 
   may be used by PEs to exchange information specific to the L1VPNs 
   supported by the provider network (e.g., membership information). 
    
   In the L1VPN Basic Mode, the provider network is completely under the 
   control of the provider. This includes the PE-PE segment of the CE-CE 
   L1VPN connection that is controlled and computed by the provider (PE-
   PE segment control). On the other hand, the L1VPN itself, constructed 
   from a set of CEs and the L1VPN connections provided by the provider, 
   is under the control of each customer. This includes that a customer 
   can request between which CEs a connection is to be established 
   (topology control). Note that a customer may outsource the management 
   of its L1VPN to a third party, including to the provider itself. 
   There is a confidentiality requirement between the provider and each 
   customer. 
    
   [L1VPN-BM], which extends [RFC4208], specifies GMPLS signaling to 
   establish CE-CE L1VPN connections.

   [L1VPN-BGP-DISC] and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] specify alternative mechanisms 
   to exchange L1VPN membership information between PEs, based on BGP 
   and OSPF respectively. 
    
3. Supported Network Types 
    
3.1 Data Plane 
    
   The provider network can be constructed from any type of layer 1 
   switches, such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) switches, Optical 
   Cross-Connects (OXCs), or Photonic Cross-Connects (PXCs).  
   Furthermore, a PE may be an Ethernet Private Line (EPL) type of 
   device, that maps Ethernet frames onto layer 1 connections (by means 
   of Ethernet over TDM etc.). The provider network may be constructed 
   from switches providing a single switching granularity (e.g., only 
   VC3 switches), or from switches providing multiple switching 
   granularities (e.g., from VC3/VC4 switches, or from VC3 switches and 
   OXCs). The provider network may provide a single type of L1VPN 
   connection (e.g., VC3 connections only), or multiple types of 
   connection (e.g., VC3/VC4 connections, or VC3 connections and 
   wavelength connections). 
    
   A CE does not have to have the capability to switch at layer 1, but 
   it must be capable of receiving a layer 1 signal and either switching 
   it or terminating it with adaptation. 
    
   As described in [RFC4847] and [L1VPN-BM], a CE and a PE are connected 
   by one or more links. A CE may also be connected to more than one PE, 
   and a PE may have more than one CE connected to it. 
    
   A CE may belong to a single L1VPN, or to multiple L1VPNs, and a PE 
   may support one or more L1VPNs through a single CE or through 
   multiple CEs. 
    
3.2 Control Plane 
    
   The provider network is controlled by GMPLS. L1VPN Basic Mode 
   provider networks are limited to a single AS within the scope of this 
   document. Multi-AS Basic Mode L1VPNs are for future study. 
    
   As described in [RFC4847] and [L1VPN-BM], a CE and a PE need to be 
   connected by at least one control channel. It is necessary to 
   disambiguate control plane messages exchanged between a CE and a PE 
   if the CE-PE relationship is applicable to more than one L1VPN. This 
   makes it possible to determine to which L1VPN such control plane 
   messages apply. Such disambiguation can be achieved by allocating a 
   separate control channel to each L1VPN (either using a separate 
   physical channel, a separate logical channel such as an IP tunnel, or 
   using separate addressing). 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                  [Page 4] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
    
   GMPLS allows any type of control channel to be used, as long as there 
   is IP level reachability. In the L1VPN context, instantiation of a 
   control channel between a CE and a PE may differ depending on 
   security requirements, etc. This is discussed in Section 8. 
    
4. Addressing 
    
   As described in [L1VPN-BM], the L1VPN Basic Mode allows that customer 
   addressing realms overlap with each other, and also overlap with the 
   service provider addressing realm. That is, a customer network may 
   re-use addresses used by the provider network, and may re-use 
   addresses used in another customer network supported by the same 
   provider network. This is the same as in any other VPN model. 
    
   In addition, the L1VPN Basic Mode allows a CE-PE control channel 
   addressing realm overlap. That is, a CE-PE control channel address 
   (CE's address of this control channel and PE's address of this 
   control channel) is unique within the L1VPN they belong to, but not 
   necessarily unique across multiple L1VPNs.  
    
   Furthermore, once a L1VPN connection has been established, the L1VPN 
   Basic Mode does not enforce any restriction on address assignment for 
   this L1VPN connection (treated as a link) for customer network 
   operation (e.g., IP network, MPLS network). 
    
5. Provider Control of its Infrastructure 
    
5.1 Provisioning Model 
    
   As described in [L1VPN-BM], for each L1VPN that has at least one 
   customer-facing port on a given PE, the PE maintains a Port 
   Information Table (PIT) associated with that L1VPN. A PIT provides a 
   cross-reference between Customer Port Indices (CPIs) and Provider 
   Port Indices (PPIs) and contains a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples for all 
   the ports within the L1VPN. In addition, for local PE ports of a 
   given L1VPN the PE retains an identifier known as the VPN-PPI, and 
   this is stored in the PIT with the <CPI, PPI> tuples. 
    
   When a new CE belonging to one or more L1VPNs is added to a PE, PIT 
   entries associated to those L1VPNs need to be configured on the PE. 
   Section 4 of [L1VPN-BM] specifies such procedures: 
    
   - If no PIT exists for the L1VPN on the PE, a new PIT is created by 
     the provider and associated with the VPN identifier. 
    
   - The PIT (new or pre-existing) is updated to include information 
     related to the newly added CE. The VPN-PPI, PPI, and CPI are 
     installed in the PIT. Note that the PPI is well-known by the PE, 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                  [Page 5] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
     but the CPI must be discovered either through manual configuration 
     or automatically by mechanisms such as the Link Management Protocol 
     (LMP) [RFC4204]. In addition, a CE to PE control channel needs to 
     be configured. 
    
   - The updated PIT information needs to be configured in the PITs on 
     remote PE associated with the L1VPN. For such purposes, manual 
     configuration or some sort of auto-discovery mechanisms can be 
     used. [L1VPN-BGP-DISC] and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] specify alternative 
     auto-discovery mechanisms. 
    
   - In addition, remote PIT information associated with the L1VPN needs 
     to be configured on this PE if the PIT has been newly created. 
     Again, this can be achieved through manual configuration or through 
     auto-discovery, [L1VPN-BGP-DISC] and [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC]. 
    
   When L1VPN membership of an existing CE changes, or when a CE is 
   removed from a PE, similar procedures need to be applied to update 
   the local and remote PITs. 
    
5.2 PE-PE Segment Control 
    
   In the L1VPN Basic Mode, a PE-PE segment of a CE-CE L1VPN connection 
   is completely under the control of provider network. 
    
5.2.1 Path Computation and Establishment 
    
   A PE-PE segment of a CE-CE L1VPN connection may be established based 
   on various policies. Those policies can be applied per L1VPN or per 
   L1VPN connection. The policy is configured by the provider, possibly 
   based on the contracts with each customer. 
    
   Examples of PE-PE segment connection establishment polices supported 
   in the L1VPN Basic Mode are as follows. 
    
   - Policy 1: On-demand establishment, on-demand path computation 
   - Policy 2: On-demand establishment, pre-computed path 
   - Policy 3: Pre-establishment, pre-computed path 
    
   In each policy, the PE-PE path may be computed by the local PE, or by 
   a path computation entity outside of the local PE (e.g., a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655], or a management system). 
    
   In policies 2 and 3, pre-computation of paths (and pre-establishment 
   if applicable) can be done at the network planning phase, or just 
   before signaling (e.g., triggered by an off-line customer request). 
   As the result of pre-computation (and pre-establishment), there could 
   be multiple PE-PE segments for a specific pair of PEs. When a PE 
   receives a Path message from a CE for a L1VPN connection, a PE needs 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                  [Page 6] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
   to determine which PE-PE segment to use. In such cases, the provider 
   may want to control: 
    
   - Which L1VPN uses which PE-PE L1VPN segment. 
   - Which CE-CE L1VPN connection uses which PE-PE L1VPN segment. 
    
   The former requires mapping between the PIT and the PE-PE segment. 
   The latter requires some more sophisticated mapping method, for 
   example: 
    
   - Mapping between individual PIT entries and PE-PE segments. 
   - Use of a Path Key ID [Conf-Segment] supplied by the provider to the 
     CE, and signaled by the CE as part of the L1VPN connection request.  
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode does not preclude usage of other methods, if 
   applicable. 
    
   In policy 3, stitching or nesting is necessary in order to map the 
   CE-CE L1VPN connection to a pre-established PE-PE segment. 
    
5.2.2 Resource Management 
    
   The provider network may operate resource management based on various 
   policies. These policies can be applied per L1VPN or per L1VPN  
   connection. The policy is configured by the provider, possibly based 
   on the contracts with each customer. 
    
   For example, a provider may choose to partition the resources of the 
   provider network for limited use by different L1VPNs or customers. 
   Such a function might be achieved within the scope of the Basic Mode 
   using resource affinities [RFC3209], but the details of per-L1VPN 
   resource models (especially in terms of CE-PE routing) are considered 
   as part of the Enhanced Mode. 
    
5.2.3 Consideration of CE-PE TE information 
    
   [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] and [BGP-TE] allow CE-PE TE link information to be 
   injected into the provider network. This may be helpful for the 
   ingress PE to prevent connection setup failure due to lack of 
   resources or incompatible switching capabilities on remote CE-PE TE 
   links. 
    
   Furthermore, the L1VPN Basic Mode allows a remote CE to be reached 
   through more than one TE link connected to the same PE (single-homed) 
   or to different PEs (dual-homed). In such cases, to facilitate route 
   choice, the ingress CE needs to initiate signaling by specifying the 
   egress CE's router ID not the egress CPI in the Session Object and 
   ERO (if present) so as to not constrain the choice of route within 

 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                  [Page 7] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
   the provider network. Therefore, the CE's router ID needs to be 
   configured in the PITs. 
    
   Note that, as described in Section 7.2, consideration of the full 
   feature set enabled by dual-homing (such as resiliency) is out of 
   scope of the L1VPN Basic Mode. 
    
5.3 Connectivity Restriction 
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode allows restricting connection establishment 
   between CEs belonging to the same L1VPN for policy reasons (including 
   L1VPN security). Since the PIT at each PE is associated with a L1VPN, 
   this function can be easily supported. The restriction can be applied 
   at the ingress PE or at the egress PE according to the applicable 
   restriction policy, but note that applying the policy at the egress 
   may waste signaling effort within the network as L1VPN connections 
   are pointlessly attempted. 
    
   In addition, the L1VPN Basic Mode does not restrict use of any 
   advanced admission control based on various policies. 
    
6. Customer Control of its L1VPN 
    
6.1 Topology Control 
    
   In the L1VPN Basic Mode, L1VPN connection topology is controlled by 
   the customer. That is, a customer can request 
   setup/deletion/modification of L1VPN connections using signaling 
   mechanisms specified in [L1VPN-BM]. 
    
   Also note that if there are multiple CE-PE TE links (single-homed or 
   multi-homed), a customer can specify which CE-PE TE link to use to 
   support any L1VPN connection. Alternatively, a customer may let the 
   provider choose the CE-PE TE link at the egress side, as described in 
   Section 5.2.3. 
    
6.2 Note on Routing 
    
   A CE needs to obtain the remote CPI to which it wishes to request a 
   connection. Since, in the L1VPN Basic Mode, there is no routing 
   information exchange between a CE and a PE, there is no dynamic 
   mechanism supported as part of the Basic Mode L1VPN service, and the 
   knowledge of remote CPIs must be acquired in a L1VPN-specific way, 
   perhaps through configuration or through a directory server. 
    
   If a L1VPN is used by a customer to operate a private IP network, the 
   customer may wish to form routing adjacencies over the CE-CE L1VPN 
   connections. The L1VPN Basic Mode does not enforce any restriction on 

 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                  [Page 8] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
   such operation by a customer, and the use made of the L1VPN 
   connections is transparent to the provider network. 
    
   Furthermore, if a L1VPN is used by a customer to operate a private 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) or GMPLS network, the customer 
   may wish to treat a L1VPN connection as a Traffic Engineering (TE) 
   link, and this requires a CE-CE control channel. Note that a 
   Forwarding Adjacency [RFC4206] cannot be formed from the CE-CE L1VPN 
   connection in the Basic Mode because there is no routing exchange 
   between CE and PE - that is, the customer network and the provider 
   network do not share a routing instance, and the customer control 
   channel cannot be carried within the provider control plane. But 
   where the CE provides suitable adaptation (for example, where the 
   customer network is a packet-switched MPLS or GMPLS network) the 
   customer control channel may be in-band and a routing adjacency may 
   be formed between the CEs using the L1VPN connection. Otherwise, CE-
   CE control plane connectivity may form part of the L1VPN service 
   provided to the customer by the provider and may be achieved within 
   the L1VPN connection (for example, through the use of overhead bytes) 
   or through a dedicated control channel connection or tunnel. The 
   options available are discussed further in Section 10.2 of  
   [RFC4847]. 
    
7. Scalability and Resiliency 
    
7.1 Scalability 
    
   There are several factors that impact scalability. 
    
   o Number of L1VPNs (PITs) configured on each PE 
    
     With the increase of this number, information to be maintained on 
     the PE increases. Theoretically, the upper limit of the number of 
     L1VPNs supported in a provider network is governed by how the ID 
     associated with a L1VPN is allocated, and the number of PITs 
     configured on each PE is limited by this number. However, 
     implementations may impose arbitrary limits on the number of PITs 
     supported by any one PE. 
    
   o Number of CE-PE TE links for each L1VPN 
    
     With the increase of this number, information to be maintained in 
     each PIT increases. When auto-discovery mechanisms are used, the 
     amount of information that an auto-discovery mechanism can support 
     may restrict this number. 
    
     Note that [L1VPN-OSPF-DISC] floods membership information not only 
     among PEs, but also to all P nodes. This may lead to scalability 
     concerns, compared to [L1VPN-BGP-DISC], which distributes 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                  [Page 9] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
     membership information only among PEs. Alternatively, a separate 
     instance of the OSPF protocol can be used just between PEs for 
     distributing membership information. In such a case, Ps do not 
     participate in flooding. 
    
     Note that in the L1VPN Basic Mode, a PE needs to obtain only CE-PE 
     TE link information, and not customer routing information, which is 
     quite different from the mode of operation of a L3VPN. Therefore, 
     the scalability concern is considered to be less problematic. 
    
   o Number of L1VPN connections 
    
     With the increase of this number, information to be maintained on 
     each PE/P increases. When stitching or nesting is used, state to 
     be maintained at each PE increases compared to when connectivity is 
     achieved without stitching or nesting. 
    
     However, in a layer 1 core, this number is always bounded by the 
     available physical resource because each LSP uses a separate label 
     which is directly bound to a physical, switchable resource 
     (timeslot, lambda, fiber). Thus, it can be safely assumed that the 
     PEs/Ps can comfortably handle the number of LSPs that they may be 
     called on to switch for a L1VPN. 
    
7.2 Data Plane Resiliency 
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode supports following data plane recovery 
   techniques [L1VPN-BM]. 
    
   o PE-PE segment recovery 
    
     The CE indicates to protect the PE-PE segment by including 
     Protection Object specified in [RFC4873] in the Path message and 
     setting Segment Recovery Flags. The CE may also indicate the branch 
     and merge nodes by including Secondary Explicit Route Object. 
    
     Depending on the signaling mechanisms used within the provider 
     network, details on how to protect the PE-PE segment may differ as 
     follows. 
    
     - If LSP stitching or LSP hierarchy are used to provision the PE-PE 
       segment, then the PE-PE LSP may be protected using end-to-end 
       recovery within the provider network. 
    
     - If the CE-CE L1VPN connection is a single end-to-end LSP 
      (including if session shuffling is used), then the PE-PE LSP 
       segment may be protected using segment protection [RFC4873] 
    
   o CE-PE recovery and PE-PE recovery via link protection

     The CE indicates to protect ingress and egress CE-PE links as well 
     as links within the provider network by including Protection Object 
     specified in [RFC3473] and setting Link Flags in the Path message.  
    
     - The ingress and egress CE-PE link may be protected at a lower 
       layer  
    
     Depending on the signaling mechanisms used within the provider 
     network, details on how to protect links within the provider 
     network may differ as follows. 
    
     - If the PE-PE segment is provided as a single TE link (stitching 
       or hierarchy) so that the provider network can perform simple PE- 
       to-PE routing, then the TE link may offer link-level protection 
       through the instantiation of multiple PE-PE LSPs. 
    
     - The PE-PE segment may be provisioned using only link-protected 
       links within the core network. 
    
   Note that it is not possible to protect only the CE-PE portion or the 
   PE-PE portion by link protection because the CE-CE signaling request 
   asks for a certain level of link protection on all links used by the 
   LSP. Also, it is not possible to protect the CE-PE portion by link 
   recovery and the PE-PE portion by segment recovery at the same time. 
    
   CE-CE recovery through the use of connections from one CE to diverse 
   PEs (i.e., dual-homing) is not supported in the L1VPN Basic Mode. 
    
7.3 Control Plane Resiliency 
    
   The L1VPN Basic Mode allows use of GMPLS control plane resiliency 
   mechanisms. This includes, but not limited to, control channel 
   management in LMP [RFC4204] and fault handling in RSVP-TE ([RFC3473] 
   and [RSVP-GR]) between a CE and a PE as well as within the provider 
   network. 
    
8. Security 
    
   Security considerations are described in [RFC4847], and this section 
   describes how these considerations are addressed in the L1VPN Basic 
   Mode. 
    
8.1 Topology Confidentiality 
    
   As specified in [L1VPN-BM], a provider's topology confidentiality is 
   preserved by the Basic Mode. Since there is no routing exchange 
   between PE and CE, the customer network can gather no information 
   about the provider network. Further, as described in Section 4 of 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                 [Page 11] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
   [RFC4208], a PE may filter the information present in a Record Route 
   Object (RRO) that is signaled from the provider network to the 
   customer network. In addition, as described in Section 5 of [RFC4208] 
   and Section 4.4 of [L1VPN-BM], when a Notify message is sent to a CE, 
   it is possible to hide the provider internal address. This is 
   accomplished by a PE updating the Notify Node Address with its own 
   address when the PE receives NOTIFY_REQUEST object from the CE. 
    
   Even in the case of pre-computed and/or pre-signaled PE-PE segments, 
   provider topology confidentiality may be preserved through the use of 
   path key IDs [Conf-Segment]. 
    
   The customer's topology confidentiality cannot be completely hidden 
   from the provider network. At the least, the provider network will 
   know about the addresses and locations of CEs. Other customer 
   topology information will remain hidden from the provider in the 
   Basic Mode although care may be needed to protect the customer 
   control channel as described in Section 8.4. 
    
   The provider network is responsible for maintaining confidentiality 
   of topology information between customers and across L1VPNs. Since 
   there is no distribution of routing information from PE to CE in the 
   Basic Mode, there is no mechanism by which the provider could 
   accidentally, or deliberately but automatically, distribute this 
   information. 
    
8.2 External Control of the Provider Network 
    
   The provider network is protected from direct control from within 
   customer networks through policy and through filtering of signaling 
   messages. 
    
   There is a service-based policy installed at each PE that directs how 
   a PE should react to a L1VPN connection request received from any CE. 
   Each CE is configured at the PE (or through a policy server) for its 
   membership of a L1VPN, and so CEs cannot dynamically bind to a PE or 
   join a L1VPN. With this configuration comes the policy that tells the 
   PE how to react to a L1VPN connection request (for example, whether 
   to allow dynamic establishment of PE-PE connections). Thus, the 
   provider network is protected against spurious L1VPN connection 
   requests and can charge for all L1VPN connections according to the 
   service agreement with the customers. Hence the provider network is 
   substantially protected against denial of service attacks. 
    
   At the same time, if a Path message from a CE contains an Explicit 
   Route Object (ERO) specifying the route within provider network, it 
   is rejected by the PE. Thus, the customer network has no control over 
   the resources in the provider network.

8.3 Data Plane Security 
    
   As described in [RFC4847], at layer 1, data plane information is 
   normally assumed to be secure once connections are established since 
   those connections are dedicated to L1VPNs. That is, it is not 
   possible to communicate unless there is a connection. 
    
   In order to protect against mis-delivery, each L1VPN connection is 
   restricted to use only within a single L1VPN. That is, a L1VPN 
   connection does not connect CEs that are in different L1VPNs. In 
   order to realize this, the identity of CEs is assured as part of the 
   service contract. And upon receipt of a request for connection setup, 
   the provider network assures that the connection is requested between 
   CEs belonging to the same L1VPN. This is achieved as described in 
   Section 5.3. 
    
   Furthermore, customers can apply their own security mechanisms to 
   protect data plane information (CE-CE security). This includes IPsec 
   for IP traffic. 
    
8.4 Control Plane Security 
    
   There are two aspects for control plane security. 
    
   First, the entity connected over a CE-PE control channel must be 
   identified. This is done when a new CE is added as part of the 
   service contract and the necessary control channel is established. 
   This identification can use authentication procedures available in 
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209]. 
    
   Second, it must be possible to secure communication over a CE-PE 
   control channel. If a communication channel between the customer and 
   the provider (control channel, management interface) is physically 
   separate per customer, the communication channel could be considered 
   as secure. However, when the communication channel is physically 
   shared among customers, security mechanisms need to be available and 
   should be enforced. RSVP-TE [RFC3209] provides for tamper-protection 
   of signaling message exchanges. IPsec tunnels can further be used for 
   this purpose. 
    
   Note that even in the case of physically separate communication 
   channels, customers may wish to apply security mechanisms, such as 
   IPsec, to assure higher security, and such mechanisms must be 
   available. 
    
   Furthermore, the provider network needs mechanisms to detect Denial 
   of Service (DoS) attacks and to protect against them reactively and 
   proactively. In the Basic Mode, this relies on management systems. 
   For example, management systems collect and analyze statistics on 
 
 
T.Takeda, et al.          Expires April 2008                 [Page 13] 
draft-ietf-l1vpn-applicability-basic-mode-03.txt          October 2007 
 
 
   signaling requests from CEs, and protect against malicious behaviors 
   where necessary. 
    
   Lastly, it should be noted that customer control plane traffic 
   carried over the provider network between CEs needs to be protected. 
   Such protection is normally the responsibility of the customer 
   network and can use the security mechanisms of the customer signaling 
   and routing protocols (for example, RSVP-TE [RFC3209]) or may use 
   IPsec tunnels between CEs. CE-CE control plane security may form part 
   of the data plane protection where the control plane traffic is 
   carried in-band in the L1VPN connection. Where the CE-CE control 
   plane connectivity is provided as an explicit part of the L1VPN 
   service by the provider, control plane security should form part of 
   the service agreement between the provider and customer. 
    
9. Manageability Considerations 
    
   Manageability considerations are described in [RFC4847]. In the L1VPN 
   Basic Mode, we rely on management systems for various aspects of the 
   different service functions, such as fault management, configuration 
   and policy management, accounting management, performance management, 
   and security management (as described in Section 8). 
    
   In order to support various management functionalities, MIB modules 
   need to be supported. In particular, the GMPLS TE MIB (GMPLS-TE-STD-
   MIB) [RFC4802] can be used for GMPLS-based traffic engineering 
   configuration and management, while the TE Link MIB (TE-LINK-STD-MIB) 
   [RFC4220] can be used for TE links configuration and management.
