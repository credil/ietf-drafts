Abstract

   The fragmentation and reassembly algorithm specified in the base IPv6
   specification allows fragments to overlap.  This document
   demonstrates the security issues with allowing overlapping fragments
   and updates the IPv6 specification to explicitly forbid overlapping
   fragments.

Internet-Draft   Handling of overlapping IPv6 fragments    November 2008


1.  Introduction

   Fragmentation is used in IPv6 when the IPv6 packet will not fit
   inside the path MTU to its destination.  When fragmentation is
   performed an IPv6 node uses a fragment header as specified in section
   4.5 of the IPv6 base specification [RFC2460] to break down the
   datagram into smaller fragments that will fit in the path MTU.  The
   destination node receives these fragments and reassembles them.  The
   algorithm specified for fragmentation in [RFC2460] does not prevent
   the fragments from overlapping, and this can lead to some security
   issues with firewalls [RFC4942].  This document explores the issues
   that can be caused by overlapping fragments.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Overlapping Fragments

   Commonly used firewalls use the algorithm specified in [RFC1858] to
   weed out malicious packets that try to overwrite parts of the
   transport layer header to bypass inbound connection checks.
   [RFC1858] prevents an overlapping fragment attack on an upper layer
   protocol (in this case TCP) by recommending that packets with
   fragment offset 1 be dropped.  While this works well for IPv4
   fragments, it will not work for IPv6 fragments.  This is because the
   fragmentable part of the IPv6 packet can contain extension headers
   before the TCP header, making this check less effective.


3.  The attack

   This attack describes how a malicious node can bypass a firewall
   using overlapping fragments.  Consider a sufficiently large IPv6
   packet that needs to be fragmented.

   packet can fit inside the path MTU.  Let's say the packet is split
   into two fragments.

   +------------------+--------+--------------------+
   |  Unfragmentable  |Fragment|       first        |

   |       Part       | Header |      fragment      |
   +------------------+--------+--------------------+

   Consider the first fragment.  Let's say it contains a destination
   options header (DOH) 80 octets long and is followed by a TCP header.

                         Figure 3: First Fragment

   The TCP header has the following values of the flags S(YN)=1 and
   A(CK)=1.  This makes an inspecting stateful firewall think that it is
   a response packet for a connection request initiated from the trusted
   side of the firewall.  Hence it will allow the fragment to pass.  It
   will also allow the following fragments with the same Fragment
   Identification value in the fragment header to pass through.

   A malicious node can form a second fragment with a TCP header that
   changes the flags and sets S(YN)=1 and A(CK)=0.  This would change
   the packet on the receiving end to consider the packet as a
   connection request instead of a response.  By doing this the
   malicious node has bypassed the firewall's access control to initiate
   a connection request to a node protected by a firewall.

                         Figure 4: Second Fragment

   Note that this attack is much more serious in IPv6 than in IPv4.  In
   IPv4 the overlapping part of the TCP header did not include the
   source and destination ports.  In IPv6 the attack can easily work to
   replace the source or destination port with an overlapping fragment.


4.  Recommendation

   IPv6 nodes transmitting datagrams that need to be fragmented MUST NOT
   create overlapping fragments.  IPv6 nodes that receive a fragment
   that overlaps with a previously received fragment MUST cease the
   reassembly process and MUST ignore further fragments with the same
   IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address and Fragment
   Identification.  It MUST also discard the previously received
   fragments with the same IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address
   and Fragment Identification.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses an attack that can be used to bypass IPv6
   firewalls using overlapping fragments.  It recommends disallowing
   overlapping fragments in order to prevent this attack.
