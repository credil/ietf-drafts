Abstract

   This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility.  Unlike
   unicast traceroute, multicast traceroute requires special
   implementations on the part of routers.  This specification describes
   the required functionality in multicast routers, as well as how
   management applications can use the router functionality.

1.  Introduction

   The unicast "traceroute" program allows the tracing of a path from
   one machine to another.  The key mechanism for unicast traceroute is
   the ICMP TTL exceeded message, which is specifically precluded as a
   response to multicast packets.  On the other hand, the multicast
   traceroute facility allows the tracing of an IP multicast routing
   paths.  In this document, we specify the multicast "traceroute"
   facility to be implemented in multicast routers and accessed by
   diagnostic programs.  The multicast traceroute described in this
   document named as mtrace version 2 or mtrace2 provides additional
   information about packet rates and losses that the unicast traceroute
   cannot, and generally requires fewer packets to be sent.

    o.  To be able to trace the path that a packet would take from some
        source to some destination.

    o.  To be able to isolate packet loss problems (e.g., congestion).

    o.  To be able to isolate configuration problems (e.g., TTL
        threshold).

    o.  To minimize packets sent (e.g. no flooding, no implosion).

   This document supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast traceroute
   facility.  The protocol design, concept, and program behavior are
   same between IPv4 and IPv6 mtrace2.  While the original IPv4
   multicast traceroute, mtrace, the query and response messages are
   implemented as IGMP messages [4], all mtrace2 messages are carried on
   UDP.  The packet formats of IPv4 and IPv6 mtrace2 are different
   because of the different address families, but the syntax is similar.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   Since multicast traceroutes flow in the opposite direction to the
   data flow, we refer to "upstream" and "downstream" with respect to
   data, unless explicitly specified.

   Incoming interface:
   The interface on which traffic is expected from the specified source
   and group.

   Outgoing interface:
   The interface on which traffic is forwarded from the specified source
   and group toward the destination.  It is the interface on which the
   multicast traceroute Request was received.

   Previous-hop router:
   The router that is on the link attached to the Incoming Interface and
   is responsible for forwarding traffic for the specified source and
   group.

   Group state:
   It is the state in which a shared-tree protocol (e.g., PIM-SM [12])
   running on a router chooses the previous-hop router toward the core
   router or Rendezvous Point (RP) as its parent router.  In this state,
   source-specific state is not available for the corresponding
   multicast address on the router.

   Source-specific state:
   It is the state in which a routing protocol running on a router
   chooses the path that would be followed for a source-specific join.

   ALL-[protocol]-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET:
   It is a dedicated multicast address for a multicast router to
   communicate with other routers that are working with the same routing
   protocol.  For instance,the address of ALL-PIM-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET is
   '224.0.0.13' for IPv4 and 'ff02::d' for IPv6.

3.  Overview

   Given a multicast distribution tree, tracing from a source to a
   multicast destination is hard, since you don't know down which branch
   of the multicast tree the destination lies.  This means that you have
   to flood the whole tree to find the path from one source to one
   destination.  However, walking up the tree from destination to source
   is easy, as most existing multicast routing protocols know the
   previous hop for each source.  Tracing from destination to source can
   involve only routers on the direct path.

   The party requesting the traceroute (which need be neither the source
   nor the destination) sends a traceroute Query packet to the last-hop
   multicast router for the given destination.  The last-hop router
   turns the Query into a Request packet by adding a response data block
   containing its interface addresses and packet statistics, and then
   forwards the Request packet via unicast to the router that it
   believes is the proper previous hop for the given source and group.
   Each hop adds its response data to the end of the Request packet,
   then unicast forwards it to the previous hop.  The first hop router
   (the router that believes that packets from the source originate on
   one of its directly connected networks) changes the packet type to
   indicate a Response packet and sends the completed response to the
   response destination address.  The response may be returned before
   reaching the first hop router if a fatal error condition such as "no
   route" is encountered along the path.

   Multicast traceroute uses any information available to it in the
   router to attempt to determine a previous hop to forward the trace
   towards.  Multicast routing protocols vary in the type and amount of
   state they keep; multicast traceroute endeavors to work with all of
   them by using whatever is available.  For example, if a PIM-SM router
   is on the (*,G) tree, it chooses the parent towards the RP as the
   previous hop.  In these cases, no source/group-specific state is
   available, but the path may still be traced.

4.  Packet Formats

   Mtrace2 message is encoded in TLV format.  If an implementation
   receives a TLV whose length exceeds the TLV length specified in the
   Length field, the TLV SHOULD be accepted but any additional data
   SHOULD be ignored.

4.1.  Mtrace2 TLV format

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Type      |           Length              |   Value ....  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type (8 bits)

   Length (16 bits)

   Value (variable length)

4.2.  Defined TLVs

   The following TLV Types are defined:

                   Code                  Type
                  ======      ============================
                    1               Mtrace2 Query
                    2               Mtrace2 Response

   The type field is defined to be "0x1" for traceroute queries and
   requests.  The type field is changed to "0x2" when the packet is
   completed and sent as a response from the first hop router to the
   querier.  Two codes are required so that multicast routers won't
   attempt to process a completed response in those cases where the
   initial query was issued from a router or the response is sent via
   multicast.

5.  Mtrace2 Header

   The mtrace2 message is carried as a UDP packet.  The UDP source port
   is uniquely selected by the local host operating system.  The UDP
   destination port is the IANA reserved mtrace2 port number (see
   Section 12).  The UDP checksum MUST be valid in mtrace2 control
   messages.

   The mtrace2 includes the common packet header as follows.  The header
   is only filled in by the originator of the traceroute Query;
   intermediate routers MUST NOT modify any of the fields.

5.1.  # hops: 8 bits

   This field specifies the maximum number of hops that the requester
   wants to trace.  If there is some error condition in the middle of
   the path that keeps the traceroute request from reaching the first-
   hop router, this field can be used to perform an expanding-ring
   search to trace the path to just before the problem.

5.2.  Multicast Address

   This field specifies the 32 bits length IPv4 or 128 bits length IPv6
   multicast address to be traced, or is filled with "all 1" in case of
   IPv4 or with the unspecified address (::) in case of IPv6 if no
   source-specific information is desired.  Note that non-group-specific
   traceroutes may not be possible with certain multicast routing
   protocols.

5.3.  Source Address

   This field specifies the 32 bits length IPv4 or 128 bits length IPv6
   address of the multicast source for the path being traced, or is
   filled with "all 1" in case of IPv4 or with the unspecified address
   (::) in case of IPv6 if no source-specific information is desired.
   Note that non-source-specific traceroutes may not be possible with
   certain multicast routing protocols.

5.4.  Destination Address

   This field specifies the 32 bits length IPv4 or 128 bits length IPv6
   address of the multicast receiver for the path being traced.  The
   trace starts at this destination and proceeds toward the traffic
   source.

5.5.  Response Address

   This field specifies 32 bits length IPv4 or 128 bits length IPv6
   address to which the completed traceroute response packet gets sent.
   It can be a unicast address or a multicast address, as explained in
   Section 8.2

5.6.  Resp TTL/HopLim: 8 bits

   This field specifies the TTL or Hop Limit at which to multicast the
   response, if the response address is a multicast address.

5.7.  Query ID: 24 bits

   This field is used as a unique identifier for this traceroute request
   so that duplicate or delayed responses may be detected and to
   minimize collisions when a multicast response address is used.

6.1.  Query Arrival Time: 32 bits

   The Query Arrival Time is a 32-bit NTP timestamp specifying the
   arrival time of the traceroute request packet at this router.  The
   32-bit form of an NTP timestamp consists of the middle 32 bits of the
   full 64-bit form; that is, the low 16 bits of the integer part and
   the high 16 bits of the fractional part.

   The following formula converts from a UNIX timeval to a 32-bit NTP
   timestamp:

      query_arrival_time
      = (tv.tv_sec + 32384) << 16 + ((tv.tv_usec << 10) / 15625)

   The constant 32384 is the number of seconds from Jan 1, 1900 to Jan

   1, 1970 truncated to 16 bits. ((tv.tv_usec << 10) / 15625) is a
   reduction of ((tv.tv_usec / 100000000) << 16).

6.2.  Incoming Interface Address: 32 bits

   This field specifies the address of the interface on which packets
   from this source and group are expected to arrive, or 0 if unknown.

6.3.  Outgoing Interface Address: 32 bits

   This field specifies the address of the interface on which packets
   from this source and group flow to the specified destination, or 0 if
   unknown.

6.4.  Previous-Hop Router Address: 32 bits

   This field specifies the router from which this router expects
   packets from this source.  This may be a multicast group (e.g.  ALL-
   [protocol]-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET) if the previous hop is not known
   because of the workings of the multicast routing protocol.  However,
   it should be 0 if the incoming interface address is unknown.

6.5.  Input packet count on incoming interface: 64 bits

   This field contains the number of multicast packets received for all
   groups and sources on the incoming interface, or "all 1" if no count
   can be reported.  This counter may have the same value as
   ifHCInMulticastPkts from the IF-MIB [10] for this interface.

6.6.  Output packet count on incoming interface: 64 bits

   This field contains the number of multicast packets that have been
   transmitted or queued for transmission for all groups and sources on
   the outgoing interface, or "all 1" if no count can be reported.  This
   counter may have the same value as ifHCOutMulticastPkts from the IF-
   MIB for this interface.

6.7.  Total number of packets for this source-group pair: 64 bits

   This field counts the number of packets from the specified source
   forwarded by this router to the specified group, or "all 1" if no
   count can be reported.  If the S bit is set, the count is for the
   source network, as specified by the Src Mask field.  If the S bit is
   set and the Src Mask field is 63, indicating no source-specific
   state, the count is for all sources sending to this group.  This
   counter should have the same value as ipMcastRoutePkts from the
   IPMROUTE-STD-MIB [11] for this forwarding entry.

6.8.  Rtg Protocol: 8 bits

   This field describes the routing protocol in use between this router
   and the previous-hop router.  Specified values include:

             0    Unknown
             1    PIM
             2    PIM using special routing table
             3    PIM using a static route
             4    PIM using MBGP route
             5    PIM using state created by Assert processing
             6    Bi-directional PIM
             7    IGMP/MLD proxy
             8    AMT Relay
             9    AMT Gateway

6.9.  Fwd TTL: 8 bits

   This field contains the TTL that a packet is required to have before
   it will be forwarded over the outgoing interface.

6.10.  MBZ: 1 bit

   Must be zeroed on transmission and ignored on reception.

6.11.  S: 1 bit

   This S bit indicates that the packet count for the source-group pair
   is for the source network, as determined by masking the source
   address with the Src Mask field.

6.12.  Src Mask: 6 bits

   This field contains the number of 1's in the netmask this router has
   for the source (i.e. a value of 24 means the netmask is 0xffffff00).
   If the router is forwarding solely on group state, this field is set
   to 63 (0x3f).

6.13.  Forwarding Code: 8 bits

   This field contains a forwarding information/error code.  Section 8.2
   explains how and when the forwarding code is filled.  Defined values
   are as follows;

     Value   Name            Description

   This field specifies the interface ID on which packets from this
   source and group are expected to arrive, or 0 if unknown.  This ID
   should be the value taken from InterfaceIndex of the IF-MIB [10] for
   this interface.  This field is carried in network byte order.

7.3.  Outgoing Interface ID: 32 bits

   This field specifies the interface ID on which packets from this
   source and group flow to the specified destination, or 0 if unknown.
   This ID should be the value taken from InterfaceIndex of the IF-MIB
   for this interface.  This field is carried in network byte order.

7.4.  Local Address

   This field specifies a global IPv6 address that uniquely identifies
   the router.  A unique local unicast address [6] SHOULD NOT be used
   unless the node is only assigned link-local and unique local
   addresses.  [TBD: What if the node is only assigned link-local
   addresses?  It should be very unlikely case, but is possible even for
   a properly working router.]

   Note that since interface indices used in the Incoming and Outgoing
   Interface ID fields are node-local information, a global identifier
   is needed to specify the router.

7.5.  Remote Address

   This field specifies the address of the previous-hop router, which,
   in most cases, is a link-local unicast address for the queried source
   and destination addresses.

   Although a link-local address does not have enough information to
   identify a node, it is possible to detect the previous-hop router
   with the assistance of Incoming Interface ID and the current router
   address (i.e., Local Address).

   This may be a multicast group (e.g., ALL-[protocol]-
   ROUTERS.MCAST.NET) if the previous hop is not known because of the
   workings of the multicast routing protocol.  However, it should be
   the unspecified address (::) if the incoming interface address is
   unknown.

7.8.  Total number of packets for this source-group pair

   This field counts the number of packets from the specified source
   forwarded by this router to the specified group, or "all 1" if no
   count can be reported.  If the S bit is set, the count is for the
   source network, as specified by the Src Prefix Len field.  If the S
   bit is set and the Src Prefix Len field is 255, indicating no source-
   specific state, the count is for all sources sending to this group.
   This counter should have the same value as ipMcastRoutePkts from the
   IPMROUTE-STD-MIB for this forwarding entry.

   Same definition described in Section 6.8

7.10.  MBZ: 7 bits

   Must be zeroed on transmission and ignored on reception.

7.11.  S: 1 bit

   This S bit indicates that the packet count for the source-group pair
   is for the source network, as determined by masking the source
   address with the Src Prefix Len field.

7.12.  Src Prefix Len: 8 bits

   This field contains the prefix length this router has for the source.
   If the router is forwarding solely on group state, this field is set
   to 255 (0xff)

8.  Router Behavior

   All of these actions are performed in addition to (NOT instead of)
   forwarding the packet, if applicable.  E.g. a multicast packet that
   has TTL or the hop limit remaining MUST be forwarded normally, as
   MUST a unicast packet that has TTL or the hop limit remaining and is
   not addressed to this router.

8.1.  Traceroute Query

   An mtrace2 Query message is a traceroute message with no response
   blocks filled in, and uses TLV type 0x1 for IPv4 and IPv6 mtrace2.

8.1.1.  Packet Verification

   Upon receiving an mtrace2 Query message, a router must examine the
   Query to see if it is the proper last-hop router for the destination
   address in the packet.  It is the proper last-hop router if it has a
   multicast-capable interface on the same subnet as the Destination
   Address and is the router that would forward traffic from the given
   (S,G) onto that subnet.

   If the router determines that it is not the proper last-hop router,
   or it cannot make that determination, it does one of two things
   depending if the Query was received via multicast or unicast.  If the
   Query was received via multicast, then it MUST be silently dropped.
   If it was received via unicast, a forwarding code of WRONG_LAST_HOP
   is noted and processing continues as in Section 8.2

   Duplicate Query messages as identified by the tuple (IP Source, Query
   ID) SHOULD be ignored.  This MAY be implemented using a simple 1-back
   cache (i.e. remembering the IP source and Query ID of the previous
   Query message that was processed, and ignoring future messages with
   the same IP Source and Query ID).  Duplicate Request messages MUST
   NOT be ignored in this manner.

8.1.2.  Normal Processing

   When a router receives an mtrace2 Query and it determines that it is
   the proper last-hop router, it treats it like an mtrace2 Request and
   performs the steps listed in Section 8.2

8.2.  Mtrace2 Request

   An mtrace2 Request is a traceroute message with some number of
   response blocks filled in, and uses TLV type 0x1 for IPv4 and IPv6
   mtrace2.  Routers can tell the difference between Queries and
   Requests by checking the length of the packet.

8.2.1.  Packet Verification

   If the mtrace2 Request is not addressed to this router, or if the
   Request is addressed to a multicast group which is not a link-scoped
   group (i.e. 224/24 for IPv4, FFx2::/16 [3] for IPv6), it MUST be
   silently ignored.

8.2.2.  Normal Processing

   When a router receives an mtrace2 Request, it performs the following
   steps.  Note that it is possible to have multiple situations covered
   by the Forwarding Codes.  The first one encountered is the one that
   is reported, i.e. all "note forwarding code N" should be interpreted
   as "if forwarding code is not already set, set forwarding code to N".

   1.   If there is room in the current buffer (or the router can
        efficiently allocate more space to use), insert a new response
        block into the packet and fill in the Query Arrival Time,
        Outgoing Interface Address (for IPv4 mtrace2) or Outgoing
        Interface ID (for IPv6 mtrace2), Output Packet Count, and Fwd
        TTL (for IPv4 mtrace2).  If there was no room, fill in the
        response code "NO_SPACE" in the *previous* hop's response block,
        and forward the packet to the requester as described in
        Section 8.4.

   2.   Attempt to determine the forwarding information for the source
        and group specified, using the same mechanisms as would be used
        when a packet is received from the source destined for the
        group.  State need not be instantiated, it can be "phantom"
        state created only for the purpose of the trace.

        If using a shared-tree protocol and there is no source-specific
        state, or if the source is specified as "all 1", group state
        should be used.  If there is no group state or the group is
        specified as 0, potential source state (i.e. the path that would
        be followed for a source-specific Join) should be used.  If this
        router is the Core or RP and no source-specific information is
        available, note an error code of REACHED_RP.

   3.   If no forwarding information can be determined, the router notes
        an error code of NO_ROUTE, sets the remaining fields that have
        not yet been filled in to zero, and then forwards the packet to
        the requester as described in Section 8.4.

   4.   Fill in the Incoming Interface Address, Previous-Hop Router
        Address, Input Packet Count, Total Number of Packets, Routing
        Protocol, S, and Src Mask from the forwarding information that
        was determined.

   5.   If traceroute is administratively prohibited or the previous hop
        router does not understand traceroute requests, note the
        appropriate forwarding code (ADMIN_PROHIB or OLD_ROUTER).  If
        traceroute is administratively prohibited and any of the fields
        as filled in step 4 are considered private information, zero out
        the applicable fields.  Then the packet is forwarded to the
        requester as described in Section 8.4.

   6.   If the reception interface is not enabled for multicast, note
        forwarding code NO_MULTICAST.  If the reception interface is the
        interface from which the router would expect data to arrive from
        the source, note forwarding code RPF_IF.  Otherwise, if the
        reception interface is not one to which the router would forward
        data from the source to the group, a forwarding code of WRONG_IF
        is noted.

   7.   If the group is subject to administrative scoping on either the
        Outgoing or Incoming interfaces, a forwarding code of SCOPED is
        noted.

   8.   If this router is the Rendezvous Point or Core for the group, a
        forwarding code of REACHED_RP is noted.

   9.   If this router has sent a prune upstream which applies to the
        source and group in the traceroute Request, it notes forwarding
        code PRUNE_SENT.  If the router has stopped forwarding
        downstream in response to a prune sent by the next hop router,
        it notes forwarding code PRUNE_RCVD.  If the router should
        normally forward traffic for this source and group downstream
        but is not, it notes forwarding code NOT_FORWARDING.

   10.  The packet is then sent on to the previous hop or the requester
        as described in Section 8.4.

8.3.  Mtrace2 Response

   A router must forward all mtrace2 response packets normally, with no
   special processing.  If a router has initiated an mtrace2 with a
   Query or Request message, it may listen for Responses to that
   traceroute but MUST still forward them as well.

8.4.  Forwarding Mtrace2 Requests

   If the Previous-hop router is known for this request, the packet is
   sent to that router.  If the Incoming Interface is known but the
   Previous-hop router is not known, the packet is sent to an
   appropriate multicast address on the Incoming Interface.  The
   appropriate multicast address may depend on the routing protocol in

   use, MUST be a link-scoped group (i.e. 224/24 for IPv4, FF02::/16 for
   IPv6), MUST NOT be ALL-SYSTEMS.MCAST.NET (224.0.0.1) for IPv4 and All
   Nodes Address (FF02::1) for IPv6, and MAY be ALL-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET
   (224.0.0.2) for IPv4 or All Routers Address (FF02::2) for IPv6 if the
   routing protocol in use does not define a more appropriate group.
   Otherwise, it is sent to the Response Address in the header, as
   described in Section 8.5.

8.5.  Sending Mtrace2 Responses

8.5.1.  Destination Address

   An mtrace2 response must be sent to the Response Address in the
   traceroute header.

8.5.2.  TTL and Hop Limit

   If the Response Address is unicast, the router inserts its normal
   unicast TTL or hop limit in the IP header.  If the Response Address
   is multicast, the router copies the Response TTL or hop limit from
   the traceroute header into the IP header.

8.5.3.  Source Address

   If the Response Address is unicast, the router may use any of its
   interface addresses as the source address.  Since some multicast
   routing protocols forward based on source address, if the Response
   Address is multicast, the router MUST use an address that is known in
   the multicast routing topology if it can make that determination.

8.5.4.  Sourcing Multicast Responses

   When a router sources a multicast response, the response packet MUST
   be sent on a single interface, then forwarded as if it were received
   on that interface.  It MUST NOT source the response packet
   individually on each interface, in order to avoid duplicate packets.

8.6.  Hiding Information

   Information about a domain's topology and connectivity may be hidden
   from multicast traceroute requests.  The exact mechanism is not
   specified here; however, the INFO_HIDDEN forwarding code may be used
   to note that, for example, the incoming interface address and packet
   count are for the entrance to the domain and the outgoing interface
   address and packet count are the exit from the domain.  The source-
   group packet count may be from either router or not specified (all
   1).

9.  Client Behavior

9.1.  Sending Mtrace2 Query

   When the destination of the mtrace2 is the machine running the
   client, the mtrace2 Query packet can be sent to the ALL-
   ROUTERS.MCAST.NET (224.0.0.2) for IPv4 or All Routers Address
   (FF02::2) for IPv6.  This will ensure that the packet is received by
   the last-hop router on the subnet.  Otherwise, if the proper last-hop
   router is known for the mtrace2 destination, the Query could be
   unicasted to that router.  Otherwise, the Query packet should be
   multicasted to the group being queried; if the destination of the
   mtrace2 is a member of the group, this will get the Query to the
   proper last-hop router.  In this final case, the packet should
   contain the Router Alert option [8][9], to make sure that routers
   that are not members of the multicast group notice the packet.

   See also Section 9.4 on determining the last-hop router.

9.2.  Determining the Path

   The client could send a small number of initial query messages with a
   large "# hops" field, in order to try to trace the full path.  If
   this attempt fails, one strategy is to perform a linear search (as
   the traditional unicast traceroute program does); set the "# hops"
   field to 1 and try to get a response, then 2, and so on.  If no
   response is received at a certain hop, the hop count can continue
   past the non-responding hop, in the hopes that further hops may
   respond.  These attempts should continue until a user-defined timeout
   has occurred.

   See also Section 9.5 and Section 9.6 on receiving the results of a
   trace.

9.3.  Collecting Statistics

   After a client has determined that it has traced the whole path or as
   much as it can expect to (see Section 9.7), it might collect
   statistics by waiting a short time and performing a second trace.  If
   the path is the same in the two traces, statistics can be displayed
   as described in Section 11.3 and Section 11.4.

9.4.  Last Hop Router

   The mtrace2 querier may not know which is the last hop router, or
   that router may be behind a firewall that blocks unicast packets but
   passes multicast packets.  In these cases, the mtrace2 request should
   be multicasted to ALL-ROUTERS.MCAST.NET (224.0.0.2) for IPv4 or All

Internet-Draft                   Mtrace2                       July 2008


   Routers Address (FF02::2) for IPv6.  All routers except the correct
   last hop router should ignore any mtrace2 request received via
   multicast.  Mtrace2 requests which are multicasted to the group being
   traced must include the Router Alert option[8][9].

   Another alternative is to unicast to the trace destination.  Mtrace2
   requests which are unicasted to the trace destination must include
   the Router Alert option, in order that the last-hop router is aware
   of the packet.

9.5.  First Hop Router

   The mtrace2 querier may not be unicast reachable from the first hop
   router.  In this case, the querier should set the traceroute response
   address to a multicast address, and should set the response TTL (or
   hop limit) to a value sufficient for the response from the first hop
   router to reach the querier.  It may be appropriate to start with a
   small TTL and increase in subsequent attempts until a sufficient TTL
   is reached, up to an appropriate maximum (such as 192).

   The IANA has assigned 224.0.1.32, MTRACE.MCAST.NET as the default
   multicast group for IPv4 mtrace2 responses, and will assign
   MTRACE2_IPV6RESPADDR (TBD (see Section 12)) for IPv6 mtrace2
   responses.  Other groups may be used if needed, e.g. when using
   mtrace2 to diagnose problems with the IANA-assigned group.

9.6.  Broken Intermediate Router

   A broken intermediate router might simply not understand traceroute
   packets, and drop them.  The querier would then get no response at
   all from its traceroute requests.  It should then perform a hop-by-
   hop search by setting the number of responses field until it gets a
   response (both linear and binary search are options, but binary is
   likely to be slower because a failure requires waiting for a
   timeout).

9.7.  Mtrace2 Termination

   When performing an expanding hop-by-hop trace, it is necessary to
   determine when to stop expanding.

9.7.1.  Arriving at source

   A trace can be determined to have arrived at the source if the
   Incoming Interface of the last router in the trace is non-zero, but
   the Previous Hop router is zero.

9.7.2.  Fatal error

   A trace has encountered a fatal error if the last Forwarding Error in
   the trace has the 0x80 bit set.

9.7.3.  No previous hop

   A trace can not continue if the last Previous Hop in the trace is set
   to 0.

9.7.4.  Traceroute shorter than requested

   If the trace that is returned is shorter than requested (i.e. the
   number of Response blocks is smaller than the "# hops" field), the
   trace encountered an error and could not continue.

9.8.  Continuing after an error

   When the NO_SPACE error occurs, the client might try to continue the
   trace by starting it at the last hop in the trace.  It can do this by
   unicasting to this router's outgoing interface address, keeping all
   fields the same.  If this results in a single hop and a "WRONG_IF"
   error, the client may try setting the trace destination to the same
   outgoing interface address.

   If a trace times out, it is likely to be because a router in the
   middle of the path does not support multicast traceroute.  That
   router's address will be in the Previous Hop field of the last entry
   in the last response packet received.  A client may be able to
   determine (via mrinfo or SNMP [6][11]) a list of neighbors of the
   non-responding router.  If desired, each of those neighbors could be
   probed to determine the remainder of the path.  Unfortunately, this
   heuristic may end up with multiple paths, since there is no way of
   knowing what the non-responding router's algorithm for choosing a
   previous-hop router is.  However, if all paths but one flow back
   towards the non-responding router, it is possible to be sure that
   this is the correct path.

10.  Protocol-Specific Considerations

10.1.  PIM-SM

   When a multicast traceroute reaches a PIM-SM RP and the RP does not
   forward the trace on, it means that the RP has not performed a
   source-specific join so there is no more state to trace.  However,
   the path that traffic would use if the RP did perform a source-
   specific join can be traced by setting the trace destination to the
   RP, the trace source to the traffic source, and the trace group to 0.
   This trace Query may be unicasted to the RP.

10.2.  Bi-Directional PIM

   Bi-directional PIM [13] is a variant of PIM-SM that builds bi-
   directional shared trees connecting multicast sources and receivers.
   Along the bi-directional shared trees, multicast data is natively
   forwarded from sources to the RPA (Rendezvous Point Address) and from
   the RPA to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  In
   contrast to PIM-SM, RP always has the state to trace.

   A Designated Forwarder (DF) for a given RPA is in charge of
   forwarding downstream traffic onto its link, and forwarding upstream
   traffic from its link towards the RPL (Rendezvous Point Link) that
   the RPA belongs to.  Hence mtrace2 reports DF addresses or RPA along
   the path.

10.3.  PIM-DM

   Routers running PIM Dense Mode do not know the path packets would
   take unless traffic is flowing.  Without some extra protocol
   mechanism, this means that in an environment with multiple possible
   paths with branch points on shared media, multicast traceroute can
   only trace existing paths, not potential paths.  When there are
   multiple possible paths but the branch points are not on shared
   media, the previous hop router is known, but the last hop router may
   not know that it is the appropriate last hop.

   When traffic is flowing, PIM Dense Mode routers know whether or not
   they are the last-hop forwarder for the link (because they won or
   lost an Assert battle) and know who the previous hop is (because it
   won an Assert battle).  Therefore, multicast traceroute is always
   able to follow the proper path when traffic is flowing.

10.4.  IGMP/MLD Proxy

   When a mtrace2 Query packet reaches an incoming interface of IGMP/MLD
   Proxy [14], it must be simply discarded.  When a mtrace2 Query packet

   reaches an outgoing interface of IGMP/MLD Proxy, it is forwarded
   through its incoming interface towards the upstream router.

10.5.  AMT

   AMT [15] provides the multicast connectivity to the unicast-only
   inter-network.  To do this, multicast packets being sent to or from a
   site are encapsulated in unicast packets.  When a mtrace2 Query
   packet reaches an AMT Pseudo-Interface of an AMT Gateway, the AMT
   Gateway encapsulats it to a particular AMT Relay reachable across the
   unicast-only infrastructure.

11.  Problem Diagnosis

11.1.  Forwarding Inconsistencies

   The forwarding error code can tell if a group is unexpectedly pruned
   or administratively scoped.

11.2.  TTL or Hop Limit Problems

   By taking the maximum of hops (from source + forwarding TTL (or hop
   limit) threshold) over all hops, you can discover the TTL or hop
   limit required for the source to reach the destination.

11.3.  Packet loss

   By taking two traces, you can find packet loss information by
   comparing the difference in input packet counts to the difference in
   output packet counts for the specified source-group address pair at
   the previous hop.  On a point-to-point link, any difference in these
   numbers implies packet loss.  Since the packet counts may be changing
   as the mtrace2 query is propagating, there may be small errors (off
   by 1 or 2 or more) in these statistics.  However, these errors will
   not accumulate if multiple traces are taken to expand the measurement
   period.  On a shared link, the count of input packets can be larger
   than the number of output packets at the previous hop, due to other
   routers or hosts on the link injecting packets.  This appears as
   "negative loss" which may mask real packet loss.

   In addition to the counts of input and output packets for all
   multicast traffic on the interfaces, the response data includes a
   count of the packets forwarded by a node for the specified source-
   group pair.  Taking the difference in this count between two traces
   and then comparing those differences between two hops gives a measure
   of packet loss just for traffic from the specified source to the
   specified receiver via the specified group.  This measure is not
   affected by shared links.

   On a point-to-point link that is a multicast tunnel, packet loss is
   usually due to congestion in unicast routers along the path of that
   tunnel.  On native multicast links, loss is more likely in the output
   queue of one hop, perhaps due to priority dropping, or in the input
   queue at the next hop.  The counters in the response data do not
   allow these cases to be distinguished.  Differences in packet counts
   between the incoming and outgoing interfaces on one node cannot
   generally be used to measure queue overflow in the node.

11.4.  Link Utilization

   Again, with two traces, you can divide the difference in the input or
   output packet counts at some hop by the difference in time stamps
   from the same hop to obtain the packet rate over the link.  If the
   average packet size is known, then the link utilization can also be
   estimated to see whether packet loss may be due to the rate limit or
   the physical capacity on a particular link being exceeded.

11.5.  Time Delay

   If the routers have synchronized clocks, it is possible to estimate
   propagation and queuing delay from the differences between the
   timestamps at successive hops.  However, this delay includes control
   processing overhead, so is not necessarily indicative of the delay
   that data traffic would experience.

12.  IANA Considerations

   The following new assignments can only be made via a Standards Action
   as specified in [5].

12.1.  Forwarding Codes

   New Forwarding codes must only be created by an RFC that modifies
   this document's Section 9, fully describing the conditions under
   which the new forwarding code is used.  The IANA may act as a central
   repository so that there is a single place to look up forwarding
   codes and the document in which they are defined.

12.2.  UDP Destination Port and IPv6 Address

   The IANA should allocate UDP destination port for multicast
   traceroute version 2 upon publication of the first RFC.
   Additionally, the well-known multicast address (MTRACE2_IPV6RESPADDR)
   intended for default use by IPv6 multicast traceroute should be
   registered and defined by the first RFC published.

13.  Security Considerations

13.1.  Topology Discovery

   Mtrace2 can be used to discover any actively-used topology.  If your
   network topology is a secret, mtrace2 may be restricted at the border
   of your domain, using the ADMIN_PROHIB forwarding code.

13.2.  Traffic Rates

   Mtrace2 can be used to discover what sources are sending to what
   groups and at what rates.  If this information is a secret, mtrace2
   may be restricted at the border of your domain, using the
   ADMIN_PROHIB forwarding code.

13.3.  Unicast Replies

   The "Response address" field may be used to send a single packet (the
   traceroute Reply packet) to an arbitrary unicast address.  It is
   possible to use this facility as a packet amplifier, as a small
   multicast traceroute Query may turn into a large Reply packet.

14.  Acknowledgements

   This specification started largely as a transcription of Van
   Jacobson's slides from the 30th IETF, and the implementation in
   mrouted 3.3 by Ajit Thyagarajan.  Van's original slides credit Steve
   Casner, Steve Deering, Dino Farinacci and Deb Agrawal.  The original
   multicast traceroute client, mtrace (version 1), has been implemented
   by Ajit Thyagarajan, Steve Casner and Bill Fenner.

   The idea of unicasting a multicast traceroute Query to the
   destination of the trace with Router Alert set is due to Tony
   Ballardie.  The idea of the "S" bit to allow statistics for a source
   subnet is due to Tom Pusateri.

   For the mtrace version 2 specification, extensive comments were
   received from Yiqun Cai, Liu Hui, Bharat Joshi, Shinsuke Suzuki, and
   Cao Wei.
