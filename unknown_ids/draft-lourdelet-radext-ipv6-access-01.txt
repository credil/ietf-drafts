Abstract

   This document specifies new IPv6 RADIUS attributes used to support
   IPv6 network access.  As IPv6 specifies two configuration mechanisms
   (DHCP and SLAAC), the new attributes are targeted at both protocols
   when that makes sense.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                  June 2009


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   This document specifies new IPv6 attributes for RADIUS that both
   complement and extend the functionality provided by those already
   defined [RFC3162].  Its goal is to offer more IPv6 deployment options
   when StateLess Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) or DHCP are
   utilized.


3.  Attributes

   As usual, the fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from
   left to right.  Multiple instances of each of the attributes defined
   below may be included in a single RADIUS packet.  In this case, the
   attributes to be applied to any given prefix MUST all contain the
   same value in their respective Tag fields; otherwise, the Tag field
   MUST be set to zero (0x00) [RFC2868].

3.1.  IPv6-Address

   This Attribute indicates an IPv6 Address that is assigned to the
   uplink of the user equipment.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept
   packets, and can appear multiple times.  It MAY be used in an Access-
   Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would
   prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the server is not required to
   honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS, when necessary,
   will add a route corresponding to the address, it is not necessary
   for the server to also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route attribute for
   the same address.

   This Attribute can be used by DHCPv6 to offer a unique IPv6 address
   or can be used for a-posteriori validation of an autoconfigured
   address.

   A summary of the IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.

3.2.  IPv6-DNS-Server-Address

   The IPv6-DNS-Server-Address Attribute contains the IPv6 address of a
   DNS server.  This attribute MAY be included multiple times in Access-
   Accept.

   The content of this attribute can be inserted in a Router
   Advertisement as specified in [RFC5006] or mapped to the matching
   DHCPv6 option.

   A summary of the IPv6-DNS-Server-Address Attribute format is given
   below.

3.3.  IPv6-Prefix

   This Attribute specifies a prefix (and corresponding route) to be
   authorized for the user or NAS interface.  This Attribute also
   specifies a prefix that is reachable via the NAS and that need to be
   advertised as routes to the user by the NAS.  It is used in the
   Access-Accept packet and can appear multiple times.  It may be used
   in the Access-Request packet and can appear multiple times.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      TBA3 for IPv6-Prefix

   Length

      At least 4 and no larger than 20; typically 12 or less.

   Prefix Length

      The length of the prefix, in bits; at least 0 and no more than
      128; typically 64 or less.

   Tag

      The Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide a
      means of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the
      same IPv6 Route Option or Authorized Prefixes depending on the tag
      value.  The Tag field is mandatory.  The Tag field values are
      greater than 0x00.

   Prefix

      Variable-length field containing an IP address or a prefix of an
      IP address.  The Prefix Length field contains the number of valid
      leading bits in the prefix.  The bits in the prefix after the
      prefix length (if any) are reserved and MUST be initialized to
      zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

3.4.  IPv6-Route-Option-Preference

   This Attribute specifies the preference value that is associated with
   the prefix in IPv6-Prefix as defined in Section 3.3.  It is used in
   the Access-Accept packet and can appear multiple times.

   Tag

      The Tag field is one octet in length and is intended to provide a
      means of grouping attributes in the same packet which refer to the
      same IPv6 Route Option.  The Tag field is mandatory.  The Tag
      field values are greater than 0x00.

   Value
      Only the first two bits of the Value is interpreted as 2-bit
      signed integer.  The remaining bits are ignored.  The 2-bit signed
      integer indicates the Route Preference to a host whether to prefer
      the NAS announcing the prefix in IPv6-Route-Option-Prefix
      attribute over others, when multiple identical prefixes (for
      different NASes) have been received.

3.5.  IPv6-Route-Option-Lifetime

   This Attribute specifies a lifetime value to be used in association
   with IPv6-Prefix attribute as defined in Section 3.3.  It is used in
   the Access-Accept packet and can appear multiple times.

   A summary of the IPv6-Route-Option-Lifetime Attribute format is shown
   below.

      The Value field is 32-bit unsigned integer.  The length of time in
      seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent) that addresses
      generated from the prefix via stateless address autoconfiguration
      remain preferred [RFC4862].  A value of all one bits (0xffffffff)
      represents infinity.

3.8.  Auth-IPv6-Prefix-User-ID

   This Attribute identifies the user of the authorized IPv6-Prefix
   defined in Section 3.3.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept packets, and
   can appear only once.  It MAY be used in an Access-Request packet and
   can appear only once.

   The server manages authorized prefixes based on Auth-IPv6-Prefix-
   User-IDs.  MAC addresses MAY be used as Auth-IPv6-Prefix-User-IDs.

   A summary of the Auth-IPv6-Prefix-User-ID Attribute format is shown
   below.

   can be used.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept packets, and can appear
   only once.  It MAY be used in an Access-Request packet and can appear
   only once.

   Access-Request message containing at least one Auth-IPv6-Prefix-
   Valid-Lifetime or Auth-IPv6-Prefix-Prefd-Lifetime attribute MUST also
   contain Prefix-Lifetime-Service-Type attribute.  Access-Accept
   message containing at least one Auth-IPv6-Prefix-Valid-Lifetime or
   Auth-IPv6-Prefix-Prefd-Lifetime attribute MUST also contain Prefix-
   Lifetime-Service-Type attribute.

      2  Release

      3  Renew

   Prefix-Lifetime-Service-Type values are defined as follows when used
   in an Access- Accept.  When used in an Access-Request, they MAY be
   considered to be a hint to the RADIUS server that the NAS has reason
   to believe the user would prefer the kind of service indicated, but
   the server is not required to honor the hint.

   Request   Prefix request for a user or a NAS interface.  The
             interface of the user or NAS that the prefix (Authorized-
             IPv6-Prefix) is to be configured MUST be sent in Auth-IPv6-
             Prefix-User-ID attribute Section 3.8 in Access-Request.
             Auth-IPv6-Prefix-Prefd-Lifetime MUST be set to a non zero
             value.  Auth-IPv6-Prefix-Valid-Lifetime becomes the
             lifetime of the prefix assigned.

   Renew     Renew the lifetime of the prefix already requested by Valid
             Lifetime seconds.

   Release   For a disconnected user or for a disabled NAS interface,
             NAS MAY request a release of a prefix (Auth-IPv6-Prefix) to
             the RADIUS server.  Each interface for which the prefix is
             to be released is identified using Auth-IPv6-Prefix-User-ID
             attribute.

3.10.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   Since the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from the
   standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling is

   required by Diameter entities.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the use of RADIUS for the purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled
   networks.  In such networks, the RADIUS protocol may run either over
   IPv4 or over IPv6.  Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS
   protocol apply to the attributes defined in this document.  Since
   IPSEC is natively defined for IPv6, it is expected that running
   RADIUS implementations supporting IPv6 may want to run over IPSEC.
   Where RADIUS is run over IPSEC and where certificates are used for
   authentication, it may be desirable to avoid management of RADIUS
   shared secrets, so as to leverage the improved scalability of public
   key infrastructure.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of three new RADIUS Attribute
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following
   attributes:

   o  IPv6-Address

   o  IPv6-DNS-Server-Address

   o  IPv6-Prefix

   o  IPv6-Route-Option-Preference

   o  IPv6-Route-Option-Lifetime

   o  Auth-IPv6-Prefix-Valid-Lifetime

   o  Auth-IPv6-Prefix-Prefd-Lifetime

   o  Auth-IPv6-Prefix-User-ID

   o  Prefix-Lifetime-Service-Type

   IANA should allocate these numbers from the standard RADIUS
   Attributes space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].
