Internet-Draft         RTP Usage for Telepresence           October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Telepresence systems, of the architecture described by
   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-use-cases] and
   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements], will send and receive
   multiple media streams, where the number of streams in use is
   potentially large and asymmetric between endpoints, and streams can
   come and go dynamically.  These characteristics lead to a number of
   architectural design choices which, while still in the scope of
   potential architectures envisioned by the Real-Time Transport
   Protocol [RFC3550], must be fairly different than those typically
   implemented by the current generation of voice or video conferencing
   systems.  This document makes recommendations about how streams
   should be encoded and transmitted in RTP for this telepresence
   architecture.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Source multiplexing - overview

   Telepresence sessions have lots of media streams: easily dozens at a
   time (given, e.g., a continuous presence screen in a multi-point
   conference), potentially out of a possible pool of hundreds.
   Furthermore, endpoints will have an asymmetric number of media
   streams.

   In such an environment the usual model of existing SIP endpoints --
   sending zero or one source (in each direction) per RTP session --
   doesn't scale, and mapping asymmetric numbers of sources to sessions
   is needlessly complex.

   Therefore, telepresence systems SHOULD use a single RTP session per
   media type, except where there's a need to give sessions different
   transport treatment.  All sources of the same media type are sent
   over this single RTP session.  This architecture (known as "source
   multiplexing") was defined by [RFC3550], but was used rarely until
   more recently by some Telepresence systems.

   Multiplexing multiple media streams in this way has additional
   advantages.  It makes going through middle boxes considerably easier,
   as it allows Telepresence devices to work through SIP B2BUAs that do

   not support multiple media lines of the same media type.  It also
   simplifies NAT and firewall traversal by allowing endpoint to deal
   with only a single address/port mapping per media type rather than
   multiple mappings.

   During call setup, a single RTP session is negotiated for each media
   type.  In SDP, only one media line is negotiated per media and
   multiple media streams are sent over the same UDP channel negotiated
   using the SDP media line.

   A number of protocol issues involved in multiplexing RTP streams into
   session are discussed in
   [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-multiplex-architecture] and
   [I-D.lennox-rtcweb-rtp-media-type-mux].  In this draft we concentrate
   on examining the demultiplexing of RTP streams, in the specific
   context of telepresence systems.

   A key issue to work out is how a receiver interprets the multiple
   streams it receives, and corrolates them with the captures it has
   requested.  In some cases, the CLUE Framework
   [I-D.ietf-clue-framework]'s concept of the "capture" maps cleanly to
   the RTP concept of an SSRC, but in some cases it does not.

   First we will consider the cases that need to be considered.  We will
   then examine the two most obvious approaches to demultiplexing,
   showing their pros and cons.  We then describe a third possible
   alternative.


4.  Use Cases

   There are three distinct use cases relevant for telepresence systems:

   Static stream choice:

   In this case, the streams sent over the multiplex are constant over
   the complete session.  An example is a triple-camera system to MCU in
   which left, center and right streams are sent for the duration of the
   session.

   This describes an endpoint to endpoint, endpoint to multipoint
   device, and equivalently a transcoding multipoint device to endpoint.

   This is illustrated in Figure 1.

   Dynamic streams from a finite set:

   In this case, the receiver has requested a smaller number of streams
   than the number of media sources that are available, and expects the
   sender to switch the sources being sent based on criteria chosen by
   the sender.  (This is called auto-switched in the CLUE Framework
   [I-D.ietf-clue-framework].)

   An example is a triple-camera system to two-screen system, in which
   the sender needs to switch either LC -> LR, or CR -> LR.

   This describes an endpoint to endpoint, endpoint to multipoint
   device, and a transcoding device to endpoint.

   This is illustrated in Figure 2.

   Dynamic streams from an infinite set:

   This case describes a switched multipoint device to endpoint, in
   which the multipoint device can choose to send any streams received
   from any other endpoints within the conference to the endpoint.

   For example, in an MCU to triple-screen system, the MCU could send
   e.g.  LCR of a triple-camera system -> LCR, or CCC of three single-
   camera endpoints -> LCR.

                   Figure 3: Multipoint Infinite Streams

   Within any of these cases, every stream within the multiplexed
   session MUST have a unique SSRC.  The SSRC is chosen at random
   [RFC3550] to ensure uniqueness (within the conference), and contains
   no meaningful information.

   Any source may choose to restart a stream at any time, resulting in a
   new SSRC.  For example, a transcoding MCU might, for reasons of load
   balancing, transfer an encoder onto a different DSP, and throw away
   all context of the encoding at this state, sending an RTCP BYE
   message for the old SSRC, and picking a new SSRC for the stream when
   started on the new DSP.

   Because of this possibility of changing the SSRC at any time, all our
   use cases can be considered to be the third and most difficult case,
   that of dynamic streams from an infinite set.  Thus, this is the only
   case we will consider.


5.  Demultiplexing

   There are two obvious choices in order to demultiplex: the SSRC,
   which is guaranteed to be unique for a stream, but conveys no



Lennox, et al.             Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         RTP Usage for Telepresence           October 2011


   intrinsic useful information, or an additional multiplex ID tagged on
   to media packets.  There may be other choices, e.g., payload type
   number, which might be appropriate for multiplexing one audio with
   one video stream on the same RTP session, but this not relevant for
   the cases discussed here.

   For receivers with limited decoding resources, it is particularly
   important to ensure that the number of streams which the receiver is
   expecting to receive never exceeds the maximum number it has
   requested.  On a change of stream, the receiver can be expected to
   have a one-out, one-in policy, so that the decoder of the stream
   currently being decoded is stopped before starting the decoder for
   the stream replacing it.  The sender should therefore indicate to the
   receiver which stream will be replaced upon a stream change.

5.1.  Using the SSRC for demultiplexing

   Using the SSRC has the advantage of being included already in each
   RTP packet.  However, there are some disadvantages to consider.
   First, the SSRC needs to be linked to some metadata to associate it
   to the capture stream.  This is because although it uniquely
   identifies a media stream, it does not indicate which of the
   requested streams each SSRC is tied to.  If more than one media
   stream is expected, it is therefore required to send some additional
   metadata to indicate the link between the SSRC and the CLUE stream
   ID.  This is simply a mapping from transmitted SSRC to stream ID,
   updated as new SSRCs replace old ones.

   Because of the one-out, one-in codec policy, the receiver must know
   in advance of receiving the media stream how to allocate its decoding
   resources.  Athough it could cache incoming media received before it
   knows what multiplex stream it applies to, this will require an
   unknown amount of storage space (particularly if the metadata is
   lost), and could lead to significant latency, after which the
   receiver may not find it possible to catch up because of resource
   constraints, or else it would require an expensive state refresh,
   such as a Full Intra Request (FIR) [RFC5104].

   In addition, a receiver will have to store lookup tables of SSRCs to
   stream IDs/decoders etc.  Because of the large SSRC space (32 bits),
   this will have to be in the form of something like a hash map, and a
   lookup will have to be performed for every incoming packet, which may
   prove costly on the receiver side.

   Consider the choices for where to put the metadata.  The metadata
   could be sent in the CLUE messaging.  The use of a reliable transport
   means that it can be sure that the metadata will not be lost, but if
   this reliability is acheived through retransmission, the time taken



Lennox, et al.             Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         RTP Usage for Telepresence           October 2011


   for the metadata to reach all receivers (particularly in a very large
   scale conference, e.g., with thousands of users) could result in very
   poor switching times, providing a bad user experience.

   A second option for sending the metadata is in RTCP, for instance as
   a new SDES item.  This is likely to follow the same path as media,
   and therefore if the metadata is sent slightly in advance of the
   media, it can be expected to be received in advance of the media.
   However, because RTCP is lossy, the metadata may not be received for
   some time, resulting in the receiver of the media not knowing how to
   route the received media.  A system of acks and retransmissions could
   mitigate this, but this results in the same high switching latency
   behaviour as discussed for using CLUE as a transport for the
   metadata.

5.2.  Multiplex ID

   The second option is to tag each media packet with an RTP header
   extension [RFC5285] carrying a multiplex ID.  This means that a
   receiver immediately knows how to interpret received media, even when
   an unknown SSRC is seen.  As long as the media carries a known
   multiplex ID, it can be assumed that this media stream will replace
   the stream currently being received with that multiplex ID.

   This gives significant advantages to switching latency, as a switch
   between sources can be acheived without any form of negotiation with
   the receiver.  There is no chance of receiving media without knowing
   to which switched capture it belongs.

   Although multiplex IDs may be chosen by either the sender or
   receiver, the multiplex ID can, if chosen by the receiver, contain
   semantic information relevant to the receiver.  For example, on a
   large multipoint device with many DSPs, the receiver chosen multiplex
   ID could identify the DSP to which the media should be sent, and
   possibly contain routing information to the DSP.

   However, there are also significant disadvantages in using a
   multiplex ID.  It introduces additional processing costs.

   Multiplex IDs are scoped only within one hop (i.e., within a cascaded
   conference a multiplex ID that is used from the source to the first
   MCU is not meaningful between two MCUs, or between an MCU and a
   receiver), and so they may need to be modified at every stage.

   To add or modify the multiplex ID is an expensive operation,
   particularly if SRTP is used to authenticate the packet.
   Modification to the contents of the RTP header requires a
   reauthentication of the complete packet, and this could prove to be a



Lennox, et al.             Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         RTP Usage for Telepresence           October 2011


   limiting factor in the throughput of a multipoint device.  However,
   it may be that reauthentication is required in any case due to the
   nature of SDP.  SDP permits the receiver to choose payload types,
   meaning that a similar option to modify the payload type in the
   packet header will cause the need to reauthenticate.

5.3.  Combined approach

   The two major flaws of the above methods (poor switching performance
   of SSRC multiplexing, high computational cost on switching nodes) can
   be mitigated with a combined method.  In this, the multiplex ID can
   be included in packets belonging to the first frame of media
   (typically an IDR/GDR), but following this only the SSRC is used to
   demultiplex.

   Because the IDR is already required to be received before any further
   frames can be decoded, this does not create any further restrictions
   on the media stream -- existing mechanisms to ensure the reliability
   of an IDR frame can be used.  It does introduce extra complexity on
   the demultiplex side, requiring a two stage process of inspecting the
   packet for a multiplex ID, and, if it is not present, looking for the
   SSRC in a table of known streams.

   The solution is somewhat more complex if it is possible for a source
   to change which switched capture is sending it: for instance, in the
   second example in Section 4, when the sender switches from sending LC
   -> LR to sending CR -> LR, the sender's "C" source moves from the
   receiver's "R" multiplex ID to the receiver's "L" multiplex ID.  For
   reasons of coding efficiency, it is desirable in this case to avoid
   sending a new IDR frame for the "C" stream, if the receiver's
   architecture allows the same decoding state to be used for its
   various multiplex IDs.  In this case, the multiplex ID could be sent
   for a small number of frames after the source's multiplex ID has
   changed.


6.  Transmission of presentation sources

   Most existing videoconferencing systems use separate RTP sessions for
   main and presentation video sources, distinguished by the SDP content
   attribute [RFC4796].  The use of [I-D.ietf-clue-framework]the CLUE
   telepresence framework to describe multiplexed streams can remove
   this need.  However, it could still be useful in some cases to make
   the distinction between presentation and main video sources at the
   transport layer.  In particular, if different treatment is desired at
   the transport layer or below (e.g. different VLANs, different QoS
   characteristics, etc.) for main video vs presentiation, the use of
   multiple RTP sessions m lines with different transport addresses



Lennox, et al.             Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         RTP Usage for Telepresence           October 2011


   could would be necessary.


7.  Other considerations

   As currently defined, H.281 Far-End Camera Control
   [ITU.H281.1994][RFC4573] does not, in SIP-based videoconferences,
   support selecting among multiple remote sources (though it does in
   H.323 conferences controled by an MCU, which can assign terminal IDs
   to sources).  When RTP sessions contain multiple sources, this
   limitation becomes pressing.  (However, this problem does not appear
   to be in scope of the CLUE working group.)


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for multiplexed RTP do not seem to be
   different than for non-multiplexed RTP.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.
