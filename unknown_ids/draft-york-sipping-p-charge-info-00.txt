Internet-Draft     P-Charge-Info, a SIP Private Header     February 2008


1.  Overview

   In certain network configurations, it is desirable to decouple the
   Caller ID from the number used for billing purposes.  This document
   describes the current usage of 'P-Charge-Info', a private SIP header,
   to provide simple billing information and requests the registration
   of this header with IANA as required by section 4.1 of RFC 3427.

   In a typical configuration, "Caller ID" is derived from one of the
   following SIP headers:

   o  Remote-Party-ID

   o  P-Asserted-Identity

   o  From (in the absence of the other two)

   This number is typically presented to the receiving UA where it is
   usually displayed for the end user.  It is also typically used for
   billing purposes by the network entities involved in carrying the
   session.

   However, in a distributed environment the "Caller ID" presented to
   the receiving UA may not reflect the actual reality of the underlying
   network in terms of costs incurred on the PSTN.  This may result in
   excessive charging of one carrier by another based on the erroneous
   assumption that the call was originating from a different point on
   the PSTN.

   There exists a need for a way to pass an additional billing
   identifier that can be used between network entities in order to
   correctly bill for services.  At least one equipment provider, Sonus
   Networks, and several carriers have begun using the "P-Charge-Info"
   header as a simple mechanism to exchange this billing identifier.

   It should be noted that the 3GPP has also recognized the need for
   such a billing identifier and in section 4.6 of RFC 3455 established
   a SIP P-Header, "P-Charging-Vector", to provide similar information.
   This header, though, is designed for use within 3GPP environments and
   includes more information than is required in many simpler
   environments.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  The P-Charge-Info Header

3.1.  Applicability Statement for the P-Charge-Info header

   [Information to be completed.]

3.2.  Usage of the P-Charge-Info header

   The P-Charge-Info header is used to convey information related to
   billing record for a particular call.  The P-Charge-Info header is
   typically inserted by the SIP proxy on the originating network.

3.2.1.  Procedures at the UA

   This document does not specify any procedure at the UA with regard to
   the P-Charge-Info header.  UAs need not understand this header.

3.2.2.  Procedures at the Proxy

   [Information to be completed.]

3.3.  Examples of Usage

   [Information to be completed.]


4.  Formal Syntax

   The Private Header specified in this document is described in both
   prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in RFC 2234.
   Further, several BNF definitions are inherited from SIP and are not
   repeated here.  Implementors need to be familiar with the notation
   and contents of SIP [1] and RFC 2234 [3] to understand this document.

   They syntax of the P-Charge-Info header is described as follows:

   [Information to be completed.]


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a private SIP extension header field (beginning
   with the prefixe "P-").

   The extension is registered as a private extension field:

   RFC Number: RFCXXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number of
   this specification.

Internet-Draft     P-Charge-Info, a SIP Private Header     February 2008


   Header Field Name: P-Charge-Info

   Compact Form: none


6.  Security Considerations

   Given that the information contained in the P-Charge-Info header will
   be used for billing purposes the proxies that share this information
   MUST have a trust relationship.

   If an untrusted entity were inserted between the trusted entities, it
   could potentially interfere with the billing records for the call.
   If the SIP connections are not made over a private WAN, a mechanism
   for securing the confidentiality and integrity of the SIP connection
   should be used to protect the information.
