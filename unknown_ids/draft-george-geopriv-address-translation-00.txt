Internet-Draft        Location translation protocol            July 2009


1.  Introduction

   As the growth of location-based services, access to real-time
   geolocation information becomes more important.  This draft describes
   how to convert civic addresses to geospatial addresses and vice
   versa.  For example, I'm in Washington, DC, instead of (40.8N,
   73.9W).  This form of location is a lot more realistic in a lot of
   situations, since it can be often hard to get a precise position.
   However, it's good enough for some location-based services.

   It is sending PIDF-LO (civic) to the server and getting a geodetic
   address back.  To use it, look up your location's co-ordinates, and
   then enter them in the request.  The corresponding response will
   return the civic address of the requested coordinates.  In the same
   way the geodetic address obtained, if civic address information has
   provided in the request.

   The Geodetic-civic address translation may return the standard errors
   and status codes.  The possible errors conditions are listed in the
   Section 5.


2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Coordinate System Translation

3.1.  Geodetic-Civic

   This method performs the conversion of a latitude/longitude pair into
   human-readable addresses.  User sends a request to the location
   translation service, asking to return the civic address for the given
   geodetic address.  If the address was successfully located, it sent
   back to the user.  In case of ambiguous addresses, only the point for
   the best match is passed in the response.

   The given response is the result for a civic address request, where
   the geodetic address is -34.407 150.88001.

   The civic address includes the header fields which are defined in
   [RFC5139].  It is recommended to follow a particular civic address

   schema, if there is any civic address recommendation for a particular
   country or region.  For example,
   draft-ietf-geopriv-civic-address-recommendations-02.

   One thing that needs explanation is accuracy, which is a measure of
   how accurately the system is returning location information.  It
   allows to specify whether it is 'exact', 'neighborhood' etc.
   However, it is worth specifying how much deviation from the requested
   location in terms of meters.  If client sends a request with geodetic
   address and there is no mapping found in the server, server could
   return civic address which is close by.  Also specify how much
   deviation from the requested location in terms of meters.

3.2.  Civic to Geodetic

   Civic to Geodetic is the process of converting civic addresses (like
   "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic
   coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739).
   This method performs a conversion of a human-readable address into a
   latitude/longitude pair.  The user sends a request to the server,
   asking it to parse the given address and get response back.

   The server will attempt to find the closest addressable location
   within a certain tolerance; if no match is found, the server will
   usually return a status code, unknown addresses.

   If the geodetic address of a location is requested, the response will
   contain altitude, latitude and longitude of the location, in which
   altitude is an optional.  The following parameters may be included
   while requesting for a geodetic address.

   Street name, city name, zip code.  If this location contradicts the
   city and state specified, the zip code will be used for determining
   the location and the city, state and other parameters will be
   ignored.  If a location like Washington DC is specified, it will take
   priority over the individual fields in determining the location for
   the query.  City, state and zip will be ignored.

   Hence, the corresponding response from the server.

   Result for a civic address request contains each individual response.
   More than one result may be returned if the given address is
   ambiguous.  Possible values, from most specific to most general are:
   address, street, zip, city, state, country etc. <warning>: If the
   exact address was not found, the closest available match will be
   noted here.


4.  The Accuracy

   Location translation service returns an Accuracy value within each
   returned address.  This value indicates the resolution of the given
   result, but not necessarily the correctness of the result.  For
   example, a civic address of "111 8th Avenue, New York, NY" may return
   8 (Address) level accuracy, indicating that the given address is on
   the order of resolution of a street address.  A civic address for

   "France" would only return 1 (Country) level accuracy.  The following
   table lists the accuracy values returned by the Geo-Civic address
   translation service.  Note that these accuracy values only indicate
   the expected resolution.

   Value Description

   0 Unknown accuracy.

   1 Country level accuracy.

   2 Region (state, province, prefecture, etc.) level accuracy.

   3 Sub-region (county, municipality, etc.) level accuracy.

   4 Town (city, village) level accuracy.

   5 Post code (zip code) level accuracy.

   6 Street level accuracy.

   7 Intersection level accuracy.

   8 Address level accuracy.

   9 Premise (building name, property name, shopping center, etc.) level
   accuracy.

   Consider an example for <locationResponse> with accuracy information.

   expected.  This document should re-use the HELD error codes.  In
   particular, the server should always return a 200/OK, possibly with a
   HELD <error> element.  In addition to HELD errors codes, following is
   a list of error codes that you may encounter.

   accessDenied: You do not have permission to access this resource.

   internaleError: An internal problem prevents from returning data.

   notDefined: The address translation process failed due to an error
   not covered by the definition of any other error code in this
   interface.

   For each error, you'll receive an XML response of the following form.
