Internet-Draft  Option including Multiple Agents' Information  Oct. 2009




Abstract

   RFC 3046 allows only the first Relay Agent to append Relay Agent
   Information option. In some networks, both Layer 2 Relay Agents and
   Layer 3 Relay Agents are deployed and their information is necessary
   for DHCP packets forwarding and DHCP server's policy designing
   described as [4]. This document defines a DHCP option which can
   contain multiple relay agents' information and describes how it works.

1. Introduction

   As defined in RFC 3046, Relay Agent Information option is inserted by
   the DHCP relay agent (or downstream network element) when forwarding
   client-originated DHCP packets to a DHCP server. Servers recognizing
   the Relay Agent Information option may use the information to
   implement IP address or other parameter assignment policies. The DHCP
   Server echoes the option back verbatim to the relay agent in server-
   to-client replies, and the relay agent strips the option before
   forwarding the reply to the client.

   RFC 3046 allows only one agent add its information with option 82.
   But in some scenarios as [4], multiply relay agents need to insert
   more information into the same DHCP message. This document defines a
   DHCP option which can contain multiple relay agents' information and
   describes how it works.

2. DHCP option including Multiple Relay Agents' Information

2.1. Mechanism

   This option is organized as a single DHCP option that contains one or
   more sub-options. Each relay agent can insert a set of sub-options to
   convey its Information.

                                                -------
             +-----------+  +-----------+    ///       \\\    +------+
   +------+  |Layer 2    |  |Layer 3    |   |             |   |DHCP  |
   |Client+--+Relay Agent+--+Relay Agent+--+    Network    +--+Server|
   +------+  +-----------+  +-----------+   |             |   +------+
                                             \\\       ///
                                                -------
                         Figure 1 Network Scenario

   As shown in figure 1, it's a most popular network scenario where
   option including Multiple Relay Agents' Information is necessary.
   Based on the demand of the new Relay Agent Information option as [4],
   this option works as following:

   1. An initiating client sends a DHCP discovery packet.

   2. Layer 2 relay agent receives the discovery packet without any
      options defined in this document. So it inserts a new option in
      which a set of sub-options convey the layer 2 relay agent's
      necessary information. After that, the discovery packet is
      forwarded to the appropriate port.

   3. Layer 3 relay agent receives the discovery packet and check out
      that it already contains a relay agent information option defined
      in this document. So it just insert a set of sub-options into the
      existing option to convey its own necessary information. After
      that, the discovery packet is forwarded and reaches DHCP server
      directly or through a network.

   4. DHCP server handles the discovery packet as normal and could carry
      out flexible IP assigning or other policies based on the
      information of option defined in this document. After that DHCP
      server reply a DHCP response packet containing the original option
      carried in the corresponding discovery packet.

   5. Layer 3 relay agents quickly get the right outgoing interface
      based on the information in the option and forward the response
      packet after deleting its set of sub-options.

   6. Layer 2 relay agents quickly get the right outgoing interface
      based on the information in the option and forward the response
      packet. Because there is no other agent's information left in the
      option, so in this case layer 2 relay agent delete the whole
      option before forwarding the packet.

2.2. Format

   Option format:

 +-------+-----+-----+
 |Code(x)| Len |Value|
 +-------+-----+-----+


   This option use a new DHCP option code "x".

   Value:

 +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
 |sub-option1|sub-option2|sub-option3|sub-option4|
 +-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+
 |1|N1|value1|2|N2|value2|3|N3|value3|4|N4|value4|->a Set of sub-options
 +-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+
 /                      ...                      \
 |          Multiple sets of sub-options         |
 \                      ...                      /
 +-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+
 |1|N1|value1|2|N2|value2|3|N3|value3|4|N4|value4|
 +-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+-+--+------+


   Sub-option1

       Agent level. Describe the order of agent who insert this set of
       sub-options. For example, in the case of figure 1, layer 2 relay
       agent's level is 1 because it is the closest agent to the client
       and it will be the first agent who insert relay agent information.

   Sub-option2

       Agent ID. Describe a unique identifier for the agent who insert
       this set of sub-options.

   Sub-option3

Internet-Draft  Option including Multiple Agents' Information  Oct. 2009


       IP address. Describe IP address of the agent who insert this set
       of sub-options. For a pure layer 2 agent, this field could be
       0.0.0.0.

   Sub-option4

       Downstream interface. Describe the receiving interface of the
       DHCP packet of the agent who insert this set of sub-options.

3. Security Considerations

   This document doesn't propose any new protocol.

4. IANA Considerations

   This document requires a new number for DHCP option code x described
   in section 2.2.
