                         ALTO Server Discovery
                  draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery-00

Abstract

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desired
   resource.

   Entities seeking guidance need to discover and possibly select an
   ALTO server to ask.  This is called ALTO server discovery.  This memo
   describes an ALTO server discovery mechanism based on several
   alternative mechanisms that are applicable in a diverse set of ALTO
   deployments.

1.  Introduction

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource [RFC5693].  The requirements for ALTO are itemized in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs].  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.
   ALTO clients send queries to ALTO servers, in order to solicit
   guidance.

   ALTO clients have to discover suitable ALTO servers.  Therefore the
   output of the herein defined ALTO discovery procedure tells the ALTO
   client which ALTO servers to send the queries to.  The ALTO discovery
   procedure, as part of the the ALTO client, can be embedded in the
   resource consumer, which will eventually access the desired resource.
   As an alternative, they can be embedded in a resource directory,
   which assists resource consumers in finding appropriate resource
   providers.  In some specific peer-to-peer application protocols these
   resource directories are called "trackers".  Finally the ALTO server
   discovery procedure can be embedded in the resource consumer, whereas
   the ALTO client is embedded in the resource directory.  ALTO queries,
   which are issued by a resource directory on behalf of a resource
   consumer, are referred to as third-party ALTO queries.  The various
   possibilities to place ALTO servers and the placement of ALTO clients
   is discussed in [I-D.stiemerling-alto-deployments].

   No matter where ALTO server and client are located, clients have to
   first find out if there is an ALTO server deployed that is in charge
   for them, and second they have to get the contact information of that
   server, i.e., the IP address, port number, and probably transport
   protocol (which defaults to TCP for [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol]).

   The goal of this memo is to propose a uniform mechanism for all types
   of ALTO client deployments that is implementable and deployable at a
   fast pace, i.e., without creating other deployment dependecies for
   ALTO.  We propose to use a combination of DHCP and DNS to retrieve
   the URL of the resposnsible ALTO server.

   Comments and discussions about this memo should be directed to the
   ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

   Hereby the ALTO service discovery scenarios are classified into two
   types: one is the ALTO server discovery by the resource consumer, and
   the other is the ALTO server discovery by a third party, such as
   application trackers.  Before the specification of the discovery
   mechanism the following section illustrates and discusses both
   scenarios.

1.2.1.  ALTO Server Discovery by Resource Consumers

   The ALTO service discovery in some scenarios needs to be performed by
   the resource consumer itself.  In particular in p2p applications
   without a tracker like DHTs and other conventional client/server
   applications.

   In addition also p2p application which are tracker based may embed
   the ALTO client into the resurce consumer to allow peers a peer
   selection after retrieving peer list from the application tracker.
   Another option is that the reource consumer peer sends its ALTO
   server address information to the application tracker or any other
   third party entity, which in turn will contact the specific ALTO
   server and in order to retrieve ALTO guidance on behalf of the
   resource consumer.

   The following figure illustrates this scenario, showing the
   relationship between the different entities as discussed before.

1.2.2.  ALTO Server Discovery by a Third Party

   Some p2p applications have trackers, and these applications might not
   need to have their clients looking for the ALTO server guidance.  In
   these scenarios trackers query the ALTO servers for guidance
   themselves, and then return the final ranked result to the
   application clients.  However, application clients are distributed
   among different network operators and autonomous systems.  Trackers
   thus need to find different ALTO servers for the clients located in
   different operator networks or autonomous systems.  In such scenarios
   the discuvery is thus not performed by the resource consumer, but a
   third party entity on behalf of the resource consumer.

   Figure 3 shows an example for a third party ALTO server discovery.
   For client 1, the tracker has not cached yet the mapping between

   client 1's network operator and its ALTO server address, so it
   queries the DNS server for the ALTO server address in that operator's
   domain.  And then the tracker interacts with the ALTO server on
   behalf of client 1(to get the network map and cost map), finally, the
   ranked list is sent back to client 1.  For client 2, the tracker has
   cached the mapping between client 2's network operator and its ALTO
   server address, so it does not need to query the DNS for the address
   of ALTO server 2.  If the Application tracker already has the network
   map and cost map from ALTO Server2, then it does not to query the
   ALTO Server for network map and cost map frequently.

1.3.  Pre-Conditions

   The whole document assumes certain pre-conditions, such as:

   o  The ALTO server discovery procedure is executed on a per IP
      address base.  Multiple IP addresses per interface or multiple IP
      addresses assigned to different IP interfaces require to repeat
      the procedure for every IP address.  It may be fine to group IP
      addresses according their domain suffixes and to perfom the
      procedure for such a group.  However, this is out of scope of this
      document.

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                 May 2011


   o  The ALTO server discovery procedure is executed on a per IP family
      base, i.e., seperate for IPv4 and IPv6.  It is up to the ALTO
      client to decide which of the possible multiple results of
      different IP address families to use.  The choice of whether to
      use IPv4 or IPv6 is out of scope of this document.

   o  A change of the IP address at an interface invalidates the result
      of the ALTO server discovery procedure.  For instance, if the IP
      address assigned to a mobile host changes due to host mobility, it
      is required to run the ALTO server discovery procedure for the new
      IP address without relying on earlier gained information.

2.  Protocol Overview

   We define multiple alternatives to discover the IP address of the
   ALTO server, as there are a number of ways possible how such
   information can be provided to the ALTO client.  The choice of method
   is up to the local network deployment.  For instance, there can be
   deployments where the ALTO server in charge for ALTO client is
   provisioned by the network operator and communicated to the ALTO
   client's host via a DHCP option, while in other deployments no such
   means may exist.

   The following figure illustrates the different protocols that are
   used to find the URI of a suitable ALTO server.

                        Figure 1: Protocol Overview

   The figure above illustrates the U-NAPTR based resolution process to
   retrieve the ALTO Server URL.  As a precondition for resolution the
   U-NAPTR process needs the right domain name as input.  This domain
   name is determined by the IP address of the client and the DNS suffix
   of the access network where the client is registered in.  In order to
   retrieve the DNS suffix we specify three options:

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                 May 2011


   User input:  a user may manually specify the DNS suffix on its own,
      either to access a 3rd party ALTO service provider or as it does
      know such information.

   DHCP:  a network provider provides the DNS suffix through a DHCP
      option.

   Reverse DNS:  the DNS system can be used to retrieve the DNS suffix
      through reverse lookup of an FQDN associated with an IP address.
      This is the last resort if all other options failed.

3.  Retrieving the URI by U-NAPTR

   This section specifies the U-NAPTR based resolution process.  To
   start the U-NAPTR resolution process a domain name as input is
   needed.  Thus the section is devided into two parts: Section 3.1
   describes the U-NAPTR resolution process itself.  How the client
   identifies this DNS suffix of the access network where the resource
   consumer is registered in is described in Section 3.2.

3.1.  U-NAPTR Resolution

   ALTO servers are identified by U-NAPTR/DDDS (URI-Enabled NAPTR/
   Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service) [RFC4848] application unique
   strings, in the form of a DNS name.  An example is
   'altoserver.example.com'.

   Clients need to use the U-NAPTR [RFC4848] specification described
   below to obtain a URI (indicating host and protocol) for the
   applicable ALTO service.  In this document, only the HTTP and HTTPS
   URL schemes are defined.  Note that the HTTP URL can be any valid
   HTTP URL, including those containing path elements.

   The following two DNS entries show the U-NAPTR resolution for
   "example.com" to the HTTPS URL https://altoserver.example.com/secure
   or the HTTP URL http://altoserver.example.com, with the former being
   preferred.


       example.com.

       IN NAPTR 100  10   "u"    "ALTO:https"
            "!.*!https://altoserver.example.com/secure!"  ""

       IN NAPTR 200  10   "u"    "ALTO:http"
            "!.*!http://altoserver.example.com!"  ""

3.2.  Retrieving the Domain Name

   The U-NAPTR resolution process requires a domain name as input.  The
   algorithm that is applied to determine this domain name is described
   in this section.  We specify three different options.  In option 1
   the user manually configures a specific ALTO service instance that he
   wants to use.  Option 2 defines a DHCP option to allow the network
   service provider a remote configuration of the client.  In option 3
   the client tries to get the domain name by performing a reverse DNS
   lookup on its IP address.

   The resource consumer may have private IP addresses and public IP

   addresses and depending on the deployment it might be necessary to
   determine for all IP addresses the ALTO server in charge of.  To
   determine its public IP address the resource consumer may need to use
   STUN[RFC5389] or BEP24[bep24].  For the following examples we assume
   that the IP address of the resource consumer is a.b.c.d.

3.2.1.  Option 1: User input

   A user may want to use a third party ALTO service instance.
   Therefore we allow the user to specify a DNS suffix on its own, for
   example in a config file option.  The DNS suffix given by the user is
   combined with the IP address of the resource consumer to allow the
   third party ALTO service to direct the client to a suitable ALTO
   server based on the location of the client.  A possible DNS suffix
   entered by the user may be:

      myaltoprovider.org

   This DNS suffix is prepended with the IP address of the resource
   consumer in reverse order to compose the domain name used for the
   final U-NAPTR lookup Section 3.1.  In case there are multiple ALTO
   servers deployed, the third party ALTO service instance can direct
   the ALTO client to the ALTO server closest to the client based on the
   IP address.

   Multiple lookups with different domain names might be necessary to
   complete the U-NAPTR resolution process.  If there is no response for
   a lookup the domain name is shortened by one part for the succeeding
   lookup, until a lookup is successful, as for example

      d.c.b.a.myaltoprovider.org.

      c.b.a.myaltoprovider.org.

      b.a.myaltoprovider.org.

      a.myaltoprovider.org.

      myaltoprovider.org.

3.2.2.  Option 2: DHCP

   As a second option network operators can configure the domain name to
   be used for service discovery within an access network.  RFC
   5986[RFC5986] defines DHCP IPv4 and IPv6 access network domain name
   options that identify a domain name that is suitable for service
   discovery within the access network.  The ALTO server discovery
   procedure uses these DHCP options to retrieve the domain name as an

   input for the U-NAPTR resolution.  One example could be:

      example.com

3.2.3.  Option 3: Reverse DNS Lookup

   The last option to get the domain name is to use a DNS PTR query for
   the IP address of the resource consumer.  The local DNS server
   resolves the IP address to the FQDN that also contains the DNS suffix
   for the respective IP address.  A possible answer for a PTR lookup
   for d.c.b.a.in-addr.apra might be, for example:

      d-c-b-a.dsl.westcoast.myisp.net

   This domain name can be used for the final U-NAPTR lookup
   Section 3.1.  If there is no response to the lookup the domain name
   is shortened by one part for one succeeding lookup.  If there is
   still no response we consider the reverse lookup being failed.  The
   domain names used for the example as described above are:

      d-c-b-a.dsl.westcoast.myisp.net.

      dsl.westcoast.myisp.net.

4.  Applicability

   This section discusses the applicability of the proposed solution
   with respect to the resource consumer server discovery and the third
   party deployment scenarios.  Each section discusses the proposed
   steps that are needed to determine the ALTO Server URI.

4.1.  Applicability for Resource Consumer Server Discovery

   In this scenario the ALTO server discovery procedure is performed by
   the resource consumer, for example a peer in a P2P system.  After the
   discovery the peer does the ALTO query on its own, or it might share
   the ALTO server contact information with a third party, for example a
   tracker, which then does the ALTO query on behalf of the peer.

   To complete the ALTO server discovery process the resource consumer
   first SHOULD check whether the user has provider the domain name
   through manual configuration.  If this is not the case the next step
   SHOULD be to check for the access network domain name DHCP option
   (Section 3.2.2).  Finally the client SHOULD try to retrieve the
   domain name by the last option, the DNS reverse lookup on its IP
   address as described in Section 3.2.3.

   In case the ALTO discovery client has determined the domain name
   through one of the described options it proceedes with the U-NAPTR
   lookup as described in Section 3.1.

4.2.  Applicability for Third Party Server Discovery

   In case of the third party server discovery deployment scenario the
   entity performing the ALTO server discovery process is different from
   the resource consumer.  Typically the resource consumer is a peer
   whereas the ALTO client is a resource directory which seeks for ALTO
   guidance on behalf of the peer.  Another use case for the third party
   discovery is an application that looks for ALTO guidance
   transparently for the resource consumer, for example a CDN.

   Here the ALTO server discovery process can also retrieve guidance
   through the DHCP option or manual user configuration, but only if the
   provided discovery information is forwarded by the resource consumer
   to the third party entity.  In this case, additional mechanisms for
   the forwarding of this discovery information need to be specified.
   However these mechanisms are out of scope of this doument.

   If the third party entity cannot obtain this discovery information,
   the ALTO server discovery process relies on retrieving the domain
   name used as input to the U-NAPTR lookup through reverse DNS lookup
   of the IP address of the resource consumer as described in



Kiesel, et al.          Expires November 6, 2011               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                 May 2011


   Section 3.2.3.  Usually the third party entity already knows the IP
   address of the resource consumer which was used to establish the
   initial connection.  In general this IP address is a public address,
   either of the resource consumer or of the last NAT on the path to the
   ALTO client.  This makes the IP address a good candidate for the DNS
   PTR query.  Thus, we expect that the DNS query will be successfully
   resolved to the FQDN of the domain where the resource consumer is
   registered in.

   In case the resource consumer needs guidance for a different IP
   address, for example one from a private network, we recommend that
   the resource consumer discovers the server itself and forwards the
   ALTO server contact information directly to the third party entity,
   which in turn can then do the third party ALTO query.  Again,
   forwarding the contact information from the resource consumer to the
   third party entity is out of scope of this document.

5.  Deployment Considerations

   The mechanism specified in this document needs some configuration
   effort in order to work properly.  Especially the domain name
   retrieved through the reverse DNS lookup (PTR records) and the
   U-NAPTR entry need to be coordinated.  In this section we discuss
   this configuration for different scenarios.

5.1.  Private customers or very small businesses

   For private customers and very small businesses that are DSL or cable
   customers often a dynamically assigned IP address is provisioned.
   Here, the reverse DNS lookup (PTR records) are controlled by the ISP
   and they point to the ISP's domain, e.g.:

      p5B203EA1.dip.t-dialin.net.

      dslb-084-056-144-100.pools.arcor-ip.net.

      187-4-222-157.bnut3700.dsl.brasiltelecom.net.br.

      65-154-39-69.ispnetbilling.com.

      197-151-94-178.pool.ukrtel.net.

   In this case, it would be the responsibility of the respective ISP to
   provide U-NAPTR entries for the DNS suffix without the endhost part,
   e.g.:

      dip.t-dialin.net.

      pools.arcor-ip.net.

      bnut3700.dsl.brasiltelecom.net.br.

      ispnetbilling.com.

      pool.ukrtel.net.

5.2.  Medium-size customer networks

   The second class of customers have their own DNS domain but only one
   single upstream ISP, e.g.:

   (1)  ISP my-isp.net assigns an IP address a.b.c.d to its customer






Kiesel, et al.          Expires November 6, 2011               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            ALTO Server Discovery                 May 2011


   (2)  The customer decides that reverse mapping for a.b.c.d should be
        whatever.customerdomain.com

   (3)  If the customer wants to support ALTO, he has to ask the ISP for
        the URI of the ISP's ALTO server which can give guidance to
        a.b.c.d.  Assume that ISP replies it is
        http://altoserver.my-isp.net

   (4)  The customer establishes a U-NAPTR entry for his domain

       customerdomain.com.   IN NAPTR 200  10   "u"    "ALTO:http"
            "!.*!http://altoserver.my-isp.net!"  ""

5.3.  Large Customers

   For very large customers with multiple upstream connections we assume
   that they have their very own traffic optimization policies and thus
   run their own ALTO server anyway.  In this case they need to manage
   their DNS entries accordingly.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  General

   This is still to be done in later revision of this draft, as the
   draft evolves heavily right now.

7.2.  For U-NAPTR

   The address of an ALTO server is usually well-known within an access
   network; therefore, interception of messages does not introduce any
   specific concerns.

   The primary attack against the methods described in this document is
   one that would lead to impersonation of a ALTO server since a device
   does not necessarily have a prior relationship with a ALTO server.

   An attacker could attempt to compromise ALTO discovery at any of
   three stages:

   1.  providing a falsified domain name to be used as input to U-NAPTR

   2.  altering the DNS records used in U-NAPTR resolution

   3.  impersonation of the ALTO

   This document focuses on the U-NAPTR resolution process and hence
   this section discusses the security considerations related to the DNS
   handling.  The security aspects of obtaining the domain name that is
   used for input to the U-NAPTR process is described in respective
   documents, such as [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery].

   The domain name that is used to authenticated the ALTO server is the
   domain name in the URI that is the result of the U-NAPTR resolution.
   Therefore, if an attacker were able to modify or spoof any of the DNS
   records used in the DDDS resolution, this URI could be replaced by an
   invalid URI.  The application of DNS security (DNSSEC) [RFC4033]
   provides a means to limit attacks that rely on modification of the
   DNS records used in U-NAPTR resolution.  Security considerations
   specific to U-NAPTR are described in more detail in [RFC4848].

   An "https:" URI is authenticated using the method described in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC2818].  The domain name used for this
   authentication is the domain name in the URI resulting from U-NAPTR
   resolution, not the input domain name as in [RFC3958].  Using the
   domain name in the URI is more compatible with existing HTTP client
   software, which authenticate servers based on the domain name in the
   URI.

   An ALTO server that is identified by an "http:" URI cannot be
   authenticated.  If an "http:" URI is the product of the ALTO
   discovery, this leaves devices vulnerable to several attacks.  Lower
   layer protections, such as layer 2 traffic separation might be used
   to provide some guarantees.

8.  Open Issues

   Here are a few open issues to be clarified:

   Handling of reverse DNS lookups for IPv6:  Refer to [RFC4472] for a
      discussion about the issues.

   Missing reverse DNS entries for an IP address:  There may be cases
      where the reverse DNS lookup does not yield any result.  However,
      this will leave the ALTO client with no choice, other than giving
      up.  This needs better documentation.

   How to handled multiple results:  For instance, a host behind a NAT
      that yields an ALTO server in the private IP address domain and
      one in the public IP address domain.  Whom to ask?

   Suffix Issues  Document issues with suffix information provided by
      DHCP or by other means.  For instance, a host behind a NAT may
      have a configured DNS suffix ".local".  This suffix is not usuable
      for the server discovery procedure.
