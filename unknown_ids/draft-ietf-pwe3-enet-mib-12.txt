1.  Introduction

   This document describes a model for managing Ethernet pseudowire
   services for transmission over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).  This
   MIB module is generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in
   the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985], which describes the transport and
   encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN types.

   In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on
   top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for
   VPLS service) to a point-to-point PW.  It is complementary to the
   [PWMIB], which manages the generic PW parameters common to all
   services, including all supported PSN types.

   Comments should be made directly to the PWE3 mailing list at
   pwe3@ietf.org.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects
   in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure
   of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module
   that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC
   2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC3985] and [RFC3916].  Unless otherwise stated, the
   mechanisms of [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here.


4.  Overview

   The MIB module structure for defining a PW service is composed of

Internet-Draft                 PW ENET MIB                 November 2007


   three layers of MIB modules functioning together.  This general model
   is defined in the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985].  The layering model is
   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN
   layer that carries the emulated service.  This is done at the same
   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported
   services to any supported PSNs.

   The first layer, known as the service layer, contains service-
   specific modules.  These modules define service-specific management
   objects that interface or collaborate with existing MIB modules for
   the native version of the service.  The service-specific module
   "glues" the standard modules to the PWE3 MIB modules.

   The next layer of the PWE3 MIB framework is the PW MIB module
   [PWMIB].  This module is used to configure general parameters of PWs
   that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.  This
   layer is connected to the service-specific layer above, and the PSN
   layer below.

   The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.
   These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry
   the service over the PSN.  These modules are used to "glue" the PW
   service to the underlying PSN-specific MIB modules.  This document
   defines the MIB module for Ethernet PW over any PSN type.

   This module uses TCs and objects as defined in [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
   [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC4502], [PWMIB] and [PWTC].

   The Etherlike-MIB [RFC3635] does not support virtual Ethernet port,
   however it is sometimes desired to manage the PW as an Ethernet port
   via the Etherlike-MIB.  This MIB module supports an option to
   recognize the PW as an ifIndex, enabling standard use of the
   Etherlike-MIB to manage the PW.


5.  Feature Checklist

   The PW Ethernet MIB module (PW-ENET-STD-MIB) is designed to satisfy
   the following requirements and constraints:

   -  The MIB module is designed to work with the PW-STD-MIB [PWMIB].

   -  The MIB module is agnostic to the PSN type.

   -  The MIB module supports various options for selecting Ethernet
      packets into the PW, as defined in [RFC4448].  These include port-
      based PW, VLAN-based PW, VLAN-manipulated based (change, add or
      remove) between the port to be emulated and the PW.

Internet-Draft                 PW ENET MIB                 November 2007


   -  In the case of an MPLS PSN, the MIB module supports the use of
      multiple PWs to carry the same Ethernet service.  These PWs can be
      used to support L-LSPs or single COS E-LSPs capable PSN, when
      mapping of the Ethernet PRI bits to the PSN COS is required.

   -  The MIB module enables both point-to-point Ethernet services and
      VPLS services as discussed in the L2VPN working group [RFC4664].

   -  The MIB module allows modeling of the PW as an Ethernet virtual
      port to be managed via existing Ethernet MIBs like Etherlike-MIB
      [RFC3635].


6.  PW ENET MIB Module Usage

   -  The PW table (pwTable) is used for all PW types (ATM, FR,
      Ethernet, SONET, etc.).  This table contains high level generic
      parameters related to the PW creation.  A row is typically created
      by the operator (see [PWTC] for other options) for each PW
      service.

   -  Based on the PSN type defined for the PW, rows are created in PSN
      specific module (for example [PWMPLSMIB]) and associated to the
      pwTable by the common pwIndex.

   -  If the PW type is Ethernet or EthernetTagged a row is created by
      the agent in pwEnetTable.

7.  PW-ENET Management Model

   The management model for the Ethernet PW is shown in Figure 1, and is
   based on the PW layering [RFC3985].

                              May be modeled as
                                  ifIndex

      Notation:
      o       A physical CE-bound PE port
      +       A PW IWF instance interface to the forwarder.
      X       A PE PSN-bound port.

                 Figure 1: A simple point-to-point service

   In the typical point-to-point service, the object pwEnetPortIfIndex
   associates the physical CE-bound PE port ('o') to the PW (it is
   allowed to have multiple PWs associated to the same physical port).
   This MIB module also manages some of the possible operations of the
   forwarder.

   In some models it is convenient to model the forwarder virtual
   interface to a PW IWF instance ('+') as an ifIndex.  As discussed in
   the [PWMIB], this is possible by using the PW ifType in the ifTable
   and indicating the ifIndex in the main pwTable.  In case of Ethernet
   PW a virtual interface of ifType = etherLike will be assigned on top
   of the PW interface to enable statistics gathering and statuses and
   other management configuration tasks via existing tools.  This way,
   the PW instance is managed as virtual Ethernet interface in the PE.

   The model for using the PW in non-point-to-point applications, such
   as VPLS are done with the same principle in mind, except that the
   creation of the tables is related typically to an auto-discovery
   process.

8.  Example of the PW-ENET MIB Module Usage

   Assume we would like to create a PW of type VLAN between two PEs, for
   VLAN value 5.

   -  Follows the example in [PWMIB], with pwType equals
      'ethernetTagged'.

   -  The agent creates a row in pwEnetTable and a row in
      pwEnetStatsTable for the specified pwIndex.  The pwEnetPwInstance
      is automatically set by the agent to the value of '1'.

   -  The operator fills the following entries in the pwEnetTable:

          pwEnetPwVlan        5,
          pwEnetVlanMode      noChange,
          pwEnetPortVlan      5,

          pwEnetPortIfIndex   1001,
          pwEnetPwIfIndex     0, -- Not managed in the
                                   -- Etherlike MIB module
          ...

   -  The PW is ready for forwarding when signaling has been
      accomplished successfully between the two peers.


9.  Service Delimiting Modes

   This section describes how the MIB module supports point-to-point
   applications with various VLAN service delimiting options on the
   original Ethernet port and the corresponding PW mode and VLAN values.
   If the PW is attached to VPLS service, the PW is associated to a
   virtual interface that is attached to a bridge or VPLS forwarder.
   The bridging function between local physical ports and virtual
   interfaces that are later associated tp PWs is not handled via this
   MIB module.

   There are 3 main service types that are supported by this MIB module:

   (1)  Port mode: In this mode, the whole traffic from the port is
        mapped to the PW.

        A.  In the typical application, the packet is sent to the PW as
            is:

Internet-Draft                 PW ENET MIB                 November 2007


           pwEnetPwVlan        4097,
           pwEnetVlanMode      portMode,
           pwEnetPortVlan      4097,

           pwType              Ethernet,

        B.  It is possible to add a provider tag (value 10 for example)
            to the packet when it is sent over the PW:

           pwEnetPwVlan        10,
           pwEnetVlanMode      addVlan,
           pwEnetPortVlan      4097,

           pwType SHOULD be set to 'EthernetTagged'.

   (2)  Single VLAN: In this mode, only the first VLAN field on the
        packet from the physical port is the service delimiting tag, as
        an example VLAN=5.  The following options of processing are
        possible:

        A.  One to one mapping: The service delimiting tag is kept as is
            on the PW.

           pwEnetPwVlan        5,
           pwEnetVlanMode      noChange,
           pwEnetPortVlan      5,

           pwType SHOULD be set to 'EthernetTagged'.


        B.  VLAN change mapping: The service delimiting tag changes its
            value (to value of 6) on the PW.

           pwEnetPwVlan        6,
           pwEnetVlanMode      changeVlan,
           pwEnetPortVlan      5,

           pwType SHOULD be set to 'EthernetTagged'.

        C.  The service delimiting tag is removed when the packet is
            sent to the PW.

           pwEnetPwVlan        5,
           pwEnetVlanMode      removeVlan,
           pwEnetPortVlan      4097,

           pwType SHOULD be set to 'EthernetTagged'.

            It should be noted that this mode is also applicable when
            the service delimiting tag is a service provider tag (VLAN=5
            in this case), and the node removes this VLAN and maps the
            traffic to a single PW independent of the packet format on
            top of this VLAN.

        D.  Untagged packets mapped to a PW as is (packets with a VLAN
            field from the same port MAY be mapped to other PWs).

           pwEnetPwVlan        4096,
           pwEnetVlanMode      noChange,
           pwEnetPortVlan      4096,

           pwType MAY equal 'Ethernet' or 'EthernetTagged'.

        E.  Untagged packets mapped to a PW, and a VLAN field is added
            to the packet.

           pwEnetPwVlan        6,
           pwEnetVlanMode      addVlan,
           pwEnetPortVlan      4096,

           pwType SHOULD be set to 'EthernetTagged'.

        F.  A provider VLAN (value 10) is added to packets arriving with
            VLAN value 5 before they are sent to the PW.

           pwEnetPwVlan        10,
           pwEnetVlanMode      addVlan,
           pwEnetPortVlan      5,

           pwType SHOULD be set to 'EthernetTagged'.

   (3)  Nested VLAN (QinQ): When only the first VLAN is the service
        delimiting tag, one of the modes as described in 2) SHOULD be
        used.  If the service delimiting tag is both the first VLAN and
        the second VLAN, the following option is supported by this MIB
        module:
        Assuming the provider VLAN tag equals 5 and the user VLAN tag
        equal 100, this traffic can be mapped to the PW without the
        provider tag by using the following configuration:

         pwEnetPwVlan        100,
         pwEnetVlanMode      removeVLAN,
         pwEnetPortVlan      5,

         It is RECOMMENDED that the pwType would equal 'EthernetTagged',
         but pwType equal to 'Ethernet' MAY be used as well.

        Packets with the same provider tag MAY be mapped to other PWs.

   (4)  Other scenarios are considered out of the scope and should be
        handled by other MIB modules that manage the forwarder and the
        NSP sections.

        PW-STD-MIB module.
        The pwIndex and the pwEnetPwInstance are used as indexes
        to allow multiple VLANs to exist on the same PW.

        An entry is created in this table by the agent for every
        entry in the pwTable with a pwType of 'ethernetTagged'
        or 'ethernet'. Additional rows may be created by the
        operator or the agent if multiple entries are required for
        the same PW.

        The value of pwEnetPwInstance can be arbitrary selected
        to make the row unique, however implementations that know
        the VLAN field value when the row is created MAY use the
        value of the VLAN itself for better readability and
        backward compatibility with older versions of this MIB
        module.

        This table provides Ethernet port mapping and VLAN
        configuration for each Ethernet PW.

        All read-create object in this table MAY be changed at any
        time, however change of some objects (for example
        pwEnetVlanMode) during PW forwarding state MAY cause traffic
        disruption.

        Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a
        re-boot, the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those
        entries. If the set of entires of a specific row are found to
        be non consistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus MUST be
        declared as notPresent(5).

        - 'other' indicates an operation that is not defined by
          this MIB module.

        - 'portBased' indicates that the forwarder will forward
          packets between the port and the PW independent of their
          structure (i.e. there is no service delimiting VLAN tags
          from the PE standpoint).

        - 'noChange' indicates that the PW contains the original
           user VLAN, as specified in pwEnetPortVlan, i.e. the
           VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting tag
           and is kept 'as is' on the PW.

        - 'changeVlan' indicates that the VLAN field on the PW
          may be different than the VLAN field on the user's
          port. The VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting
          tag but has a different value on the PW.

        - 'removeVlan' indicates that the encapsulation on the
          PW does not include the service delimiting VLAN field.
          Note that PRI bits transparency is lost in this case.

        - 'addVlan' indicates that a VLAN field will be added
          on the PSN bound direction (i.e. on the PW). pwEnetPwVlan
          indicates the value that will be added.

        - Implementation of 'portsbased', 'removeVlan', 'addVlan'
          'other' and 'changeVlan' is OPTIONAL.

11.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   of PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for
   configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be configured
   can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwEnetTable contains objects to provision Ethernet PWs.
      Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result in
      disruption of traffic on the network.  The use of stronger
      mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where
      possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any
      v3 agent which implements this MIB module.  Administrators should
      consider whether read access to these objects should be allowed,
      since read access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwEnetTable shows the Ethernet PW service configuration.  If
      an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then
      these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.




Zelig & Nadeau            Expires May 21, 2008                 [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                 PW ENET MIB                 November 2007


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


12.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         pwEnetStdMIB         { transmission XXXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXXX" under the 'transmission'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.
