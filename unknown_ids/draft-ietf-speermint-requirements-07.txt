Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


1.  Introduction

   Peering at the session level represents an agreement between parties
   to exchange multimedia traffic.  It is assumed that these sessions
   use the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol to enable peering
   between two or more actors.  These actors are called SIP Service
   Providers (SSPs) and they are typically represented by users, user
   groups such as enterprises, real-time collaboration service
   communities, or other service providers offering voice or multimedia
   services using SIP.

   A reference architecture for SIP session peering is described in
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-architecture].  A number of use cases describe
   how session peering has been or could be deployed based on the
   reference architecture
   ([I-D.ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases] and
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-consolidated-presence-im-usecases]).

   Peering at the session layer can be achieved on a bilateral basis
   (direct peering established directly between two SSPs), or on an
   indirect basis via a session intermediary (indirect peering via a
   third-party SSP that has a trust relationship with the SSPs) - see
   the terminology document for more details.

   This document first describes general requirements.  The use cases
   are then analyzed in the spirit of extracting relevant protocol
   requirements that must be met to accomplish the use cases.  These
   requirements are intended to be independent of the type of media
   exchanged such as Voice over IP (VoIP), video telephony, and instant
   messaging.  Requirements specific to presence and instant messaging
   are defined in Section 4.

   It is not the goal of this document to mandate any particular use of
   IETF protocols by SIP Service Providers in order to establish session
   peering.  Instead, the document highlights what requirements should
   be met and what protocols may be used to define the solution space.

   Finally, we conclude with a list of parameters for the definition of
   a session peering policy, provided in an informative appendix.  It
   should be considered as an example of the information SIP Service
   Providers may have to discuss or agree on to exchange SIP traffic.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-terminology].  It is assumed that the reader is
   familiar with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] and
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  Finally, when used
   with capital letters, the terms 'Authentication Service' are to be
   understood as defined by SIP Identity [RFC4474].

3.  General Requirements

   The following sub-sections contain general requirements applicable to
   multiple use cases for multimedia session peering.

3.1.  Scope

   The primary focus of this document is on the requirements applicable
   to the boundaries of Layer 5 SIP networks: SIP entities, Signaling
   path Border Elements (SBEs), and the associated protocol requirements
   for the look-up and location routing of the session establishment
   data.  The requirements applicable to SIP UAs or related to the
   provisioning of the session data are considered out of scope.

   SSPs desiring to establish session peering relationships have to
   reach an agreement on numerous points.
   This document highlights only certain aspects of a session peering
   agreement, mostly the requirements relevant to protocols: the
   declaration, advertisement and management of ingress and egress
   border elements for session signaling and media, information related
   to the Session Establishment Data (SED), and the security properties
   that may be desirable for secure session exchanges.
   Numerous other considerations of session peering arrangements are
   critical to reach a successful agreement but they are considered out
   of scope of the SPEERMINT working group.  They include information
   about SIP protocol support (e.g.  SIP extensions and field
   conventions), media (e.g., type of media traffic to be exchanged,
   compatible media codecs and transport protocols, mechanisms to ensure
   differentiated quality of service for media), layer-3 IP connectivity
   between the Signaling and Data path Border Elements, accounting and
   traffic capacity control (e.g. the maximum number of SIP sessions at
   each ingress point, or the maximum number of concurrent IM or VoIP
   sessions).

   The informative Appendix A lists parameters that may be considered
   when discussing the technical parameters of SIP session peering.  The
   purpose of this list is to capture the parameters that are considered
   outside the scope of the protocol requirements.

3.2.  Border Elements

   For border elements to be operationally manageable, maximum
   flexibility should be given for how they are declared or dynamically
   advertised.  Indeed, in any session peering environment, there is a
   need for a SIP Service Provider to declare or dynamically advertise
   the SIP entities that will face the peer's network.  The data path
   border elements are typically signaled dynamically in the session
   description.

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


   The use cases defined in
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases] catalog the various
   border elements between SIP Service Providers; they include Signaling
   path Border Elements (SBEs) and SIP proxies (or any SIP entity at the
   boundary of the Layer 5 network).

   o  Requirement #1:
      Protocol mechanisms MUST be provided to enable a SIP Service
      Provider to communicate the ingress Signaling Path Border Elements
      of its service domain.

      Notes on solution space:
      The SBEs may be advertised to session peers using static
      mechanisms or they may be dynamically advertised.  There is
      general agreement that [RFC3263] provides a solution for
      dynamically advertising ingress SBEs in most cases of Direct or
      Indirect peering.  However, this DNS-based solution may be limited
      in cases where the DNS response varies based on who sends the
      query (peer-dependent SBEs, see below).

   o  Requirement #2:
      Protocol mechanisms MUST be provided to enable a SIP Service
      Provider to communicate the egress SBEs of its service domain.

      Notes on motivations for this requirement:
      For the purposes of capacity planning, traffic engineering and
      call admission control, a SIP Service Provider may be asked where
      it will generate SIP calls from.  The SSP accepting calls from a
      peer may wish to know where SIP calls will originate from (this
      information is typically used by the terminating SSP).
      While provisioning requirements are out-of-scope, some SSPs may
      find use for a mechanism to dynamically advertise or discover the
      egress SBEs of a peer.

   If the SSP also provides media streams to its users as shown in the
   use cases for "Originating" and "Terminating" SSPs, a mechanism must
   exist to allow SSPs to advertise their egress and ingress data path
   border elements (DBEs), if applicable.  While some SSPs may have open
   policies and accept media traffic from anywhere outside their network
   to anywhere inside their network, some SSPs may want to optimize
   media delivery and identify media paths between peers prior to
   traffic being sent (layer 5 to layer 3 QoS mapping).

   o  Requirement #3:
      Protocol mechanisms MUST be provided to allow a SIP Service
      Provider to communicate its DBEs to its peers.

      Notes: Some SSPs engaged in SIP interconnects do exchange this



Mule                     Expires April 20, 2009                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


      type of DBE information today in a static manner.  Some SSPs do
      not.

   In some SIP networks, SSPs operate the same border elements for all
   peers.  In other SIP networks, it is common for SSPs to advertise
   specific SBEs and DBEs to certain peers: the advertisement of SBEs
   and DBEs may be peer-dependent.

   o  Requirement #4:
      The mechanisms recommended for the declaration or advertisement of
      SBE and DBE entities MUST allow for peer variability.

      Notes on solution space:
      For advertising peer-dependent SBEs (peer variability), the
      solution space based on [RFC3263] is under specified and there are
      no know best current practices.  Is DNS the right place for
      putting data that varies based on who asks?

      Notes on media-variability of such advertisements:
      Some SSPs may have some restrictions on the type of media traffic
      their SBEs can accept.  For SIP sessions however, it is not
      possible to communicate those restrictions in advance of the
      session initiation: a SIP target may support voice-only media,
      voice and video, or voice and instant messaging communications.
      While the inability to find out whether a particular type of SIP
      session can be terminated by a certain SBE can cause failed
      session establishment attempts, there is consensus to not add a
      new requirement for this.  These aspects are essentially covered
      by SSPs when discussing traffic exchange policies (out of scope of
      this document).

   In the use cases provided as part of direct and indirect peering
   scenarios, an SSP deals with multiple SIP entities and multiple SBEs
   in its own domain.  There is often a many-to-many relationship
   between the SIP Proxies considered inside the trusted network
   boundary of the SSP and its Signaling path Border Elements at the
   network boundaries.
   It should be possible for an SSP to define which egress SBE a SIP
   entity must use based on a given peer destination.
   For example, in the case of an indirect peering scenario (section 5.
   of [I-D.ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases], Figure 5), it
   should be possible for the SIP proxy in the originating network
   (O-Proxy) to select the appropriate egress SBE (O-SBE) to reach the
   SIP target based on the information the proxy receives from the
   Lookup Function (O-LUF) and/or Location Routing Function (O-LRF) -
   message response labeled (2).  Note that this example also applies to
   the case of Direct Peering when a service provider has multiple
   service areas and each service area involves multiple SIP Proxies and



Mule                     Expires April 20, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


   a few SBEs.

   o  Requirement #5:
      The mechanisms recommended for the Look-Up Function (LUF) and the
      Location Routing Functions (LRF) MUST be capable of returning both
      a target URI destination and a value providing the next SIP
      hop(s).

      Notes: solutions may exist depending on the choice of the protocol
      used between the Proxy and its LUF/LRF.  The idea is for the
      O-Proxy to be provided with the next SIP hop and the equivalent of
      one or more SIP Route header values.  If ENUM is used as a
      protocol for the LUF, the solution space is undefined.

   It is desirable for an SSP to be able to communicate how
   authentication of a peer's SBEs will occur (see the security
   requirements for more details).

   o  Requirement #6:
      The mechanisms recommended for locating a peer's SBE MUST be able
      to convey how a peer should initiate secure session establishment.

      Notes : some mechanisms exist.  For example, the required protocol
      use of SIP over TLS may be discovered via [RFC3263].

3.3.  Session Establishment Data

   The Session Establishment Data (SED) is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-terminology] as the data used to route a call to
   the next hop associated with the called domain's ingress point.  The
   following paragraphs capture some general requirements on the SED
   data.

3.3.1.  User Identities and SIP URIs

   User identities used between peers can be represented in many
   different formats.  Session Establishment Data should rely on URIs
   (Uniform Resource Identifiers, [RFC3986]) and SIP URIs should be
   preferred over tel URIs ([RFC3966]) for session peering of VoIP
   traffic.
   The use of DNS domain names and hostnames is recommended in SIP URIs
   and they should be resolvable on the public Internet.  As for the
   user part of the SIP URIs, the mechanisms for session peering should
   not require an SSP to be aware of which individual user identities
   are valid within its peer's domain.

   o  Requirement #7:
      The protocols used for session peering MUST accommodate the use of



Mule                     Expires April 20, 2009                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


      different types of URIs.  URIs with the same domain-part SHOULD
      share the same set of peering policies, thus the domain of the SIP
      URI may be used as the primary key to any information regarding
      the reachability of that SIP URI.  The host part of SIP URIs
      SHOULD contain a fully-qualified domain name instead of a numeric
      IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   o  Requirement #8:
      The mechanisms for session peering should not require an SSP to be
      aware of which individual user identities are valid within its
      peer's domain.

   o  Notes on the solution space for #7 and #8:
      This is generally well supported by IETF protocols.  When
      telephone numbers are in tel URIs, SIP requests cannot be routed
      in accordance with the traditional DNS resolution procedures
      standardized for SIP as indicated in [RFC3824].  This means that
      the solutions built for session peering must not solely use PSTN
      identifiers such as Service Provider IDs (SPIDs) or Trunk Group
      IDs (they should not be precluded but solutions should not be
      limited to these).
      Motivations:
      Although SED data may be based on E.164-based SIP URIs for voice
      interconnects, a generic peering methodology should not rely on
      such E.164 numbers.

3.3.2.  URI Reachability

   Based on a well-known URI type (for e.g. sip:, pres:, or im: URIs),
   it must be possible to determine whether the SSP domain servicing the
   URI allows for session peering, and if it does, it should be possible
   to locate and retrieve the domain's policy and SBE entities.
   For example, an originating service provider must be able to
   determine whether a SIP URI is open for direct interconnection
   without requiring an SBE to initiate a SIP request.  Furthermore,
   since each call setup implies the execution of any proposed
   algorithm, the establishment of a SIP session via peering should
   incur minimal overhead and delay, and employ caching wherever
   possible to avoid extra protocol round trips.

   o  Requirement #9:
      The mechanisms for session peering MUST allow an SBE to locate its
      peer SBE given a URI type and the target SSP domain name.

4.  Requirements for Session Peering of Presence and Instant Messaging

   This section describes requirements for presence and instant
   messaging session peering.  Several use cases for presence and
   instant messaging peering are described in
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-consolidated-presence-im-usecases], a document
   authored by A. Houri, E. Aoki and S. Parameswar.  Credits for this
   section must go to A. Houri, E. Aoki and S. Parameswar.

   The following requirements for presence and instant messaging session
   peering are derived from
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-consolidated-presence-im-usecases] and an initial
   set of related requirements published by A. Houri, E. Aoki and S.
   Parameswar:

   o  Requirement #10:
      The mechanisms recommended for the exchange of presence
      information between SSPs MUST allow a user of one SSP's presence
      community to subscribe presentities served by another SSP via its
      local community, including subscriptions to a single presentity, a
      personal, public or ad-hoc group list of presentities.

      Notes: see section 2.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-speermint-consolidated-presence-im-usecases].

   o  Requirement #11:
      The mechanisms recommended for Instant Messaging message exchanges
      between SSPs MUST allow a user of one SSP's community to
      communicate with users of the other SSP community via their local
      community using various methods.  Such methods include sending a
      one-time IM message, initiating a SIP session for transporting
      sessions of messages, participating in n-way chats using chat
      rooms with users from the peer SSPs, sending a file or sharing a
      document.

      Notes: see section 2.6 of
      [I-D.ietf-speermint-consolidated-presence-im-usecases].

   o  Requirement #12: Privacy Sharing
      In order to enable sending less notifications between communities,
      there should be a mechanism that will enable sharing privacy
      information of users between the communities.  This will enable
      sending a single notification per presentity that will be sent to
      the appropriate watchers on the other community according to the
      presentity's privacy information.
      The privacy sharing mechanism must be done in a way that will
      enable getting the consent of the user whose privacy will be sent
      to the other community prior to sending the privacy information.



Mule                     Expires April 20, 2009                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


      if user consent is not give, it should not be possible to this
      optimization.  In addition to getting the consent of users
      regarding privacy sharing, the privacy data must be sent only via
      secure channels between communities.

      Notes: see section 2.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-speermint-consolidated-presence-im-usecases].

   o  Requirement #13: Multiple Recipients
      It should be possible to send a presence document with a list of
      watchers on the other community that should receive the presence
      document notification.  This will enable sending less presence
      document notifications between the communities while avoiding the
      need to share privacy information of presentities from one
      community to the other.

   o  Requirement #14: Mappings
      Early deployments of SIP based presence and IM gateways are done
      in front of legacy proprietary systems that use different names
      for different properties that exist in PIDF.  For example "Do Not
      Disturb" may be translated to "Busy" in another system.  In order
      to make sure that the meaning of the status is preserved, there is
      a need that either each system will translate its internal
      statuses to standard PIDF based statuses of a translation table of
      proprietary statuses to standard based PIDF statuses will be
      provided from one system to the other.

5.  Security Considerations

   This section describes the security properties that are desirable for
   the protocol exchanges in scope of session peering.  Three types of
   information flows are described in the architecture and use case
   documents: the acquisition of the Session Establishment Data (SED)
   based on a destination target via the Lookup and Location Routing
   Functions (LUF and LRF), the SIP signaling between SIP Service
   Providers, and the associated media exchanges.

   This section is focused on three security services, authentication,
   data confidentiality and data integrity as summarized in [RFC3365].
   However, this text does not specify the mandatory-to-implement
   security mechanisms as required by [RFC3365]; this is left for future
   protocol solutions that meet the requirements.

   A security threat analysis provides additional guidance for session
   peering ([I-D.niccolini-speermint-voipthreats]).

5.1.  Security Properties for the Acquisition of Session Establishment
      Data

   The Look-Up Function (LUF) and Location Routing Function (LRF) are
   defined in [I-D.ietf-speermint-terminology].  They provide mechanisms
   for determining the SIP target address and domain the request should
   be sent to, and the associated SED to route the request to that
   domain.

   o  Requirement #15:
      The protocols used to query the Lookup and Location Routing
      Functions MUST support mutual authentication.

      Motivations:
      A mutual authentication service is desirable for the LUF and LRF
      protocol exchanges.  The content of the response returned by the
      LUF and LRF may depend on the identity of the requestor: the
      authentication of the LUF & LRF requests is therefore a desirable
      property.  Mutual authentication is also desirable: the requestor
      may verify the identity of the systems that provided the LUF & LRF
      responses given the nature of the data returned in those
      responses.  Authentication also provides some protection for the
      availability of the LUF and LRF against attackers that would
      attempt to launch DoS attacks by sending bogus requests causing
      the LUF to perform a lookup and consume resources.

   o  Requirement #16:
      The protocols used to query the Lookup and Location Routing
      Functions MUST provide support for data confidentiality and

      integrity.

      Motivations:
      Given the sensitive nature of the session establishment data
      exchanged with the LUF and LRF functions, the protocol mechanisms
      chosen for the lookup and location routing should offer data
      confidentiality and integrity protection (SED data may contain
      user addresses, SIP URI, location of SIP entities at the
      boundaries of SIP Service Provider domains, etc.).

   o  Notes on the solution space for Requirements #15 and #16: ENUM,
      SIP and proprietary protocols are typically used today for
      accessing these functions.  Even though SSPs may use lower layer
      security mechanisms to guarantee some of those security
      properties, candidate protocols for the LUF and LRF must meet the
      above requirements.

5.2.  Security Properties for the SIP signaling exchanges

   The SIP signaling exchanges are out of scope of this document.  This
   section describes some of the security properties that are desirable
   in the context of SIP interconnects between SSPs without formulating
   any normative requirements.

   In general, the security properties desirable for the SIP exchanges
   in an inter-domain context apply to session peering.  These include:

   o  securing the transport of SIP messages between the peers' SBEs.
      Authentication of SIP communications is desirable, especially in
      the context of session peering involving SIP intermediaries.  Data
      confidentiality and integrity of the SIP message body may be
      desirable as well given some of the levels of session peering
      indirection (indirect/assisted peering), but they could be harmful
      as they may prevent intermediary SSPs from "inserting" SBEs/DBEs
      along the signaling and data paths.

   o  providing an Authentication Service to authenticate the identity
      of connected users based on the SIP Service Provider domains (for
      both the SIP requests and the responses).

   The fundamental mechanisms for securing SIP between proxy servers
   intra- and inter-domain are applicable to session peering; refer to
   Section 26.2 of [RFC3261] for transport-layer security of SIP
   messages using TLS, [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse] for establishing TLS
   connections between proxies, [RFC4474] for the protocol mechanisms to
   verify the identity of the senders of SIP requests in an inter-domain
   context, and [RFC4916] for verifying the identity of the sender of
   SIP responses).

5.3.  End-to-End Media Security

   Media security is critical to guarantee end-to-end confidentiality of
   the communication between the end-users' devices, independently of
   how many direct or indirect peers are present along the signaling
   path.  A number of desirable security properties emerge from this
   goal.

   The establishment of media security may be achieved along the media
   path and not over the signaling path given the indirect peering use
   cases.
   For example, media carried over the Real-Time Protocol (RTP) can be
   secured using secure RTP (SRTP [RFC3711]).  A framework for
   establishing SRTP security using Datagram TLS [RFC4347] is described
   in [I-D.ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework]: it allows for end-to-end media
   security establishment using extensions to DTLS
   ([I-D.ietf-avt-dtls-srtp]).
   It should also be noted that media can be carried in numerous
   protocols other than RTP such as SIP (SIP MESSAGE method), MSRP,
   XMPP, etc., over TCP ([RFC4571]), and that it can be encrypted over
   secure connection-oriented transport sessions over TLS ([RFC4572]).

   A desirable security property for session peering is for SIP entities
   to be transparent to the end-to-end media security negotiations: SIP
   entities should not intervene in the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) exchanges for end-to-end media security.

   o  Requirement #17:
      The protocols used to enable session peering MUST NOT interfere
      with the exchanges of media security attributes in SDP.  Media
      attribute lines that are not understood by SBEs MUST be ignored
      and passed along the signaling path untouched.

Appendix A.  Policy Parameters for Session Peering

   This informative section lists various types of parameters that
   should be considered by implementers when deciding what configuration
   variables to expose to system administrators or management stations,
   as well as SSPs or federations of SSPs when discussing the technical
   part of a session peering policy.

   In the context of session peering, a policy can be defined as the set
   of parameters and other information needed by an SSP to exchange
   traffic with another peer.  Some of the session policy parameters may
   be statically exchanged and set throughout the lifetime of the
   peering relationship.  Others parameters may be discovered and
   updated dynamically using by some explicit protocol mechanisms.
   These dynamic parameters may be session-dependent, or the may apply
   over multiple sessions or peers.

   Various types of policy information may need to be discovered or
   exchanged in order to establish session peering.  At a minimum, a
   policy should specify information related to session establishment
   data in order to avoid session establishment failures.  A policy may
   also include information related to QoS, billing and accounting,
   layer-3 related interconnect requirements which are out of the scope
   of this document.

   Some aspects of session peering policies must be agreed to and
   manually implemented; they are static and are typically documented as
   part of a business contract, technical document or agreement between
   parties.  For some parameters linked to protocol support and
   capabilities, standard ways of expressing those policy parameters may
   be defined among SSP and exchanged dynamically.  For e.g., templates
   could be created in various document formats so that it could be
   possible to dynamically discover some of the domain policy.  Such
   templates could be initiated by implementers (for each software/
   hardware release, a list of supported RFCs, RFC parameters is
   provided in a standard format) and then adapted by each SSP based on
   its service description, server or device configurations and variable
   based on peer relationships.

A.1.  Categories of Parameters for VoIP Session Peering and
      Justifications

   The following list should be considered as an initial list of
   "discussion topics" to be addressed by peers when initiating a VoIP
   peering relationship.

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


   o  IP Network Connectivity:
      Session peers should define how the IP network connectivity
      between their respective SBEs and DBEs.  While this is out of
      scope of session peering, SSPs must agree on a common mechanism
      for IP transport of session signaling and media.  This may be
      accomplish via private (e.g.  IPVPN, IPsec, etc.) or public IP
      networks.

   o  Media-related Parameters:

      *  Media Codecs: list of supported media codecs for audio, real-
         time fax (version of T.38, if applicable), real-time text (RFC
         4103), DTMF transport, voice band data communications (as
         applicable) along with the supported or recommended codec
         packetization rates, level of RTP payload redundancy, audio
         volume levels, etc.

      *  Media Transport: level of support for RTP-RTCP [RFC3550], RTP
         Redundancy (RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data - [RFC2198]) ,
         T.38 transport over RTP, etc.

      *  Media variability at the Signaling path Border Elements: list
         of media types supported by the various ingress points of a
         peer's network.

      *  Other: support of the VoIP metric block as defined in RTP
         Control Protocol Extended Reports [RFC3611] , etc.

   o  SIP:

      *  A session peering policy should include the list of supported
         and required SIP RFCs, supported and required SIP methods
         (including private p headers if applicable), error response
         codes, supported or recommended format of some header field
         values , etc.

      *  It should also be possible to describe the list of supported
         SIP RFCs by various functional groupings.  A group of SIP RFCs
         may represent how a call feature is implemented (call hold,
         transfer, conferencing, etc.), or it may indicate a functional
         grouping as in [I-D.ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide].

   o  Accounting:
      Methods used for call or session accounting should be specified.
      An SSP may require a peer to track session usage.  It is critical
      for peers to determine whether the support of any SIP extensions
      for accounting is a pre-requisite for SIP interoperability.  In
      some cases, call accounting may feed data for billing purposes but

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


      not always: some operators may decide to use accounting as a 'bill
      and keep' model to track session usage and monitor usage against
      service level agreements.
      [RFC3702] defines the terminology and basic requirements for
      accounting of SIP sessions.  A few private SIP extensions have
      also been defined and used over the years to enable call
      accounting between SSP domains such as the P-Charging* headers in
      [RFC3455], the P-DCS-Billing-Info header in [RFC3603], etc.

   o  Performance Metrics:
      Layer-5 performance metrics should be defined and shared between
      peers.  The performance metrics apply directly to signaling or
      media; they may be used pro-actively to help avoid congestion,
      call quality issues or call signaling failures, and as part of
      monitoring techniques, they can be used to evaluate the
      performance of peering exchanges.
      Examples of SIP performance metrics include the maximum number of
      SIP transactions per second on per domain basis, Session
      Completion Rate (SCR), Session Establishment Rate (SER), etc.
      Some SIP end-to-end performance metrics are defined in
      [I-D.ietf-pmol-sip-perf-metrics]; a subset of these may be
      applicable to session peering and interconnects.
      Some media-related metrics for monitoring VoIP calls have been
      defined in the VoIP Metrics Report Block, in Section 4.7 of
      [RFC3611].

   o  Security:
      An SSP should describe the security requirements that other peers
      must meet in order to terminate calls to its network.  While such
      a list of security-related policy parameters often depends on the
      security models pre-agreed to by peers, it is expected that these
      parameters will be discoverable or signaled in the future to allow
      session peering outside SSP clubs.  The list of security
      parameters may be long and composed of high-level requirements
      (e.g. authentication, privacy, secure transport) and low level
      protocol configuration elements like TLS parameters.
      The following list is not intended to be complete, it provides a
      preliminary list in the form of examples:

      *  Call admission requirements: for some providers, sessions can
         only be admitted if certain criteria are met.  For example, for
         some providers' networks, only incoming SIP sessions signaled
         over established IPsec tunnels or presented to the well-known
         TLS ports are admitted.  Other call admission requirements may
         be related to some performance metrics as described above.
         Finally, it is possible that some requirements be imposed on
         lower layers, but these are considered out of scope of session
         peering.

Internet-Draft           SPEERMINT Requirements             October 2008


      *  Call authorization requirements and validation: the presence of
         a caller or user identity may be required by an SSP.  Indeed,
         some SSPs may further authorize an incoming session request by
         validating the caller's identity against white/black lists
         maintained by the service provider or users (traditional caller
         ID screening applications or IM white list).

      *  Privacy requirements: an SSP may demand that its SIP messages
         be securely transported by its peers for privacy reasons so
         that the calling/called party information be protected.  Media
         sessions may also require privacy and some SSP policies may
         include requirements on the use of secure media transport
         protocols such as SRTP, along with some constraints on the
         minimum authentication/encryption options for use in SRTP.

      *  Network-layer security parameters: this covers how IPsec
         security associated may be established, the IPsec key exchange
         mechanisms to be used and any keying materials, the lifetime of
         timed Security Associated if applicable, etc.

      *  Transport-layer security parameters: this covers how TLS
         connections should be established as described in Section
         Section 5.

   o  Accounting

   o  Capacity Control and Performance Management: any limits on, or,
      means to measure and limit the maximum number of active calls to a
      peer or federation, maximum number of sessions and messages per
      specified unit time, maximum number of active users or subscribers
      per specified unit time, the aggregate media bandwidth per peer or
      for the federation, specified SIP signaling performance metrics to
      measure and report; media-level VoIP metrics if applicable.

   o  Security: Call admission control, call authorization, network and
