Operators of multicast networks may apply various filters to multicast 
traffic at boundary routers or on MSDP peerings.  The aim of this text
is to document existing filtering practices, with a view to generating
some discussion towards producing guidance on best filtering practice.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
Multicast filtering can be applied at a multicast boundary or on
an MSDP peering as a means to prevent unintended leakage of multicast 
traffic beyond its desired scope.  An informal discussion of filtering
practices suggested that those practices vary from organisation
to organisation.  The aim of this text is to gather and document
commonly used existing filtering practices.  Whether it is then possible to
draw up a definitive best practice is to be determined; it is quite
possible that due to the shifting nature of the target that a point-in-time
recommendation would quickly be overtaken by events.  For example,
the recent addition of unicast prefix-based IPv4 multicast addresses
<xref target="RFC6034"/> meant that filtering of all of 234.0.0.0/8 became
undesirable. However, general principles may remain valid over time.
	</t>
	<t>
For sites on academic research networks, some examples of filtering
recommendations already exists, e.g. in documentation 
<xref target="I2multicast"/> from the Internet2 Multicast WG, and in
the JANET IPv4 Multicast Guide <xref target="JANETmulticast"/>.
There is also a more specific proposal for the Rutgers network 
<xref target="RutgersProposal"/>, which includes a good discussion of
organisational-local scope address usage within its network as a whole.
	</t>
	<t>
When determining filtering policies, one needs to consider how strict
to be; some ranges are not supposed to be used, but there may be no
harm per se in accepting them.
There are certainly some ranges that should not be filtered, such
as the newly assigned 234.0.0.0/8 range mentioned above, and the
GLOP range under 233.0.0.0/8.
	</t>
	<t>
An additional resource is the registry of IPv4 multicast address space
held by IANA <xref target="IANAmulticast"/>.  This registry should be
a definitive guide to the formal use of ranges of addresses within
the overall IPv4 multicast address space.  A similar registry is
maintained for IPv6 multicast address space <xref target="IANA6multicast"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
This text is a very early draft, aimed at soliciting feedback, both on 
content and whether the goal of the draft is actually worthwhile.
Different sites may have different requirements.  There may also be
issues with handling scope boundaries that need to be considered.  So
there may be general principles that could be captured in a document 
such as this, even if specific filtering rules are not included.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="" title="Border and MSDP Filtering">
	<t>
In this section we summarise IPv4 multicast addresses that are commonly
filtered at site borders or on MSDP peerings. Based on responses we
received from a couple of multicast community lists, it wasn't clear which
filters are applied on border routers and which on MSDP SA messages. 
Some sites apply minimal traffic filters, but heavier MSDP filtering.
	</t>
	<t>
A site may choose to filter on addresses or on observed TTLs; it is now
general practice to filter on addresses rather than the TTL filtering
that was common a long time ago.
	</t>
	<t>
Some sites choose to route multicast around their unicast firewalls, 
for performance or other operational reasons, but this shouldn't alter 
the requirement to filter groups appropriately where necessary.
	</t>
	<t>
In this section we draw on the small number contributions so far; we hope 
to get more inputs in time.  In general, many 224.0.0.* addresses that 
are used by infrastructure are typically blocked, as well as some addresses 
that are global scope but should not be, like Ghostcast.  
	</t>
	<t>
The following list includes multicast IPv4 addresses that are being filtered
based on the union of responses received so far (hence the apparent
duplication of certain prefixes).  The list of filters
applied by all respondents would be somewhat shorter.

	<t>
One site gave figures for matches/hits on its filters; it may be 
interesting to gather such statistics at other sites.
	</t>
	<t>
Different networks make different use of the scoped address space
under 239.0.0.0/8, which may lead to different organisational filters
in different scenarios.  Organisation-local scope IPv4 multicast 
addressing is described in <xref target="RFC2365"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
The SSM range 232.0.0.0/8 should not be carried in MSDP peerings;
this is an example of different policy applied at the site border 
to an MSDP peering. Usually the filters are probably the same though.
	</t>
	<t>
As a general principle, multicast sourced from private address ranges
<xref target="RFC1918"/> or from 169.254.0.0/16, 192.0.2.0/24 or 
127.0.0.0/8 should be dropped, regardless of the multicast destination.
	</t>
	<t>
In certain cases, rate limiting may be desirable, where complete filtering
might not, e.g. in mitigating against SAP <xref target="RFC2974"/> storms,
or against unintended MSDP SA bursts.
	</t>
	<t>
Where BSR is deployed, a site should consider dropping BSR packets 
at its border, both BSR messages and C-RP messages.
Except for Embedded-RP it probably makes sense to drop PIM register 
messages at the site border, unless a site's RP is external.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Org" title="Organisational filtering">
	<t>
As described in <xref target="RutgersProposal"/>, a site may use 
multiple organisational scopes within its site, which may use different
blocks from 239.0.0.0/8, and thus require appropriate filtering
at boundaries, e.g. between metropolitan campuses.
	</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Subnet" title="Subnet filtering">
	<t>
Two respondents are currently filtering uPNP between subnets, and one
is filtering mDNS. One reason for the uPNP filtering was due to issues 
with errant Ricoh printers which flood announcements with too-large TTLs.
	</t>
	<t>
Subnet filtering may help protect against other forms of misconfigured
client subnets.
One site has networks that consist of multiple edge routers, where the 
outside 'LAN side' is strictly meant to be for local subnets only, and 
all intranet comms are to go through the 'WAN interface'. They have had 
cases where multihomed client networks were misconfigured, cross-connecting 
IP subnets with layer 2 boxes.
To prevent multiplication of multicasts, they configure all edge routers 
in the intranet to accept multicast packets from the 'LAN side' only if 
the source IP of the multicast packets belongs to the IP subnet of that 
LAN. So it's a simple filter, with no scaling issues.
	</t>
	<t>
At least one site is filtering multicast traffic from its wireless links;
this is presumably streamed video or audio content.  Multicast support is
required on wireless links for IPv6 operation. At layer 2, multicast IPv6
Router Advertisements may be filtered on ports that do not have known
routers attached.
	</t>
	<t>
One site is running per-subnet boundary filters on its wired multicast-enabled
subnets.  The list below reflects these.  One could add local scope relative 
addresses, though in practice the latter would all fall under 239.255.0.0/16 
if it is the smallest scope group applied to a subnet.

The importance of such subnet filtering may depend on TTLs used.

<section anchor="Conclusions" title="Conclusions">
	<t>
This text is a very drafty first version of a document aimed to summarise
the use of multicast filtering practices in the wild.  It includes filters
at various boundaries as well as MSDP SA filters.  Further feedback on 
the text, and the practices reported to date is welcomed.
