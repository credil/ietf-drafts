Internet-Draft   IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis          July 2011 
    

    

1. Introduction 

   As introduced in [RFC5887], renumbering, especially for medium to 
   large sites and networks, is currently viewed as an expensive, 
   painful, and error-prone process, avoided by network managers as much 
   as possible. If IPv6 site renumbering continues to be considered 
   difficult, network managers will turn to Provider Independent (PI) 
   addressing for IPv6 to attempt to minimize the need for future 
   renumbering. However, widespread use of PI may create very serious 
   BGP4 scaling problems. It is thus desirable to develop tools and 
   practices that may make renumbering a simpler process to reduce 
   demand for IPv6 PI space. 

   This document performs a gap analysis to provide a basis for future 
   work to identify and develop solutions or to stimulate such 
   development as appropriate. Gap analysis draws on existing work in 
   (at least) [RFC5887] and [RFC4192]. The [I-D.jiang-6renum-enterprise] 
   contributions are incorporated into the more detailed gap analysis. 
   In this document, we discuss the overall requirements for  
   renumbering. The gap analysis is organized by the main steps of 
   renumbering process, which include the prefix management, the node 
   address (re)configuration, and address relevant entries update in 
   various gateways, routers and servers, etc. Besides the steps, a sub-
   clause of renumbering event management is presented independently, 
   which targets to help the operational/administrative process. 

2. Overall Requirements for Renumbering 

   This section envisions the effort potentially be achieved in the 
   future. 

   o Prefix delegation and delivery should be automatic and accurate in 
      aggregation and coordination. 

   o Address reconfiguration should be automatically achieved through 
      standard protocols with minimum human intervene. 

   o Address relevant entries update should be processed integrally and 
      error-prevented. [open question]Is it necessary to develop 
      automatic entries update mechanisms? If necessary, do we need 
      standard protocols/interface for it? 

   o [open question]Is it necessary/possible to develop a "One-Click" 
      fully automatic renumbering technology? What scenarios have the 
      potential possibility?

   o [open question]Is session survivability within our scope? 

3. Existing Components for IPv6 Renumbering 

   Existing technical components for IPv6 renumbering are categorized 
   into three types described as the following. 

3.1. Relevant Protocols and Mechanisms 

   Basically, renumbering is archived by utilizing existing protocols 
   rather than dedicated renumbering protocols.  

   o RA messages defined in [RFC4861], are used to deprecate/announce 
      old/new prefixes in renumbering. 

   o When a host is renumbered, it may use SLAAC [RFC4862] for address 
      configuration with the new prefix. 

   o Hosts configured through DHCPv6 [RFC3315] can reconfigure 
      addresses by initialing RENEW sessions when the current addresses' 
      lease time is expired or receiving the reconfiguration messages 
      initialed by the DHCPv6 servers. 

   o DHCP-PD (Prefix Delegation) [RFC3633] enables automated delegation 
      of IPv6 prefixes using the DHCPv6.  

   o [RFC2894] defined standard ICMPv6 messages for router renumbering. 
      This is a dedicated protocol for renumbering but has not been 
      widely used.  

3.2. Management Tools 

   Some operations of renumbering could be automatically processed by 
   management tools to make the renumbering process more efficient and 
   accurate. The tools may be designed dedicated for renumbering or just 
   common tools could be utilized for some operations in renumbering. 

   Following are samples of the tools. 

   o [LEROY] proposed a mechanism of macros to automatically update the 
      address relevant entries/configurations inside the DNS, firewall, 
      etc. The macros can be delivered though SOAP protocol by a network 
      management server.

Internet-Draft   IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis          July 2011 
    

   o Asset management tools/systems. Some of this kind of tools may 
      provide the ability of managing configuration files in nodes so 
      that it is convenient to update the address relevant configuration 
      in these nodes. 

   o Other tools haven't been documented or aware of. (need further 
      contribution) 

3.3. Procedures/Policies 

   o [RFC4192] proposed a procedure for renumbering a IPv6 network 
      without a flag day. The document includes a set of operational 
      suggestions which can be followed step by step by network 
      administrators.  

   o [I-D.jiang-6renum-enterprise] analyzes the enterprise renumbering 
      events and gives the recommendations among the existing 
      renumbering mechanisms. According to the different stages, 
      renumbering considerations are described in three categories: 
      considerations during network design, considerations for 
      preparation of enterprise network renumbering, and considerations 
      during renumbering operation. Recommended solutions or strategies 
      are also described. 

4. Managing Prefixes 

   When renumbering an enterprise site, a short prefix may be divided 
   into longer prefixes for subnets. So we need to carefully manage the 
   prefixes for prefix delivery, delegation, aggregation, 
   synchronization, coordination, etc. 

4.1. Prefix delegation 

   Usually, the short prefix comes down from the operator and received 
   by DHCP server or router inside the enterprise network. The short 
   prefix could be automatically delegated through DHCP-PD. Then the 
   DHCP server or router can begin advertising the longer prefixes to 
   the subnets. 

   Besides DHCP-PD, HPD (Hierarchical Prefix Delegation for IPv6), which 
   uses bespoke ICMPv6 messages for prefix delegation, could also be 
   used for prefix delegation.

Internet-Draft   IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis          July 2011 
    

4.2. Prefix assignment 

   When subnet routers receive the longer prefixes, they can directly 
   assign them to the hosts. Then the issues fall into the host address 
   configuration, which is described in the following section 5.1. 

5. Address Configuration 

5.1. Host Address Configuration 

   Both of the DHCPv6 and ND protocols have IP address configuration 
   function. They are suitable for different scenarios respectively. 
   During renumbering, the SLAAC-configured hosts can reconfigure IP 
   addresses by receiving ND Router Advertisement (RA) messages 
   containing new prefix information (It should be noted that, the 
   prefix delivery could be achieved through DHCP according to the new 
   IETF DHC WG document [I.D ietf-dhc-host-gen-id]). The DHCPv6-
   configured hosts can reconfigure addresses by initialing RENEW 
   sessions when the current addresses' lease time is expired or 
   receiving the reconfiguration messages initialed by the DHCPv6 
   servers. 

   o Gaps of SLAAC and DHCP address configuration co-existence 

   While an IPv6 site is being renumbered, both DHCPv6 and ND may be 
   used to reconfigure the host addresses. This may cause potential 
   address configuration conflicts during renumbering procedure. The 
   issue mainly includes two situations:  

        -  A DHCPv6-configured host receives RA messages containing new 
          prefix(es) 

        There are no standards specifying what approach should be taken 
        by a DHCPv6-configured host when it receives RA messages 
        containing new prefix. It depends on the operation system of the 
        host and cannot be predicted or controlled by the network. If 
        the host accepts the new prefix in RA, it may violet the DHCPv6-
        managed policies. But if it ignores the RA messages and there 
        are no DHCPv6 reconfiguration messages received either, the 
        renumbering would fail. What is worse, the host may even receive 
        both the RA messages and DHCP-v6 reconfiguration messages and 
        finds the prefixes in the two protocols are different. This 
        means serious network configuration error occurring. 

        [open question]It is hard for the host to identify the RA 
        messages containing new prefix(es) representing adding an uplink

Internet-Draft   IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis          July 2011 
    

        or conflict caused by network configuration mistake. This may be 
        a gap in protocol. 

        -  A SLAAC-configured finds DHCPv6 is in use 

        [RFC5887] and [I-D.jiang-6renum-enterprise] mentioned RA message 
        of ND protocol contains a "Managed Configuration" flag to 
        indicate DHCPv6 is in use. But it is unspecified what behavior 
        should be taken when the host receives RA messages with "M" set 
        to 1. The gap of standard will cause ambiguous host behavior 
        because it depends on the operation system of the host.  

        The host may start a DHCPv6 session and receives the DHCPv6 
        address configuration. It is also possible that the host finds 
        the DHCPv6 assigned prefix is different from the prefix in the 
        RA messages, which means there is a serious network 
        configuration error.  

        Another possibility is that the host may receive no response 
        from any DHCPv6 servers, which means the DHCPv6 service is not 
        available and the "Managed Configuration" flag was mis-
        configured.  

   o  Gaps of dynamic upsteam learning 

        -  DHCP-configured host may want to learn about the upstream 
          availability of new prefixes or loss of prior prefixes 
          dynamically by deducing from periodic RA messages. This falls 
          into the host behavior issue, which may be determined by the 
          operating system of the host. 

5.2. Router Address Configuration 

   o Learning new prefixes 

        As described in [RFC5887], "if a site wanted to be multihomed 
        using multiple provider- aggregated (PA) routing prefixes with 
        one prefix per upstream provider, then the interior routers 
        would need a mechanism to learn which upstream providers and 
        prefixes were currently reachable (and valid).  In this case, 
        their Router Advertisement messages could be updated dynamically 
        to only advertise currently valid routing prefixes to hosts.  
        This would be significantly more complicated if the various 
        provider prefixes were of different lengths or if the site had 
        non-uniform subnet prefix lengths." 

   o Restart after renumbering

Internet-Draft   IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis          July 2011 
    

        "Some routers cache IP addresses in some situations. So routers 
        might need to be restarted as a result of site renumbering" 
        [RFC2072].  
        After investigation, it seems (need further confirmation) this 
        caused by individual implementation and only happen on the old 
        type of routers. Therefore, it is not an issue anymore. 

5.3. Static Address Configuration 

   Further gap analysis about static address issue could consider the 
   following suggestions (proposed by George Wesley in the mail list). 

   o Documenting how to limit the places where static addresses must be 
      used (vs FQDN or autoconf). 

   o Identifying gaps and proposing solutions in other areas to reduce 
      the number of places that static addresses are required. 

   o Documenting any gaps in [RFC4192] to make renumbering easier for a 
      statically-numbered set of hosts and potentially identifying a 
      problem statement for improving renumbering for static. 

   [open question]Besides the open questions above, the ULA utilization 
   issue may also need consideration. 

6. Address Relevant Entries Update 

   When nodes in a site have been renumbered, then all the entries in 
   the site which contain the nodes' address must be updated. The 
   entries mainly include DNS records and filters in various entities 
   such as ACLs in firewalls/gateways.  

6.1. DNS Records Update 

   o DNS update synchronization 

   For DNS records update, most sites will achieve it by maintaining a 
   DNS zone file and loading this file into the site's DNS server(s).  
   Synchronization between host renumbering and the updating of its A or 
   AAAA record is hard. [RFC5887] mentioned that an alternative is to 
   use Secure Dynamic DNS Update [RFC3007], in which a host informs its 
   own DNS server when it receives a new address. But Secure Dynamic DNS 
   Update hasn't been widely deployed.  

   [open question]To popularize the [RFC3007] or to develop a 
   lightweight dedicated protocol for this need to be considered.

Internet-Draft   IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis          July 2011 
    

   DNS entries commonly have matching Reverse DNS entries which will 
   also need to be updated during renumbering.  

   [open question]So synchronizing the procedures of forward and reverse 
   DNS or even combining forward and reverse DNS updates in a single 
   procedure also need to be considered. 

   o DNS data structure optimization 

   [RFC2874] proposed a new A6 record type for DNS recording IPv6 
   address/prefix. And several extensions on query and processing were 
   also proposed. With the A6 record and the extensions, the DNS entries 
   update for renumbering could be easier than the original DNS 
   specification. But the [RFC2874] has not been widely used. 

   [open question]Is the DNS data structure optimization as [RFC2874] 
   necessary for easing renumbering? If necessary, the optimization in 
   [RFC2874] enough? 

   o DNS authority 

   As described in [I-D.chown-v6ops-renumber-thinkabout], "it is often 
   the case in enterprises that host web servers and application servers 
   on behalf of collaborators and customers that DNS zones out of the 
   administrative control of the host maintain resource records 
   concerning addresses for nodes out of their control. When the service 
   host renumbers, they do not have sufficient authority to change the 
   records." 

   [open question]Whether it is only an operational issue or we need 
   additional protocol/mechanism to standardize the interaction between 
   operator and enterprise inside DNS system needs to be considered.  

6.2. Filters 

   There might be filters based on addresses/prefixes spread in various 
   devices; as [RFC5887] described, some address configuration data 
   might be widely dispersed and much harder to find, even will 
   inevitably be found only after the renumbering event. So there's a 
   big gap for filter/configuration management for renumbering. 

7. Renumbering Event Management 

   From the perspective of network management, renumbering is a kind of 
   event which may need additional process to make the process more easy 
   and manageable. Following are several examples of such additional 
   process may ease the renumbering. Further contributions are expected.

Internet-Draft   IPv6 Site Renumbering Gap Analysis          July 2011 
    

   o DHCPv6 should be extended to indicate hosts the associated DNS 
      lifetimes when making DNS configuration. 

   o New interaction may need to be defined to achieve the cooperation 
      among branch sites/sub-networks to be renumbered together with 
      multiple prefixes. 

   o A notification mechanism may be needed to indicate the hosts that 
      a renumbering event of local recursive DNS happen or is going to 
      take place recursive. 

8. Miscellaneous 

8.1. Multicast 

   o The embedding of IPv6 unicast addresses into multicast addresses 
      and the embedded-RP (Rendezvous Point) will cause issues when 
      renumbering. 

   o Changing the unicast source address of a multicast sender might 
      also be an issue for receivers. 

8.2. Mobility 

   o [RFC5887] suggested that, for Mobile IP, define a better mechanism 
      to handle change of home agent address while mobile is 
      disconnected. 

9. Gap Summary 

9.1. Managing Prefixes 

   None. (Would be added if gaps could be found.)

   o Filters 

        Filter and address configuration data management 

9.4. Renumbering event management 

   o  Additional management process to ease renumbering 

10. Security Considerations 

   o Prefix Validation 

   Prefixes from the ISP may need authentication to prevent prefix  
   fraud. Announcing changes of site prefix to other sites (for example, 
   those that configure routers or VPNs to point to the site in  
   question) also need validation. 

   In the LAN, Secure DHCPv6 ([I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6]) or SeND 
   ([RFC3971], Secure Neighbor Discovery) deployment may need to 
   validate prefixes.                         

   o Influence to Security Controls 

   During renumbering, security controls (e.g. ACLs) blocking access to 
   legitimate resources should not be interrupted. 

11. IANA Considerations 

   None.
