   ESSCertIDv2 defined in RFC 5035 [ESSv2] to specify the hash of a
   signer certificate when the hash is calculated with a function other
   than SHA-1 [SHA1].

INTERNET DRAFT        RFC 3161 ESSCertIDV2 Update      September 8, 2009


1  Introduction

   The time stamping protocol defined in RFC 3161 [RFC3161] requires
   that the CMS SignedData [RFC3852], used to apply a digital signature
   on the time-stamp token, include a signed attribute that identifies
   the signer's certificate.

   This identifier only allows SHA-1 to be used as hash algorithm to
   generate the identifier value.

   The mechanism used in [RFC3161] employed ESSCertID from RFC 2634
   [ESS]. RFC 5035 [ESSv2] updated ESSCertID with ESSCertIDv2 to allow
   the use of any hash algorithm.

   The changes to RFC 3161 [RFC3161] defined in this document allows
   ESSCertIDv2 to be used to include an identifier of the signing
   certificate as defined in RFC 5035 [ESSv2].


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Updates to RFC 3161 

2.1  Changes to section 2.4.1 Request Format

   Last paragraph on page 5.

   Old:

      If the certReq field is present and set to true, the TSA's public
      key certificate that is referenced by the ESSCertID identifier
      inside a SigningCertificate attribute in the response MUST be
      provided by the TSA in the certificates field from the SignedData
      structure in that response. That field may also contain other
      certificates.

   New:

      If the certReq field is present and set to true, the TSA's public
      key certificate that is referenced by the ESSCertID [ESS] field
      inside a SigningCertificate attribute or by the ESSCertIDv2
      [ESSv2] field inside a SigningCertificateV2 attribute in the
      response MUST be provided by the TSA in the certificates field
      from the SignedData structure in that response.  That field may
      also contain other certificates.

2.2  Changes to Section 2.4.2 Response Format

2.2.1  signature of time stamp token

   5th paragraph on page 8, just before the definition of TSTInfo.

   Old:

      The time-stamp token MUST NOT contain any signatures other than
      the signature of the TSA. The certificate identifier (ESSCertID)
      of the TSA certificate MUST be included as a signerInfo attribute
      inside a SigningCertificate attribute.

   New:

      The time-stamp token MUST NOT contain any signatures other than
      the signature of the TSA. The certificate identifier (either
      ESSCertID [ESS] or ESSCertIDv2 [ESSv2]) of the TSA certificate
      MUST be included as a signerInfo attribute inside a
      SigningCertificate attribute.

      Note: As mentioned in RFC 5035 [ESSV2], the SigningCertificateV2
            attribute MUST be used if any algorithm other than SHA-1 is
            used and SHOULD NOT be used for SHA-1.

      Note: For backwards compatibility, in line with RFC 5035, both
            ESSCertID and ESSCertIDv2 MAY be present. Systems MAY ignore
            ESSCertIDV2 if RFC 5035 has not been implemented.

2.2.2  verifying the time stamp token

   3rd paragraph on page 11.

   Old:

      The purpose of the tsa field is to give a hint in identifying the
      name of the TSA.  If present, it MUST correspond to one of the
      subject names included in the certificate that is to be used to
      verify the token.  However, the actual identification of the
      entity that signed the response will always occur through the use
      of the certificate identifier (ESSCertID Attribute) inside a
      SigningCertificate attribute which is part of the signerInfo (See
      Section 5 of [ESS]).

3  Security Considerations

   This draft incorporates the security considerations of RFC 5035
   [ESSv2].

   Provided that the PKI used to validate the TSA certificate is not
   broken or compromised, the identifier used to identify the signer
   certificate is only used to distinguish between valid non revoked TSA
   certificates. The chance of colliding identifiers is negligible even
   if a poor hash algorithm is used.

   The update provided by this draft is thus motivated by reasons of
   interoperability and migration to other hash algorithms rather than
   security.


4  IANA Considerations

   This draft requires no actions by IANA.
