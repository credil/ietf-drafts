               RTCP Extension for Third-party Loss Report
             draft-ietf-avtcore-feedback-supression-rtp-09

Abstract

   In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
   RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some
   event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once.
   This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports
   are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending
   duplicate feedback reports.  However, there are cases where it is not
   recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback
   implosion.  This memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP
   third-party loss report that can be used to inform receivers that the
   feedback target is aware of some loss event, allowing them to
   suppress feedback.  Associated SDP signalling is also defined.

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report           November 2011


1.  Introduction

   RTCP feedback messages [RFC4585] allow the receivers in an RTP
   session to report events and ask for action from the media source (or
   a delegated feedback target when using unicast RTCP feedback with SSM
   [RFC5760]).  There are cases where multiple receivers may initiate
   the same, or an equivalent message towards the same media source.
   When the receiver count is large, this behavior may cause transient
   overload of the media source, the network or both.  This is known as
   a "feedback storm" or a "NACK storm".  One common cause of such a
   feedback storm is receivers utilizing RTP retransmission [RFC4588] as
   a packet loss recovery technique, sending feedback using RTCP NACK
   messages [RFC4585] without proper dithering of the retransmission
   requests (e.g., not implementing the RFC 4585 dithering rules or
   sending NACKs to a middlebox that doesn't redistribute them to other
   receivers).

   Another use case involves video Fast Update requests.  A storm of
   these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia
   scenarios like multipoint video switching conference [RFC4587].  In
   this scenario, the receiver may lose synchronization with the video
   stream when speaker is changed in the middle of session.  Poorly
   designed receivers that blindly issue fast update requests (i.e.,
   Full Intra Request (FIR) described in [RFC5104]), can cause an
   implosion of FIR requests from receivers to the same media source.

   RTCP feedback storms may cause short term overload, and in extreme
   cases to pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the
   control channel (e.g.  RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both.  It
   is therefore desirable to provide a way of suppressing unneeded
   feedback.

   One approach to this, suggested in [DVB-IPTV], involves sending a
   NACK message to the other clients (or receiver) in the same group as
   the sender of NACK.  However NACK is defined as a receiver report
   sent from a receiver observing a packet loss, therefore it only
   inform others that sender of NACK detected loss while the case where
   the sender of the feedback has received reports that the indicated
   packets were lost is not covered.  This document specifies a new
   third-party loss report for this function.  It supplements the
   existing the use of RTCP NACK packet and further is more precise in
   the uses where the network is active to suppress feedback.  It tells
   receivers explicitly that feedback for a particular packet or frame
   loss is not needed for a period of time and can provide an early
   indication before the receiver reacts to the loss and invokes its
   packet loss repair machinery.  Section 6 provides some examples of
   when to send the Third Party Loss Report message.

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Overview

   This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the
   Audio-Visual Profile with feedback (RTP/AVPF) [RFC4585] defining a
   Third Party Loss Report message.  The Third Party Loss Report message
   can be used by the intermediaries to inform the receiver that the
   sender of the Third Party Loss Report has received reports that the
   indicated packets were lost, and asks the receiver not to send
   feedback to it regarding these packets.

   RTCP Third Party Loss Report follows the similar format of message
   type as RTCP NACK or Full Intra Request Command.  However, the Third
   Party Loss Report is defined as an indication that the sender of the
   feedback has received reports that the indicated packets were lost,
   while NACK [RFC4585] just indicates that the sender of the NACK
   observed that these packets were lost.  The Third Party Loss Report
   (TPLR) message is generated by a RTP system that may not seen the
   actual packet loss.  It is sent following the same timing rule as
   sending NACK defined in [RFC4585].  The TPLR feedback message may be
   sent in a regular full compound RTCP packet or in an early RTCP
   packet, as per the RTP/AVPF rules.  RTP Systems in the network that
   receive a Third Party Loss Report SHOULD NOT send their own
   additional Third Party Loss Report messages for the same packet
   sequence numbers.  They should simply forward the Third Party Loss
   Report message received from upstream direction, additionally, they
   may generate their own Third Party Loss Report that reports a set of
   the losses they see, which are different from ones reported in the
   Third Party Loss report they received.  The Third Party Loss Report
   does not have the retransmission request [RFC4588] semantics.

   When a receiver gets a Third Party Loss Report message, it should
   follow the rules for NACK suppression in RFC 4585 and refrain from
   sending a feedback request (e.g., NACK or FIR) for the missing
   packets reported in the message,which is dealt with in the same way
   as receiving NACK.

   To increase the robustness to the loss of a TPLR or of a transmission
   RTP data packet, TPLR or the RTP packet for the same missing Packet
   may be retransmitted when RTP systems are aware that the same packet
   loss occurs again.  If the additional TPLR arrives at receiver, the
   receiver should deal with the additional TPLR in the same way as

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report           November 2011


   receiving the first TPLR for the same packet and no additional
   behavior for receiver is required.  When the retransmitted packet is
   received by the receiver,it should take its normal behavior as if
   there is no current feedback suppression.

   A receiver may still have sent a Feedback message according to the
   RTP/AVPF scheduling algorithm of [RFC4585] before receiving a Third
   Party Loss Report message, but further feedback messages for those
   sequence numbers SHOULD be suppressed for a period of time after
   receiving the TPLR.  Nodes that do not understand the Third Party
   Loss Report message will ignore it, and might therefore still send
   feedback according to the AVPF scheduling algorithm of [RFC4585].
   The media source or intermediate nodes cannot be certain that the use
   of a Third Party Loss Report message actually reduces the amount of
   feedback it receives.

   Since Third Party Loss Report interacts strongly with repair timing,
   it has to work together with feedback to not adversely impact the
   repair of lost source packets.  In order not to incur a lot of NACK
   requests due to additional TPLR described above, it is recommended
   that the RTP system sending TPLR should be implemented more closer to
   the media source.  When the loss was detected and repair initiated
   much closer to the media source, the delay for the receiver to
   recover from packet loss can be reduced through the combination of
   intermediary feedback to the source and Third Party Loss Report
   downstream.


4.  Format of RTCP Feedback Messages

   This document registers two new RTCP Feedback messages for Third
   Party Loss Report.  Applications that are employing one or more loss-
   repair methods MAY use the Third Party Loss Report together with
   their existing loss-repair methods either for every packet they
   expect to receive, or for an application-specific subset of the RTP
   packets in a session.  In other words, receivers MAY ignore Third
   Party Loss Report messages, but SHOULD react to them unless they have
   good reason to still send feedback messages despite having been
   requested to suppress them.

4.1.  Transport Layer Feedback:  Third-party Loss Report

   This Third Party Loss Report message is an extension to the RTCP
   Transport Layer Feedback Report and identified by RTCP packet type
   value PT=RTPFB and FMT=TBD.

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of [RFC4585]), the "SSRC of packet sender" field

   indicates the source of the request, and the "SSRC of media source"
   denotes the media sender of the flow for which the indicated losses
   are being suppressed .

   The FCI field MUST contain one or more entries of transport layer
   third party loss Early Indication (TLLEI).  Each entry applies to the
   same media source identified by the SSRC contained in the SSRC of
   media source field of Feedback header.  The length of the TLLEI
   feedback message MUST be set to 2+1*N, where N is the number of FCI
   entries.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) for TLLEI uses the similar
   format of message Types defined in the section 6.2.1 of [RFC4585].
   The format is shown in Figure 1.

      The PID field is used to specify a lost packet.  The PID field
      refers to the RTP sequence number of the lost packet.

   bitmask of proceeding lost packets (BLP): 16 bits

      The BLP allows for reporting losses of any of the 16 RTP packets
      immediately following the RTP packet indicated by the PID.  The
      BLP's definition is identical to that given in [RFC4585].


4.2.  Payload Specific Feedback: Third-party Loss Report

   This message is an extension to the RTCP Payload Specific Feedback
   report and identified by RTCP packet type value PT=PSFB and FMT=TBD,
   which is used to suppress FIR [RFC5104]or PLI [RFC4585].

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of [RFC4585]), the "SSRC of packet sender" field
   indicates the source of the request, and the "SSRC of media source"
   is not used and SHALL be set to 0.  The SSRCs of the media senders to
   which this message applies are in the corresponding FCI entries.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) for a Payload Specific Third

5.  SDP Signaling

   A new feedback value "tplr" needs to be defined for the Third Party
   Loss Report message to be used with Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC4585].

   The "tplr" feedback value SHOULD be used with parameters that
   indicate the third party loss supported.  In this document, we define
   two such parameter, namely:

   o  "tllei" denotes support of transport layer third party loss early
      indication.

   o  "pslei" denotes support of payload specific third party loss early
      indication.

   In the ABNF [RFC5234] for rtcp-fb-val defined in [RFC4585], there is
   a placeholder called rtcp-fb-id to define new feedback types. "tplr"
   is defined as a new feedback type in this document, and the ABNF for
   the parameters for tplr is defined here (please refer to section 4.2
   of [RFC4585] for complete ABNF syntax).

   full syntax of the "rtcp-fb" attribute.


6.  Example Use Cases

   The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
   sessions and topologies [RFC5117], however the exact messages used
   and the scenarios in which suppression is employed differ for various
   use cases.  The following sections outline some of the intended use
   cases for using the Third Party Loss Report for feedback suppression
   and give an overview of the particular mechanisms.

6.1.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case

   In SSM RTP sessions as described in [RFC5760], one or more Media
   Sources send RTP packets to a Distribution Source.  The Distribution
   Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using a source-
   specific multicast group.

   As outlined in the [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback models
   that may be used for reporting, the Simple Feedback model and the
   Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model.  In the simple Feedback
   Model, there's no need for distribution source to create the Third
   Party Loss Report, instead, NACKs are reflected by the distribution
   source to the other Receivers.  However in the Distribution Source
   Feedback Summary model, the distribution source will not redistribute
   the NACK for some reason(e.g., to prevent revealing the identity or
   existence of a system sending NACK)and may send a Third Party Loss
   Report to the systems that were unable to receive the NACK, and won't
   receive the NACK via other means. since the summary feedback does not
   mandate the forwarding of NACK downstream.  The Third Party Loss
   Report can be generated at the distribution source when downstream
   loss is told (e.g., downstream loss report is received), which
   indicates to the receivers that they should not transmit feedback
   messages for the same loss event for a certain time.  Therefore the

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report           November 2011


   distribution source in the feedback summary model can be reasonably
   certain that it will help the situation by sending this Third Party
   Loss Report message to all the relevant receivers impacted by the
   packet loss.

6.2.  Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use
      case

   The typical RAMS architecture [RFC6285] may have several Burst/
   Retransmission Sources(BRS) behind the multicast source (MS) placed
   at the same level.  These BRSes will receive the primary multicast
   RTP stream from the media source and cache most recent packets after
   joining multicast session.  If packet loss happens at the upstream of
   all the BRSs or the downstream of BRSes.  One of the BRSes or all the
   BRSes may send a NACK or TPLR message to the DS, where the SSRC in
   this NACK or TPLR message is the BRS that is sending the message.
   The DS forwards/reflects this message down on the primary SSM.  The
   details on how DS deal with this message is specified in
   [RETRANSMISSION-FOR-SSM].

6.3.  RTP Transport Translator use case

   A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in [RFC5117]
   is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP traffic between RTP clients,
   for example converting from multicast to unicast for domains that do
   not support multicast.  The translator may suffer a loss of important
   video packets.  In this case, the translator may forward TPLR message
   received from upstream in the same way as forwarding other RTCP
   traffic.  If the translator acting as quality monitor [Monarch]is
   aware of packet loss, it may use the SSRC of monitor as packet sender
   SSRC to create NACK message and send it to the receivers that is not
   aware of packet loss.

6.4.  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case

   When the speaker is changed in a voice-activated multipoint video
   switching conference [RFC4587], an RTP mixer can be used to select
   the available input streams and forward them to each participants.
   If the MCU is doing a blind switch without waiting for a
   synchronization point on the new stream it can send a FIR to the new
   video source.  In this case the MCU should send a FIR suppression
   message to the new receivers. e.g.,when the RTP Mixer starts to
   receive FIR from some participants it can suppress the remaining
   session participants from sending FIR by sending out a Third party
   Loss report message.

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report           November 2011


6.5.  Mixer use case

   A Mixer, in accordance with [RFC5117], aggregates multiple RTP
   streams from other session participants and generates a new RTP
   stream sent to the session participants.  In some cases, the video
   frames may get badly screwed up between media source and the mixer.
   In such case, the mixer need to check if the packet loss will result
   in PLI or FIR transmissions from most of the group by analyzing the
   received video.  If so the mixer may initiate FIR or PLI towards the
   media source on behalf of all the session participants and send out a
   Third party Loss report message to these session participants that
   may or are expected to send a PLI or FIR.  Alternatively, when the
   mixer starts to receive FIR or PLI from some participants and like to
   suppress the remaining session participants from sending FIR or PLI
   by forwarding the FIR/PLI from one session participant to others.


7.  Security Considerations

   The defined messages have certain properties that have security
   implications.  These must be addressed and taken into account by
   users of this protocol.

   Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
   in this specification can have the following implications:

   Sending the spurious Third Party Loss Report (e.g., the Third Party
   Loss Report with the wrong sequence number of lost packet) that
   causes missing RTP packets to not be repaired in a timely fashion.

   To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
   integrity protection of the feedback messages.  This can be
   accomplished against threats external to the current RTP session
   using the RTP profile that combines Secure RTP [RFC3711] and AVPF
   into SAVPF [RFC5124].

   Note that middleboxes that are not visible at the RTP layer that wish
   to send the Third Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media source
   can only do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source.  This is
   difficult in case SRTP is in use.  If the middlebox is visible at the
   RTP layer, this is not an issue, provided the middlebox is part of
   the security context for the session.

   Also note that endpoints that receive a Third Party Loss Report would
   be well-advised to ignore it, unless the security is in place to
   authenticate the sender of the Third Party Loss Report.  Accepting
   Third Party Loss Report from un-authenticated sender can lead to a
   denial of service attack, where the endpoint accepts poor quality
