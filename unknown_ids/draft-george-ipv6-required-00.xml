    <abstract>
      <t>Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in
      IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document deprecates the
      concept that an IP-capable node MAY support IPv4 _only_, and redefines
      an IP-capable node as one which supports either IPv6 _only_ or IPv4/IPv6
      dual-stack. This document updates RFC1812 and 1122 to reflect the change
      in requirements.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IP version 4 (IPv4) has served to connect public and private hosts
      all over the world for over 30 years. However, due to the success of the
      Internet in finding new and innovative uses for IP networking, billions
      of hosts are now connected via the Internet and requiring unique
      addressing. This demand has led to the exhaustion of the <xref
      target="IANA-exhaust">IANA</xref> global pool of unique IPv4 addresses.
      While transition technologies and other means to extend the lifespan of
      IPv4 do exist, nearly all of them come with tradeoffs that prevent them
      from being optimal long-term solutions when compared with deployment of
      IP version 6 (IPv6) as a means to allow continued growth on the
      Internet. See <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues">I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues</xref>and
      <xref
      target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts">I-D.donley-nat444-impacts</xref> for
      some discussion on this topic. [add'l informative citations needed]</t>

      <t>IPv6 was proposed in 1995 [<xref target="RFC1883">RFC 1883</xref>]
      as, among other things, a solution to the limitations on globally unique
      addressing that IPv4's 32-bit addressing space represented, and has been
      under continuous refinement and deployment ever since. [<xref
      target="RFC2460">RFC 2460</xref>]. The exhaustion of IPv4 and the
      continued growth of the internet worldwide has created the driver for
      widespread IPv6 deployment.</t>

      <t>However, the IPv6 deployment necessary to reduce reliance on IPv4 has
      been hampered by a lack of ubiquitous hardware and software support
      throughout the industry. Many of those who are deploying IPv6 have been
      forced to fund the initial IPv6 implementations for their vendors,
      because the vendor continued to view IPv6 support as optional. This
      added burden on the early adopters, plus the high cost of replacing
      installed-base that does not currently support IPv6 has been a
      significant barrier to wider deployment of IPv6. Even today, many
      vendors, especially in the consumer space are still selling "IP capable"
      devices which are not IPv6-capable, and are choosing not to update
      existing software to enable IPv6 support on software-updatable devices.
      It is not realistic to expect that the hardware refresh cycle will
      single-handedly purge IPv4-only devices from the active network in a
      reasonable amount of time, especially in the consumer space, where the
      operator often has no control over the hardware the consumer chooses to
      use.</t>

      <t>This lack of support is making the eventual IPv6 transition
      considerably more difficult, and drives the need for expensive and
      complicated transition technologies to extend the life of IPv4-only
      devices as well as eventually to interwork IPv4-only and IPv6-only
      hosts. While IPv4 is expected to coexist on the Internet with IPv6 for
      many years, a transition from IPv4 as the dominant Internet Protocol
      towards IPv6 as the dominant Internet Protocol will need to occur. The
      sooner the majority of devices support IPv6, the less protracted this
      transition period will be.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="simple_list" title="Requirements and Recommendation">
      <t>This draft updates <xref target="RFC1812">RFC 1812</xref> to note
      that IP nodes SHOULD no longer support IPv4 only. This is to ensure that
      those using it as a guideline for IP implementations use the other
      informative references in this document as a guideline for proper IPv6
      implementations. This draft also updates <xref target="RFC1122">RFC
      1122</xref> to redefine generic "IP" support to include and require IPv6
      for IP-capable nodes and routers.</t>

      <t>From a practical perspective, the requirements proposed by this draft
      mean that:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>New IP implementations MUST support IPv6, and current IP
          implementations SHOULD support IPv6.</t>

          <t>Helpful informative references can be found in <xref
          target="RFC4294">RFC 4294</xref>, and <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router">I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router</xref></t>

          <t>Current and new IP Networking implementations SHOULD support IPv4
          and IPv6 coexistence (dual-stack), but MUST NOT require IPv4 for
          proper and complete function.</t>

          <t>It is expected that many existing devices and implementations
          will not be able to support IPv6 for one or more valid technical
          reasons, but for maximum flexibility and compatibility, a best
          effort SHOULD be made to update existing hardware and software to
          enable IPv6 support.</t>
        </list>Within the IETF, further protocol development on applications
      _exclusive_ to IPv4 SHOULD cease in order to concentrate on additional
      refinements and enhancements to IP version 6, with the goal of bringing
      IPv6 to complete parity with IPv4. This does not mean that further work
      SHOULD NOT have support for IPv4, merely that it MUST happen as a part
      of an IP version-agnostic implementation, or as an implementation that
      explicitly supports both IPv4 and IPv6. New features and protocols
      SHOULD NOT be introduced for use as IPv4-only unless they are
      specifically in support of IPv6 transition or IPv4-IPv6 interworking. A
      comprehensive list of these parity items and enhancements is outside the
      scope of this document, but this document recommends that the charters
      and work items of currently active IETF Working Groups (WGs) be
      evaluated to ensure that they are supporting the goal of full parity for
      IPv6.</t>
