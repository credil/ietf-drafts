Internet-Draft              RP SA Management                October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The draft [I-D.wei-karp-analysis-rp-sa] has shown the diversity of SA
   of routing protocols, and then one problem arises -- how to manage
   these diverse SAs of routing protocols automatically?  An automated
   key management protocol (KMP) is desired to manage SAs of routing
   protocols.  When considering KMP design for routing protocols,
   automated SA management is the main function that KMP should provide
   for routing protocols.  In some sense and to some extent, KMP for
   routing protocols is automated SA management for routing protocols
   essentially.

   The following sections discuss automated SA management for routing
   protocols based on [I-D.wei-karp-analysis-rp-sa] , and also discuss
   the candidate solutions based on IKEv2 [RFC4306] [RFC4307] [RFC4718]
   [RFC5996] and ISAKMP [RFC2408], respectively.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   When used in lower case, these words convey their typical use in
   common language, and are not to be interpreted as described in
   RFC2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Automated SA Management for Routing Protocols

   An SA is a simplex "connection" that affords security services to the
   traffic carried by it [RFC4301].  In the routing protocol context, an
   SA of routing protocol is a set of cryptographic algorithms and other
   security parameters to be used to protect routing protocol message,
   i.e., to perform routing protocol message authentication and
   integrity protection (see [I-D.ietf-karp-framework] and
   [I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide]).  The document uses RP SA to represent
   routing protocol security association, i.e., security association for
   routing protocols, and uses RP SAs to represent its plural form.
   Since manual SA management is vulnerable to a variety of security
   issues as discussed in [I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs], automated SA
   management is the desired solution to be considered.

   To achieve automated SA management for routing protocols, the
   following items to be considered are identified and defined.

Internet-Draft              RP SA Management                October 2010


2.1.  RP SA Attributes/Parameters/Components/Contents

   In this document, the four words -- attribute, parameter, component
   and content, refer to the same meaning to RP SA, and among them,
   attribute is preferred in RFC 2408 [RFC2408].  The attributes of RP
   SA is different from that of IPsec [RFC4301], since RP SA is
   dedicated to routing protocols.  The draft
   [I-D.wei-karp-analysis-rp-sa] has identified the attributes of RP SA,
   i.e., Key ID, authentication algorithm, authentication key, life
   time, sequence number, etc.  In order to distinguish different RP
   SAs, routing protocol ID, message type ID of routing protocol, which
   is related to message transaction type, and etc., may also be taken
   into consideration.  Attention should be paid to the direction
   attribute of SA.  In IPsec, the SA is simplex, while in routing
   protocols, the direction attribute of SA is not defined, and it seems
   that the direction attribute of RP SA depends on how to use the
   traffic key by routing protocol message.  If the communicating peers
   use different traffic keys in both directions, RP SA is simplex; if
   the communicating peers use the same traffic key in both directions,
   RP SA is duplex; and vice versa.

2.2.  RP SA Format

   An agreed on RP SA format should be formed to achieve interoperation
   between/among communicating peers.  It is about how RP SA to be
   constructed, e.g., the header format and the payload format of RP SA.
   The RP SA format could support as much as possible, if not all, the
   RP SA attributes.

2.3.  Secure Channel

   RP SA is shared information between/among involving peers, and the
   attributes of RP SA that will be transferred should be protected via
   secure channel.  Secure channel is needed to be established before RP
   SA is involved in the communication between/among peers, for example,
   RP SA negotiation, RP SA distribution, etc.  Generally, the secure
   channel protection provides encryption and message authentication and
   anti-replay for RP SA.

2.4.  RP SA Negotiation

   In RFC 2408 [RFC2408], the need for negotiation was stated, and the
   main reason for SA negotiation is the diverse security requirements
   and security services of different networks.  To achieve common
   supported security functionality for interoperation and cooperation
   between/among communicating peers for routing protocols, RP SA
   negotiation is desired in automated SA management for routing
   protocols.  In other words, the diverse configurations and security



Liang, et al.            Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              RP SA Management                October 2010


   functionalities of routers and their deployed routing protocols are
   the main reason that makes RP SA negotiation desirable, and
   automation requirement of SA management makes RP SA negotiation
   necessary.  The RP SA negotiation procedures and payloads that will
   be transferred should be identified and defined in automated SA
   management for routing protocols.  What attributes of RP SA will be
   negotiated is dependent on specific routing protocol and its message
   transaction type, etc.

2.5.  RP SA Creation/Generation

   Creation and generation of RP SA have the same meaning in this
   document.  If the RP SA attributes and format are defined, and the
   negotiation of needed attributes of RP SA is finished successfully,
   then automated SA management takes the task of RP SA creation
   according to corresponding RP SA attributes, format, and specific
   routing protocol, etc., obtained via negotiaotion.  In this creation
   process, one or more databases may be involved, e.g., cryptography
   algorithms database, cryptography functions database, and key
   databases, or one database composed of these three things.

2.6.  RP SA Distribution and Delivery

   This may involve two scenarios, that is, RP SA is distributed to
   other peers, and RP SA is delivered to routing protocol served by
   KMP.  The former scenario may be a group SA for routing protocol that
   is distributed to all the group member peers, and this kind of
   distribution should be under the protection of secure channel.  The
   later scenario may be that the RP SA is delivered to the
   corresponding routing protocol directly, or to a key store, which
   then will serve the corresponding routing protocol with the RP SA.

2.7.  RP SA Deletion, Update, and Rekeying

   Since RP SA is time relevant, and some routing protocol messages are
   updated periodically, RP SA deletion, update, and rekeying are very
   important.  The life time or life cycle attribute of RP SA is a key
   factor that effects RP SA deletion, update, and rekeying.  If life
   time is expired, then the RP SA can be deleted or updated or rekeyed.
   Deletion means to remove RP SA from corresponding store, update means
   to assign new values to attributes of RP SA, which may be by the
   means of negotiation, and rekeying means to create a new RP SA
   totally, which may involve using different cryptography algorithms,
   different key, etc.  Attention should be paid to adjacencies bouncing
   problem during RP SA deletion, update, and rekeying.  Roughly
   speaking though, update and rekeying indicate the same meaning, and
   both involve deletion of old RP SA.

3.  Candidate Solutions

   According to the design spirit of KMP for routing protocols
   [I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide], it is best to reuse existing
   technology/mechanisms to solve problems.  In this sense, IKEv2 and
   ISAKMP are good candidates for automated SA management for routing
   protocols, since they are existing and mature protocols for key
   management that is evolving along time, and they provide some
   flexible and extendable mechanism that can be exploited.  Taking into
   consideration the above items discussed in section 2, IKEv2 and
   ISAKMP can be extended to support automated SA management for routing
   protocols.  The details of extending IKEv2 is discussed in section
   3.1, and the details of extending ISAKMP is discussed in section 3.2.
   Both extensions are focusing on peer-to-peer communication at the
   time being, and the extension to support group RP SA will be
   discussed in later update version of the document.

3.1.  IKEv2 Extensions

   IKEv2 is dedicated to IPsec, specifically ESP [RFC4303] [RFC4305]
   [RFC4835] and/or AH [RFC2402] [RFC4302] [RFC4305] [RFC4835], to
   establish and maintain SAs for two communicating peers, and cannot be
   applied to routing protocols as automated SA management for routing
   protocols directly.  IKEv2 can be extended and made adaptive to
   routing protocols.  Specifically, IKEv2 can be extended to support
   attributes of RP SA, to provide unified format for RP SA, to
   establish secure channel for RP SA negotiation and distribution if
   applicable, to negotiate RP SA between/among communicating peers, to
   create RP SA, to distribute RP SA if applicable, and to update and
   rekey RP SA.

   Three ways of IKEv2 extension to support RP SA management are
   considered, that is, extending SA payload, adding new payload, and
   adding new exchange type.

3.1.1.  Extending SA Payload to Support PR SA Management

   The SA payload of IKEv2 has proposals substructure which has
   transforms substructure, which has Transform Attributes in turn to
   describe key length for encryption algorithm, etc., to support the SA
   for ESP and/or AH of IPsec.  The following changes to SA payload can
   be made to adapt for RP SA.

   o  Extend Protocol ID field of proposal substructure to include
      routing protocols, and take the ID values from those reserved to
      IANA, i.e., 4-200, e.g., assign OSPFv2 [RFC2328] the value 3.

Internet-Draft              RP SA Management                October 2010


   o  Match SPI field in proposal substructure to Key ID of RP SA, and
      extend SPI Size (in octet) field of proposal substructure to
      include routing protocols, e.g., assign OSPFv2 the value 1, since
      the length of Key ID is 8 bits.

   o  Extend Transform Type 3 in transform substructure to be also used
      in routing protocols, and extend Transform ID of Transform Type 3
      to include authentication algorithms used by routing protocols,
      and take the ID values from those reserved to IANA, i.e., 6-1023,
      e.g., assign AUTH_HMAC_SHA_256, which stands for HMAC-SHA-256
      [RFC5709] as authentication algorithm, the value 8.

   o  Extend Attribute Type in transform substructure to include key
      length and life time attributes for routing protocols.  As to the
      Attribute Type 14 Key Length (in bits), it is defined for
      encryption algorithm only, and can be extended to use in
      authentication algorithm in case of negotiation of key length of
      authentication algorithm.  As to the life time attributes, they
      can be defined as a new Attribute Type and assigned the Attribute
      Type values from those reserved to IANA, i.e., 18-16383, e.g.,
      Start Time can be defined as one new Attribute Type, and its
      Attribute Type Value can be assigned 18.

   The above extensions together can support attributes and format of RP
   SA.  The extended SA can be denoted as SAe, where !oe!+/- means
   extension.

   The procedures to establish secure channel and negotiate RP SA can be
   as follows:

                Initiator                         Responder
           --------------------------------------------------------
                HDR, SAi, KEi, Ni -->

                                  <--  HDR, SAr, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ]

   The above IKE_SA_INIT exchange results in IKE_SA, which will be used
   to encrypt and authenticate the subsequent exchange content in brace
   following SK, hence, the secure channel is established.

              Initiator                                 Responder
          -----------------------------------------------------------
              HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,] [IDr,]
                         AUTH, SAe, TSi, TSr}   -->

                                     <--  HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                                SAe, TSi, TSr}

Internet-Draft              RP SA Management                October 2010


   In the above IKE_AUTH exchange, Initiator offers a list of proposals
   in the extended payload SAe, and the Responder chooses one, put it in
   the SAe, and send to the Initiator.  Then Initiator hands the SA to
   routing protocol being served.  Hence the RP SA negotiation is
   finished.

   As to the Authentication Key in RP SA, it can be calculated by
   Pseudo-random Function (PRF) with the inputs of Nonce from both peers
   and from KE (Key Exchange) payload that will be used in Diffie-
   Hellman exchange.

3.1.2.  Adding New Payload to Support RP SA Management

   Alternatively, a new payload to support attributes and format of RP
   SA can be created in IKEv2, for example, it may be named SARP, which
   stands for security association of routing protocol , and take the
   Next Payload Type value, say 49, from the reserved to IANA value 49-
   127.  The Next Payload Type of the original SA payload in IKEv2 is
   33.

   The structure of SARP can be similar to that of SA, with the
   following differences:

   o  Add Length of Life Time field and the Life Time field in the
      Proposal Substructure.

   o  Replace SPI Size field with Length of Key ID field, and Key ID
      field substitutes the SPI field.

   o  Define Transform Type to include Pseudo-random Function (PRF),
      Integrity Algorithm (INTEG), and Sequence Numbers (SN), etc.,
      which are used by routing protocols.

   o  Define Transform ID for PRF that will be used by routing
      protocols.

   o  Define Transform ID for INTEG that will be used by routing
      protocols.

   o  Define Key Length of PRF or/and INTEG that will be used by routing
      protocols in case the length of key can be negotiated.

   As to the Authentication Key in RP SA, it can be calculated by PRF
   with the inputs from Nonce payload and KE payload of both peers.

   The procedures to negotiate RP SA using the above new payload SARP
   are the same as that of extending SA payload above, with SAe payload
   substituted by SARP payload.

Internet-Draft              RP SA Management                October 2010


   The benefit gained by adding new payload to support RP SA management
   is a bit fast processing for automated SA management.

3.1.3.  Adding New Exchange Type to Support RP SA Management

   New exchange type can also be defined to do RP SA negotiation.  For
   example, IKE_RP_AUTH exchange can be defined dedicated to RP SA
   negotiation, and take the value, say 38, from the reserved to IANA
   value 38-239, as its Exchange Type value.  Note that the Exchange
   Type of IKE_AUTH is 35.  The payloads involved in IKE_RP_AUTH
   exchange may be similar with that in IKE_AUTH, and the major
   difference may be the SA payload.  The extended SA payload SAe or the
   new added payload SARP can be used in this exchange, replacing the SA
   payload in IKE_AUTH exchange.  In this way, i.e., with a dedicated
   exchange, the negotiation of RP SA can be speeded up to some extent.

   Extending SA payload and adding new payload can be used independently
   or even hybridly if applicable, and can also be combined with the new
   added exchange type defined in section 3.1.3, to finish the RP SA
   negotiation, creation, and distribution if applicable.

3.2.  ISAKMP Extensions

   ISAKMP [RFC2408] defines procedures and packet formats to establish,
   negotiate, modify and delete SA.  SAs contain all the information
   required for execution of various network security services, such as
   the IP layer services (such as header authentication and payload
   encapsulation), transport or application layer services, or self-
   protection of negotiation traffic.  ISAKMP is intended to support the
   negotiation of SAs for security protocols at all layers of the
   network stack.  However, ISAKMP provides a framework but not define
   them [RFC2409].  This section tries to discuss ISAKMP extensions and
   definitions to serve routing protocol.

   The following changes can be made in ISAKMP to support automated SA
   management for routing protocols:

   o  Extend DOI (Domain of Interpretation) field of SA payload to
      indicate the subsequent payloads are used to negotiate RP SA,
      e.g., define a new DOI and assign it the value 3 if applicable,
      and denote it as SARPDOI, which means DOI for routing protocol
      security association.

   o  Extend Security Protocol Identifiers of proposal for RP SA, e.g.,
      define OSPFv2 as PROTO_ OSPFv2 and assign it the value 5 if
      applicable.  In this way, the RP SA established for OSPFv2 is
      shown.

Internet-Draft              RP SA Management                October 2010


   o  Match SPI field in proposal substructure to Key ID of RP SA, and
      extend SPI Size (in octet) field of proposal substructure to
      include routing protocols, e.g., assign OSPFv2 the value 1, since
      the length of Key ID is 8 bits.

   o  Extend Transform Identifiers to define transform for specific
      routing protocol, e.g., define new transforms OSPFv2_MD5 and
      OSPFv2_SHA for OSPFv2, which means OSPFv2 using MD5 and SHA-1 as
      authentication algorithm respectively, and assign them the value 2
      and 3 respectively.

   o  Extend Attribute Type to support attributes of RP SA, e.g., define
      Start Time for life time of OSPFv2, and assign it the value 4.

   Alternatively, DOI (Domain of Interpretation ) can be extended in
   this way -- extend DOI field of SA payload to indicate the subsequent
   payloads will be used to negotiate RP SA, e.g., define SPFv2 DOI and
   assign it the value 3.
