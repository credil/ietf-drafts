    <abstract>
      <t>Fast handover protocols for MIPv6 and PMIPv6 define mobility
      management procedures that support unicast communication at reduced
      handover latencies. Fast handover base operations do not affect
      multicast communication, and hence do not accelerate handover management
      for native multicast listeners. Many multicast applications like IPTV or
      conferencing, though, are comprised of delay-sensitive real-time traffic
      and will benefit from fast handover execution. This document specifies
      extension of the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast
      Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast
      traffic management in fast handover operations.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC3775"></xref> defines a network layer
      mobility protocol involving mobile nodes participation, while Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> provides a mechanism without
      requiring mobility protocol operations at a Mobile Node (MN). Both
      protocols introduce traffic disruptions on handovers that may be
      intolerable in many application scenarios. Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers
      (FMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5568"></xref>, and Fast Handovers for Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 (PFMIPv6) <xref target="I-D.ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6"></xref>
      improve these handover delays for unicast communication to the order of
      the maximum delay needed for link switching and signaling between Access
      Routers (ARs) or Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs) <xref
      target="FMIPv6-Analysis"></xref>.</t>

      <t>No dedicated treatment of seamless multicast data reception has been
      proposed by any of the above protocols. MIPv6 only roughly defines
      multicast for Mobile Nodes using a remote subscription approach or a
      home subscription through bi-directional tunneling via the Home Agent
      (HA). Multicast forwarding services have not been specified at all in
      <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>, but are subject to current specification
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution"></xref>. It is
      assumed throughout this document that mechanisms and protocol operations
      are in place to transport multicast traffic to ARs. These operations are
      referred to as 'JOIN/LEAVE' of an AR, while the explicit techniques to
      manage multicast transmission are beyond the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Mobile multicast protocols need to serve applications such as IPTV
      with high-volume content streams to be distributed to potentially large
      numbers of receivers, and therefore should preserve the multicast nature
      of packet distribution and approximate optimal routing <xref
      target="RFC5757"></xref>. It is undesirable to rely on home tunneling
      for optimizing multicast. Unencapsulated, native multicast transmission
      requires establishing forwarding state, which will not be transferred
      between access routers by the unicast fast handover protocols. Thus
      multicast traffic will not experience expedited handover performance,
      but an MN - or its corresponding MAG in PMIPv6 - can perform remote
      subscriptions in each visited network.</t>

      <t>This document specifies extensions of FMIPv6 and PFMIPv6 for
      including multicast traffic management in fast handover operations. The
      solution common to both underlying protocols defines the per-group
      transfer of multicast contexts between ARs or MAGs. The protocol defines
      corresponding message extensions necessary for carrying group context
      information independent of the particular handover protocol. ARs or MAGs
      are then enabled to treat multicast traffic according to fast unicast
      handovers and with similar performance. No protocol changes are
      introduced that prevent a multicast unaware node from performing fast
      handovers with multicast aware ARs or MAGs.</t>

      <t>This specification is applicable when a mobile node has joined and
      maintains one or several multicast group subscriptions prior to
      undergoing a fast handover. It does not introduce any requirements on
      the multicast routing protocols in use, nor are the ARs or MAGs assumed
      to be multicast routers. It assumes network conditions, though, that
      allow native multicast reception in both, the previous and new access
      network. Methods to bridge regions without native multicast connectivity
      are beyond the scope of this document.</t>

      <section anchor="AR-context-transfer"
               title="Multicast Context Transfer between Access Routers">
        <t>In a fast handover scenario (cf. <xref target="fig1"></xref>),
        ARs/MAGs establish a mutual binding and provide the capability to
        exchange context information concerning the MN. This context transfer
        will be triggered by detecting MN's forthcoming move to a new AR and
        assist the MN to immediately resume communication on the new subnet
        link using its previous IP address. In contrast to unicast, multicast
        stream reception does not primarily depend on address and binding
        cache management, but requires distribution trees to adapt so that
        traffic follows the movement of the MN. This process may be
        significantly slower than fast handover management <xref
        target="RFC5757"></xref>. Multicast listeners at handover may take the
        twofold advantage of including the multicast groups under subscription
        in context transfer. First, the NAR can proactively join the desired
        groups as soon as it gains knowledge of them. Second, multicast
        streams may be included in traffic forwarding via the tunnel
        established from PAR to NAR.</t>

        <t>There are two modes of operation in FMIPv6 and in PFMIPv6. The
        predictive mode allows for AR-binding and context transfer prior to an
        MN handover, while in the reactive mode, these steps are executed
        after detection that the MN has re-attached to NAR. Details of the
        signaling schemes differ between FMIPv6 and PFMIPv6 and are outlined
        in <xref target="FMIPv6-overview"></xref> and <xref
        target="PFMIPv6-overview"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In a predictive fast handover, the access router (e.g., PAR in
        <xref target="fig1"></xref>) learns about the impending movement of
        the MN and simultaneously about the multicast group context as
        specified in <xref target="FMIPv6-overview"></xref> and <xref
        target="PFMIPv6-overview"></xref>. Thereafter, PAR will initiate an
        AR-binding and context transfer by transmitting a HI message to NAR.
        HI is extended by multicast group states carried in mobility header
        options as defined in <xref target="multicast-option"></xref>. On
        reception of the HI message, NAR returns a multicast acknowledgement
        in its HACK answer that indicates its ability to support each
        requested group, as well as its willingness to receive multicast
        traffic forwarded from PAR (see <xref target="multicast-ack"></xref>).
        There are several reasons to waive forwarding, e.g., the group may
        already be under native subscription or capacity constraints may
        hinder decapsulation of additional streams at the NAR. For the groups
        requested, PAR will add the tunnel interface to its multicast
        forwarding database, so that multicast streams are forwarded in
        parallel to unicast traffic. NAR, taking the role of an MLD proxy
        <xref target="RFC4605"></xref> with the upstream tunnel interface to
        PAR, will submit an MLD report to request the desired groups, but will
        terminate multicast forwarding <xref target="RFC3810"></xref> from
        PAR, as soon as group traffic natively arrives. In addition, NAR
        immediately joins all groups that are not already under subscription
        using its loopback interface, and starts downstream multicast
        forwarding after the MN has arrived.</t>

        <t>In a reactive fast handover, PAR will learn about the movement of
        the MN, after the latter has re-associated with the new access
        network. Also from the new link, it will be informed about the
        multicast context of the MN. As group membership information are
        present at the new access network prior to context transfer, MLD join
        signaling can proceed in parallel to HI/HACK exchange. Following the
        context transfer, multicast data can be forwarded to the new access
        network using the PAR-NAR tunnel of the fast handover protocol.
        Depending on the specific network topology though, multicast traffic
        for some groups may natively arrive before it is forwarded from
        PAR.</t>

        <t>In both modes of operation, it is the responsibility of the PAR
        (PMAG) to properly react on the departure of the MN in the context of
        local group management. Depending on the multicast state management,
        link type and MLD parameters deployed (cf., <xref
        target="RFC5757"></xref>), it is requested to take appropriate actions
        to adjust multicast service to requirements of the remaining
        nodes.</t>

        <t>In this way, the MN will be able to participate in multicast group
        communication with a handover performance comparable to that for
        unicast, while network resources consumption is minimized.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="FMIPv6-overview"
               title="Protocol Operations Specific to FMIPv6">
        <t>ARs that provide multicast support in FMIPv6 will advertise this
        general service by setting an indicator bit (M-bit) in its PrRtAdv
        message as defined in <xref target="m-prtrtadv"></xref>. Additional
        details about the multicast service support, e.g., flavors and groups,
        will be exchanged within HI/HACK dialogs later at handovers.</t>

        <t>An MN operating FMIPv6 will actively initiate the handover
        management by submitting a fast binding update (FBU). The MN, which is
        aware of the multicast groups it wishes to maintain, will attach
        mobility options containing its group states (see <xref
        target="multicast-option"></xref>) to the FBU, and thereby inform ARs
        about its multicast context. ARs will use these multicast context
        options for inter-AR context transfer.</t>

        <t>In predictive mode, FBU is issued on the previous link and received
        by PAR as displayed in <xref target="fmip-pred"></xref>. PAR will
        extract the multicast context options and append them to its HI
        message. From the HACK message, PAR will redistribute the multicast
        acknowledgement by adding the corresponding mobility options to its
        FBACK message. From receiving FBACK, the MN will learn about a per
        group multicast support in the new access network. If some groups or a
        multicast flavour are not supported, it may decide on taking actions
        to compensate the missing service. Note that the proactive multicast
        context transfer may proceed successfully, even if the MN misses the
        FBACK message on the previous link.</t>

        and performing an unsolicited neighbor advertisement (UNA), the MN
        issues an FBU which NAR forwards to PAR without processing. At this
        time, the MN is able to re-join all desired multicast groups without
        relying on AR assistance. Nevertheless, multicast context options are
        exchanged in the HI/HACK dialog to facilitate intermediate forwarding
        of requested streams. Note that group traffic may already arrive from
        a MN's subscription at the time NAR receives the HI message. Such
        streams may be transparently excluded from forwarding by setting an
        appropriate multicast acknowledge option. In any case, NAR MUST ensure
        that not more than one stream of the same group is forwarded to the
        MN.</t>

               title="Protocol Operations Specific to PFMIPv6">
        <t>In a proxy mobile IPv6 environment, the MN remains agnostic of
        network layer changes, and fast handover procedures are operated by
        the access routers or MAGs. The handover initiation, or the
        re-association respectively are managed by the access networks.
        Consequently, access routers need to be aware of multicast membership
        state at the mobile node. There are two ways to obtain record of MN's
        multicast membership. First, MAGs MAY perform an explicit tracking
        (cf., <xref target="RFC4605"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution"></xref>) or extract
        membership status from forwarding states at node-specific
        point-to-point links. Second, routers can perform general queries at
        handovers. Both methods are equally applicable. However, a router that
        does not do explicit tracking MUST query its downstream links
        subsequent to handovers. In either case, the PAR will become
        knowledgeable about multicast group subscriptions of the MN.</t>

        <t>In predictive mode, the PMAG (PAR) will learn about the upcoming
        movement of the mobile node. Without explicit tracking, it will
        immediately submit a general MLD query and learn about the multicast
        groups under subscription. As displayed in <xref
        target="pfmip-pred"></xref>, it will initiate binding and context
        transfer with the NMAG (NAR) by issuing a HI message that is augmented
        by multicast contexts in the mobility options defined in <xref
        target="multicast-option"></xref>). NAR will extract multicast context
        information and act as described in <xref
        target="AR-context-transfer"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In reactive mode, the NMAG (NAR) will learn about MN's attachment
        to the N-AN and establish connectivity by means of PMIPv6 protocol
        operations. However, it will have no knowledge about multicast state
        at the MN. Triggered by a MN attachment, the NMAG will send a general
        MLD query and thereafter join the requested groups. In the case of a
        reactive handover, the binding is initiated by NMAG, and the HI/HACK
        message semantic is inverted (see <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6"></xref>). For multicast context
        transfer, the NMAG attaches to its HI message those group identifiers
        it requests to be forwarded from PMAG. Using the identical syntax in
        its multicast mobility option headers as defined in <xref
        target="multicast-ack"></xref>, PMAG acknowledges the group forwarding
        request in its HACK answer. The corresponding call flow is displayed
        in <xref target="pfmip-react"></xref>.</t>

          <t>A Mobile Node willing to manage multicast traffic will join,
          maintain and leave groups as if located in the fixed Internet. It
          will cooperate in handover indication as specified in <xref

          link-layer technology. No multicast-specific mobility actions nor
          implementations are required at the MN in a PMIPv6 domain.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operations of the Previous MAG">
          <t>A MAG receiving a handover indication for one of its MNs follows
          the predictive fast handover mode as a PMAG. It MUST issue a general
          MLD Query immediately on its corresponding link unless it performs
          an explicit tracking on that link. After gaining knowledge of the
          multicast subscriptions of the MN, the PMAG builds a Multicast
          Mobility Option as described in <xref
          target="multicast-option"></xref> that contains the MLD (IGMP)
          multicast listener state. This Mobility Option is appended to the
          regular fast handover HI messages, or - in the case of unicast HI
          message being submitted prior to multicast state detection - sent in
          an additional HI message to the NMAG. PMAG then waits for receiving
          the Multicast Acknowledgement Option with HACK (see <xref
          target="multicast-ack"></xref>) and the creation of the
          bidirectional tunnel with NMAG. Thereafter PMAG will add the tunnel
          to its downstream interfaces in the multicast forwarding database.
          For those groups (channels) reported in the Multicast
          Acknowledgement Option, i.e., not supported in the new access
          network, PMAG takes appropriate actions (e.g., forwarding,
          termination) in concordance with the network policy. It SHOULD start
          forwarding traffic down the tunnel interface for those groups it
          receives an MLD listener report message from NAR. After the
          departure of the MN and on the reception of LEAVE messages for
          groups/channels, PMAG MUST terminate forwarding of the specific
          groups and update its multicast forwarding database. Correspondingly
          it issues a group/channel LEAVE to its upstream link if no more
          listeners are present on its downstream links.</t>

          <t>A MAG receiving a HI message with Multicast Mobility Option for a
          currently attached node follows the reactive fast handover mode as a
          PMAG. It will return a Multicast Acknowledgement Option (see <xref
          target="multicast-ack"></xref>) within HACK listing those
          groups/channels it is not willing to support or forward to NMAG. It
          will add the bidirectional tunnel with NMAG to its downstream
          interfaces and will start forwarding multicast traffic. At the
          reception of LEAVE messages for groups/channels, PMAG MUST terminate
          forwarding of the specific groups and update its multicast
          forwarding database. According to its multicast forwarding states it
          MAY need to issue a group/channel LEAVE to its upstream link if no
          more listeners are present on its downstream links.</t>

          <t>An MN in a PMIPv6 domain may use an IPv4 address transparently
          for communication as specified in <xref target="RFC5844"></xref>.
          For this purpose, LMAs can register IPv4-Proxy-CoAs in its Binding
          Caches and MAGs can provide IPv4 support in access networks.
          Correspondingly, multicast membership management will be performed
          by the MN using IGMP. For multiprotocol multicast support on the
          network side, IGMPv3 router functions are required at both MAGs (see
          <xref target="MLD-compat"></xref> for compatibility considerations
          with previous IGMP versions). Context transfer between MAGs can
          transparently proceed in HI/HACK message exchanges by encapsulating
          IGMP multicast state records within Multicast Mobility Options (see

               title="Length Considerations: Number of Records and Addresses">
        <t>Mobility Header Messages exchanged in HI/HACK and FBU/FBACK dialogs
        impose length restrictions on multicast context records. The maximal
        payload length available in FBU/FBACK messages is the PATH-MTU - 40
        octets (IPv6 Header) - 6 octets (Mobility Header) - 6 octets
        (FBU/FBACK Header). For example, on an Ethernet link with an MTU of
        1500 octets, not more than 72 Multicast Address Records of minimal
        length (without source states) may be exchanged in one message pair.
        In typical handover scenarios, this number reduces further according
        to unicast context and Binding Authorization data. A larger number of
        MLD Report Payloads MAY be sent within multiple HI/HACK or FBU/FBACK
        message pairs. In PFMIPv6, context information can be fragmented over
        several HI/HACK messages. However, a single MLDv2 Report Payload MUST
        NOT be fragmented. Hence, for a single Multicast Address Record on an
        Ethernet link, the number of source addresses is limited to 89.</t>

      <section anchor="MLD-compat" title="MLD (IGMP) Compatibility Aspects">
        <t>Access routers (MAGs) MUST support MLDv2 (IGMPv3). To enable
        multicast service for MLDv1 (IGMPv2) listeners, the routers MUST
        follow the interoperability rules defined in <xref
        target="RFC3810"></xref> (<xref target="RFC3376"></xref>) and
        appropriately set the Multicast Address Compatibility Mode. When the
        Multicast Address Compatibility Mode is MLDv1 (IGMPv2), a router
        internally translates the following MLDv1 (IGMPv2) messages for that
        multicast address to their MLDv2 (IGMPv2) equivalents and uses these
        messages in the context transfer. The current state of Compatibility
        Mode is translated into the code of the Multicast Mobility Option as
        defined in <xref target="multicast-option"></xref>. A NAR (nMAG)
        receiving a Multicast Mobility Option during handover will switch to
        the minimum obtained from its previous and newly learned value of MLD
        (IGMP) Compatibility Mode for continued operation.</t>

      <t>Multicast context transfer at predictive handovers implements group
      states at remote access routers and may lead to group subscriptions
      without further validation of the multicast service requests. Thereby a
      NAR (nMAG) is requested to cooperate in potentially complex multicast
      re-routing and may receive large volumes of traffic. Malicious or
      inadvertent multicast context transfers may result in a significant
      burden of route establishment and traffic management onto the backbone
      infrastructure and the access router itself. Rapid re-routing or traffic
      overload can be mitigated by a rate control at the AR that restricts the
      frequency of traffic redirects and the total number of subscriptions. In
      addition, the wireless access network remains protected from multicast
      data injection until the requesting MN attaches to the new location.</t>
