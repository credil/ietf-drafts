1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].


3.  Introduction

   The ForCES MIB module is a read-only MIB module that captures
   information related to the ForCES protocol ([RFC3654], [RFC3746],
   [forces-applicability-draft] and [forces-protocol-draft]).

   The ForCES MIB module does not include information that is specified
   in other MIB modules, such as packet counters for interfaces, etc.

   More specifically, the information in the ForCES MIB module relative
   to associations (between Control Elements and Forwarding Elements)
   that are in the UP state includes:

   o  identifiers of the elements in the association,

   o  configuration parameters of the association, and

   o  statistics of the association.


4.  ForCES MIB Overview

   The MIB module contains the latest ForCES protocol version supported
   by the Control Element (CE) (forcesLatestProtocolVersionSupported).
   Note that the CE must also allow interaction with Forwarding Elements
   (FEs) supporting earlier versions.

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                 September 2008


   For each association identified by the pair CE ID and FE ID, the
   following associated information is provided by the MIB module as an
   entry (forcesAssociationEntry) in the association table
   (forcesAssociationTable):

   o  Version number of the ForCES protocol running in this association
      (forcesAssociationRunningProtocolVersion).

   o  Time when the association entered the UP state
      (forcesAssociationTimeUp).

   o  Time when the association left the UP state
      (forcesAssociationTimeDown).  Note that this is only used for
      notification purposes as the association is removed from the MIB
      immediately after it leaves the UP state.

   o  Number of ForCES Heartbeat messages sent from the CE
      (forcesAssociationHBMsgSent) and received by the CE
      (forcesAssociationHBMsgReceived) since the association entered the
      UP state.

   o  Number of operational ForCES messages sent from the CE
      (forcesAssociationOperMsgSent) and received by the CE
      (forcesAssociationOperMsgReceived) since the association entered
      the UP state.  Only messages other than Heartbeat, Association
      Setup, Association Setup Response, and Association Teardown are
      counted.

   Finally, the MIB module defines the following notifications:

   o  Whenever an association enters the UP state, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryUp) is issued containing the version of the
      ForCES protocol running.  CE ID and FE ID are concatenated to form
      the table index, hence they appear in the OID of the ForCES-
      protocol running-version object.  Optionally, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryUpStats) can instead be issued with all
      associated information for this association, except
      forcesAssociationTimeDown.

   o  Whenever an association leaves the UP state, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryDown) is issued containing the version of
      the ForCES protocol running.  Optionally, a notification
      (forcesAssociationEntryDownStats) can instead be issued with all
      associated information for this association.  The reason is that
      the association and all its associated information will be removed
      from the MIB immediately after this notification has been issued.

6.  Associations kept in the MIB

   Associations enter the UP state as soon as the CE has sent to the FE
   an Association Setup Response message containing a successful
   Association Setup Result.  Only associations that are UP are
   reflected in this MIB module.

   Associations are removed from the MIB module as soon as they leave
   the UP state, i.e., if the CE has not received any message (Heartbeat
   or other protocol message) from the FE within a given time period or
   if an Association Teardown message has been sent by the CE.

   Statistics counters are initialized to zero when the association is
   created.  If the same association goes down and comes back up, the
   counters will reset and the discontinuity can be discovered by
   checking the discontinuity timestamp.  In addition, the time-up
   timestamp in the association allows to distinguish new associations
   from past ones with the same index.  Note that the optional down
   notification contains the statistics with the final values of the
   statistics counters.


7.  Support for multiple CEs and FEs

   An NE consists of one or more FEs and one or more CEs.  Where there
   is a single CE, that CE will have knowledge of all the associations
   in the NE and so can provide the information necessary to support the
   managed objects defined in this MIB module.  Where there is more than
   one CE, information about the associations may be distributed among
   the CEs.  Whether each CE implements the managed objects for the
   associations of which it is aware or whether the CEs cooperate to
   present the appearance of a single set of managed objects for all the

   associations in the NE is outside the scope of this document.


8.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Objects in the forcesMibGroup are protocol versions.  They are
      neither sensitive nor vulnerable.

   o  Objects in the forcesStatsGroup are statistics.  They are neither
      sensitive nor vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


9.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                 September 2008


   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         forcesMIB         { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.


10.  Changes from Previous Draft Revisions

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): Prior to RFC
   publication of this document, the RFC Editor is asked to remove this
   entire section titled "Changes from Previous Draft Versions".

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-08:

   o  Changed the MIB objects forcesAssociationOtherMsgSent and
      forcesAssociationOtherMsgReceived to forcesAssociationOperMsgSent
      and forcesAssociationOperMsgReceived as they are not all other
      messages besides HB (comment from the General Area Review Team).

   o  Changed MIB counter objects forcesAssociationHBMsgSent,
      forcesAssociationHBMsgReceived, forcesAssociationOperMsgSent, and
      forcesAssociationOperMsgReceived from Counter32 to
      ZeroBasedCounter32 (comment from Bert Wijnen).  Adapted the
      paragraph about statistics counters in section "Associations kept
      in the MIB"

   o  Introduced a MIB object forcesAssociationCounterDiscontinuityTime,
      and added it to the forcesAssociationEntry as well as to the
      forcesAssociationEntryDownStats notification and the
      forcesStatsGroup compliance group.  Added text on discontinuity
      for all counter objects.

   o  Removed MIB counters from the forcesAssociationEntryUpStats
      notification, as passing now zero values is useless.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-07: They are editorial changes
   made as suggested by the General Area Review Team.

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                 September 2008


   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-06:

   o  Informational RFCs 3654 and 3746 moved to Informative References
      section.

   o  Updated chairs' names in the MIB description.

   o  Update references to protocol and applicability drafts.

   o  Reversed the order of the two first sentences in section
      "Associations kept in the MIB"

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-05: Copyright statement in the MIB
   description corrected to IETF Trust.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-04.  They are changes suggested by
   the MIB doctor review, according to the MIB Review Checklist in
   Appendix A of RFC 4181:

   o  Changed MIB descriptions with "since the association entered the
      UP state" instead of "since the association is up".

   o  Updated the I-D boilerplate copyright statement.

   o  Removed last sentence of abstract.

   o  Moved the MIB boilerplate into a section of its own.

   o  Moved the MIB definition into a section of its own.

   o  Updated the Security Considerations section according to the
      boilerplate at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html.

   o  Updated the MIB description with the copyright statement.

   o  Added DISPLAY-HINT to the ForCESProtocolVersion.  Note that the
      smilint tool doesn't like it.

   o  Added IETF to the MODULE-IDENTITY ORGANIZATION.

   o  Updated CONTACT-INFO to indicate how to reach the group.

   o  Changed forcesAssocationTimeDown MAX-ACCESS to accessible-for-
      notify.

   o  Added text to DESCRIPTION of forcesAssociationTimeUp to indicate
      that it allows to uniquely identify associations with the same FE
      and CE IDs.

Internet-Draft                 ForCES MIB                 September 2008


   o  Added two optional notifications that carry stats and added
      corresponding text in the last paragraph of section titled
      "Associations kept in the MIB".  The reason is that optional
      objects such as stats in a mandatory notification are not
      supported.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-03.  They are small fixes to the
   text and the MIB module:

   o  Added MIB boilerplate according to
      http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html

   o  Clarified terminology with respect to MIB module and MIB managed
      objects.

   o  Added RFC Editor note to indicate RFC number for version 1 of
      ForCES protocol under ForcesProtocolVersion.

   o  Renumbered elements in forcesAssociationEntry starting with 1.

   o  Changed ForcesProtocolVersion from INTEGER to Integer32.

   o  Added forcesLatestProtocolVersionSupported into the mandatory
      forcesMibGroups conformance group.

   o  Explicitely added the forcesStatsGroup to the forcesMibCompliance
      compliance statement as optional.

   o  Moved the MIB Definition section to the front.

   o  Rephrased IANA Considerations section according to RFC 4181
      Section 3.5.2.

   o  Added RFC Editor note to remove the "Changes from Previous Draft
      Revisions" section prior to publication.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-02.  They are refinements of the
   MIB module:

   o  Changed forcesAssociationCEID and forcesAssociationFEID from read-
      only to not-accessible to conform with Section 7.7 in [RFC2578].

   o  Removed forcesAssociationCEID and forcesAssociationFEID from the
      notifications.  This information is conveyed in the OID anyway.

   o  Added MIB conformance information.

   Changes from draft-ietf-forces-mib-01.  The changes are in response

   to the Working Group Last Call:

   o  Addition of two traps/notifications to signal the associations
      that enter or leave the UP state.

   o  Suppression of the DOWN and ESTABLISHING states.  Only
      associations in the UP state are kept in the table.

   o  Split of the Message counters into Heartbeat and other messages.

   o  Addition of the current running version of ForCES protocol for
      each association in the UP state.

   o  Addition of the latest version of the ForCES protocol supported by
      the CE.
