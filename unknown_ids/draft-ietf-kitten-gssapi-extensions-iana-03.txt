Internet-Draft            GSS IANA Instructions               March 2008


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   There is a need for private-use and mechanism-specific extensions to
   the Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-
   API).  As such extensions are designed and standardized (or not),
   both at the IETF and elsewhere, there is a non-trivial risk of
   namespace pollution and conflicts.  To avoid this we set out
   guidelines for extending the GSS-API and direct the creation of an
   IANA registry for GSS-API namespaces.

   Registrations of individual items and sub-namespaces are allowed.
   Each sub-namespace may provide different rules for registration,
   e.g., for mechanism-specific and private-use extensions.  All
   Standards-Track uses of the GSS-API namespaces will be registered as
   part of the RFC publication process.  See Section 8.2.


3.  Extensions to the GSS-API

   Extensions to the GSS-API can be categorized as follows:
   o  Abstract API extensions
   o  Implementation-specific
   o  Mechanism-specific
   o  Language binding-specific

   Extensions to the GSS-API may be purely semantic, without effect on
   the GSS-API's namespaces.  Or they may introduce new functions,
   constants, types, etc...; these clearly affect the GSS-API
   namespaces.

   Extensions that affect the GSS-API namespaces should be registered
   with the IANA as described herein.


4.  Generic GSS-API Namespaces

   The abstract API namespaces for the GSS-API are:
   o  Type names
   o  Function names
   o  Constant names for each type
   o  Constant values for each type

Internet-Draft            GSS IANA Instructions               March 2008


   o  Name types (OID, type name and syntaxes)

   Additionally we have namespaces associates with the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
   (OID) type:
   o  Mechanism OIDs
   o  Name Type OIDs


5.  Language Binding-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   Language binding specific namespaces include:
   o  Header/interface module names
   o  Object classes and/or types
   o  Methods and/or functions
   o  Constant names
   o  Constant values


6.  Extension-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   Extensions to the GSS-API may create additional namespaces.  See
   Section 8.2.


7.  Registration Form(s)

   Registrations for GSS-API namespaces SHALL take the following form:

   +----------------+--------------------+-----------------------------+

   |                |                    | constant value), or whether |
   |                |                    | it reserves an entire       |

   |                |                    | value range.                |

   The IANA should create a single GSS-API namespace registry, or
   multiple registries, one for symbolic names and one for constant
   values, and/or it may create a registry per-programming language, at
   its convenience.

   Entries in these registries should consist of all the fields from
   their corresponding registration entries.

   Entries should be sorted by: registration type, progamming language,
   object type, and symbol name/prefix.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document deals with IANA considerations throughout.
   Specifically it creates a single registry of various kinds of things,
   thought the IANA may instead create multiple registries each for one
   of those kinds of things.  Of particular interest may be that IANA
   will now be the registration authority for the GSS-API name type OID
   space.

8.1.  Initial Namespace Registrations

   Initial registry content corresponding to the items defined in
   [RFC2743], [RFC2744], [RFC2853], [RFC1964] and [RFC4121] and others
   will be supplied during the IANA review portion of the RFC publishing
   process.  The KITTEN WG chairs MUST indicate that such content has
   been reviewed by the WG and that there is WG consensus that the
   entries are in agreement with those RFCs.

8.2.  Registration Maintenance Guidelines

   Standards-Track RFCs can create new items with any non-conflicting
   Symbol Name/Prefix value for this registry by virtue of IESG approval
   to publish as a Standards-Track RFC.  The status of such entries
   SHALL initially be as specified by the RFC (defaulting to 'Standards-
   Track').

   Standards-Track RFCs can mark existing entries as obsolete or

Internet-Draft            GSS IANA Instructions               March 2008


   historic, and can even create conflicting entries if explicitly
   stated (the IESG, of course, should review conflicts very carefully).

   IANA shall also consider submissions from individuals, and via
   Informational and Experimental RFCs, subject to Expert Review.  IANA
   SHALL allow such registrations if a) they are not conflicting, and b)
   if expert review passes.  Guidelines for expert reviews are given
   below.  The Status of any such registrations SHALL agree with the
   Status of the source RFC, or, for individual registrations, 'Other'.

8.2.1.  Expert Reviews of Individual Submissions

   Expert review selection SHALL be as follows.  If, at the time that
   the IANA receives an individual submission for registration in this
   registry, there is are any IETF Working Groups chartered to produce
   GSS-API-related documents, then the IANA SHALL ask the chairs of such
   WGs to be expert reviewers or to name one.  If there are no such WGs
   at that time, then the IANA SHALL ask past chairs of the KITTEN WG
   and the author/editor of this RFC to act as expert reviewers or name
   an alternate.

   Expert reviewers of individual registration submissions with
   Registration Type == Sub-namespace should check that the registration
   request has a suitable description (which need not be sufficiently
   detailsed for others to implement) and that the Symbol Name/Prefix is
   sufficiently descriptive of the purpose of the sub-namespace or the
   name of the submitter or associated company.

   Expert reviewers of individual registration submissions with
   Registration Type == Instance should check that the Symbol Name falls
   under a sub-namespace controlled by the submitter and that the Status
   of the submission is "Informational."  Registration of such entries
   which do not fall under such a sub-namespace may be allowed provided
   that they correspond to long existing non-standard extensions to the
   GSS-API and this can be easily checked or demonstrated, otherwise
   IESG Protocol Action is REQUIRED (see previous section).  Also,
   reviewers should check that any registration of constant values for
   types which have Standard-Track status have a detailed description
   that is suitable for other implementors to reproduce, and that they
   don't conflict with other usages or are otherwise dangerous in the
   reviewers estimation.


9.  Security Considerations
