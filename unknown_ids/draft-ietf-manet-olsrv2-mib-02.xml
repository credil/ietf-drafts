      <t>This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).
      The Optimized Link State Routing MIB is structured into
      state information, performance metrics, and notifications. In addition
      to configuration, this additional state and performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues of the routing protocol. Different levels of compliances allow implementors to  use smaller subsets of all defined objects, allowing for this MIB to be deployed on more constrained routers.

      <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
      Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of <xref target="RFC3410"/>.</t>

      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in <xref
      target="RFC2578"/>, <xref
      target="RFC2579"/>, and <xref
      target="RFC2580"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) <xref target="OLSRv2"/> is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e. it exchanges topology information with other routers in the network regularly. OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing protocol. Its key concept is that of MultiPoint Relays (MPRs).  Each router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.  MPRs are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology reduction.</t>
      
      <t>This MIB document provides management and control capabilities of an OLSRv2 instance, allowing to monitor the state and performance of an OLSRV2 router, as well as to change settings of the deployment.</t>
      
      <t>As OLSRv2 relies on the neighborhood information discovered by NHDP <xref target="NHDP"/>, the OLSRv2-MIB is aligned with the <xref target="NHDP-MIB">NHDP-MIB</xref>. In particular, common indexes for router interfaces and discovered neighbors are used, as described in <xref target="state_group"/>.</t>  


      <section title="Terms">
        <t>The following definitions apply throughout this document:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
          initialized to default settings or set through the management
          interface defined by this MIB.</t>

          <t>State Objects - automatically generated values which define the      current operating state of the OLSRv2 protocol process in the      router.</t>

          <t>Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help
          an administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
          OLSRv2 routing process on the router.</t>
          
          <t>Notification Objects - define triggers and associated notification      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined events      on the managed router.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>
    
   

    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">
      <t>This section presents the structure of the OLSRv2-MIB module. The objects are arranged into the following structure:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>olsrv2Objects - defines objects forming the basis for the OLSRv2-MIB. These objects are divided up by function into the following
        groups:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the OLSRv2 instance on the router.</t>

          <t>State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the OLSRv2 instance running on the router.</t>

          <t>Performance Group -defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of OLSRv2
         on the router and in the MANET.</t>
        </list></t>
        
        <t>olsrv2Notifications - objects defining OLSRv2-MIB notifications.</t>

        <t>olsrv2Conformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance      requirements for implementations of this MIB.</t>
      </list></t>

  

      <section title="The Configuration Group">
        <t>The OLSRv2 router is configured with a set of controls.  The   authoritative list of configuration controls within the OLSRv2-MIB are   found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt was made in developing the OLSRv2-MIB module to support all configuration objects defined in <xref target="OLSRv2"/>. For all of the configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of these parameters as defined in <xref target="OLSRv2"/> are followed.</t>

      <section anchor="state_group" title="The State Group">
        <t>The State Group reports current state information of a router running   <xref target="OLSRv2"/>. The OLSRv2-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain the complete set of state information defined within the information bases in <xref target="OLSRv2"/>.</t>

   		<t>The State Group tables defined in this MIB are aligned with the according tables in the <xref target="NHDP-MIB">NHDP-MIB</xref>, as described in <xref target="relationship_to_NHDP_MIB"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="performance_group" title="The Performance Group">
      	<t>The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.           This section lists objects for OLSRv2 performance monitoring,           some of which explicitly appear in the OLSRv2-MIB and others which           are obtainable through a combination of base objects from this MIB and reports available through the <xref target="REPORT">REPORT-MIB</xref>.           Throughout this section, those objects will be pointed out that are intended as base objects which will be explicitly defined within this MIB and those objects which are derived through a combination of the          base objects and capabilities afforded by the REPORT-MIB.</t>
           
        <t>The objects in this group can be used to examine stability of the Routing Set, the selected MPRs, as well as message scheduling of this router.</t>

        This group is currently empty.</t>

      <t>This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards   containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB   modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in this section.</t>

      <section title="Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB">
        <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"/>
        is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply
        to the entity as a whole. The 'system' group provides identification
        of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The
        OLSRv2-MIB does not duplicate those objects.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="relationship_to_NHDP_MIB" title="Relationship to the NHDP-MIB">
        <t>OLSRv2 depends on the neighborhood information that is discovered by <xref target="NHDP"/>. In order access the Objects relating to discovered neighbors, the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB <xref target="NHDP-MIB"/> are aligned with this MIB. This is accomplished through the definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB: the NeighborInterfaceId and the NeighborRouterId.  These object types are used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB and routing protocol State Group tables.  These objects are locally significant but should be locally common to the NHDP-MIB and the OLSRv2-MIB implemented on a common networked router.  This will allow for improved cross referencing of information across the two MIBs.</t>
      </section>

	  <section title="Relationship to the REPORT-MIB">
	  	<t>This document describes several Performance Management metrics for   the management of OLSRv2 routers.  However, not all of these metrics are explicitly defined solely within the context of this OLSRv2-MIB.  Some of these metrics are obtained through joint interaction between this MIB and the REPORT-MIB [REPORT]. This OLSRv2-MIB defines the minimum necessary objects (often of type COUNTER) which form the underlying basis for more sophisticated Performance Management reporting available in conjunction with the REPORT-MIB. See <xref target="performance_group"/> for a description of the performance metrics for OLSRv2.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This MIB defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and   notification of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2 <xref target="OLSRv2"/>. OLSRv2 allows routers to acquire topological information of the routing domain by virtue of exchanging TC message, to calculate shortest paths to each destination router in the routing domain, to select relays for network-wide transmissions etc.</t>
      
      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
      
      <list style="symbols">
   	  	<t>olsrv2TcInterval, olsrv2TcMinInterval -  these writable objects control the rate at which TC messages are sent.  If set at too high a rate, this could represent a form of DOS attack by overloading interface resources. If set low, OLSRv2 may not converge fast enough to provide accurate routes to all destinations in the routing domain.</t>
   	  	
   	  	<t>olsrv2TcHopLimit - defines the hop limit for TC messages. If set too low, messages will not be forwarded beyond the defined scope, and thus routers further away from the message originator will not be able to construct appropriate topology graphs.</t>
   	  	
   	  	<t>olsrv2OHoldTime, olsrv2THoldTime, olsrv2AHoldTime, olsrv2RxHoldTime, olsrv2PHoldTime, olsrv2FHoldTime -  define hold times for tuples of different Information Bases of OLSRv2. If set too low, information will expire quickly, and may this harm a correct operation of the routing protocol.</t>
   	  	
   	  	<t>olsrv2Willingness - defines the willingness of this router to become MPR. If this is set to WILL_NEVER (0), the managed router will not forward any TC messages, nor accept a selection to become MPR by neighboring routers. If set to WILL_ALWAYS (15), the router will be preferred by neighbors during MPR selection, and may thus attract more traffic.</t>
   	  	
   	  	<t>olsrv2TpMaxJitter, olsrv2TtMaxJitter, olsrv2FMaxJitter - define jitter values for TC message transmission and forwarding. If set too low, control traffic may get lost if the channel is lossy. </t>

	
	 </list></t>

    <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a  MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or  vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
	 
	<list style="symbols">
      <t>olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - The contains information on the topology of the MANET, specifically the IP address of the routers in the MANET (as identified by olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr and olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr objects).  This information provides an adversary broad information on the members of the MANET, located within this single table. This information can be use to expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without having to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr is the index into the table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'. However, this information can be exposed using SNMP operations.</t>
    </list></t>


   <t>MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of the communications network and to protect sensitive information related to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.</t>

   <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.</t>

   <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>, Section 8, including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

   <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
