Internet-Draft         APN and ATTACH_Type Options          October 2008


Abstract

   Cellular data networks which are based on 3GPP standards use the
   concept of Access Point Name.  A mobile node which attaches via a
   3GPP access network indicates thru layer 2 signaling the access point
   name to which connectivity is desired.  This document specifies a
   DHCP option which enables the mobile node to request the access point
   name in DHCP messages.  A mobile node whose mobility is managed by
   the network using Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol may perform a handover
   from one access technology to another.  A DHCP option which enables
   the host to indicate if the attachment via the new interface is a
   handover or another connction is also specified.

2.  Introduction

   Cellular data networks which are based on 3GPP standards [REF 3GPP
   23.060], i.e GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) define the concept
   of an Access Point Name (APN).  The APN is an FQDN and identifies a
   specific gateway in the core network.  Operators choose to offer
   different types of services via specific gateways.  For example
   gateway 1 identified by APN1 offers Internet connectivity while
   gateway 2 identified by APN2 offers multi-media messaging service
   (MMS).  A mobile node which attaches via a 3GPP access network
   indicates the gateway to which it needs connectivity by transmitting
   the APN parameter in layer 2 signaling.  The APN information enables
   the access network to establish a tunnel to the appropriate gateway
   in the core.  The mobile node chooses the APN based on the
   application in use.  The application is configured to connect to the
   gateway through which the operator provides the service.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility protocol.  A
   host which is attached to a Proxy MIP6 (PMIP6) domain through an
   access network of type X may initiate a handover when it attaches to
   another access network of type Y. In order to ensure that the Local
   Mobility Agent (LMA) in the PMIP6 domain assigns the host the same
   prefix/address, the Mobility access gateway (MAG) in the network to
   which the host performs the handover to (i.e type y) needs to
   indicate that it is a handover.  In the absence of any context
   transfer from the previous MAG to the new MAG, the host has to
   provide this information to the MAG.  The host can indicate that the
   network attachment to the access network of type Y is a handover.

   This document specifies DHCP options which enable the host to
   indicate the APN to which connectivity is desired and the attach-type
   to be used in the case of Proxy MIP6 inter-access type handovers.

3.  Terminology

   This document refers to [RFC5213].  The term Access Point Name is
   defined in 3GPP [TS 23.003] in section 9.1.  It is also defined below
   as per the 3GPP definition.

   Access Point Name:
        In the GPRS backbone, an Access Point Name (APN) is a reference
        to a GGSN (Gateway GPRS Serving Node).

4.  DHCP options for APN and Attach-type

   The use of APN has been limited to 3GPP networks.  In the case of
   3GPP accesses such as GERAN, UMTS and HSPA, a layer 2 mechanism is
   specified which enables the mobile node to indicate the APN parameter
   to the access network, and thereby being assigned a specific GGSN in
   the core.  Recent developments now allow non-3GPP accesses such as
   HRPD and WiMAX to also connect to a 3GPP core network.  These access
   types do not have a specific mechanism by which a mobile node can
   indicate the APN to establish a connection with.  Specifying this
   capability as a DHCP option enables the mobile node to indicate the
   APN to establish a connection with at the time of network entry.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] does not require any changes on the host
   in order to support mobility.  A Proxy MIP6 domain can span multiple
   access networks of different technologies.  An MN which is attached
   via an interface (I1) to a PMIP6 domain may attach via another
   interface (I2).  If the MN wants the sessions which are currently
   served by interface I1 to be moved to interface I2, it needs to
   indicate that the new network attachment is of type handover.  The MN
   can indicate the attach type via a DHCP option during network entry
   and the MAG in the PMIP6 domain can use this information in the
   signaling to the LMA appropriately.

5.  APN Information option

   This option enables the host to indicate the access point name to
   which the connection needs to be established with.  The host (DHCP
   client) includes this option in the DHCP Request message sent to the
   access gateway/NAS (Network Access Server) which acts as the DHCP
   server or relay.

6.  Attach Type Information option

   This option enables the host to indicate if the attach to the network
   is to be interpreted as a handover.  This is applicable in the case
   the host is attaching to a PMIP6 domain.  The host (DHCP client)
   includes the Attach type option in the DHCP Request message sent to
   the Access Router/Mobility Access Gateway which acts as a DHCP relay
   or in some cases a DHCP server.  The MAG uses the Attach type
   information option to construct the signaling message to the Local
   Mobility Agent as per [RFC5213] .

7.  Option Usage

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCP options follow the
   rules specified for DHCP options in [RFC3315].

8.  Mobile Node/host behavior

   A mobile node includes the APN option when attaching to an access
   network which is served by a 3GPP core.  The option is not required
   for access technologies which have layer 2 mechanisms.  The MN/host
   is aware of the access type through which it is connecting and hence
   can make the decision to include the APN option.  The MN includes the
   APN Option in the DHCP Request message sent to the access router/NAS.

   The MN is aware when it attaches via another access type if it is to
   be treated as a handover.  If the MN prefers to move the sessions
   from the previous interface to the new interface it needs to indicate
   via the Attach_Type that it is a handover.  The MN includes the
   Attach_type option in the DHCP request message.

9.  Access Router/NAS/DHCP relay agent behavior

   An access router/gateway which also acts as a NAS and includes either
   a DHCP relay function or in some cases acts as a DHCP server receives
   the DHCP request message which includes either the APN option or the
   Attach_type option or both.  The gateway uses the APN information
   from the APN option to establish a bi-directional tunnel with the
   appropriate gateway in the 3GPP core network.  The NAS/gateway
   resolves the IP address of the gateway in the core from the APN via
   DNS.

   The NAS/access gateway which receives the attach_type option from the
   MN in the DHCP Request relays this information to the PMIP6 MAG
   function.  The MAG uses the attach_type information to set the flags
   in the proxy binding update (PBU) sent to the Local Mobiliity agent
   (LMA).
