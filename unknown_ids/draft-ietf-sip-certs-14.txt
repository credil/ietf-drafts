Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                        draft-ietf-sip-certs-14

Abstract

   This draft defines a Credential Service that allows Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP event
   package to discover the certificates of other users.  This mechanism
   allows user agents that want to contact a given Address-of-Record
   (AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the
   Credential Service, which returns an authenticated response
   containing that certificate.  The Credential Service also allows
   users to store and retrieve their own certificates and private keys.

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3261], as amended by [RFC3853], provides a mechanism for end-to-
   end encryption and integrity using S/MIME [RFC3851].  Several
   security properties of [RFC3261] depend on S/MIME, and yet it has not
   been widely deployed.  One reason is the complexity of providing a
   reasonable certificate distribution infrastructure.  This
   specification proposes a way to address discovery, retrieval, and
   management of certificates for SIP deployments.  Combined with the
   SIP Identity [RFC4474] specification, this specification allows users
   to have certificates that are not signed by any well known
   certification authority while still strongly binding the user's
   identity to the certificate.

   In addition, this specification provides a mechanism that allows SIP
   User Agents such as IP phones to enroll and get their credentials
   without any more configuration information than they commonly have
   today.  The end user expends no extra effort.


2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Certificate:  A PKIX [RFC5280] style certificate containing a public
      key and a list of identities in the SubjectAltName that are bound
      to this key.  The certificates discussed in this draft are
      generally self-signed and use the mechanisms in the SIP Identity
      [RFC4474] specification to vouch for their validity.  Certificates
      that are signed by a certification authority can also be used with
      all the mechanisms in this draft, however, they need not be
      validated by the receiver (although the receiver can validate them
      for extra assurance; see Section 10.3.1).
   Credential:  For this document, credential means the combination of a
      certificate and the associated private key.
   Password Phrase:  A password used to encrypt and decrypt a PKCS#8
      private key.


3.  Overview

   The general approach is to provide a new SIP service referred to as a
   "credential service" that allows SIP User Agents (UAs) to subscribe
   to other users' certificates using a new SIP event package [RFC3265].
   The certificate is delivered to the subscribing UA in a corresponding
   SIP NOTIFY request.  An Authentication Service as described in the

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   SIP Identity [RFC4474] specification can be used to vouch for the
   identity of the sender of the certificate by using the sender's proxy
   domain certificate to sign the NOTIFY request.  The Authentication
   Service is vouching that the sender is allowed to populate the SIP
   From header field value.  The sender of the message is vouching that
   this is an appropriate certificate for the user identified in the SIP
   from header field value.  The credential service can manage public
   certificates as well as the user's private keys.  Users can update
   their credentials, as stored on the credential service, using a SIP
   PUBLISH [RFC3903] request.  The UA authenticates to the credential
   service using a shared secret when a UA is updating a credential.
   Typically the shared secret will be the same one that is used by the
   UA to authenticate a REGISTER request with the Registrar for the
   domain (usually with SIP Digest Authentication).

   The following figure shows Bob publishing his credentials from one of
   his User Agents (e.g. his laptop software client), retrieving his
   credentials from another of his User Agents (e.g. his mobile phone),
   and then Alice retrieving Bob's certificate and sending a message to
   Bob. SIP 200-class responses are omitted from the diagram to make the
   figure easier to understand.

   Bob's UA (Bob2) does a TLS [RFC5246] handshake with the credential
   server to authenticate that the UA is connected to the correct
   credential server.  Then Bob's UA publishes his newly created or
   updated credentials.  The credential server digest challenges the UA
   to authenticate that the UA knows Bob's shared secret.  Once the UA
   is authenticated, the credential server stores Bob's credentials.

   Another of Bob's User Agents (Bob1) wants to fetch its current
   credentials.  It does a TLS [RFC5246] handshake with the credential
   server to authenticate that the UA is connected to the correct
   credential server.  Then Bob's UA subscribes for the credentials.
   The credential server digest challenges the UA to authenticate that
   the UA knows Bob's shared secret.  Once the UA is authenticated, the

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   credential server sends a NOTIFY that contains Bob's credentials.
   The private key portion of the credential may have been encrypted
   with a secret that only Bob's UA (and not the credential server)
   knows.  In this case, once Bob's UA decrypts the private key it will
   be ready to go.  Typically Bob's UA would do this when it first
   registered on the network.

   Some time later Alice decides that she wishes to discover Bob's
   certificate so that she can send him an encrypted message or so that
   she can verify the signature on a message from Bob. Alice's UA sends
   a SUBSCRIBE message to Bob's AOR.  The proxy in Bob's domain routes
   this to the credential server via an "authentication service" as
   defined in [RFC4474].  The credential server returns a NOTIFY that
   contains Bob's public certificate in the body.  This is routed
   through an authentication service that signs that this message really
   can validly claim to be from the AOR "sip:bob@example.com".  Alice's
   UA receives the certificate and can use it to encrypt a message to
   Bob.

   It is critical to understand that the only way that Alice can trust
   that the certificate really is the one for Bob and that the NOTIFY
   has not been spoofed is for Alice to check that the Identity
   [RFC4474] header field value is correct.

   The mechanism described in this document works for both self-signed
   certificates and certificates signed by well known certification
   authorities.  In order to deploy certificates signed by well known
   certification authorities, certification authorities would have to
   support adding SIP URIs to the SubjectAltName of the certificates
   they generate.  This is something which has been rarely implemented
   by commercial certification authorities.  However, most UAs would
   only use self-signed certificates and would use an Authentication
   Service as described in [RFC4474] to provide a strong binding of an
   AOR to the certificates.

   The mechanisms described in this draft allow for three different
   styles of deployment:

   1.  Deployments where the credential server only stores certificates
       and does not store any private key information.  If the
       deployment had users with multiple devices, some other scheme
       (perhaps even manual provisioning) would be used to get the right
       private keys onto all the devices that a user uses.
   2.  Deployments where the credential server stores certificates and
       also stores an encrypted version of the private keys.  The
       credential server would not know or need the password phrase for
       decrypting the private key.  The credential server would help
       move the private keys between devices but the user would need to

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


       enter a password phrase on each device to allow that device to
       decrypt (and encrypt) the private key information.
   3.  Deployments where the credential server generates and stores the
       certificates and private keys.  Deployments such as these may not
       use password phrases.  Consequently, the private keys are not
       encrypted inside the PKCS#8 objects.  This style of deployment
       would often have the credential server, instead of the devices,
       create the credentials.


4.  UA Behavior with Certificates

   When a User Agent wishes to discover some other user's certificate it
   subscribes to the "certificate" SIP event package as described in
   Section 6 to get the certificate.  While the subscription is active,
   if the certificate is updated, the Subscriber will receive the
   updated certificate in a notification.

   The Subscriber needs to decide how long it is willing to trust that
   the certificate it receives is still valid.  If the certificate is
   revoked before it expires, the Notifier will send a notification with
   an empty body to indicate that the certificate is no longer valid.
   If the certificate is renewed before it expires, the Notifier will
   send a notification with a body containing the new certificate.  Note
   that the Subscriber might not receive the notification if an attacker
   blocks this traffic.  The amount of time that the Subscriber caches a
   certificate SHOULD be configurable.  A default of one day is
   RECOMMENDED.

   Note that the actual duration of the subscription is unrelated to the
   caching time or validity time of the corresponding certificate.
   Allowing subscriptions to persist after a certificate is no longer
   valid ensures that Subscribers receive the replacement certificate in
   a timely fashion.  The Notifier could return an immediate
   notification with the certificate in response to subscribe and then
   immediately terminate subscription, setting the reason parameter to
   "probation".  The Subscriber will have to periodically poll the
   Notifier to verify validity of the certificate.

   If the UA uses a cached certificate in a request and receives a 437
   (Unsupported Certificate) response, it SHOULD remove the certificate
   it used from the cache, attempt to fetch the certificate again.  If
   the certificate is changed, then the UA SHOULD retry the original
   request again with the new certificate.  This situation usually
   indicates that the certificate was recently updated, and that the
   Subscriber has not received a corresponding notification.  If the
   certificate fetched is the same as the one that was previously in the
   cache, then the UA SHOULD NOT try the request again.  This situation

   can happened when the request was retargeted to a different user than
   the original request.  The 437 response is defined in [RFC4474].

      Note: A UA that has a presence list MAY want to subscribe to the
      certificates of all the presentities in the list when the UA
      subscribes to their presence, so that when the user wishes to
      contact a presentity, the UA will already have the appropriate
      certificate.  Future specifications might consider the possibility
      of retrieving the certificates along with the presence documents.

   The details of how a UA deals with receiving encrypted messages is
   outside the scope of this specification.  It is worth noting that if
   Charlie's UAS receives a request that is encrypted to Bob, it would
   be valid and legal for that UA to send a 302 redirecting the call to
   Bob.


5.  UA Behavior with Credentials

   UAs discover their own credentials by subscribing to their AOR with
   an event type of credential as described in Section 7.  After a UA
   registers, it SHOULD retrieve its credentials by subscribing to them
   as described in Section 6.5.

   When a UA discovers its credential, the private key information might
   be encrypted with a password phrase.  The UA SHOULD request that the
   user enter the password phrase on the device, and the UA MAY cache
   this password phrase for future use.

   There are several different cases in which a UA should generate a new
   credential:
   o  If the UA receives a NOTIFY with no body for the credential
      package.
   o  If the certificate has expired.
   o  If the certificate's notAfter date is within the next 600 seconds,
      the UA SHOULD attempt to create replacement credentials.  The UA
      does this by waiting a random amount of time between 0 and 300
      seconds.  If no new credentials have been received in that time,
      the UA creates new credentials to replace the expiring ones and
      sends them in a PUBLISH request following the rules for modifying

   Credentials are created by creating a new key pair which will require
   appropriate randomness as described in [RFC4086] and then creating a
   certificate as described in Section 10.6.  The UA MAY encrypt the

   in Section 10.5.  Next, the UA updates the user's credential by
   sending a PUBLISH [RFC3903] request with the credentials or just the
   certificate as described in Section 7.8.

   If a UA wishes to revoke the existing certificate without publishing
   a new one, it MUST send a PUBLISH with an empty body to the
   credential server.


6.  Event Package Formal Definition for "certificate"

6.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in [RFC3265].
   The event-package token name for this package is:

          certificate

6.2.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   This package does not define any SUBSCRIBE bodies.

6.3.  Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package can range from no time to weeks.
   Subscriptions in days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.  The
   default subscription duration for this event package is one day.

   The credential service is encouraged to keep the subscriptions active
   for AORs that are communicating frequently, but the credential
   service MAY terminate the subscription at any point in time.

6.4.  NOTIFY Bodies

   The body of a NOTIFY request for this package MUST either be empty or
   contain an application/pkix-cert body (as defined in [RFC2585]) that
   contains the certificate, unless an Accept header field has
   negotiated some other type.  The Content-Disposition MUST be set to
   "signal" as defined in [RFC3204].

   A future extension MAY define other NOTIFY bodies.  If no "Accept"
   header field is present in the SUBSCRIBE, the body type defined in
   this document MUST be assumed.

   Implementations which generate large notifications are reminded to
   follow the message size restrictions for unreliable transports
   articulated in Section 18.1.1 of SIP.

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


6.5.  Subscriber Generation of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   A UA discovers a certificate by sending a SUBSCRIBE request with an
   event type of "certificate" to the AOR for which a certificate is
   desired.  In general, the UA stays subscribed to the certificate for
   as long as it plans to use and cache the certificate, so that the UA
   can be notified about changes or revocations to the certificate.

   Subscriber User Agents will typically subscribe to certificate
   information for a period of hours or days, and automatically attempt
   to re-subscribe just before the subscription is completely expired.

   When a user de-registers from a device (logoff, power down of a
   mobile device, etc.), subscribers SHOULD unsubscribe by sending a
   SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires header field of zero.

6.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   When a SIP credential server receives a SUBSCRIBE request with the
   certificate event-type, it is not necessary to authenticate the
   subscription request.  The Notifier MAY limit the duration of the
   subscription to an administrator-defined period of time.  The
   duration of the subscription does not correspond in any way to the
   period for which the certificate will be valid.

   When the credential server receives a SUBSCRIBE request for a
   certificate, it first checks to see if it has credentials for the
   requested URI.  If it does not have a certificate, it returns a
   NOTIFY request with an empty message body.

6.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   Immediately after a subscription is accepted, the Notifier MUST send
   a NOTIFY with the current certificate, or an empty body if no
   certificate is available for the target user.  In either case it
   forms a NOTIFY with the From header field value set to the value of
   the To header field in the SUBSCRIBE request.  This server sending
   the NOTIFY needs either to implement an Authentication Service (as
   described in SIP Identity [RFC4474]) or else the server needs to be
   set up such that the NOTIFY request will be sent through an
   Authentication Service.  Sending the NOTIFY request through the
   Authentication Service requires the SUBSCRIBE request to have been
   routed through the Authentication Service, since the NOTIFY is sent
   within the dialog formed by the subscription.

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


6.8.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   The resulting NOTIFY will contain an application/pkix-cert body that
   contains the requested certificate.  The UA MUST follow the
   procedures in Section 10.3 to decide if the received certificate can
   be used.  The UA needs to cache this certificate for future use.  The
   maximum length of time it should be cached for is discussed in
   Section 10.1.  The certificate MUST be removed from the cache if the
   certificate has been revoked (if a NOTIFY with an empty body is
   received), or if it is updated by a subsequent NOTIFY.  The UA MUST
   check that the NOTIFY is correctly signed by an Authentication
   Service as described in [RFC4474].  If the identity asserted by the
   Authentication Service does not match the AOR that the UA subscribed
   to, the certificate in the NOTIFY is discarded and MUST NOT be used.

6.9.  Handling of Forked Requests

   This event package does not permit forked requests.  At most one
   subscription to this event type is permitted per resource.

6.10.  Rate of Notifications

   Notifiers SHOULD NOT generate NOTIFY requests more frequently than
   once per minute.

6.11.  State Agents and Lists

   The credential server described in this section which serves
   certificates is a state agent as defined in [RFC3265] and
   implementations of the credential server MUST be implemented as a
   state agent.

   Implementers MUST NOT use the event list extension [RFC4662] with
   this event type.  It is not possible to make such an approach work,
   because the Authentication service would have to simultaneously
   assert several different identities.

6.12.  Behavior of a Proxy Server

   There are no additional requirements on a SIP Proxy, other than to
   transparently forward the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests as required
   in SIP.  This specification describes the Proxy, Authentication
   service, and credential service as three separate services, but it is
   certainly possible to build a single SIP network element that
   performs all of these services at the same time.

7.  Event Package Formal Definition for "credential"

7.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in [RFC3265].
   The event-package token name for this package is:

         credential

7.2.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   This package does not define any SUBSCRIBE bodies.

7.3.  Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package can range from hours to one week.
   Subscriptions in days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.  The
   default subscription duration for this event package is one day.

   The credential service SHOULD keep subscriptions active for UAs that
   are currently registered.

7.4.  NOTIFY Bodies

   An implementation compliant to this specification MUST support the
   multipart/mixed type (see [RFC2046]).  This allows a notification to
   contain multiple resource documents including at a minimum the
   application/pkix-cert body with the certificate and an application/
   pkcs8 body that has the associated private key information for the
   certificate.  The application/pkcs8 media type is defined in
   [I-D.turner-asymmetrickeyformat].

   The absence of an Accept header in the SUBSCRIBE indicates support
   for multipart/mixed and the content types application/pkix-cert and
   application/pkcs8.  If an Accept header is present, these types MUST
   be included, in additional to any other types supported by the
   client.

   The application/pkix-cert body is a DER encoded X.509v3 certificate
   [RFC2585].  The application/pkcs8 body contains a DER-encoded
   [I-D.turner-asymmetrickeyformat] object that contains the private
   key.  The PKCS#8 objects MUST be of type PrivateKeyInfo.  The
   integrity and confidentiality of the PKCS#8 objects is provided by
   the TLS transport.  The transport encoding of all the MIME bodies is
   binary.

7.5.  Subscriber Generation of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   A Subscriber User Agent will subscribe to its credential information
   for a period of hours or days and will automatically attempt to re-
   subscribe before the subscription has completely expired.

   The Subscriber SHOULD subscribe to its credentials whenever a new
   user becomes associated with the device (a new login).  The
   subscriber SHOULD also renew its subscription immediately after a
   reboot, or when the subscriber's network connectivity has just been
   re-established.

   The UA needs to authenticate with the credential service for these
   operations.  The UA MUST use TLS to directly connect to the server
   acting as the credential service or to a server that is authoritative
   for the domain of the credential service.  The UA MUST NOT connect
   through an intermediate proxy to the credential service.  The UA may
   be configured with a specific name for the credential service;
   otherwise normal SIP routing is used.  As described in RFC 3261, the
   TLS connection needs to present a certificate that matches the
   expected name of the server to which the connection was formed, so
   that the UA knows it is talking to the correct server.  Failing to do
   this may result in the UA publishing its private key information to
   an attacker.  The credential service will authenticate the UA using
   the usual SIP Digest mechanism, so the UA can expect to receive a SIP
   challenge to the SUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH requests.

7.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   When a credential service receives a SUBSCRIBE for a credential, the
   credential service has to authenticate and authorize the UA and
   validate that adequate transport security is being used.  Only a UA
   that can authenticate as being able to register as the AOR is
   authorized to receive the credentials for that AOR.  The Credential
   Service MUST digest challenge the UA to authenticate the UA and then
   decide if it is authorized to receive the credentials.  If
   authentication is successful, the Notifier MAY limit the duration of
   the subscription to an administrator-defined period of time.  The
   duration of the subscription MUST NOT be larger than the length of
   time for which the certificate is still valid.  The Expires header
   field SHOULD be set so that it is not longer than the notAfter date
   in the certificate.

7.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   Once the UA has authenticated with the credential service and the
   subscription is accepted, the credential service MUST immediately
   send a Notify request.  The Authentication Service is applied to this



Jennings & Fischl        Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   NOTIFY request in the same way as the certificate subscriptions.  If
   the credential is revoked, the credential service MUST terminate any
   current subscriptions and force the UA to re-authenticate by sending
   a NOTIFY with its Subscription-State header field set to "terminated"
   and a reason parameter of "deactivated".  (This causes a Subscriber
   to retry the subscription immediately.)  This is so that if a secret
   for retrieving the credentials gets compromised, the rogue UA will
   not continue to receive credentials after the compromised secret has
   been changed.

   Any time the credentials for this URI change, the credential service
   MUST send a new NOTIFY to any active subscriptions with the new
   credentials.

   The notification MUST be sent over TLS so that it is integrity
   protected and the TLS needs to be directly connected between the UA
   and the credential service with no intermediaries.

7.8.  Generation of PUBLISH Requests

   A user agent SHOULD be configurable to control whether it publishes
   the credential for a user or just the user's certificate.

   When publishing just a certificate, the body contains an application/
   pkix-cert.  When publishing a credential, the body contains a
   multipart/mixed containing both an application/pkix-cert and an
   application/pkcs8 body.

   When the UA sends the PUBLISH [RFC3903] request, it needs to do the
   following:
   o  The UA MUST use TLS to directly connect to the server acting as
      the credential service or to a server that is authoritative for
      the domain of the credential service.  The UA MUST NOT connect
      through an intermediate proxy to the credential service.
   o  The Expires header field value in the PUBLISH request SHOULD be
      set to match the time for which the certificate is valid.
   o  If the certificate includes Basic Constraints, it SHOULD set the
      cA flag to false.

7.9.  Notifier Processing of PUBLISH Requests

   When the credential service receives a PUBLISH to update credentials,
   it MUST authenticate and authorize this request the same way as for
   subscriptions for credentials.  If the authorization succeeds, then
   the credential service MUST perform the following check on the
   certificate:





Jennings & Fischl        Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   o  The notBefore validity time MUST NOT be in the future.
   o  The notAfter validity time MUST be in the future.
   o  If a cA Basic Constraint flag is set in the certificate, it is set
      to false.
   If all of these succeed, the credential service updates the
   credential for this URI, processes all the active certificates and
   credential subscriptions to this URI, and generates a NOTIFY request
   with the new credential or certificate.  Note the SubjectAltName
   SHOULD NOT be checked as that would restrict which certificates could
   be used and offers no additional security guarantees.

   If the Subscriber submits a PUBLISH request with no body and
   Expires=0, this revokes the current credentials.  Watchers of these
   credentials will receive update with no body indicating that they
   MUST stop any previously stored credentials.  Note that subscriptions
   to the certificate package are NOT terminated; each subscriber to the
   certificate package receives a notification with an empty body.

7.10.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   When the UA receives a valid NOTIFY request, it should replace its
   existing credentials with the new received ones.  If the UA cannot
   decrypt the PKCS#8 object, it MUST send a 437 (Unsupported
   Certificate) response.  Later if the user provides a new password
   phrase for the private key, the UA can subscribe to the credentials
   again and attempt to decrypt with the new password phrase.

7.11.  Handling of Forked Requests

   This event package does not permit forked requests.

7.12.  Rate of Notifications

   Notifiers SHOULD NOT generate NOTIFY requests more frequently than
   once per minute.

7.13.  State Agents and Lists

   The credential server described in this section which serves
   credentials is a state agent and implementations of the credential
   server MUST be implemented as a state agent.

   Implementers MUST NOT use the event list extension [RFC4662] with
   this event type.

7.14.  Behavior of a Proxy Server

   The behavior is identical to behavior described for certificate
   subscriptions described in Section 6.12.


8.  Identity Signatures

   The [RFC4474] Authentication service defined an signature algorithm
   based on SHA-1 called rsa-sha1.  This specification adds an signature
   algorithm that is roughly the same but based on SHA-256 and called
   rsa-sha256.

   When using the rsa-sha256 algorithm, the signature MUST be computed
   in exactly the same way as described in section 9 of [RFC4474] with
   the exception that instead of using sha1WithRSAEncryption, the
   computation is done using sha256WithRSAEncryption as described in
   [RFC5754].

   Implementations of this specification MUST implement both rsa-sha1
   and rsa-sha256.  The IANA registration for rsa-sha256 is defined in
   Section 11.3.


9.  Examples

   In all these examples, large parts of the messages are omitted to
   highlight what is relevant to this draft.  The lines in the examples
   that are prefixed by $ represent encrypted blocks of data.

9.1.  Encrypted Page Mode IM Message

   In this example, Alice sends Bob an encrypted page mode instant
   message.  Alice does not already have Bob's public key from previous
   communications, so she fetches Bob's public key from Bob's credential
   service:

   SUBSCRIBE sip:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0
   ...
   Event: certificate

   The credential service responds with the certificate in a NOTIFY.

   ....
   Event: certificate
   Content-Type: application/pkix-cert
   Content-Disposition: signal

   < certificate data >

   Next, Alice sends a SIP MESSAGE message to Bob and can encrypt the
   body using Bob's public key as shown below.

    MESSAGE sip:bob@biloxi.example.com SIP/2.0
    ...
    Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime
    Content-Disposition: render

    $ Content-Type: text/plain
    $
    $ < encrypted version of "Hello" >

9.2.  Setting and Retrieving UA Credentials

   When Alice's UA wishes to publish Alice's certificate and private key
   to the credential service, it sends a PUBLISH request like the one
   below.  This must be sent over a TLS connection directly to the
   domain of the credential service.  The credential service presents a
   certificate where the SubjectAltName contains an entry that matches
   the domain name in the request line of the PUBLISH request and digest
   challenges the request to authenticate her.

    < Public certificate for Alice >
    --boundary
    Content-ID: 456
    Content-Type: application/pkcs8

    < Private Key for Alice >
    --boundary

   If one of Alice's UAs subscribes to the credential event, the UA will
   be digest challenged, and the NOTIFY will include a body similar to
   the one in the PUBLISH section above.


10.  Security Considerations

   The high level message flow from a security point of view is
   summarized in the following figure.  The 200 responses are removed
   from the figure as they do not have much to do with the overall
   security.

   In this figure, authC refers to authentication and authZ refers to
   authorization.

   When the UA, labeled Bob, first created a credential for Bob, it
   would store this on the credential server.  The UA authenticated the
   Server using the certificates from the TLS handshake.  The Server
   authenticated the UA using a digest style challenge with a shared
   secret.

   The UA, labeled Bob, wishes to request its credentials from the
   server.  First it forms a TLS connection to the Server, which
   provides integrity and privacy protection and also authenticates the
   server to Bob's UA.  Next the UA requests its credentials using a
   SUBSCRIBE request.  The Server digest challenges this to authenticate
   Bob's UA.  The server and Bob's UA have a shared secret that is used
   for this.  If the authentication is successful, the server sends the
   credentials to Bob's UA.  The private key in the credentials may have
   been encrypted using a shared secret that the server does not know.

   A similar process would be used for Bob's UA to publish new
   credentials to the server.  Bob's UA would send a PUBLISH request
   containing the new credentials.  When this happened, all the other



Jennings & Fischl        Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   UAs that were subscribed to Bob's credentials would receive a NOTIFY
   with the new credentials.

   Alice wishes to find Bob's certificate and sends a SUBSCRIBE to the
   server.  The server sends the response in a NOTIFY.  This does not
   need to be sent over a privacy or integrity protected channel, as the
   Authentication service described in [RFC4474] provides integrity
   protection of this information and signs it with the certificate for
   the domain.

   This whole scheme is highly dependent on trusting the operators of
   the credential service and trusting that the credential service will
   not be compromised.  The security of all the users will be
   compromised if the credential service is compromised.

      Note: There has been significant discussion of the topic of
      avoiding deployments in which the credential servers store the
      private keys, even in some encrypted form that the credential
      server does not know how to decrypt.  Various schemes were
      considered to avoid this but they all result in either moving the
      problem to some other server, which does not seem to make the
      problem any better, or having a different credential for each
      device.  For some deployments where each user has only one device
      this is fine but for deployments with multiple devices, it would
      require that when Alice went to contact Bob, Alice would have to
      provide messages encrypted for all of Bob's devices.  The sipping
      working group did consider this architecture and decided it was
      not appropriate due both to the information it revealed about the
      devices and users and the amount of signaling required to make it
      work.

   This specification requires that TLS be used for the SIP
   communications to place and retrieve a UA's private key.  This
   provides security in two ways:
   1.  Confidentiality is provided for the digest authentication
       exchange, thus protecting it from dictionary attacks.
   2.  Confidentiality is provided for the private key, thus protecting
       it from being exposed to passive attackers.
   In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, TLS clients MUST check
   that the SubjectAltName of the certificate for the server they
   connected to exactly matches the server they were trying to connect
   to.  The connection must be directly connected to the correct server
   or any intermediaries in the TLS path can compromise the certificate
   and instead provide a certificate for which the attacker knows the
   private key.  This may lead the UA that relies on this compromised
   certificate to lose confidential information.  Failing to use TLS or
   selecting a poor cipher suite (such as NULL encryption) may result in
   credentials, including private keys, being sent unencrypted over the

   network and will render the whole system useless.

   The correct checking of chained certificates as specified in TLS
   [RFC5246] is critical for the client to authenticate the server.  If
   the client does not authenticate that it is talking to the correct
   credential service, a man in the middle attack is possible.

10.1.  Certificate Revocation

   If a particular credential needs to be revoked, the new credential is
   simply published to the credential service.  Every device with a copy
   of the old credential or certificate in its cache will have a
   subscription and will rapidly (order of seconds) be notified and
   replace its cache.  Clients that are not subscribed will subscribe
   when they next need to use the certificate and will get the new
   certificate.

   It is possible that an attacker could mount a DOS attack such that
   the UA that had cached a certificate did not receive the NOTIFY with
   its revocation.  To protect against this attack, the UA needs to
   limit how long it caches certificates.  After this time, the UA would
   invalidate the cached information even though no NOTIFY had ever been
   received due to the attacker blocking it.

   The duration of this cached information is in some ways similar to a
   device deciding how often to check a CRL list.  For many
   applications, a default time of 1 day is suggested, but for some
   applications it may be desirable to set the time to zero so that no
   certificates are cached at all and the credential is checked for
   validity every time the certificate is used.

   The UA MUST NOT cache the certificates for a period longer than that
   of the subscription duration.  This is to avoid the UA using invalid
   cached credentials when the notifier of the new credentials has been
   prevented from updating the UA.

10.2.  Certificate Replacement

   The UAs in the system replace the certificates close to the time that
   the certificates would expire.  If a UA has used the same key pair to
   encrypt a very large volume of traffic, the UA MAY choose to replace
   the credential with a new one before the normal expiration.

10.3.  Trusting the Identity of a Certificate

   When a UA wishes to discover the certificate for
   sip:alice@example.com, the UA subscribes to the certificate for
   alice@example.com and receives a certificate in the body of a SIP

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   NOTIFY request.  The term original URI is used to describe the URI
   that was in the To header field value of the SUBSCRIBE request.  So
   in this case the original URI would be sip:alice@example.com.

   If the certificate is signed by a trusted certification authority,
   and one of the names in the SubjectAltName matches the original URI,
   then this certificate MAY be used but only for exactly the original
   URI and not for other identities found in the SubjectAltName.
   Otherwise, there are several steps the UA MUST perform before using
   this certificate.
   o  The From header field in the NOTIFY request MUST match the
      original URI that was subscribed to.
   o  The UA MUST check the Identity header field as described in the
      Identity [RFC4474] specification to validate that bodies have not
      been tampered with and that an Authentication Service has
      validated this From header field.
   o  The UA MUST check the validity time of the certificate and stop
      using the certificate if it is invalid.  (Implementations are
      reminded to verify both the notBefore and notAfter validity
      times.)
   o  The certificate MAY have several names in the SubjectAltName but
      the UA MUST only use this certificate when it needs the
      certificate for the identity asserted by the Authentication
      Service in the NOTIFY.  This means that the certificate should
      only be indexed in the certificate cache by the AOR that the
      Authentication Service asserted and not by the value of all the
      identities found in the SubjectAltName list.
   These steps result in a chain of bindings that result in a trusted
   binding between the original AOR that was subscribed to and a public
   key.  The original AOR is forced to match the From.  The
   Authentication Service validates that this request did come from the
   identity claimed in the From header field value and that the bodies
   in the request that carry the certificate have not been tampered
   with.  The certificate in the body contains the public key for the
   identity.  Only the UA that can authenticate as this AOR, or devices
   with access to the private key of the domain, can tamper with this
   body.  This stops other users from being able to provide a false
   public key.  This chain of assertion from original URI, to From, to
   body, to public key is critical to the security of the mechanism
   described in this specification.  If any of the steps above are not
   followed, this chain of security will be broken and the system will
   not work.

10.3.1.  Extra Assurance

   Although the certificates used with this document need not be
   validatable to a trust anchor via PKIX [RFC5280] procedures,
   certificates which can be validated may also be distributed via this



Jennings & Fischl        Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   mechanism.  Such certificates potentially offer an additional level
   of security because they can be used with the secure (and partially
   isolated) certification authority user verification and key issuance
   toolset, rather than depending on the security of generic SIP
   implementations.

   When a relying party receives a certificate which is not self-signed,
   it MAY attempt to validate it using the rules in Section 6 of
   [RFC5280].  If the certificate validates successfully and the names
   correctly match the user's AOR (see Section 10.6), then the
   implementation SHOULD provide some indication that the certificate
   has been validated with an external authority.  In general, failure
   to validate a certificate via this mechanism SHOULD NOT be used as a
   reason to reject the certificate.  However, if the certificate is
   revoked, then the implementation SHOULD reject it.

10.4.  SACRED Framework

   This specification includes a mechanism that allows end users to
   share the same credentials across different end-user devices.  This
   mechanism is based on the one presented in the SACRED Framework
   [RFC3760].  While this mechanism is fully described in this document,
   the requirements and background are more thoroughly discussed in
   [RFC3760].

   Specifically, Section 7.5, Section 7.6 and Section 7.9 follow the
   cTLS architecture described in section 4.2.2 of [RFC3760].  The
   client authenticates the server using the server's TLS certificate.
   The server authenticates the client using a SIP digest transaction
   inside the TLS session.  The TLS sessions form a strong session key
   that is used to protect the credentials being exchanged.

10.5.  Crypto Profiles

   Credential Services SHOULD implement the server name indication
   extensions in [RFC4366].  As specified in [RFC5246], Credential
   Services MUST support the TLS cipher suite
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  In addition, they MUST support the TLS
   cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 as specified in
   [RFC5246].  If additional cipher suites are supported, then
   implementations MUST NOT negotiate a cipher suite that employs NULL
   encryption, integrity, or authentication algorithms.

   Implementations of TLS typically support multiple versions of the
   Transport Layer Security protocol as well as the older Secure Sockets
   Layer (SSL) protocol.  Because of known security vulnerabilities,
   clients and servers MUST NOT request, offer, or use SSL 2.0.  See
   Appendix E.2 of [RFC5246]for further details.

Internet-Draft              SIP Certificates                   June 2010


   The PKCS#8 in the clients MUST implement PBES2 with a key derivation
   algorithm of PBKDF2 using HMAC with SHA-256 [RFC5754] and an
   encryption algorithm of id-aes128-wrap-pad as defined in [RFC5649].
   Some pre-standard deployments of this specification used DES-EDE2-
   CBC-Pad as defined in [RFC2898] so, for some implementations, it may
   be desirable to also support that algorithm.  A different passphrase
   SHOULD be used for the PKCS#8 encryption than is used for
   authentication of the client.  It is important to choose an
   sufficiently strong passphrases.  Specific advice on the passphrase
   can be found in section 6 of [I-D.turner-asymmetrickeyformat].

10.6.  User Certificate Generation

   The certificates need to be consistent with [RFC5280].  The
   sha1WithRSAEncryption and sha256WithRSAEncryption algorithm for the
   signatureAlgorithm MUST be implemented.  The Issuers SHOULD be the
   same as the subject.  Given the ease of issuing new certificates with
   this system, the Validity can be relatively short.  A Validity of one
   year or less is RECOMMENDED.  The SubjectAltName must have a URI type
   that is set to the SIP URL corresponding to the user AOR.  It MAY be
   desirable to put some randomness into the length of time for which
   the certificates are valid so that it does not become necessary to
   renew all the certificates in the system at the same time.

   When creating a new key pair for a certificate, it is critical to
   have appropriate randomness as described in [RFC4086].  This can be
   challenging on some embedded devices such as some IP Phones and
   implementors should pay particular attention to this point.

   It is worth noting that a UA can discover the current time by looking
   at the Date header field value in the 200 response to a REGISTER
   request.

10.7.  Private Key Storage

   The protection afforded private keys is a critical security factor.
   On a small scale, failure of devices to protect the private keys will
   permit an attacker to masquerade as the user or decrypt their
   personal information.  As noted in the SACRED Framework [RFC3760],
   when stored on an end user device, such as a diskette or hard drive,
   credentials SHOULD NOT be in the clear.

10.8.  Compromised Authentication Service

   One of this worst attacks against this system would be if the
   Authentication Service were compromised.  This attack is somewhat
   analogous to a certification authority being compromised in
   traditional PKI systems.  The attacker could make a fake certificate



Jennings & Fischl        Expires January 1, 2011               [Page 26]

   for which it knows the private key, use it to receive any traffic for
   a given use, and then re-encrypt that traffic with the correct key
   and forward the communication to the intended receiver.  The attacker
   would thus become a man in the middle in the communications.

   There is not too much that can be done to protect against this.  A UA
   MAY subscribe to its own certificate under some other identity to try
   to detect whether the credential server is handing out the correct
   certificates.  It will be difficult to do this in a way that does not
   allow the credential server to recognize the user's UA.

   The UA MAY also save the fingerprints of the cached certificates and
   warn users when the certificates change significantly before their
   expiry date.

   The UA MAY also allow the user to see the fingerprints for the cached
   certificates so that they can be verified by some other out of band
   means.
