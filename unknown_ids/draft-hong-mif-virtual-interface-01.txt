          Virtual interface for multiple interfaces in a host
                  draft-hong-mif-virtual-interface-01

Abstract

   The simultaneous usage of multiple interfaces in a host may cause the
   interface change.  This document discusses how to solve the problems
   of interface change in a host and proposes a virtual interface which
   hides the change of network interface from the host IP stack to
   support simultaneous usage of multiple interfaces in a host.

1.  Introduction

   In traditional TCP/IP network environments, a communication entity
   usually has a wire connection with a single network interface and it
   is fixed.  As an introduction of wireless technologies and
   heterogeneous access technologies, a communication entity is able to
   move around between different access technologies networks and have
   multiple network interfaces [1].

   Because traditional network applications and TCP/IP stack are
   developed for a communication entity which has a single network
   interface, the adoption of multiple network interfaces into a general
   communication entity makes some problems.  Because of the change of
   network interface during communication, there may be many
   considerations to support multiple interfaces in a host [2].

   In order to solve the problems mentioned above, we propose a virtual
   interface scheme for a host with multiple network interfaces.  We
   currently use a virtual interface to provide the duplication of
   network connections through multiple network interface cards on an
   important network node such as a server.  With a virtual interface
   scheme, the host with multiple interfaces can operate as it has a
   single interface irrespective to the number of network interfaces
   [3].

2.  Introduction of a virtual interface

   In some operating systems such as Linux (or Unix), most network
   interfaces, such as eth0, wlan, and ppp, are associated to a physical
   and/or logical devices that are in charge of transmitting and
   receiving data packets.  However, there are exceptions to this rule,
   and some logical network interfaces do not feature any physical
   packet transmission.

   The virtual interface is not a real physical device and it is a
   logical network interface.  It has connections with physical network
   devices within a network entity and the path between the virtual
   interface and real physical network devices is determined dynamically
   according to some policy.

   The virtual interface is registered to the network layer and it is
   regarded as a general network interface.  Then real physical
   interfaces are connected to the virtual interface.  The network layer
   does not know the existence of these physical interfaces.

   The virtual interface can be used for the duplication of network
   connections (the duplication of network interface cards) for fault
   tolerance or load sharing.  If an important server has multiple
   physical network interface cards, it can survive even though one
   network interface card is down.  It can keep a communication session
   with other live network interface cards.  In this case, the presence
   of multiple network interface cards can be hidden to network layer
   and network layer regards the virtual inerface as a general network
   interface.  The traditional network applications and network modules
   such as TCP/IP do not need to be modified to support multiple network
   interfaces in a host if a virtual interface is used.

3.  Mechanism to use a virtual interface in a host

3.1.  Architecture of a virtual interface in a host

   In the following figure, network interfaces if_1, if_2 are real
   physical interfaces.  The network interface VI is a virtual
   interface.  The virtual interface is connected to the physical
   interfaces and it is shown to the network layer.  In this figure, the
   network layer uses the virtual interface VI instead of physical
   interfaces if_1, if_2.  To handle the virtual interface, the host
   needs a specific module (e.g., connection manager)to manage the
   virtual interface and select the path between the virtual interface
   and physical interfaces.

                            physical interfaces

3.2.  Operations of a host with a virtual interface

   When a network module in a host starts, the virtual interface is
   configured to send and receive packets.  In Figure 1, if the host
   uses a physical interface if_1, the path between the virtual
   interface VI and the physical interface if_1 is configured.

   When sending packets to another node, packets are delivered to the
   virtual interface and these packets are also forwarded into physical
   interface if_1 according to the path configuration.  When receiving
   packets from another node, packets are delivered to if_1 and these

   packets are also forwarded into VI according to the path
   configuration.

   If the host changes another interface due to movement of a host or
   the failure of network interface, the host chooses a physical
   interface if_2 and then makes the path between the virtual interface
   VI and the physical interface if_2.  At this time, the connection
   manager updates the relation between a destination address and a
   network interface.  When the host is sending packets to another node,
   packets are delivered to VI and these packets are forwarded into if_2
   according to the path configuration.  When the host is receiving
   packets from another node, packets are delivered to if_2 and these
   packets are also forwarded into VI according to the path
   configuration.
