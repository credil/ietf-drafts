Abstract

   Additional security concerns with Teredo are documented, beyond what
   is in RFC 4380.  This is based on an independent analysis of Teredo's
   security implications.  The primary intent of this document is to
   describe the updates required to update the Teredo specification.

Internet-Draft           Teredo Security Updates           February 2008


1.  Introduction

   An independent analysis of Teredo's security implications was
   conducted by Symantec[TEREDOSEC], based on the Teredo specification
   ([RFC4380]).  This analysis uncovered some security concerns
   associated with Teredo which are not documented in the Teredo
   specification.  This document discloses these additional concerns
   proposes the updates required to Teredo in order to address these
   concerns.  This Internet Draft is also influenced to an extent by an
   examination of the Teredo implementation on Microsoft Windows Vista
   [WVNASA].  This draft recommeds two changes to Teredo in order to
   make it more secure.


2.  Randomize flags

   Teredo addresses are structured and some of the fields contained in
   them are fairly predictable.  This can be used to better predict the
   address.

   Teredo prefix:  This field is 32 bits and has a single IANA assigned
      value

   Server:  This field is 32 bits and is set to the server in use.  The
      server to use is usually statically configured on the client.
      This means that overall entropy of the server field will be low,
      i.e., that the server will not be hard to predict.  Attackers
      could confine their guessing to the most popular server IP
      addresses.

   Flags:  The flags field is 16 bits in length, but RFC 4380 provides
      for only one of these bits (the cone bit) to vary.

   Client port:  This 16 bit field corresponds to the external port
      number assigned to the client's Teredo service port.  Thus the
      value of this field depends on two factors (the chosen Teredo
      service port and the NAT port assignment behavior) and therefore
      it is harder to predict the entropy this field will have.  If
      clients tend to use a predictable port number and NATs are often
      port-preserving ([RFC4787]), then the port number can be rather
      predictable.

   Client IPv4 address:  This 32 bit field corresponds to the external
      IPv4 address the NAT has assigned for the client port.  In
      principle, this can be any address in the assigned part of the
      IPv4 unicast address space.  However, if an attacker is looking
      for the address of a specific Teredo client, they will have to
      have the external IPv4 address pretty well narrowed down.  Certain

      IPv4 address ranges could also become well known for having a
      higher concentration of Teredo clients, making it easier to find
      an arbitrary Teredo client.  These addresses could correspond to
      large organizations that allows Teredo such as a university or
      enterprise or to Internet Service Providers that only provide
      their customers with RFC 1918 addresses.

   Optimizations in scanning can also reduce the number addresses that
   need to be checked.  For example, for addresses behind a cone NAT, it
   would likely be easy to probe if a specific port number is open on a
   IPv4 address, prior to trying to form a Teredo address for that
   address and port.

   Most of this is elaborated on more in [TEREDOSEC].


3.  Deprecate cone bit

   The cone bit tells the attacker whether a bubble is needed to proceed
   a connection.  It may also have some value in terms of profiling to
   the extent that it reveals the security posture of the network.  If
   the cone bit is set, the attacker may decide it is fruitful to port
   scan the embedded external IPv4 address and others associated with
   the same organization, looking for open ports.  Deprecating the cone
   bit would prevent the a priori revelation of the security posture of
   the NAT and would not reduce the functionality of the Teredo
   protocol.  The qualification procedure described in section 5.2.1 of
   [RFC4380] will also be affected by this change.


4.  Proposed changes

   The Flags field defined in section 4 of [RFC4380] is redefined as
   follows.


             0       0 0       1
            |0       7 8       5
            +----+----+----+----+
            |zzrr|rrUG|rrrr|rrrr|
            +----+----+----+----+

                          Figure 1: Flags format

   o  The bits "UG" should be set to the value "00", indicating a non-
      global unicast identifier.

Internet-Draft           Teredo Security Updates           February 2008


   o  The bits marked"z" SHOULD be set to 0.  This bit was earlier
      defined as the Cone bit to indicate if the client was behind a
      cone NAT.

   o  The bits marked with "r" SHOULD be chosen at random by the client.

   Assuming there is no bias in those bit settings, then this adds 12
   additional bits of entropy (4096 times as many addresses).  This
   makes it harder for an attacker to guess Teredo addresses.


5.  Backward Compatibility

   The Microsoft web site [MSTO] indicates that Windows Vista already
   randomizes the bits as suggested in this document.  Other
   implementations need to be updated to perform this.  All client
   implementations need to be modified to always set the cone bit to 0,
   in order to be compliant with this document.  But in either case,
   there are no functional interoperability issues and Teredo components
   updated as suggested in this specification are fully compatible with
   implementations that follow RFC 4380.


6.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Remi Denis-Courmont, Dave Thaler,
   Fred Templin, Jordi Palet Martinez, James Woodyatt and Christian
   Huitema for reviewing earlier versions of the document and providing
   comments to make this document better.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document describes some updates to RFC4380 in order to improve
   the security of the base Teredo mechanism.  Teredo is NOT RECOMMENDED
   as a solution for managed networks.  Administrators of such networks
   may wish to filter all Teredo traffic at the boundaries of their
   networks.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations resulting from this document.
