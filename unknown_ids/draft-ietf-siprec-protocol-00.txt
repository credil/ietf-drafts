Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol            August 2011


1.  Introduction

   Communication Session (CS) recording requires establishment of the
   recording session between communication system and recording system.
   In order to allow access to such recordings, the metadata about the
   CS shall be sent from the SRC to the SRS.

   The SIP-based Media Recording Requirements [RFC6341] list a set of
   requirements that need to be met by session recording protocols.  The
   Session Recording Protocol, which is specified in this document,
   meets these requirements.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   defines the terminology used throughout this document, Section 3
   discusses the scope of the Session Recording Protocol, Section 4
   provides a non-normative overview of recording operations, Section 5
   provides normative description of SIP extensions for the Recording
   Session, Section 6 provides normative description of SIP extensions
   for recording-aware user agents.


2.  Definitions

   This document refers to the core definitions provided in the
   architecture document [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture].


3.  Scope

   The scope of the Session Recording Protocol includes the
   establishment of the recording sessions and the reporting of the
   metadata.  The scope also includes extensions supported by Record-
   aware User Agents such as indication of recording.  The following
   items, which are not an exhaustive list, do not represent the
   protocol itself and are considered out of the scope of the Session
   Recording Protocol:

   o  Recording policies that determine whether the CS should be
      recorded

   o  Retention policies that determine how long a recording is stored

   o  Searching and accessing the recorded media and metadata

   o  Delivering recording session metadata through non-SIP mechanism

4.  Overview of operations

   This section is informative and provides a description of recording
   operations.

   As mentioned in the architecture document
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture], there are a couple of types of call
   flows based on the location of the Session Recording Client.  The
   following sample call flows provide a quick overview of the
   operations between the SRC and the SRS.

4.1.  Delivering recorded media

   When the SRC is deployed as a B2BUA, the SRC can route call requests
   from UA(A) to UA(B).  As a SIP B2BUA, the SRC has access to the media
   path between the user agents.  When the SRC is aware that it should
   be recording the conversation, the SRC may bridge the media between
   UA(A) and UA(B).  The SRC then establishes the Recording Session with
   the SRS and sends replicated media towards the SRS.

   An endpoint can also be acting as the SRC, and the endpoint itself
   will be establishing the Recording Session to the SRS.  Since the
   endpoint has access to the media in the Communication Session, the
   endpoint can send replicated media towards the SRS.

   The following is a sample call flow that shows the SRC establishing a
   recording session towards the SRS.  The call flow is essentially
   identical when the SRC is a B2BUA or as the endpoint itself.  Note
   that the SRC can choose when to establish the Recording Session
   independent of the Communication Session, even though the following
   call flow suggests that the SRC is establishing the Recording Session
   (message #5) after the Communication Session is established.

4.2.  Conference focus as an SRC

   A conference focus may also act as an SRC since it has access to all
   the media from each conference participant.  In this example, a user
   agent may REFER the conference focus to the SRS, and the SRC may
   choose to mix media streams from all participants as a single media
   stream towards the SRS.  In order to tell the conference focus to
   start a recording session to the SRS, the user agent can include the
   srs feature tag in the Refer-To header as per [RFC4508].

4.3.  Delivering recording metadata

   Certain metadata, such as the attributes of the recorded media
   stream, are already included in the SDP of the recording session.
   This information is reused as part of the metadata.  The SRC may
   provide an initial metadata snapshot about recorded media streams in
   the initial INVITE content in the recording session.  Subsequent
   metadata updates can be represented as a stream of events in UPDATE
   or reINVITE requests sent by the SRC.  These metadata updates are
   normally incremental updates to the initial metadata snapshot to
   optimize on the size of updates, however, the SRC may also decide to
   send a new metadata snapshot anytime.

   The SRS also has the ability to send a request to the SRC to request
   to receive a new metadata snapshot update when the SRS fails to
   understand the current stream of incremental updates for whatever
   reason (ie.  SRS gets a syntax/semantic error in metadata update, the
   SRS crashes and restarts), and the SRS may attach a reason along with
   the snapshot request.  This request allows both SRC and SRS to
   restart the states with a new metadata snapshot so that further
   metadata incremental updates will be based on the latest metadata

   snapshot.  Similar to the metadata content, the metadata snapshot
   request is transported as content in UPDATE or INVITE sent by the SRS
   in the recording session.

5.  SIP Extensions for Recording Session

   The following sections describe SIP extensions for the Recording
   Session.

   The From header must contain the identity of the SRC or the SRS.
   Participants information is not recorded in the From or To header;
   they are included in the metadata information.

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol            August 2011


   Note that a recording session does not have to live within the scope
   of a single communication session.  As outline in REQ-005 of
   [RFC6341], the recording session can be established in the absence of
   a communication session.  In this case, the SRC MUST pre-allocate a
   recorded media stream and offer an SDP with at least one m= line to
   establish a persistent recording session.  When the actual call
   arrives, the SRC can map recorded media stream to participant media
   and minimize media clipping.

   Recorded media from multiple communication sessions MAY be handled in
   a single recording session.  The SRC provides a reference of each
   recorded media stream to the metadata described in the next section.

5.1.  Callee Capabilities Extensions for SIP Recording

   This section discusses how the callee capabilities defined in
   [RFC3840] can be extended for SIP call recording.

   SIP Callee Capabilities defines feature tags which are used to
   represent characteristics and capabilities of a UA.  From RFC 3840:

      "Capability and characteristic information about a UA is carried
      as parameters of the Contact header field.  These parameters can
      be used within REGISTER requests and responses, OPTIONS responses,
      and requests and responses that create dialogs (such as INVITE)."

   Note that feature tags are also used in dialog modifying requests and
   responses such as re-INVITE and responses to a re-INVITE, and UPDATE.
   The 'isfocus' feature tag, defined in [RFC4579] is similar
   semantically to this case: it indicates that the UA is acting as a
   SIP conference focus, and is performing a specific action (mixing) on
   the resulting media stream.  This information is available from
   OPTIONS queries, dialog package notifications, and the SIP
   registration event package.

   Two new feature tags are introduced: 'src' and 'srs'.

5.1.1.  src Feature Tag

   The 'src' feature tag is used in Contact URIs by the Session
   Recording Client (SRC) related to recording sessions.  A Session
   Recording Server uses the presence of this feature tag in dialog
   creating and modifying requests and responses to confirm that the
   dialog being created is for the purpose of a Recording Session.  In
   addition, a registrar could discover that a UA is an SRC based on the
   presence of this feature tag in a registration.  Other SIP Recording
   extensions and behaviors can be triggered by the presence of this
   feature tag.



Portman, et al.         Expires February 16, 2012               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol            August 2011


   Note that we could use a single feature tag, such as 'recording' used
   by either an SRC or SRS to identify that the session is a recording
   session.  However, due to the differences in functionality and
   behavior between an SRC and SRS, using only one feature tag for both
   is not ideal.  For instance, if a routing mistake resulted in a
   request from a SRC being routed back to another SRC, if only one
   feature tag were defined, they would not know right away about the
   error and could become confused.  With separate feature tags, they
   would realize the error immediately and terminate the session.  Also,
   call logs would clearly show the routing error.

   To ensure a recording session is redirected to an SRS, an SRC can
   utilize the SIP Caller Preferences extensions, defined in [RFC3841].
   The presence of a Accept-Contact: *;sip.srs allows a UA to request
   that the INVITE be routed to an SRS.  Note that to be completely
   sure, the SRC would need to include a Require: prefs header field in
   the request.

5.1.2.  srs Feature Tag

   The 'srs' feature tag is used in Contact URIs by the Session
   Recording Server (SRS) related to recording sessions.  A Session
   Recording Client uses the presence of this feature tag in dialog
   creating and modifying requests and responses to confirm that the
   dialog being created is for the purpose of a Recording Session
   (REQ-30).  In addition, a registrar could discover that a UA is an
   SRS based on the presence of this feature tag in a registration.
   Other SIP Recording extensions and behaviors can be triggered by the
   presence of this feature tag.

   To ensure a recording session is redirected to an SRC, an SRS can
   utilize the SIP Caller Preferences extensions, defined in [RFC3841].
   The presence of a Accept-Contact: *;sip.src allows a UA to request
   that the INVITE be routed to an SRC.  Note that to be completely
   sure, the SRS would need to include a Require: prefs header field in
   the request.

5.2.  recording-session Options Tag

   Since SIP Caller Preferences extensions are optional to implement for
   routing proxies, there is no guarantee that a recording session will
   be routed an SRC or SRS.  We introduce the use of the recording-
   session option tag as a mechanism to ensure only an SRC or an SRS
   would be able to accept recording sessions.  An SRC or an SRS SHOULD
   include the recording-session option tag in the Require header so
   that other types of user agents can simply reject the INVITE request
   with a 420 Bad Extension.

5.3.  SDP handling

   Following the SDP offer/answer model in [RFC3264], this section
   describes the conventions used in the recording session for SDP
   handling.

   SRC must provide an SDP offer in the initial INVITE to the SRS.  SRC
   can include one or more media streams to the SRS.  The SRS must
   respond with the same number of media descriptors in the SDP body of
   the 200 OK.

   The SRC should use a=sendonly attribute as the SRC does not expect to
   receive media from the SRS.  As SRS only receives RTP streams from
   SRC, the 200 OK response will normally contain SDP with a=recvonly
   attribute.

   Since the SRC may send recorded media of different participants (or
   even mixed streams) to the SRS, the SDP must provide a label on each
   media stream in order to identify the recorded stream with the rest
   of the metadata.  The a=label attribute [RFC4574] will be used to
   identify each recorded media stream, and the label name is mapped to
   the Media Stream Reference in the metadata in
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata].  Note that a participant may have
   multiple streams (audio and video) and each stream is labeled
   separately.

       Figure 4: Sample SDP with audio and video streams


   To remove a recorded media stream from the recording session, send a
   reINVITE and set the port to zero in the m= line.

   To add a recorded media stream, send a reINVITE and add a new m=
   line.

   The SRS may respond with a=inactive attribute as part of the SDP in
   the 200 OK response when the SRS is not ready to receive recorded
   media.  The SRS can send re-INVITE to update the SDP with a=recvonly
   when it is ready to receive media.

   The following sequence diagram shows an example of SRS responds with
   SDP that contain a=inactive, and then later update media information
   update with re-INVITE.

5.4.  RTP handling

   recommendations for RTP usage in the session recording protocol.  The
   details are listed in [I-D.eckel-siprec-rtp-rec]]

5.5.  Metadata

   The format of the full metadata will be described as part of the
   mechanism in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata].

   As mentioned in the previous section, the SDP of the recording
   session describes the properties of media for all recorded media
   streams.  The label attribute contains a reference to the rest of the
   metadata information.

   For all basic metadata information such as communication session,
   participants and call identifiers, they can be included in the
   initial INVITE request sent by the SRC.  Metadata can be included as
   content in the INVITE or UPDATE request.  A new "disposition-type" of
   Content-Disposition is defined for this purpose and the value is
   "recording-session".

   The following is an example for RS establishment between SRC and SRS
   with metadata as content.

   Further updates to recording metadata can be delivered as a sequence
   events reported in SIP UPDATE or reINVITE requests and the SRS must
   receive the sequence of events in order.  Since there can only be a
   single INVITE or UPDATE transaction happening at a time within a SIP
   dialog, using sequence number CSeq in the dialog can be a reliable
   way for the SRS to identify the receipt of the next metadata update.

   At any time during Recording Session, the SRC can send a new metadata
   snapshot in a SIP reINVITE request along with an SDP offer.  All
   subsequent metadata updates will be based on the new metadata
   snapshot.

5.6.  Requesting for metadata snapshot

   The SRS can send a request for metadata snapshot any time after the
   Recording Session has been established.  Typically, the SRS sends
   such as request in the case where the SRS is failing to process
   further metadata incremental updates.  Failure scenarios can include
   failure to internal SRS error or failure to match metadata update
   sequence.  Certain errors, such syntax errors or semantic errors in
   the metadata information, are likely caused by an error on the SRC
   side, and it is likely the same error will occur again when a new
   snapshot is requested.  In order to avoid repeating the same error
   with snapshot requests, it is RECOMMENDED that the SRS terminate the
   recording session when a syntax error or semantic error occurs in the
   metadata.

   Similar to delivering metadata, the SRS sends the metadata snapshot
   request as content in UPDATE or INVITE requests or responses.  The
   same disposition type "recording-session" is used to note that the
   content represents content sent by the SRS.  The format of the
   content is application/rs-metadata-request, and the body format is
   chosen to be a simple text-based format with header and values.  The
   following shows an example:


       UPDATE sip:2000@10.226.240.3:5060 SIP/2.0
       To: <sip:2000@10.226.240.3>;tag=35e195d2-947d-4585-946f-098392474

       Content-Length: [length]

       Reason: SRS internal error

           Figure 7: Metadata Request


   The SRS MAY include the reason why a metadata snapshot request is
   being made to the SRC in the Reason header.  This header is free form
   text mainly designed for logging purposes on the SRC side.  The body

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol            August 2011


   format also allows additional extension headers to be included by the
   SRS in the snapshot request to convey additional information to the
   SRC.  The processing of the content by the SRC is entirely optional
   since the content is for logging only, and the snapshot request
   itself is indicated by the use of the application/rs-metadata-request
   content type.

   When the SRC receives the request for a metadata snapshot, the SRC
   MUST provide a metadata snapshot in a separate INVITE transaction,
   along with an SDP offer.  All subsequent metadata updates sent by the
   SRC MUST be based on the new metadata snapshot.

5.6.1.  Formal Syntax

   The formal syntax for the application/rs-metadata-request MIME is
   described below using the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as
   described in [RFC2234].

   snapshot-request = srs-reason-line CRLF [ *opt-srs-headers ]

   srs-reason-line = "Reason" HCOLON srs-reason

   srs-reason = [TEXT-UTF8-TRIM]

   opt-srs-headers = CRLF 1*(extension-header CRLF)

5.7.  Recording Pause and Resume

   To temporarily discontinue streaming and collection of recorded media
   from the SRC to the SRS, the SRC sends a reINVITE and set a=inactive
   for each recorded media stream to be paused.

   To resume streaming and collection of recorded media, the SRC sends a
   reINVITE and set a=sendonly for each recorded media stream to resume.

   Note that when a media stream in the CS is muted/unmuted, this
   information is conveyed in the metadata by the SRC.  The SRC SHOULD
   not modify the recorded media stream with a=inactive for mute since
   this operation is reserved for pausing the RS media.


6.  Extensions for Recording-aware User Agents

   The following sections describe SIP and SDP extensions for recording-
   aware UA.

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol            August 2011


6.1.  SIP Extensions

6.1.1.  Recording awareness

   A recording-aware UA SHOULD indicate that it can accept reporting of
   recording indication in media level SDP provided in the previous
   section.  A new option tag "record-aware" is introduced to indicate
   such awareness.

   A UA that has indicated recording awareness by including the record-
   aware option tag in a transmitted Supported header field MUST provide
   at its user interface an indication whether recording is on or off
   for a given medium based on the most recently received a=record SDP
   attribute for that medium.

   Some user agents that are automatons (eg.  IVR, media server, PSTN
   gateway) may not have a user interface to render recording
   indication.  When such user agent indicates recording awareness, the
   UA SHOULD render recording indication through other means, such as
   passing an inband tone on the PSTN gateway, putting the recording
   indication in a log file, or raising an application event in a
   VoiceXML dialog.  These user agents MAY also choose not to indicate
   recording awareness, thereby relying on whatever mechanism an SRC
   chooses to indicate recording, such as playing a tone inband.

   When a UA has not indicated that it is recording aware, an SRC MUST
   provide recording indications, where SRC is required to do so based
   on policies, through other means such as playing a tone inband.

6.2.  SDP Extensions

6.2.1.  Providing recording indication

   While there are existing mechanisms for providing an indication that
   a CS is being recorded, these mechanisms are usually delivered on the
   CS media streams such as playing an in-band tone or an announcement
   to the participants.  A new SDP attribute is introduced to allow a
   recording-aware UA to render recording indication at the user
   interface.

   The 'record' SDP attribute appears at the media level in either SDP
   offer or answer.  The recording indication applies to the specified
   media stream only, for example, only the audio portion of the call is

   'record' attribute:

      record-attr = "a=record:" indication

   on Recording is in progress.

   off  No recording is in progress.

   paused  Recording is in progress by media is paused.

   The recording attribute is a declaration by the endpoints in the
   session to indicate whether recording is taking place.  For example,
   if a UA (A) is initiating a call to UA (B) and UA (A) is also an SRC
   that is performing the recording, then UA (A) provides the recording
   indication in the SDP offer with a=record:on.  When UA (B) receives
   the SDP offer, UA (B) will see that recording is happening on the
   other endpoint of this session.  If UA (B) does not wish to perform
   recording itself, UA (B) provides the recording indication as
   a=record:off in the SDP answer.

   Whenever the recording indication needs to change, such as
   termination of recording, then the UA MUST initiate a reINVITE to
   update the SDP attribute to a=record:off.  The following call flow
   shows an example of the offer/answer with the recording indication
   attribute.


    UA A                                                   UA B

   If a call is traversed through one or more SIP B2BUA, and it happens
   that there are more than one SRC in the call path, the recording
   indication attribute does not provide any hint as to which SRC is
   performing the recording, meaning the endpoint only knows that the
   call is being recorded.  This attribute is also not used as an
   indication to negotiate which SRC in the call path will perform
   recording and is not used as a request to start/stop recording if
   there are multiple SRCs in the call path.

6.2.2.  Recording preference

   A recording-aware UA involved in a CS MAY request the CS to be
   recorded or not recorded.  This indication of recording preference
   can be sent at session establishment time or during the session.

   A new SDP attribute "recordpref" is introduced.  The SDP attribute
   appears at the media level and can only appear in an SDP offer.  The
   recording indication applies to the specified media stream only.  The
   following is the ABNF of the recordpref attribute:

      recordpref-attr = "a=recordpref:" pref

      pref = "on" / "off" / "pause" / "nopreference"

   on Request for recording if it has not already been started.  If the
      recording is currently paused, request to resume recording.

   off  Request for no recording.  If recording has already been
      started, then this preference indicates a request to stop
      recording.

   pause  Request to pause recording if recording is currently in
      progress.

   nopreference  To indicate that the UA has no preference on recording.
      While the absence of this attribute indirectly implies the lack of
      preference, using this value allows the UA to explicitly state no
      preference to being recorded.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of Option Tags

   This specification registers two option tags.  The required
   information for this registration, as specified in [RFC3261], is as
   follows.

7.1.1.  recording-session Option Tag

      Name: recording-session

      Description: This option tag is for identifying the SIP session
      for the purpose of recording session only.  This is typically not
      used in a Supported header.  When present in a Require header in a
      request, it indicates that the UAS MUST be either a SRC or SRS
      capable of handling the contexts of a recording session.

7.1.2.  record-aware Option Tag

      Name: record-aware

      Description: This option tag is to indicate the ability for the
      user agent to receive recording indicators in media level SDP.
      When present in a Supported header, it indicates that the UA can
      receive recording indicators in media level SDP.

7.2.  Registration of media feature tags

   This document registers two new media feature tags in the SIP tree
   per the process defined in [RFC2506] and [RFC3840]

7.2.1.  src feature tag

      Media feature tag name: sip.src

      ASN.1 Identifer: 25

      Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: This feature
      tag indicates that the user agent is a Session Recording Client
      for the purpose for Recording Session.

      Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: boolean

      The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
      applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This
      feature tag is only useful for a Recording Session.

      Examples of typical use: Routing the request to a Session
      Recording Server.

      Security Considerations: Security considerations for this media
      feature tag are discussed in Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.

7.2.2.  srs feature tag

      Media feature tag name: sip.srs

      ASN.1 Identifer: 26

      Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: This feature
      tag indicates that the user agent is a Session Recording Server
      for the purpose for Recording Session.

      Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: boolean

      The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following

      Examples of typical use: Routing the request to a Session
      Recording Client.

      Security Considerations: Security considerations for this media
      feature tag are discussed in Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.

7.3.  New Content-Disposition Parameter Registrations

   This document registers a new "disposition-type" value in Content-
   Disposition header: recording-session.

   recording-session the body describes the metadata information about
   the recording session

7.4.  Media Type Registration

7.4.1.  Registration of MIME Type application/rs-metadata

   This document registers the application/rs-metadata MIME media type
   in order to describe the recording session metadata.  This media type
   is defined by the following information:

   Media type name: application

   Media subtype name: rs-metadata

   Required parameters: none

   Options parameters: none

8.  Security Considerations

   The recording session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog
   [RFC3261], therefore, the recording session can reuse any of the
   existing SIP security mechanism available for securing the recorded
   media as well as metadata.

8.1.  Authentication and Authorization

   The recording session reuses the SIP mechanism to challenge requests
   that is based on HTTP authentication.  The mechanism relies on 401
   and 407 SIP responses as well as other SIP header fields for carrying
   challenges and credentials.

   The SRS may have its own set of recording policies to authorize
   recording requests from the SRC.  The use of recording policies is
   outside the scope of the Session Recording Protocol.
