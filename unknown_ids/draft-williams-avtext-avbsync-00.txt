Internet-Draft           AVB/RTP Synchronisation           February 2011


1.  Introduction

   Synchronisation between RTP flows and between devices rendering RTP
   flows is currently facilitated by means of NTP format timestamps
   taken with respect to a shared reference clock.  In professional AV
   applications, the NTP clock synchronisation protocol does not meet
   the time alignment and synchronisation speed requirements of many
   systems.

   Like NTP, the IEEE1588 family of clock synchronisation protocols
   provide a shared reference clock in an network - typically a LAN.
   IEEE1588 provides sub-microsecond synchronisation between devices on
   a LAN and typically locks within seconds at startup rather than
   minutes.  With support from Ethernet switches, IEEE1588 protocols can
   achieve nanosecond timing accuracy in LANs.  Network interface chips
   and cards supporting hardware time-stamping of timing critical
   protocol messages are also available.

   When using IEEE1588 clock synchronisation, networked AV systems can
   achieve sub 1 microsecond time alignment accuracy when rendering
   rendering of AV signals and can support latencies less than 1ms
   through a gigabit LAN.

   Two main flavours of IEEE1588 are in use today:

   o  IEEE 1588-2008: the second version of the "Standard for a
      Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for Networked Measurement
      and Control Systems".  This is a revised version of the original
      IEEE1588-2002 standard and is often called IEEE1588v2 or PTPv2.

   o  IEEE 802.1AS: "Timing and Synchronization for Time Sensitive
      Applications in Bridged Local Area Networks".  This is a Layer-2
      only profile of IEEE 1588-2008 for use in Audio/Video Bridged
      LANs.

   By using an IEEE 1588 derived reference clock, synchronisation of RTP
   streams and devices in LANs can be considerably improved.


2.  Timestamp formats

   A global IEEE 1588/802.1AS timestamp is 80 bits in total, divided
   into two parts:

      AS_sec: 48 bits seconds since epoch

      AS_nsec: 32 bits nanoseconds

Internet-Draft           AVB/RTP Synchronisation           February 2011


   A shorter 32 bit timestamp is defined for use in streaming media
   protocols in the following way:

      as_timestamp = (AS_sec * 10^9 + AS_nsec) modulo 2^32

   The shorter as_timestamp field covers just over 4 seconds of time.

            IEEE 1588/802.1AS Synchronisation Header Extension

   The fields are defined as follows:

      subtype: IEEE 1733 RTCP subtype field, see Section 4.

      as_timestamp: a 32 bit IEEE 1588/802.1AS timestamp as defined in
      Section 4.

      reserved: as this specification evolves, additional fields are
      expected to be included in this header.


4.  IEEE 1733 / RTCP

   IEEEE 1733 defines an RTCP header extension which also includes
   802.1AS timestamp information.  The IEEE 1733 RTCP extension signals
   infromation in addition to timestamps, including:

   subtype  an RTCP subtype

   gmIdentity  an 80 bit field uniquely identifying the current 802.1AS
      grand master clock for the network

   stream_id  a 64 bit number identifying the 802.1Qav stream associated
      with this RTP flow

   as_timestamp  the 32 bit 802.1AS timestamp (Section 2) associated
      with the RTP timestamp carried in this packet

   rtp_timestamp  the RTP timestamp of a media packet


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: A URN will be required to signal the presence of this header
   extension, such as:

      urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:avb-sync
