Internet-Draft       SIP-based Tracker Protocol           October 2010


1. Introduction

   As one of the important protocol components of PPSP, the PPSP Tracker
   Protocol provides communication between Trackers and Peers, by which
   Peers report streaming status to the tracker and request candidate
   lists from the tracker. This draft introduces a kind of the P2P
   streaming Tracker Protocol, the SIP-based P2P streaming Tracker
   Protocol, which utilizes SIP message to realize the functions of
   Tracker Protocol.

   Section 2 outlines the protocol overview.

   Section 3 defines the key signaling flows of SIP-based P2P streaming
   Tracker Protocol.

2. Protocol Overview

2.1. Description of the SIP-based Tracker Protocol

   SIP-based Tracker Protocol is a kind of tracker protocol realized by
   SIP protocol, i.e. the PPSP request and response message can be
   realized or substituted by SIP request and response message, not
   carried in SIP Message body.

2.2. MAPPING Methods of Tracker Protocol into SIP Methods

   This section outlines the mapping relations between SIP Request and
   PPSP Request, shown in Fig.1.

          +--------------------+----------------------------+
          | PPSP Request Method|       SIP Request Method   |
          +--------------------+----------------------------+
          |     CONNECT        |           Register         |
          |    DISCONNECT      |           Register         |
          |     JOIN           |             Invite         |
          |     LEAVE          |              BYE           |
          |     FIND           |            INFO            |
          |   KEEPALIVE        |            Register        |
          |  STAT_QUERY        |             TBD            |
          |  STAT_REPORT       |             TBD            |

3. Signaling Flows

   This section defines the key signaling flows.

3.1. Peer Registration Flow

   After Connect operation completes or a peer registers on the tracker,
   the peer may send additional requests to the tracker, like to publish
   content availability, or obtain lists of peers with specific content
   from the tracker.

   PPSP Connect operation is realized by SIP Register flow.
