  The Continue Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
          draft-sinha-dispatch-sip-continuation-option-00.txt

Abstract

   For placing a call, it is often useful to know the whether a Callee 
   is in favorable state or not.  This document defines an optional tag 
   continue and a header field Continue which provides this 
   information.  The Continue header field is to confirm the session 
   continuity with the Callee after an option for session continuity is 
   placed by the Caller.  This functionality is needed to resolve the 
   unwillingness of the Callee to receive any call.  An option is 
   given to the Callee by the Service Provider or by the Handset 
   Manufacturer to establish this requirement.

1. Introduction

   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows Caller to establish 
   sessions with Callee without informing whether Callee is in a 
   position to accept session request or not. There is no means by 
   which Caller can know the favorable state of Callee. The closest 
   approach is an OPTION method. The OPTION method is used to 
   determine the capabilities of SIP User Agent (UA). This OPTION 
   method allows a SIP User Agent Client (UAC) to discover information 
   about the supported method, content types, extensions, codecs, etc. 
   Secondly the nearest approach with respect to feature wise is a Do 
   Not Disturber (DND) feature in which the caller is failed in 
   placing an urgent call to callee.  There are several reasons why 
   the Caller wants to know the favorable state of Callee before 
   finally placing the call. 

   The Call Continuation Option is a new feature in TELECOMMUNICATION 
   where an option is given to the Caller after Caller dials the 
   Callee number to confirm the application whether to finally place 
   the call or not based on.

   o   Time Zone to talk may be unfavourable for the Callee

       Applicable when Callee is mobile and the time zone is usually 
       night or unfavourable to the Callee.

   o   Callee in Non-Dedicated Do Not Disturb (NDDND) mode

       Non-Dedicated Dot Not Disturb (NDDND) is a state of Callee 
       which portrays that the Callee is in DND mode with capability 
       of receiving calls only if it is important or urgent. So a

       mechanism to convey this information to the Caller to place the 
       call to Callee only if the call is important or urgent is 
       highlighted here. This can be the case when the Callee is in a 
       meeting, theatre or having lunch / dinner with family or 
       friends.

    Based on the call confirmation YES (i.e., TRUE) response from the 
    Caller, the application places the call finally to Callee. 

    Based on the call confirmation NO (i.e., FALSE) response from the 
    Caller, the application terminates the call. 



1.1 Terminology 

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[2].


2. Continue Header

    The Call Continuation Option feature make use of Continue header 
    and option tag continue which provide more control to Caller on 
    establishing the session.

    The Continue header field MAY appear as an option extension header 
    in PRACK request of the Call Continuation Option feature. The 
    syntax of Continue header field follows the standard SIP parameter 
    syntax. 


          Continue = "Continue" HCOLON continue_value
          continue_value = "YES" / "yes" / "NO" / "no"

    So ideally optionally used "Continue" header in SIP PRACK request 
    would look like

          Continue: "YES"
          Continue: "yes"
          Continue: "NO"
          Continue: "no"


    The information about Continue header field in this document in 
    relation to method and proxy is summarized in Table 1.

              Table 1: Summary of header fields

    The "where" column describes the request and response types in 
    which the header field may be used.  The header may not appear in 
    other types of SIP messages.  Values in the where column is: 

          R: header field may only appear in requests.

    The last six columns relate to the presence of a header field in a 
    method:

          m: the header field is mandatory.
          o: the header field is optional.
          -: the header field is not applicable.

    The Callee MUST send 182 Queued provisional response with the 
    option tag continue if willing to implement Call Continuation 
    Optional feature. If the Callee is unwilling to use Call
    Continuation Optional feature, it MUST proceed as RFC 3261.

    RFC 3261 describes guidelines for the sets of messages in which 
    offers and answers [1] can appear.  Based on those guidelines, this 
    extension provides additional opportunities for offer/answer 
    exchanges. Algorithm is defined to incorporate in Offer-Answer 
    Model for the Call Continuation Option feature using SIP Continue 
    header in PRACK shown in Figure 1.

    The Caller has 3 options to control session on receiving 182 Queued 
    provisional response with option tag continue in Require header, 
    before finally answered.

 (i)    Continue: Yes

      Caller MUST inject Continue header with field value as "yes" 
      or "YES" in the PRACK to support the Require header of 
      provisional response.

 (ii)   Continue: No

       Caller MUST inject Continue header with field value as "no" 
       or "NO" in the PRACK to support the Require header of provisional 
       response. 

(iii)  Caller Hung Up

3. Examples

    This section contains a number of examples that illustrate the use 
    of the Continue header field. The primary objective of Call 
    Continuation Option feature is the get final confirmation from the 
    Caller before establishment of the session. Assume that the Callee, 
    Alice, has enable Call Continuation Option feature in her profile. 
    The Caller, Bob, sends INVITE request to Alice.

3.1  Call is Finally Placed by Calling Party

    The call flow for when Bob finally placed a call to Alice is shown 
    in Figure 2. In this example, the Alice's phone rings only after

    Alice's phone does not ring as it got confirmation as no. PRACK is 
    responded by 200 OK followed by 486 Busy Here as per RFC 3261.


4. Implementation Recommendation

    "Session Continuation Option" feature in SIP is a new call control 
    feature proposed in this document applicable in favour of Callee 
    that gives option to Caller requesting for a confirmation to place 
    a call to Callee based on the following new applications at the 
    Callee.

   o   Callee Unfavorable Time to Receive Call (usually when the 
    Callee is sleeping or travelling, based on Callee time zone 
    which is based on his location that needs to be updated by 
    Callee in case of VoIP subscriber, and manually or 
    automatically done by Mobile Service Provider based on Daylight 
    Savings for 3G/4G subscriber).

   o   Callee has set a Non-Dedicated Do-Not-Disturb (NDDND) that is 
    DND with lower priority when the Callee is in a theatre, 
    meeting, driving, lunch/dinner, etc. - Callee is willing to 
    receive the call only when it is very urgent.

    This application is totally based on SIP Call Session Establishment 
    principles (Offer-Answer Model) with minor deviation in call flows 
    and is implementation specific and driven based on configuration at.

   o   SIP UA or Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) End Device, 3G/4G 
    Handsets (Device Driven) - Device plays more important role in 
    Call Handling.

   o   SIP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) server as a part of Voice 
    Feature Services given by the Service Provider (Service 
    Provider Driven) - Network plays more important role in Call 
    Handling instead of SIP Terminals or 3G/4G Handsets. 

    This Call Feature Application handling behaviour and subsequent 
    actions at the Calling and Callee and SIP AS is clearly defined 
    later using State Diagrams based on the call confirmation options 
    handled by Calling Party and relevant configurations / services 
    provided by the Network Service Provider.

Internet-Draft             SIP Continuation Option           August 2011



    This feature can be implemented using SIP with minor changes at 
    protocol level by introducing "Continue" header in SIP PRACK 
    Request and slight changes in the basic Offer-Answer Model 
    implementation in both UAs and SIP AS based on implementation, 
    calls of which are discussed in detail later on. There will be an 
    additional need of changes in UA Application and also at SIP AS in 
    case this feature is driven by a SIP AS instead of Callee.

    This feature is fully backward compatible and doesn't have any 
    impact on existing Subscribers, Devices, Network Setup and 
    Operation. The Service Provider may need to upgrade their SIP 
    Application server in case they wish to give this new voice feature 
    as a new service to their subscribers. Similarly Device 
    Manufacturer needs to upgrade the application of their handsets or 
    introduce as a new application feature in their new Handsets or 
    Devices.


5. IANA Considerations

    This document registers a new header field name with a compact form 
    and one new option tag.

5.1  IANA Registration of "Continue" SIP Header field

    Name of Header:        Continue
    Compact Form:          cn

5.2  IANA Registration of "continue" SIP Option-tag

    Name of option:         continue
    Description:            Support for the SIP Continue header
