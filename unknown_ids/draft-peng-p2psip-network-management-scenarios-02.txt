Internet-Draft   Network Management Scenarios for RELOAD      March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The RELOAD protocol is a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol, which
   provides an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of
   cooperating peers that form the overlay network.  It can be applied
   in different kinds of scenarios, including the Internet, carrier's
   dedicated network, enterprise network, etc.  This document summarizes
   the network management scenarios by analyzing typical application
   model for each of the above three kinds of scenarios.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   We use the terminology and definitions from Concepts and Terminology
   for Peer to Peer SIP [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and the RELOAD Base
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] extensively in this document.

   SNMP:     Simple Network Management Protocol.


3.  Network Management Scenarios for RELOAD Applied on The Internet

   There are a variety of application models for RELOAD on the Internet,
   this document only analyses one of the typical application model
   named "Public P2P VoIP Service Providers" [cite P2PVoIP scenario].
   As stated in the draft of application scenarios for RELOAD,
   centralized operation and management is required for RELOAD in this
   application model.  Here we will analyse two aspects of the network
   management requirements for this application model.

   From the viewpoint of the service provider, they need to ensure
   network stability and efficient operation.  On the one hand, the
   provider needs to monitor and control their own devices, and view
   network utility and load of the devices; on the other hand, because
   of its openness to user nodes, it is necessary to prevent malicious
   user nodes from attacking the service network and abnormal user nodes
   from disturbing the service network, so the action of user nodes need
   be monitored and controlled.  Furthermore, human intervention may be
   needed when the built-in mechanisms in RELOAD is not able to solve
   the network problems.

   From the viewpoint of administrator of enterprise users who use the
   service from the public P2P VoIP service provider, they need to
   ensure their own network security, defense external network attacks

   and viruses; It is needed to prevent commercial secret leakage; It is
   also needed to limit user function to prevent misuse enterprise VoIP
   services; It is needed to reasonably distribute traffic flows to
   improve user experience using limited bandwidth.  As an example,
   Skype plans to provide administration tools for enterprise users to
   resolve the problem that Skype may be blocked by enterprise networks.
   (Note: This quotes from http://www.best-voip-review.com/news/
   2010_06_Skype_offers_network_management_tools_to_control_their_softwa
   re.htmlz)

   According to the above requirements, we put forward the following
   network management scenarios for RELOAD used on the Internet:

   a.  Monitoring and controlling the service provider's own devices,
       such as viewing and modifying the configuration parameters of the
       devices, monitoring the load and running state of accessed
       nodes(or super nodes) and the number of client nodes that access
       accessed nodes(client nodes include RELOAD client and application
       client).

   b.  Viewing and collecting various network data, such as routing
       table, the data stored in nodes, real-time status information of
       nodes, in order to find out the operational status of the
       network, such as capacity of network, quality of service, network
       topology information.  These are the decision-making basis for
       optimization and adjustment of the network.

   c.  Alarm for abnormal events, such as congestion, message process
       failures, routing failures, link failures, etc.

   d.  Disposal of abnormal nodes, for example, finding illegal user
       nodes and forcing it to exit the network, finding fault nodes
       that can't perform RELOAD related responsibilities and requiring
       them to rejoin or forcing them to quit.  These ensure the health
       of the network.

   e.  Providing network management tool for enterprise users.  The
       administrator of the enterprise may control specific data flow
       through RELOAD nodes, and limit application functions, and
       configure the communication port by this tool.


4.  Network Management Scenarios for RELOAD Applied on Carrier's
    Dedicated Network

   DHT-based VoIP service is studied in DSN project of ITU-T (SG13 Q19).
   Its architecture and processes were developed by referring RELOAD.
   Although it has not yet been clearly adopted which protocol will be

   adopted in the project, but it is feasible that RELOAD is used here.
   And it is very possible that RELOAD is adopted by the VoIP service of
   DSN.  The following figure is the architecture figure defined in DSN.

   RLF in the above figure is equivalent to the peer of RELOAD.  And NEF
   is equivalent to the Enrollment server of RELOAD.  And MF is the
   function of network management.  The specific descriptions of every
   function are as follows:

   RLF (Resource Location Functions):

   Resource registration;

   Locate resources (content, Relay Node, subscription data, service
   capability, etc.);

   Store and maintain resource information;

   Routing of DSN message;

   Construction and management (such as updating routing tables,
   transferring resources when a new node joins the overlay network, and
   so on.)of overlay network;

   Retrieve optimization information from TOCF(Traffic Optimization
   Control Functions).

   NEF (Node Enrolment Functions):

   Provide bootstrap information for the DSN Node to join the DSN;

   Assign globally unique Node ID to the DSN Nodes;

   Configure parameters and information related to joining of the DSN
   Node;

   Apply Authentication/Authorization to DSN Node;

   Maintain the Node profile of all enrolled nodes (e.g.  Node ID, Zone
   information and etc), which can be requested by RLF;

   MF (Management Functions):

   DSN network and service administration

   DSN monitoring and diagnosis

   Statistics and Accounting which includes collection of information
   related to usage and contribution of DSN services.

   It is a telecom class application network built by telecom operators,
   and the Management Function is clearly defined in the architecture
   draft so as to achieve network management.  In this kind of
   applications, the core network devices are provided by telecom
   operators.  As the number of the devices is large and network
   topology changes frequently, it is very difficult to manage devices
   one by one, so the need for centralized operation and management is
   obvious.  Moreover, the existing telecom networks were equipped with
   the appropriate network management systems.  In this kind of
   application model, we will analyze the needs for network management
   mainly from the perspective of network operators:

   Firstly, in order to ensure network stability and efficient
   operation, the network operators need to monitor and control the
   network devices to ensure utility and load of the core devices.

   Secondly, the network operators need to effectively locate failure
   when an exception occurs in the system.

   For these requirements, we propose the following specific network
   management scenarios:

   a.  Monitoring and controlling network devices.  Such as viewing and
       modifying the configuration parameters of the devices, monitoring
       load and running state of the devices, controlling the functions

       and roles of these devices in the network.

   b.  Viewing and collecting various network data, such as routing
       table, the data stored in nodes, real-time status information of
       nodes, in order to find out the operational status of the
       network, such as the capacity of network, the quality of service,
       network topology information.  These are the decision-making
       basis for network optimization and adjustment.

   c.  Abnormal nodes alarm, such as congestion, message process
       failures, routing failures, link failures, etc.

   d.  When an exception occurs, the operators may find the location and
       the cause of failure by tracing process flow and signaling or
       doing diagnostic test.  It will provide effective help to resolve
       the failure.


5.  Network Management Scenarios for RELOAD Applied on Enterprise
    Network

   RELOAD can be applied in a variety of application models in
   controlled private network, which was put forward in the draft of
   application scenarios for RELOAD.  The need for centralized operation
   and management was clearly stated in the application model named "P2P
   for Redundant SIP Proxies" in this draft.  This document analyses the
   need of network management only for this kind of application model.

   Firstly, in order to ensure network stability and efficient
   operation, the IT department of enterprise needs to monitor and
   control network devices to ensure reasonable utilization rate and no
   overload.

   Secondly, the IT department of enterprise needs to ensure the network
   security, to defense external network attacks and viruses; It is
   needed to prevent commercial secret leakage; It is needed to limit
   user functions to prevent misuse of network resources; It is needed
   to reasonably distribute traffic flows to improve the user's
   experience under the limited bandwidth.

   Thirdly, the network operators need to effectively locate failure
   when an exception occurs in the system.

   For these requirements, we propose the following specific network
   management scenarios:

   a.  Monitoring and controlling the network devices, such as viewing
       and modifying the configuration parameters of the devices,
       monitoring load and running state of the accessed nodes(or super
       nodes) and the number of client nodes that access accessed
       nodes(client nodes include RELOAD Client and Application Client).

   b.  Viewing and collecting various network data, such as routing
       table, the data stored in nodes, real-time status information of
       nodes, in order to find out the operational status of the
       network, such as the capacity of the network, the quality of
       service, network topology information.  These are the decision-
       making basis for optimization and adjustment of the network.

   c.  Abnormal nodes alarm, such as congestion, message process
       failures, routing failures, link failures, etc.

   d.  Disposal of abnormal nodes, for example, finding illegal user
       nodes and forcing it to exit the network, finding fault nodes
       that can't perform RELOAD related responsibilities and requiring
       them to rejoin or forcing them to quit, and doing corresponding
       treatment.  These ensure the health of the network.

   e.  The manager may control specific data flow through RELOAD nodes,
       and limit application functions, and configure the communication
       port, in order to control the actions of users.

   f.  When an exception occurs, the operators may find the location and
       the cause of failure by tracing process flow and signaling or
       doing diagnostic test.  It will provide effective help to resolve
       the failure.

Internet-Draft   Network Management Scenarios for RELOAD      March 2011


   According to above analysis, we think whether RELOAD is applied on
   the Internet or carrier's dedicated network or enterprise network,
   network management is always involved in some application models and
   scenarios.  So it is necessary to study the network management
   solution for RELOAD and to define its corresponding implementation
   protocol.


7.  Relationship between Network Management Protocol and Diagnostic
    Protocol

   A diagnostic mechanism was proposed in [I-D.ietf-p2psip-diagnostics],
   which is an extension to RELOAD protocol and defines the method how
   to monitor the connection between peers and the node status.  While
   the SNMP usage for reload protocol focus on how to apply SNMP to
   manage DHT overlay considering its particular network circumstance.
   There are some correlations between the network management protocol
   and the diagnostic protocol.  But they are applied respectively
   between different network elements.  The network management protocol
   is used between the network management server and the managed peers.
   The diagnostic protocol is used between two peers in the overlay.
   These two protocols can fulfill network management functions through
   collaboration.  For example, the network management server sends SNMP
   message to Peer to trigger diagnostic operation.  After RELOAD Peer
   receives the message, it will do diagnostic test through RELOAD
   diagnostic message and generate result data.  Finally, this REOAD
   Peer will report the diagnostic result to the network management
   server through SNMP message.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security requirements of the various application scenarios vary
   tremendously.  They should be discussed in more detail in this
   document.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
