Abstract

   Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSPs) may be established using signaling techniques, but their paths
   must first be determined.  The Path Computation Element (PCE) has 
   been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of 
   the paths of P2MP TE LSPs.

   This document describes the procedures and extensions to the PCE
   communication Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for
   the computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.

1. Introduction

   Multicast services are increasingly in demand for high-capacity
   applications such as multicast VPNs, IPTV (on-demand or streaming),
   and content-rich media distribution (for example, software
   distribution, financial streaming, or data-sharing). The inter-domain
   P2MP TE LSP is a feature that facilities the deployment and operation
   of these services across multi domains.

   The need to establish point-to-multipoint (P2MP) traffic engineered
   (TE) Label Switching Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks is covered in [RFC4461].

   The applicability of the Path Computation Element (PCE) for the
   computation of such paths is discussed in [PCE-P2MP-APP], and the
   requirements placed on PCEP for this are given in [PCE-P2MP-REQ].
   The static stitching or RSVP-TE extension based solution might solve
   the issue in certain degree, but they cannot compute an optimal
   inter-domain P2MP TE LSP. This document defines a PCE-based
   solution which will give the optimal inter-domain P2MP TE LSP.

1.1 Problem Statement 

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints. A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   [RFC4875] describes how to set up P2MPTE LSPs for use in MPLS GMPLS
   networks.

   The PCE is identified as a suitable application for the computation
   of paths for P2MP TE LSPs [PCE-P2MP-APP].

   The draft-ietf-pce-brpc-09.txt specifies a procedure relying on the
   use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute point-to-
   point (P2P) inter-domain shortest constrained paths across a
   predetermined sequence of domains, using a backward recursive path
   computation technique. The technique preserves confidentiality across
   domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by
   different Service Providers.

   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) [PCEP] is extended as a
   communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs for point-to-
   multipoint(P2MP) path computations and is defined in [PCE-P2MP-EXT].
   However, that specification does not provide a mechanism to request
   path computation of inter-domain P2MP TE LSPs.

   This document presents a solution, and procedures and extensions to
   PCEP to support P2MP inter-domain path computation.

2.2  Assumptions

   It is assumed that due to deployment and commercial limitations
   (e.g.,inter-AS peering agreements) the sequence of domains for a path
   (the path domain tree) will be known in advance.

   The examples and scenarios used in this document are also based on
   the following assumptions:

   - The PCE that serves each domain in the path domain tree is known
     and the set of PCEs and their relationships is propagated to each
     PCE during the first exchange of path computation requests;
   - Each PCE knows about any leaf LSRs in the domain it serves;
   - The boundary nodes to use on the LSP are pre-determined and form 
     path of the path domain tree. In this version of the document we 
     do not consider multi-homed domains.

1.3  Requirements

   This section summarizes the PCEP requirements specific to computing
   inter-domain P2MP paths. In these requirements we note that the
   actual computation times by any PCE implementation are outside the
   scope of this document, but we observe that reducing the complexity
   of the required computations has a beneficial effect on the 
   computation time regardless of implementation. Additionally, 
   reducing the number of message exchanges and the amount of 
   information exchanged willreduce the overall computation time for 
   the entire P2MP tree. We refer to the "Complexity of the 
   computation" as the impact on these aspects of path computation 
   time as various parameters of the topology and the P2MP LSP are 
   changed.

   1. The requirements specified in [RFC5376]; 

   1.1 PCEP must allow an SP to hide from other SPs the set
       of hops within its own ASes that are traversed by an inter-AS
       inter-provider TE LSP for each inter-AS TE LSP path segment an
       inter-AS PCE computes, it may return to the requesting inter-AS
       PCE an inter-AS TE LSP path segment from its own ASes without
       detailing the explicit intra-AS hops.

   2. The computed P2MP LSP should be optimal when only considering
      The paths among the BNs.

   3. Grafting and pruning of multicast destinations in a domain should 
      have no impact on other domains and on the paths among BNs.

   4. The complexity of the computing for each sub-tree within each
      domain should be only dependent on the topology of the domain and
      it should be independent of the domain sequences.

   5. The number of PCEP request and reply messages should be 
      independent of the number of multicast destinations in each 
      domain.

   6. A number of additional requirements have also been identified in
      [PCE-P2MP-REQ].

1.4  Objective Functions 

   During the computation of a single or a set of P2MP TE LSPs a request
   to meet specific optimization criteria, called an Objective Function
   (OF), may be requested.

   The computation of one or more P2MP TE-LSPs maybe subject to an OF in
   order to select the "best" candidate paths. A variety of objective
   functions have been identified as being important during the
   computation of inter-domain P2MP LSPs. These are:

   1. The sub-tree within each domain should be optimized.

      1.1 Minimum cost tree [PCE-P2MP-REQ].
      1.2 Shortest path tree [PCE-P2MP-REQ].

   2. The P2MP LSP paths should be optimal while only considering the
      entry and exit nodes of each domain as the transit, branch and 
      leaf nodes of the P2MP LSP path. (That is, the Core Tree should be
      optimized.)

   3. It should be possible to limit the number of entry points to a 
      domain.

   4. It should be possible to force the branches for all leaves within 
      a domain to be in that domain.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses PCE terminology defined in [RFC4655], [RFC4875],
   and [PCEP]. Additional terms are defined below and draw on the
   concepts set out for P2MP LSPs in [RFC4461].

   Boundary Nodes: Each Domain has entry LSRs and exit LSRs that can 
   either be ABRs or ASBRs. They are defined here as Boundary Nodes  
  (BNs).

   without the leaf nodes.

   Leaf Boundary Nodes: The entry boundary node in the leaf domain.

   OF: Objective Function: A set of one or more optimization criterion
   (criteria) used for the computation of a single path (e.g. path cost
   minimization), or the synchronized computation of a set of paths
   (e.g. aggregate bandwidth consumption minimization, etc.). See
   [RFC4655] and [PCE-OF].

4..Procedures

3.1 Per Domain Path Computation

   Computing P2P LSPs individually is an acceptable solution for
   computing a P2MP tree. Per domain path computation [RFC5152] can be
   used to compute P2P multi-domain paths, but does not guarantee to 
   find the optimal path. Furthermore, constructing a P2MP tree from
   individual source to leaf P2P LSPs does not guarantee to produce a
   least-cost tree; it does produce a least-cost-to-destination tree.

   This approach may be considered to have scaling issues during LSP 
   setup. That is, the LSP to each leaf is signaled separately, and each
   border node must perform path computation for each leaf possibly
   invoking a PCE (although it may re-use path fragments already used 
   for other leaves if this information is retained in a stateful PCE).

3.2 Backwards Recursive Path Computation

   Backward recursive path computation (BRPC) [BRPC] provides a 
   mechanism to compute optimal P2P LSPs. This overcomes one of the 
   issues raised in Section 3.1, but nevertheless, a P2MP tree 
   constructed from individually computed optimal P2P LSPs does not 
   guarantee to produce a least-cost tree; it does produce a least-cost-
   to-destination tree.

   This approach may have scaling issues during path computation as each
   the path to each leaf must be computed separately. Although path
   fragments already used for other leaves may be re-used by stateful
   PCEs, the information must still be transmitted in a full exchange of
   PCEP messages for each leaf.

3.3.1 Core Tree Based Path Computation

   A core tree based solution provides an optimal inter-domain P2MP
   TE LSP and meets the requirements and OFs outlined in previous
   sections.

   A core tree is a path tree with nodes from each domain corresponding
   to the PCE topology which satisfies the following conditions:

    - The root of the core tree is the ingress LSR in the root domain;
    - The leaf of the core tree is the entry node in the leaf domain;
    - The transit and branch node are from the entry and exit nodes from
      the transit and branch domains.





Zhao, et el.                                                    [Page 7]

draft-zhao-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-00.txt       March 2009


   Computing the complete P2MP LSP path tree is done in two phases:

   Procedure Phase 1: P2MP LSP Core Tree Building for the Boundary Nodes
                      (BNs).

   Procedure Phase 2: Grafting destinations to the P2MP LSP Core Tree.

   Once the core tree based inter-domain tree is built. The grafting of
   all the leaf nodes from each domain to the core tree can be achieved.


   The algorithms to compute the optimal large core tree are outside
   scope of this document.  In the case that the number of domains and
   the number of BNs are not big, the following BRPC based procedure can
   be used to compute the core tree.

   BRPC Based CoreTree Path Computation Procedure

    1. Using the BRPC procedures to compute the VSPT(i) for each BN(i), 
       i=1 to n, where n is the total number of entry nodes for all the 
       leaf domains. In each VSPT(i), there are number of P(i) paths.

    2. When the root PCE has computed all the VSPT(i), i=1 to n, 
       take one path from each VSPT and form a set of paths, we call 
       it a PathSet(j), j=1 to M, where M=P(1)xP(2)...xP(n);

    3. For each PathSet(j), there are n paths and form these n 
       paths into a CoreTree(j);

    4. There will be M number of CoreTrees computed from step3. 
       Apply the OF to each of these M CoreTrees and find the 
       optimal CoreTree according to the OF.

4.2. The PCE Sequence Object

   The PCE Sequence Object is added to the existing PCE protocol. A list
   of this objects will represent the PCE topology tree. A list of 
   Sequence Objects can be exchanged between PCEs during the PCE 
   capability exchange or on the first path computation request message 
   between PCEs. In this case, the request message format needs 
   to changed to include the list of PCE Sequence Objects for the PCE 
   inter-domain P2MP calculation request.

   Each PCE Sequence is can be obtained from the domain sequence for 
   a specific path. All the PCE sequences for all the paths of P2MP 
   inter-domain form the PCE Topology Tree of the P2MP LSP.

   The format of the new PCE Sequence Object for IPv4 (Object-Type 3)
   is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr

   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.

   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into
