Internet-Draft         URN Namespace for CableLabs             July 2008


1.  Introduction

   CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium that is
   dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and
   to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical
   advancements into their business objectives.  Within CableLabs,
   specification activities are organized into projects such as
   DOCSIS(r), PacketCable(tm), and OpenCable(tm), and technical work is
   conducted in focus teams.  Product vendors, manufacturers, and cable
   operator members are invited to join the focus teams that create
   technical specifications.

   From time to time, some specifications developed by CableLabs require
   a URN namespace to uniquely identify resources.  CableLabs manages
   these resource assignments prior to specification publication and
   ensures they are both unique and persistent.

   This document defines a full and complete NID registration that
   follows [RFC3406] for the purpose of having unique and persistent
   namespace definitions in CableLabs specifications.


2.  URN Specification for CableLabs

   Namespace ID:

        The NID "cablelabs" is requested.

   Registration Information:

        registration version number: 1
        registration date: 2008-07-02

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

        Registering organization

           Name: Cable Television Laboratories Inc.
           Address: 858 Coal Creek Circle, Louisville, CO 80027, USA

        Designated contact

Internet-Draft         URN Namespace for CableLabs             July 2008


        The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
        "cablelabs" NID will have the following structure:
        urn:cablelabs:{CLresource}:{CLResourceSpecificString} where the
        "CLresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
        syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of
        resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling
        scheme that is covered by "CLResourceSpecificString", which also
        conforms to the naming requirements of [RFC2141].

        CableLabs maintains the CableLabs Assigned Names and Numbers
        [CANN] specification that will contain the assignment of
        "CLresources" and the specific registration values assigned for
        each resource class.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

        CableLabs publishes information on the registered resources in
        the [CANN] specification available at:
        http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/cpSpecs.html

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

        CableLabs will manage resources using the "cablelabs" NID and
        will be the authority for managing the resources and subsequent
        strings associated.  CableLabs is expected to guarantee the
        uniqueness of the strings themselves or it may permit secondary
        responsibility for certain defined resources.

        CableLabs could allow the use of experimental type values for
        testing purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may
        create collisions as multiple users may use the same values for
        resources and specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

        CableLabs will update the [CANN] specification to document the
        registered resources in the "cableLabs" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

        CableLabs will provide procedures for registration of each type
        of resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have
        three types of registration activities:

           1.  Registered values associated with CableLabs documents or
           services
           2.  Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
           3.  Name models for use in experimental purposes

Internet-Draft         URN Namespace for CableLabs             July 2008


   Process for identifier resolution:

        The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system;
        this is not applicable for this URN registration.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

        No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
        [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

        No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

        None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
        implemented in support of CableLabs activities.

   Scope:

        Global


3.  Example

   The following example represents an hypothetical URN that could be
   assigned by Cablelabs.

   urn:cablelabs:packetcable-example:ue:rst-sample

   Defines the URN to be used for the User Equipment (UE) implementing
   the sample Residential SIP Telephony Application (RST) defined in the
   Packetcable specifications.


4.  Namespace Considerations

   CableLabs develops specifications that may require the use of data
   models.

   URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions of those
   data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.

   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain
   different versions of URNs and dependencies between urns, across
   different versions of CableLabs specifications if they so wish.

5.  Community Considerations

   The CableLabs specifications are publicly available or licensed to
   manufacturers in a nondiscriminatory basis.

   CableLabs will maintain the allocation of resources for the
   "cablelabs" NID and maintain updated the corresponding specifications
   where those resources are referenced or used.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The requested NID has been entered into the IANA registry for URN
   NIDs.  The update can be found at:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any associated
   mirrors.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
