 Deterministic Address Mapping to Reduce Logging in Carrier Grade NATs
                draft-donley-behave-deterministic-cgn-00

Abstract

   Many Carrier Grade NAT solutions require per-connection logging.
   Unfortunately, such logging is not scalable to many residential
   broadband services.  This document suggests a way to manage Carrier
   Grade NAT translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the
   amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse
   response.  This method also provides a way of including geo-location
   significance in such assignments.

1.  Introduction

   The world is rapidly running out of unallocated IPv4 addresses.  To
   meet the growing demand for Internet service from new subscribers,
   devices, and service types, ISPs will be forced to share a single
   public IPv4 address among multiple subscribers using a technology
   such as Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGN) [RFC6264].
   However, address sharing poses additional challenges to ISPs in
   responding to law enforcement requests or attack/abuse reports.  In
   order to respond to such requests to identify a specific user
   associated with an IP address, an ISP will need to map a subscriber's
   internal source IP address and source port with the global public IP
   address and source port provided by the CGN for every connection
   initiated by the user.

   CGN connection logging satisfies the need to identify attackers and
   respond to abuse/law enforcement requests, but it imposes significant
   operational challenges to ISPs.  In lab testing, we have observed CGN
   log messages to be approximately 150 bytes long for NAT444
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444], and 175 bytes for DS-Lite [RFC6333]
   (individual log messages vary somewhat in size).  Although we are not
   aware of definitive studies of connection rates per subscriber,
   reports from several ISPs in the US sets the average number of
   connections per household per day at approximately 33,000 connections
   per day.  If each connection is individually logged, this translates
   to a data volume of approximately 5 MB per subscriber per day, or
   about 150 MB per subscriber per month; however, specific data volumes
   may vary across different ISPs based on myriad factors.  Based on
   available data, a 1-million subscriber service provider will generate
   approximately 150 terabytes of log data per month, or 1.8 petabytes
   per year.

   As an alternative to per-connection logging, CGNs could
   deterministically map internal addresses to external addresses in
   such a way as to be able to algorithmically calculate the mapping
   without relying on per connection logging.  This document describes a
   method for such CGN address mapping, combined with block port
   reservations, that significantly reduces the burden on ISPs while
   offering the ability to map a subscriber's inside IP address with an
   outside address and port observed on the Internet.


2.  Deterministic NAT

   While a subscriber uses thousands of connections per day, most
   subscribers use far fewer at any given time.  When the compression
   ratio is low (i.e., the ratio of the number of subscribers to the
   number of public IPv4 addresses allocated to a CGN is closer to 10:1



Donley, et al.           Expires March 29, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn             September 2011


   than 1000:1), each subscriber could expect to have access to
   thousands of TCP/UDP ports at any given time.  Thus, as an
   alternative to logging each connection, CGNs could deterministically
   map customer private addresses on the inside of the CGN to public
   addresses on the outside of the CGN.  This algorithm will allow an
   operator to identify a subscriber internal IP address when provided
   the public side IP and port number without having to examine the CGN
   translation logs.  This prevents an operator from having to transport
   and store massive amounts of session data from the CGN and then
   process it to identify a subscriber.

   Deterministic NAT requires configuration of the following variables:

   o  Inside IPv4/IPv6 address range (I);

   o  Outside IPv4 address range (O);

   o  Compression ratio (e.g. inside IP addresses I/outside IP addresses
      O) (C);

   o  Dynamic address pool factor (D), to be added to the compression
      ratio in order to create an overflow address pool;

   o  Maximum ports per user (M); and

   o  Reserved TCP/UDP port list

   Note: The inside address range (I) will be an IPv4 range in NAT444
   operation ([I-D.shirasaki-nat444]) and an IPv6 range in DS-Lite
   operation ([RFC6333]).

   The CGN then reserves ports as follows:

   1.  The CGN removes reserved ports from the port candidate list (e.g.
       1-1023 for TCP and UDP).  At a minimum, the CGN SHOULD remove
       system ports [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports] from the port candidate
       list reserved for deterministic assignment.

   2.  The CGN calculates the total compression ratio (C+D), and
       allocates 1/(C+D) of the available ports to each internal IP
       address.  Any remaining ports are allocated to the dynamic pool.
       Port allocation could be made sequentially (e.g. the first block
       goes to address 1, the second block to address 2, etc.),
       staggered (e.g. address 1 receives ports n*(C+D), address 2
       receives ports 1+n*(C+D), etc.), or through some other
       deterministic algorithm left to CGN implementation.  Subscribers
       could be restricted to ports from a single IPv4 address, or could
       be allocated ports across all addresses in a pool, for example.

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn             September 2011


   3.  When a subscriber initiates a connection, the CGN creates a
       translation mapping between the subscriber's inside local IP
       address/port and the CGN outside global IP address/port.  The CGN
       MUST use one of the ports allocated in step 2 for the translation
       as long as such ports are available.  The CGN MUST use the
       preallocated port range from step 2 for port control protocol
       (PCP) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] reservations as long as such ports are
       available.  While the CGN maintains its mapping table, it need
       not generate a log entry for translation mappings created in this
       step.

   4.  The CGN will have a pool of ports left for dynamic assignment.
       If a subscriber uses more than the range of ports allocated in
       step 2 (but fewer than the configured maximum ports M), the CGN
       uses a port from the dynamic assignment range for such a
       connection or for PCP reservations.  The CGN MUST log dynamically
       assigned ports to facilitate subscriber-to-address mapping.  The
       CGN SHOULD manage dynamic ports as described in
       [I-D.tsou-behave-natx4-log-reduction].

   5.  Configuration of reserved ports (e.g. system ports) is left to
       operator configuration.

   Thus, the CGN will maintain translation mapping information for all
   connections within its internal translation tables; however, it only
   needs to externally log translations for dynamically-assigned ports.

2.1.  Geo-location Considerations

   As described in [RFC6269], CGN implementation can reduce the level of
   confidence and level of granularity of geo-location information.
   However, the level of confidence in geo-location data can be
   increased, even in a centralized CGN deployment, by sub-dividing
   inside and outside ranges.  If I and O are subdivided such that I-1
   corresponds to a particular headend or central office (CO), and I-2
   corresponds with another headend/CO, etc., then geo-location data
   tied to address ranges O-1 and O-2, etc. can be accurate down to the
   headend/CO level, approximately the same level of granularity
   available in residential broadband services without CGNs.  This
   information can help content providers enforce regional content
   licensing restrictions, target advertising to local markets, and
   assist with emergency services provisioning.

2.2.  Deterministic NAT Example

   To illustrate the use of deterministic NAT, let's consider a simple
   example.  The operator configures an inside address range (I) of
   192.168.0.0/28 and outside address (O) of 203.0.113.1.  The dynamic



Donley, et al.           Expires March 29, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn             September 2011


   buffer factor is set to '2'.  Thus, the total compression ratio is
   1:(14+2) = 1:16.  Only the system ports (e.g. ports < 1024) are
   reserved.  This configuration causes the CGN to preallocate ((65536-
   1024)/16 =) 4032 TCP and 4032 UDP ports per inside IPv4 address.  For
   the purposes of this example, let's assume that they are allocated
   sequentially, where 192.168.0.1 maps to 203.0.113.1 ports 1024-5055,
   192.168.0.2 maps to 203.0.113.1 ports 5056-9087, etc.  The dynamic
   port range thus contains ports 57472-65535.  Finally, the maximum
   ports/subscriber is set to 5040.

   When subscriber 1 using 192.168.0.1 initiates a low volume of
   connections (e.g. < 4032 concurrent connections), the CGN maps the
   outgoing source address/port to the preallocated range.  These
   translation mappings are not logged.

   Subscriber 2 concurrently uses more than the allocated 4032 ports
   (e.g. for peer-to-peer, mapping, video streaming, or other
   connection-intensive traffic types), the CGN allocates up to an
   additional 1008 ports using bulk port reservations.  In this example,
   subscriber 2 uses outside ports 5056-9087, and then 100-port blocks
   between 58000-58999.  Connections using ports 5056-9087 are not
   logged, while 10 log entries are created for ports 58000-58099,
   58100-58199, 58200-58299, ..., 58900-58999.

   If a law enforcement agency reports abuse from 203.0.113.1, port
   2001, the operator can reverse the mapping algorithm to determine
   that subscriber 1 generated the traffic without consulting logs.  If
   a second abuse report comes in for 203.0.113.1, port 58204, the
   operator will determine that port 58204 is within the dynamic pool
   range, consult the log file, and determine that subscriber 2
   generated the traffic (assuming that the law enforcement timestamp
   matches the operator timestamp).

   In this example, there are no log entries for the majority of
   subscribers, who only use pre-allocated ports.  Only minimal logging
   would be needed for those few subscribers who exceed their pre-
   allocated ports and obtain extra bulk port assignments from the
   dynamic pool.  Logging data for those users will include inside
   address, outside address, outside port range, and timestamp.


3.  Additional Logging Considerations

   In order to be able to identify a subscriber based on observed
   external IPv4 address, port, and timestamp, an operator needs to know
   how the CGN was configured with regards to internal and external IP
   addresses, dynamic address pool factor, maximum ports per user, and
   reserved port range at any given time.  Therefore, the CGN MUST

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn             September 2011


   generate a log message any time such variables are changed.  Also,
   the CGN SHOULD generate such a log message once per day to facilitate
   quick identification of the relevant configuration in the event of an
   abuse notification.

   Such a log message MUST, at minimum, include the timestamp, inside
   prefix I, inside mask, outside prefix O, outside mask, D, M, and
   reserved port range; for example:

   [Wed Oct 11 14:32:52 2000]:192.168.0.0:28:203.0.113.0:32:2:5040:1-
   1023,5004,5060.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations applicable to NAT operation for various
   protocols as documented in, for example, RFC 4787 [RFC4787] and RFC
   5382 [RFC5382] also apply to this document.
