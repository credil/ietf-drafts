    <abstract>
      <t>This memo recommends that RFC 4148, the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
      Registry be reclassified as Historic, and the IANA IPPM Metrics Registry
      itself be withdrawn from use. The current registry structure has been
      found to be insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM
      metrics.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework <xref
      target="RFC2330"></xref> describes several ways to record options and
      metric parameter settings, in order to account for sources of
      measurement variability. For example, Section 13 of<xref
      target="RFC2330"></xref> describes the notion of "Type P" so that
      metrics can be specified in general, but the specifics (such as payload
      length in octets and protocol type) can replace P to disambiguate the
      results.</t>

      <t>When the IPPM Metric Registry <xref target="RFC4148"></xref> was
      designed, the variability of the Type P notion, and the variability
      possible with the many metric parameters (see Section 4.1 of <xref
      target="RFC2679"></xref> ) was not fully appreciated. Further, some of
      the early metric definitions only indicate Poisson streams <xref
      target="RFC2330"></xref> (see the metrics in <xref
      target="RFC2679"></xref>, <xref target="RFC2680"></xref>, and <xref
      target="RFC3393"></xref>), but later work standardized the methods for
      Periodic Stream measurements <xref target="RFC3432"></xref>, adding to
      the variability possible when characterizing a metric exactly.</t>

      <t>It is not believed to be feasible or even useful to register every
      possible combination of Type P, metric parameters, and Stream parameters
      using the current structure of the IPPM Metric Registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendation to Reclassify RFC 4148 and Withdraw the corresponding IANA registry">
      <t>Due to the ambiguities between the current metrics registrations and
      the metrics used, and the apparent minimal adoption of the registry in
      practice, this memo RECOMMENDS that:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>the IETF reclassify <xref target="RFC4148"></xref> as
          Historic</t>

          <t>the IANA withdraw the current IPPM Metrics Registry</t>
        </list>It is assumed that parties who wish to establish a replacement
      registry function will work to specify such a registry.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This memo and its recommendations have no known impact on the
      security of the Internet.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Metrics defined in IETF are typically registered in the IANA IPPM
      METRICS REGISTRY as described in initial version of the registry <xref
      target="RFC4148"></xref>. However, areas for improvement of this
      registry have been identified, and the registry structure has to be
      revisited when there is consensus to do so.</t>

      <t>The current consensus is to withdraw the IPPM Metrics Registry, as
      originally described in <xref target="RFC4148"></xref>.</t>
