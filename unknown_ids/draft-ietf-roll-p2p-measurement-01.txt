Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism that enables an RPL router to
   measure the quality of an existing route to another RPL router in a
   low power and lossy network, thereby allowing the router to decide if
   it wants to initiate the discovery of a more optimal route.

1.  Introduction

   Point to point (P2P) communication between arbitrary routers in a Low
   power and Lossy Network (LLN) is a key requirement for many
   applications [RFC5826][RFC5867].  RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], the IPv6
   Routing Protocol for LLNs, constrains the LLN topology to a Directed
   Acyclic Graph (DAG) built to optimize routing costs to reach the
   DAG's root and requires the P2P routes to use the DAG links only.
   Such P2P routes may potentially be suboptimal and may lead to traffic
   congestion near the DAG root.  Additionally, RPL is a proactive
   routing protocol and hence all P2P routes must be established ahead
   of the time they are used.

   To ameliorate situations, where RPL's P2P routing functionality does
   not meet the requirements, [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl] describes a
   reactive mechanism to discover P2P routes that meet the specified
   performance criteria.  This mechanism, henceforth referred to as the
   reactive P2P route discovery, requires the specification of routing
   constraints [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics], that the discovered
   routes must satisfy.  In some cases, the application requirements or
   the LLN's topological features allow a router to infer the routing
   constraints intrinsically.  For example, the application may require
   the end-to-end loss rate and/or latency on the route to be below
   certain thresholds or the LLN topology may be such that a router can
   safely assume its destination to be less than a certain number of
   hops away from itself.

   When the existing routes are deemed unsatisfactory but the router
   does not intrinsically know the routing constraints to be used in P2P
   route discovery, it may be necessary for the router to determine the
   aggregated values of the routing metrics along the existing route.
   This knowledge will allow the router to frame reasonable routing
   constraints for use in P2P route discovery to determine a better
   route.  For example, if the router determines the aggregate ETX
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics] along an existing route to be "x", it
   can use "ETX < x*y", where y is a certain fraction, as the routing
   constraint for use in P2P route discovery.  Note that it is important
   that the routing constraints are not overly strict; otherwise the P2P
   route discovery may fail even though a route, much better than the
   one currently being used, exists.

   This document specifies a mechanism that enables an RPL router to
   measure the aggregated values of the routing metrics along an
   existing route to another RPL router in an LLN, thereby allowing the
   router to decide if it wants to initiate the reactive discovery of a
   more optimal route and determine the routing constraints to be used
   for this purpose.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology], [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] and
   [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl].  The following terms, originally defined in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl], are redefined in the following manner.

   Origin: The origin refers to the router that initiates the
   measurement process defined in this document and is the start point
   of the P2P route being measured.

   Target: The target refers to the router at the end point of the P2P
   route being measured.

   Intermediate Router: A router, other than the origin and the target,
   on the P2P route being measured.


2.  Functional Overview

   The mechanism described in this document can be used by an origin to
   measure the aggregated values of the routing metrics along a P2P
   route to a target in the LLN.  Such a route could be a source route
   or a hop-by-hop route established using RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] or
   the reactive P2P route discovery [I-D.ietf-roll-p2p-rpl].  The origin
   sends a Measurement Request message along the route.  The Measurement
   Request accumulates the values of the routing metrics as it travels
   towards the target.  Upon receiving the Measurement Request, the
   target unicasts a Measurement Reply message, carrying the accumulated
   values of the routing metrics, back to the origin.

              Figure 1: Format of the Measurement Object (MO)

   This document defines a new RPL Control Message type, the Measurement
   Object (MO), with code 0x06 (to be confirmed by IANA) that serves as
   both Measurement Request and Measurement Reply.  The format of an MO
   is shown in Figure 1.  An MO consists of the following fields:

   o  RPLInstanceID: Relevant only if the MO travels along a hop-by-hop
      route.  This field identifies the RPLInstanceID of the hop-by-hop
      route being measured.  If the route being measured is a source
      route, this field MUST be set to 10000000 on transmission and
      ignored on reception.

   o  SequenceNo: An 8-bit sequence number that uniquely identifies a
      Measurement Request and the corresponding Measurement Reply.

   o  Compr: A 4-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of prefix
      octets that are elided from the IPv6 addresses in Origin/Target
      Address fields and the Address vector.  For example, Compr value

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-roll-p2p-measurement-01          July 2011


      will be 0 if full IPv6 addresses are carried in the Origin/Target
      Address fields and the Address vector.

   o  Type (T): This flag is set if the MO represents a Measurement
      Request.  The flag is cleared if the MO is a Measurement Reply.

   o  Hop-by-hop (H): This flag is set if the MO travels along a hop-by-
      hop route.  In that case, the hop-by-hop route is identified by
      the RPLInstanceID and, if the RPLInstanceID is a local value, the
      Origin Address serving as the DODAGID.  This flag is cleared if
      the MO travels along a source route specified in the Address
      vector.  Note that, in case the P2P route being measured lies
      along a non-storing DAG, an MO message may travel along a hop-by-
      hop route till it reaches the DAG's root, which then sends it
      along a source route to its destination.  In that case, the DAG
      root will reset the H flag and also insert the source route to the
      destination inside the Address vector.

   o  Accumulate Route (A): This flag is relevant only if the MO
      represents a Measurement Request that travels along a hop-by-hop
      route represented by a local RPLInstanceID.  When this flag is
      relevant, a value 1 in the flag indicates that the Measurement
      Request MUST accumulate a source route for use by the target to
      send the Measurement Reply back to the origin.  In this case, the
      intermediate routers MUST add their IPv6 addresses (after eliding
      Compr number of prefix octets) to the Address vector in the manner
      specified later.

   o  Reverse (R): This flag is relevant only if the MO represents a
      Measurement Request that travels along a source route, specified
      in the Address vector, to the target.  When this flag is relevant,
      a value 1 in the flag indicates that the Address vector contains a
      complete source route from the origin to the target, which can be
      used, after reversal, by the target to source route the
      Measurement Reply message back to the origin.

   o  Num: This field indicates the number of fields in the Address
      vector.  If the value of this field is zero, the Address vector is
      not present in the MO.

   o  Index: If the Measurement Request is traveling along a source
      route contained in the Address vector, this field indicates the
      index in the Address vector of the next hop on the route.  If the
      Measurement Request is traveling along a hop-by-hop route with a
      local RPLInstanceID and the A flag is set, this field indicates
      the index in the Address vector where an intermediate router
      receiving the MO message must store its IPv6 address.  Otherwise,
      this field MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on

      reception.

   o  Origin Address: An IPv6 address of the origin after eliding Compr
      number of prefix octets.  If the MO is traveling along a hop-by-
      hop route and the RPLInstanceID field indicates a local value, the
      Origin Address field MUST contain the DODAGID value that, along
      with the RPLInstanceID, uniquely identifies the hop-by-hop route
      being measured.

   o  Target Address: An IPv6 address of the target after eliding Compr
      number of prefix octets.

   o  Address[1..Num]: A vector of IPv6 addresses (with Compr number of
      prefix octets elided) representing a (partial) route from the
      origin to the target:

      *  Each element in the vector has size (16 - Compr) octets.

      *  The total number of elements inside the Address vector is given
         by the Num field.

      *  When the Measurement Request is traveling along a hop-by-hop
         route with local RPLInstanceID and has the A flag set, the
         Address vector is used to accumulate a route to be used by the
         target to send the Measurement Reply back to the origin.  In
         this case, the route MUST be accumulated in the forward
         direction, i.e., from the origin to the target.  The target
         router would reverse this route to obtain a source route from
         itself to the origin.  The IPv6 addresses in the accumulated
         route MUST be accessible in the backward direction.  An
         intermediate router adding its address to the Address vector
         MUST ensure that its address does not already exist in the
         vector.

      *  When the Measurement Request is traveling along a source route,
         the Address vector MUST contain a complete route to the target
         and the IPv6 addresses in the Address vector MUST be accessible
         in the forward direction, i.e., from the origin to the target.
         A router (the origin or an intermediate router) specifying a
         route to the target in the Address vector MUST ensure that the
         vector does not contain any address more than once.  The origin
         may set the R flag in the MO if the route in the Address vector
         represents a complete route from the origin to the target and
         this route can be used after reversal by the target to send the
         Measurement Reply message back to the origin.

      *  The origin and target addresses MUST NOT be included in the
         Address vector.

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-roll-p2p-measurement-01          July 2011


      *  The Address vector MUST NOT contain any multicast addresses.

   o  Metric Container Options: An MO MUST contain one or more Metric
      Container options to accumulate routing metric values for the
      route being measured.


4.  Originating a Measurement Request

   If an origin needs to measure the routing metric values along a P2P
   route towards a target, it generates an MO message and sets its
   fields in the manner described above.  Specifically, the origin MUST
   set the T flag to 1 to indicate that the MO represents a Measurement
   Request.

   If a source route is being measured, the origin MUST do the
   following:

   o  specify the complete source route to the target inside the Address
      vector;

   o  specify in the Num field the number of address elements in the
      Address vector;

   o  set the Index field to value zero;

   o  set the R flag if the route in the Address vector can be used
      after reversal by the target to source route the Measurement Reply
      message back to the origin.

   If a hop-by-hop route with a local RPLInstanceID is being measured
   and the origin desires the MO to accumulate a source route for the
   target to send the Measurement Reply message back, it MUST do the
   following:

   o  set A flag to 1;

   o  include a suitably sized, empty Address vector (with all bits set
      to zero) in the MO;

   o  specify in the Num field the number of address elements that can
      fit inside the Address vector;

   o  set the Index field to value zero.

   The origin MUST include one or more Metric Container options inside
   the MO that carry the routing metric objects of interest.  If
   required, the origin must also initiate these routing metric objects



Goyal, et al.           Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-roll-p2p-measurement-01          July 2011


   by including the values of the routing metrics for the first hop on
   the P2P route being measured.

   After setting the MO fields as described above, the origin MUST
   unicast the MO message to the next hop on the P2P route.


5.  Processing a Measurement Request at an Intermediate Router

   When a router receives an MO, it examines if one of its IPv6
   addresses is listed as the Origin or the Target Address.  If not, the
   router processes the received message in the following manner.

   An intermediate router MUST discard the packet with no further
   processing if the received MO is not a Measurement Request.

   The router then determines the next hop on the P2P route being
   measured.  In case the received MO has a clear H flag, the router
   increments the Index field and uses the Address[Index] element as the
   next hop.  If this element does not exist, the router uses the Target
   Address as the next hop.

   If the received MO has H flag set to 1, the router uses the
   RPLInstanceID, the Target Address and, if RPLInstanceID is a local
   value, the DODAGID (same as the Origin Address) to determine the next
   hop for the MO.  Also,

   o  If the RPLInstanceID of the hop-by-hop route is a local value and
      the A flag is set, the router MUST store one of its IPv6 addresses
      (after eliding Compr bytes and making sure that the Address vector
      does not already contains one of its IPv6 addresses) at location
      Address[Index] and then increments the Index field.

   o  If the router is the root of the non-storing DAG along which the
      received MO message has been traveling, the router MUST do the
      following:

      *  reset the H, A and R flags;

      *  insert a source route to the target inside the Address vector;

   message if it can not determine the next hop for the message.

   After determining the next hop, the router updates the routing metric
   objects, contained in the Metric Container options inside the MO,
   either by updating the aggregated value for the routing metric or by
   attaching the local values for the metric inside the object.  The
   router MUST drop the MO with no further processing and send a
   suitable ICMPv6 error message to the source of the message if the
   router does not know the relevant routing metric values for the next
   hop.

   After updating the routing metrics, the router MUST unicast the MO to
   the next hop.


6.  Processing a Measurement Request at the Target

   When a router receives an MO, it examines if one of its IPv6
   addresses is listed as the Target Address.  If yes, the router
   processes the received message in the following manner.

   An intermediate router MUST discard the packet with no further
   processing if the received MO is not a Measurement Request.

   The target then updates the routing metrics objects in the Metric
   Container options if required and generates a Measurement Reply
   message.  The received Measurement Request message can be trivially
   converted into the Measurement Reply by reseting the T flag to zero.
   The target MAY remove the Address vector from the Measurement Reply
   if desired.  The target then unicasts the Measurement Reply back to
   the origin:

   o  If the Measurement Request traveled along a DAG with a global
      RPLInstanceID, the Measurement Reply MAY be unicast back to the
      origin along the same DAG.

   o  If the Measurement Request traveled along a hop-by-hop route with
      a local RPLInstanceID and the A flag inside the received message
      is set, the target MAY reverse the source route contained in the
      Address vector and use it to send the Measurement Reply back to
      the origin.

   o  If the Measurement Request traveled along a source route and the R
      flag inside the received message it set, the target MAY reverse
      the source route contained in the Address vector and use it to
      send the Measurement Reply back to the origin.

7.  Processing a Measurement Reply at the Origin

   When a router receives an MO, it examines if one of its IPv6
   addresses is listed as the Origin Address.  If yes, the router
   processes the received message in the following manner.

   The origin MUST discard the packet with no further processing if the
   received MO is not a Measurement Reply or if the origin has no
   recollection of sending a Measurement Request with the sequence
   number listed in the received MO.

   The origin then examines the routing metric objects inside the Metric
   Container options to evaluate the quality of the measured P2P route.
   If a routing metric object contains local metric values recorded by
   enroute routers, the origin MAY aggregate these local values into an
   end-to-end value as per the aggregation rules for the metric.
