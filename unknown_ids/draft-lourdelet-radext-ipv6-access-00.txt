Abstract

   This document specifies new IPv6 attributes for RADIUS that
   complement [RFC3162].  Its goal is to offer more IPv6 deployment
   options when StateLess Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) or DHCP are
   involved.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                 March 2009


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   This document specifies new IPv6 RADIUS attributes used to support
   IPv6 network access.  As IPv6 specifies two configuration mechanisms
   (DHCP and SLAAC), the new attributes are targeted at both protocols
   when it makes sense.


3.  Attributes

   As usual, the fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from
   left to right.

3.1.  IPv6-Address Attribute

   This Attribute indicates an IPv6 Address that is assigned to the
   uplink of the user equipment.  It MAY be used in Access-Accept
   packets, and can appear multiple times.  It MAY be used in an Access-
   Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would
   prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the server is not required to
   honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS, when necessary
   will add a route corresponding to the address, it is not necessary
   for the server to also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route attribute for
   the same address.

   This Attribute can be used by DHCPv6 to offer a unique IPv6 address
   or can be used for a-posteriori validation of an autoconfigured
   address.

   A summary of the IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.

   Address

      The Address field contains a 128-bit IPv6 address.

3.2.  IPv6-DNS-Server-Address

   The IPv6-DNS-Server-Address Attribute contains the IPv6 address of a
   DNS server.  This attribute MAY be included multiple times in Access-
   Accept.

   The contnet of this attribute can be inserted in a Router
   Advertisemnt as specified in RFc5006 or mapped to the matching DHCPv6
   option.

   A summary of the IPv6-DNS-Server-Address Attribute format is given
   below.

      The 128-bit IPv6 address of a DNS server.

3.3.  IPv6-Prefix-Information

   This Attribute provides more specific prefix information to be
   advertised to the user by the NAS, with the NAS interface as the
   intended next-hop.  It is used in the Access-Accept packet and can
   appear multiple times.

   A summary of the IPv6-Prefix-Information Attribute format is shown

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type

      TBA3 for IPv6-Prefix-Information

   Length

      At least 4 and no larger than 20; typically 12 or less.

   Prefix Length

      The length of the prefix, in bits; at least 0 and no more than
      128; typically 64 or less.

   Prefix

      Variable-length field containing an IP address or a prefix of an
      IP address.  The Prefix Length field contains the number of valid
      leading bits in the prefix.  The bits in the prefix after the
      prefix length (if any) are reserved and MUST be initialized to
      zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

3.4.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

 Request Accept Reject Challenge Accounting  #  Attribute
                                    Request
 0+      0+     0      0         0+        TBA1  IPv6-Address
 0+      0+     0      0         0+        TBA2  IPv6-DNS-Server-Address
 0       0+     0      0         0+        TBA3  IPv6-Prefix-Information


4.  Diameter Considerations

   Since the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from the
   standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling is
   required by Diameter entities.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of three new RADIUS Attribute
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following
   attributes:

   o  IPv6-Address

   o  IPv6-DNS-Server-Address

   o  IPv6-Prefix-Information

   IANA should allocate these numbers from the standard RADIUS
   Attributes space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].


7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Alfred HInes and TBD for their
   contributions and comments to this document.
