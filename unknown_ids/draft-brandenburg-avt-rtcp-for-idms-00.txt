Abstract

   This document specifies an RTCP XR Block Type for inter-destination
   media synchronization (IDMS). The RTCP Block Type is used to collect
   information on media play-out time of a specific RTP media stream,
   and to distribute a summary of the collected information. This
   information can be used to synchronize the play-out of media such as
   audio, video and/or subtitles among multiple devices.

   This document also specifies the associated SDP parameter. The SDP
   parameter is used to signal the use of the RTCP XR block for inter-
   destination media synchronization.

   Typical applications for inter-destination media synchronization are
   social TV, watching apart together and shared service control. Each
   of these applications has two or more geographically separated users
   watching a media stream on respective devices. RTCP-XR is intended as
   a signaling mechanism to enable various media synchronization
   algorithms amongst users. The presented RTCP-XR specification for
   IDMS is independent of the used synchronization algorithm.

1. Introduction

1.1. Inter-destination Media Synchronization

   Inter-destination media synchronization (IDMS) refers to the play-out
   of media streams at two or more geographically distributed locations
   in a temporally synchronized manner. It can be applied to both
   unicast and multicast media streams and can be applied to any type
   and/or combination of streaming media, such as audio, video and text
   (subtitles). [Boronat2009] provides an overview of technologies and
   algorithms for IDMS.

   IDMS requires the exchange of information on media receipt and
   playout times. It may also require signaling for the initiation and
   maintenance of IDMS sessions and groups.

1.2. Applicability of RTCP to IDMS

   RTP and RTCP [RFC3550] are protocols that are typically used in
   conjunction. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) provides end-to-end
   network transport functions suitable for applications requiring real-
   time data transport, such as audio, video or data, over multicast or
   unicast network services.

   The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow
   monitoring of the data delivery in a manner that is scalable to large
   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
   functionality.

   RTP receivers and - senders provide reception quality feedback by
   sending out RTCP Receiver Report (RR) and Sender Report (SR) packets
   [RFC3550], which may be augmented by eXtended Reports (XR) [RFC3611].

   IDMS involves the collection, summarizing and distribution of RTP
   packet arrival and play-out times.

   RTCP is applicable to IDMS, as information on RTP packet arrival
   times and play-out times can be considered reception quality feedback
   information.

1.3. Applicability of SDP to IDMS

   RTCP XR [RFC3611] defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
   the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
   packets can be signaled by an application using the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP).

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS               September 2010


   SDP signaling is used to set up and maintain a synchronization group
   between Synchronization Clients (SCs).

1.4. This document and ETSI TISPAN

   ETSI TISPAN [TS 183 063] has specified architecture and protocol for
   IDMS using RTCP XR exchange and optional SDP signaling. This internet
   draft is an excerpt of the IDMS part of that specification.

2. Inter-destination media synchronization use cases

   Social TV is the combination of media content consumption by two or
   more users at different devices and locations and real-time
   communication between those users.

2.1. Watching Apart Together

   Watching Apart Together is an example of Social TV, where two or more
   users watch the same television broadcast at different devices and
   locations, while communicating with each other using text, audio
   and/or video.

   A skew in the media play-out of the two or more users can have
   adverse effects on their experience. A well-known use case here is
   one friend experiencing a goal in a football match well before or
   after other friend(s).Thus IDMS is required to provide play-out
   synchronization.

2.2. Shared Service Control

   Shared Service Control is an example of Social TV, where two or more
   users experience some content-on-demand together, while sharing the
   trick-play controls (play, pause, fast forward, rewind) of the
   content on demand.

   Similar to the previous use case, without IDMS, differences in play-
   out speed and the effect of transit delay of trick-play control
   signals would desynchronize content play-out.

3. Architecture for inter-destination media synchronization

   The architecture for IDMS, which is based around a sync-maestro
   architecture [Boronat2009], is sketched below. The SC and MSAS
   entities are shown as additional functionality for the RTP receiver
   and sender respectively.

   It should be noted that a master-slave type of architecture is
   supported by having one of the SC devices also act as an MSAS.

3.1. Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)

   An MSAS collects RTP packet arrival times and play-out times from one
   or more SC(s) in a synchronization group. The MSAS summarizes and
   distributes this information to the SCs in the synchronization group,
   e.g. by determining the SC with the most lagged play-out and using
   its reported RTP packet arrival time and play-out time as a summary.

3.2. Synchronization Client (SC)

   An SC reports RTP packet arrival times and play-out times of a media
   stream. It can receive summaries of such information, and use that to
   adjust its play-out buffer.

3.3. Mixer

   A Mixer re-originates an RTP media stream. Therefore the SSRC and RTP
   time stamps of an outgoing RTP media stream of a mixer are unrelated
   to the SSRC and RTP time stamps of the incoming RTP stream. A Mixer
   can report the correlation between SSCRs and RTP time stamps of
   incoming and outgoing RTP media streams.

4. RTCP XR Block Type for IDMS

   This section specifies the RTCP XR Block Type for reporting inter-
   destination media synchronization information on an RTP media stream.
   Its definition is based on [RFC5576]. The RTCP XR is used to report
   information on receipt times and presentation times of RTP packets to
   e.g. a Sender [RFC3611], a Feedback Target [RFC 3550] or a Third
   Party Monitor [RFC3611]. The RTCP XR is also used to indicate
   synchronization settings instructions to a receiver of the RTP media
   stream.

   The first 64 bits form the header of the RTCP XR, as defined in [45].
   The SSRC of packet sender identifies the sender of the specific RTCP
   packet.

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits. It identifies the block format. Its value
   shall be set to 12.

   Synchronization Packet Sender Type (SPST): 4 bits. This field
   indentifies the role of the packet sender for this specific eXtended
   Report. It can have the following values:

   SPST=0  Reserved For future use.

   SPST=1  The packet sender is an SC. It uses this XR to report
   synchronization status information. Timestamps relate to the SC
   input.

   SPST=2  The packet sender is an MSAS. It uses this XR to report
   synchronization settings instructions. Timestamps relate to the input
   of a virtual SC, which acts as reference to which the SCs belonging
   to this session are synchronized.

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS               September 2010


   SPST=3  The packet sender is a Mixer [RFC3550]. It uses this XR to
   report synchronization correlation information related to its
   incoming media stream. Timestamps relate to its input.

   SPST=4  The packet sender is a Mixer [RFC3550]. It uses this XR to
   report synchronization correlation information related to a specific
   outgoing media stream of SC'. Timestamps relate to its input. (see
   Note below)

   SPST=5-15  Reserved For future use.

   NOTE: Following the RTP/RTCP specification [RFC3611], RTP timestamps
   relate to the arrival time of the first octet of an RTP packet. In
   case of SPST=4 (Mixer output), there is not such an arrival time as
   the media stream is re-originated at the Mixer. In this case, the
   timestamp would relate to the arrival time of the equivalent octet
   (representing e.g. the same video pixel or audio sample) of the
   incoming media steam.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 3 bits. These bits are reserved for future use
   and shall be set to 0.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag (P): 1 bit. Bit set to 1 if the
   Packet Presented NTP timestamp contains a value, 0 if it is empty. If
   this flag is set to zero, then the Packet Presented NTP timestamp
   shall not be inspected.

   Block Length: 16 bits. This shall be set to 7, as this RTCP Block
   Type has a fixed length.

   Payload Type (PT):  7 bits. This field identifies the format of the
   media payload, according to [59]. The media payload is associated
   with an RTP timestamp clock rate. This clock rate provides the time
   base for the RTP timestamp counter.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 25 bits. These bits are reserved for future
   use and shall be set to 0.

   Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits. This identifier is used
   to correlate synchronized media streams. The value 0 (all bits are
   set "0") indicates that this field is empty. The value 2^32-1 (all
   bits are set "1") is reserved for future use. If the RTCP Packet
   Sender is an SC or an MSAS (SPST=1 or SPST=2), then the Media Stream
   Correlation Identifier maps on the SyncGroupId. If the RTCP Packet
   Sender is an Mixer (SPST=3 or SPST=4), related incoming and outgoing
   media streams have the same Media Stream Correlation Identifier.

   SSRC: 32 bits. The SSRC of the media source shall be set to the value
   of the SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header [44] of the RTP
   packet to which the XR relates.

   Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits. This NTP timestamp [58] is
   the arrival wall clock time of the first octet of the RTP packet to
   which the XR relates. For SPST=2 it relates to a virtual SC to which
   the other SCs in the synchronization group may synchronize. For
   SPST=4 the SC' should calculate backwards when the content (video
   frame, audio sample) associated with the first octet of the RTP
   packet arrived. SCs shall be time-synchronized using e.g. NTP.

   Packet Received RTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp has the value
   of the RTP time stamp carried in the RTP header [44] of the RTP
   packet to which the XR relates.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp reflects the
   NTP time when the data contained in the first octet of the associated
   RTP packet is presented to the user. It consists of the least
   significant 16 bits of the NTP seconds part and the most significant
   16 bits of the NTP fractional second part.  If this field is empty,
   then it shall be set to 0 and the Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag
   (P) shall be set to 0. It shall be empty for SPST=3 and SPST=4.

5. SDP parameter for IDMS

   The SDP parameter sync-group is used to signal the use of the RTCP XR
   block for inter-destination media synchronization. This SDP parameter
   extends rtcp-xr-attrib as follows, using Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   [RFC2234].

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
   ; Original definition from [RFC 3611], section 5.1

   xr-format =/ grp-sync ; Extending xr-format for inter-destination
   media synchronization

   grp-sync = "grp-sync" [",sync-group=" SyncGroupId]

   SyncGroupId = 1*DIGIT ; Numerical value from 0 till 4294967295

   DIGIT = %x30-39

   SyncGroupId is a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order and
   represented in decimal. SyncGroupId identifies a group of SCs for
   inter-destination media synchronization. It maps on the Media Stream
   Correlation Identifier of Annex W.1 for SPST=1 and SPST=2. The value

Internet-Draft              RTCP for IDMS               September 2010


   SyncGroupId=0 represents an empty SyncGroupId. The value 4294967295
   (2^32-1) is reserved for future use.

   The following is an example of the SDP attribute for inter-
   destination media synchronization.

   a=rtcp-xr:grp-sync,sync-group=42

6. Security Considerations

   The specified RTCP XR Block Type in this document is used to collect,
   summarize and distribute information on packet-receipt times and
   play-out times of streaming media. The information may be used to
   orchestrate the media play-out at multiple devices.

   Errors in the information, either accidental or malicious, may lead
   to undesired behavior. For example, if one device erroneously reports
   a two-hour delayed play-out, then another device in the same
   synchronization group could decide to delay its play-out by two hours
   as well, in order to keep its play-out synchronized. A user would
   likely interpret this two hour delay as a malfunctioning service.

   Therefore, the application logic of both Synchronization Clients and
   Media Synchronization Application Servers should check for
   inconsistent information. Differences in play-out time of more than
   e.g. ten seconds could be an indication of such inconsistent
   information.

7. IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration. For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

   [TS 183 063] assigns the block type value 12 in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry to "Inter-destination Media Synchronization Block". [TS
   183 063] also registers the SDP [RFC4566] parameter "grp-sync" for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry.

8. Conclusions

   This document specifies the RTCP XR and the associated SDP parameter
   for inter-destination media synchronization.
