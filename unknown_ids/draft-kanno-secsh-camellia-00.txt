       The Camellia for the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol
                     draft-kanno-secsh-camellia-00

Abstract

   Secure shell (SSH) is a secure remote-login protocol.  SSH provides
   for algorithms that provide authentication, key agreement,
   confidentiality, and data-integrity services.  The purpose of this
   document is to specify the Camellia cipher as symmetric encryption
   algorithm for the SSH Transport Layer Protocol.

Internet-Draft          Camellia for Secure Shell             April 2010


1.  Introduction

   The SSH protocol [3] can support many different symmetric ciphers as
   encryption methods.

   This document describes the necessary information to use the Camellia
   [1] symmetric cipher in the SSH protocol.

   This document specifies three modes (Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
   mode, Counter (CTR) mode, and Galois Counter Mode (GCM)) as
   encryption method.

2.  Encryption

   This document describes the Camellia cipher for use with the SSH
   Transport Protocol.  For the Camellia modes, these specifications
   comply with AES:

         Modes                    Specifications
         ---------------------------------------
         Camellia in CBC mode     RFC4253
         Camellia in CTR mode     RFC4344
         Camellia in GCM mode     RFC5647

   This document describes the following new methods:

      camellia256-cbc          OPTIONAL          Camellia in CBC mode,
                                                 with a 256-bit key
      camellia192-cbc          OPTIONAL          Camellia with a 192-bit key
      camellia128-cbc          OPTIONAL          Camellia with a 128-bit key
      camellia256-ctr          OPTIONAL          Camellia in CTR mode,
                                                 with 256-bit key
      camellia192-ctr          OPTIONAL          Camellia with a 192-bit key
      camellia128-ctr          OPTIONAL          Camellia with a 128-bit key
      AEAD_CAMELLIA_256_GCM    OPTIONAL          Camellia in GCM mode,
                                                 with a 256-bit key
      AEAD_CAMELLIA_128_GCM    OPTIONAL          Camellia with a 128-bit key

   The "camellia256-cbc" cipher is Camellia in CBC mode.  This version
   uses a 256-bit key.  The "camellia192-cbc" cipher is the same as
   above, but with a 192-bit key.  The "camellia128-cbc" cipher is the
   same as above, but with a 128-bit key.

   The "camellia256-ctr" cipher is Camellia in CTR mode.  This version
   uses a 256-bit key.  The "camellia192-ctr" cipher is the same as
   above, but with a 192-bit key.  The "camellia256-ctr" cipher is the
   same as above, but with a 256-bit key.

   The "AEAD_CAMELLIA_256_GCM" is Camellia in GCM mode.  This version
   uses a 256-bit key.  The "AEAD_CAMELLIA_128_GCM" is the same as
   above, but with a 128-bit key.

3.  MAC

   This document describes the Camellia-GCM for use with the SSH
   Transport Protocol as a MAC.  For the MAC of Camellia-GCM, the
   specification comply with AES for GCM mode:

         Modes                    Specifications
         ---------------------------------------
         Camellia in GCM mode      RFC5647

   This document describes the addition of the following two entities to
   the SSH MAC algorithm names registry described in [2]:

      AEAD_CAMELLIA_256_GCM    OPTIONAL          Camellia in GCM mode,
                                                 with a 256-bit key
      AEAD_CAMELLIA_128_GCM    OPTIONAL          Camellia with a 128-bit key

   The "AEAD_CAMELLIA_256_GCM" is Camellia in GCM mode.  This version
   uses a 256-bit key.  The "AEAD_CAMELLIA_128_GCM" is the same as
   above, but with a 128-bit key.

4.  Key Exchange

   The Camellia cipher uses these key exchange protocols as well as AES.
   These key exchange protocols are described in Section 7 of [3],
   Section 5.1 of [7], and Section 4 and 5 of [5].

5.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   [6], [8], and [9]).

   For the SSH security considerations, this document refers to Section
   14 of [3], Section 6 of [4], Section 8 of [7], and Section 9 of [5].

6.  IANA Considerations

   The eight encryption algorithm names are defined in Section 2, and
   the two MAC algorithm names are defined in Section 3.  These names
   request to add to the Secure Shell Encryption Algorithm Name
   registry.
