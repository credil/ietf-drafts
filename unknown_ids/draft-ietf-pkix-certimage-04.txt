INTERNET DRAFT             Certificate Image            December 4, 2009


1.  Introduction


   This standard specifies how to bind a Certificate Image, providing a
   visual representation of a certificate, to that [RFC5280] certificate
   using the Logotype extension defined in [RFC3709], specifying the
   Certificate Image as a new otherLogos type.

   The purpose of the Certificate image is to aid human interpretation
   of a certificate by providing meaningful visual information to the
   user interface.

   Typical situations when a human needs to examine the visual
   representation of a certificate are:

      - A person establishes secured channel with an authenticated
      service. The person needs to determine the identity of the service
      based on the authenticated credentials.

      - A person validates the signature on critical information, such
      as signed executable code, and needs to determine the identity of
      the signer based on the signer's certificate.

      - A person is required to select an appropriate certificate to be
      used when authenticating to a service or Identity Management
      infrastructure. The person needs to see the available certificates
      in order to distinguish between them in the selection process.


   Display of a certificate information to humans is challenging due to
   lack of well defined semantics for critical identity attributes.
   Unless the application has out of band knowledge about a particular
   certificate, the application will not know the exact nature of the
   data stored in common identification attributes such as serialNumber,
   organizationName, country, etc. Consequently the application can
   display the actual data, but faces problem to label that data in the
   UI, informing the human about the exact nature (semantics) of that
   data. It is also challenging for the application to determine which
   identification attribute that are important to display and how to
   organize them in a logical order.

   RFC 3709 [RFC3709] defines a certificate extension for binding images
   to a certificate, such as community logo and issuer logo, enhancing
   display of certificate information. The syntax is extensible and
   allows inclusion of new image types using the other-Logos structure.
   This standard defines how to include a complete certificate image
   using the extensibility mechanism of RFC 3709.

1.2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2  Certificate Image

   This section defines the Certificate Image as a new otherLogos type
   according to section 4.1 of [RFC3709].

   The Certificate Image otherLogos type is identified by the Object
   Identifier (OID) id-logo-certimage.

      id-pkix  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=
           { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
           security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }

      id-logo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 20 }

      id-logo-certimage OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-logo TBD }

   //* Note: TBD is to be replaced by a real OID before publication of
   this draft *//

   When present the Certificate Image MUST represent a complete visual
   representation of the certificate. This means that the display of
   this certificate image represents all information about the
   certificate that the issuer subjectively defines as relevant to show
   a typical human user within the typical intended use of the
   certificate, giving adequate information about at least the following
   three aspects of the certificate:

      - Certificate Context
      - Certificate Issuer
      - Certificate Subject

   Certificate Context information is visual marks and/or textual
   information which helps the typical user to understand the typical
   usage and/or purpose of the certificate

   It is up to the issuer to decide what information in the form of text
   and graphical symbols and elements, which represents a complete
   visual representation of the certificate.

   Applications providing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the
   certificate user MAY present a Certificate Image according to this
   standard in any given application interface, as the only visual
   representation of a certificate.

3 LogotypeImageInfo

   The optional LogotypeImageInfo structure is defined in [RFC3709] and
   is included here for convenience:
 


Santesson et all.         Expires June 7, 2010                  [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT             Certificate Image            December 4, 2009


      LogotypeImageInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        type          [0] LogotypeImageType DEFAULT color,
        fileSize      INTEGER,  -- In octets
        xSize         INTEGER,  -- Horizontal size in pixels
        ySize         INTEGER,  -- Vertical size in pixels
        resolution    LogotypeImageResolution OPTIONAL,
        language      [4] IA5String OPTIONAL }  -- RFC 3066 Language Tag

   When the optional LogotypeImageInfo is included with a certificate
   image, the parameters shall be used with the following semantics and
   restrictions.

   xSize and ySize represents recommended display size for the image.
   When a value of 0 (zero) is present, no recommended display size
   specified. When non-zero values are present and these values differ
   from corresponding size values in the referenced image file, then the
   referenced image SHOULD be scaled to fit within the size parameters
   of LogotypeImageInfo, while keeping x and y ratio intact.

   Resolution MUST NOT be specified.


4  Certificate Image Formats

4.1 PDF

   A Certificate Image MAY be provided in the form of a Portable
   Document Format (PDF) document according to [ISO32000] following the
   conventions defined in this section. When a certificate image is
   formatted as a PDF document, it MUST also be formatted according to
   the profile PDF/A [ISO19005].

   When including a PDF document as Certificate Image, the following
   MIME media type as specified in [RFC3778] MUST be used as mediaType
   in LogotypeDetails:

      application/pdf

4.2 SVG

   A Certificate Image MAY be provided in the form of a Scalable Vector
   Graphic (SVG) image, which MUST follow the SVG Tiny profile [SVGT1.2]

   The following MIME media type defined in Appendix M of [SVGT1.2] MUST
   be used as mediaType in LogotypeDetails for SVG images:

      image/svg+xml

INTERNET DRAFT             Certificate Image            December 4, 2009


   The SVG image file MUST NOT incorporate any external image data by
   reference to an external SVG document, or by reference to an external
   media source other than SVG. Doing so would incorporate image data
   that is not covered by the logotypeHash value of the image.
   Certificate using applications MUST reject any image that violates
   this rule.

   The XML structure in the SVG file MUST use <LF> (linefeed 0x0A) as
   end-of-line (EOL) character when calculating the hash over the SVG
   file. The referenced SVG file may be provided in compressed form, for
   example as SVG.GZ or SVGZ. It is outside the scope of this
   specification to specify any such compression algorithm. However,
   after decompression the EOL characters of the SVG file MUST be
   normalized according to this section before computing the hash of the
   SVG file.

4.2 PNG

   If a certificate image is provided as a bit mapped image, the PNG
   [ISO15948] format SHOULD be used.

   PNG images are identified by the following mediaType in
   LogotypeDetails:

      image/png

5  Embedded images

   The certificate image otherLogos type MAY be stored within the
   logotype extension using the "data" URL scheme defined in RFC 2397
   [RFC2397] if the logotype image is provided through direct
   addressing, i.e. the image is referenced using the LogotypeDetails
   structure.

   The syntax of Logotype details defined in RFC 3709 is included here
   for convenience:

      LogotypeDetails ::= SEQUENCE {
         mediaType       IA5String, -- MIME media type name and optional
                                    -- parameters
         logotypeHash    SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF HashAlgAndValue,
         logotypeURI     SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF IA5String }

INTERNET DRAFT             Certificate Image            December 4, 2009


   The syntax of the "data" URL Scheme defined in RFC 2397 is included
   here for convenience:

         dataurl    := "data:" [ mediatype ] [ ";base64" ] "," data
         mediatype  := [ type "/" subtype ] *( ";" parameter ) data     
          := *urlchar parameter  := attribute "=" value


   When including the image data in the logotype extension using the
   "data" URL scheme the following conventions apply.

      -  the value of mediaType in LogotypeDetails MUST be identical to
         the mediatype value in the "data" URL.

      -  The hash of the image MUST be included in logotypeHash and MUST
         be calculated over the same data as it would have been, had the
         image been referenced through a link to an external resource.



   Note: As the "data" URL scheme is processed as a data source rather
         than as a URL, the image data is typically not limited by any
         URL length limit setting that otherwise apply to URLs in
         general.

   Note: Implementations need to be cautious about the the size of
         images included in a certificate in order to ensure that the
         size of the certificate does not prevent the certificate to be
         used as intended.

6  Security Considerations

   This document is based on and inherits all security considerations
   from RFC 3709 [RFC3709].

   Referenced image files are hashed in order to bind the image to the
   signature of the certificate. Some image types, such as SVG allow
   part of the image to be collected from external source by
   incorporating a reference to an external image file. If this feature
   were used within a certificate image file, the hash of the image file
   would only cover the URI reference to the external image file, but
   not the referenced image data. To ensure that the hash of the
   certificate image covers the whole image, implementations of this
   standard MUST reject images that incorporate parts of the image by
   reference to external image files.

   CAs issuing certificate with embedded certificate images should be
   cautious when accepting graphics from the certificate requestor for
   inclusion in the certificate if the hash algorithm used to sign the
   certificate is vulnerable to collision attacks. In such case the
   accepted image may contain data that could help an attacker to obtain
   colliding certificates with identical certificate signatures.


7  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions from IANA.
