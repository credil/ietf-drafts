          Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Recording Metadata
                      draft-ram-siprec-metadata-02

Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document describes the metadata model as
   viewed by Session Recording Server(SRS).

1.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications
   environments such as call centers and financial trading.  In some of
   these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory,
   compliance, and consumer protection reasons.  Recording of a session
   is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a
   recording device.  This document focuses on the Recording metadata
   which describes the communication session.  The document describes a
   metadata model as viewed by Session Recording Server, the
   architecture for which is described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture]
   and the requirements for which are described in
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-req].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs."


3.  Metadata Model

   Metadata is the data that describes the communication session.  Below
   diagram shows a model for Metadata as viewed by Session Recording
   Server (SRS).

   The metadata model above MUST be used by a SRS.  (NOTE: Not entirely
   clear what sort of normative statement to make about this.)

   The Session Recording Client (SRC) MAY initiate the Recording
   Session.  It should be noted that the Recording Session is a
   completely independent from the Communication Session that is being
   recorded at both the SIP dialog level and at the session level.  The
   metadata MUST be conveyed from SRC to SRS.  The metadata MAY be
   conveyed in Recording Session Dialog.

   Note that the metadata model captures changes that occur over the
   duration of the recording session.  For example, if the call is
   transferred from one participant to another, then the SRC SHALL

   convey a change of participant and the properties of the new media
   stream to the SRS.

   Some of the data in the model may not be conveyed explicitly from the
   SRC to the SRS, if it can be obtained contextually by the SRS.  For
   instance, the timing of changes may not explicitly conveyed from the
   SRC to the SRC, because the mechanism (yet to be defined) which
   conveys the metadata may implicitly provide the timing.  (E.g. the
   time a change occurred by be assumed to be the same as the time when
   notification of the change is received by the SRS.)


4.  Recording Metadata elements

   This section describes the different elements and its attributes of
   the metadata model shown above.  This section also describes in brief
   on how the different elements of metadata are associated.

   A Recording Session element represents one instance of a Recording
   Session.

4.1.1.  Attributes

   A Recording Session element MAY have attributes like:
   o  Recording requestor ID(which could be SRS or SRC).
   o  Reason for recording - The reason for recording MAY be a policy(in
      a financial trading floor or Call centre) or to monitor a agent,
      or for quality purposes etc.

   o  Recording type - This attribute indicates whether the recording
      session is selective or persistent.

4.1.2.  Associations

   One instance of Recording Session SHALL have:

   o  Zero or more instances of Communication Session Group.This is to
      accommodate persistent recording cases.
   o  Each CS Group MUST be associated with one or more Recording
      Sessions [ setup potentially by multiple SRCs]

   NOTE: Need to check if the current cardinality between CS Group and
   RS is sufficient for all use cases of SIPREC

    Communication Session (CS)


   A Communication Session Group provides association or linking of
   Communication Sessions.

4.2.1.  Attributes

   A CS Group MUST have a Unique-ID attribute.  SRC MUST ensure the
   uniqueness of Unique-ID in case multiple SRC interacts with the same
   SRS.  The mechanism by which SRC creates this unique-ID and ensures
   its uniqueness is outside the scope of SIPREC.

   NOTE: Need more clarity/use cases on how the unique-ID SHALL be used

Internet-Draft           SIP Recording Metadata            December 2010


4.2.2.  Associations

   A communication Session Group SHALL be associated with RS and CS in
   the following manner:

   o  There can be one or more Recording Session elements per
      Communication Session Group.
   o  Each Communication Session Group MUST be associated with one or
      more RS [ setup potentially by multiple SRCs]
   o  There MAY be one or more Communication Sessions per CS Group [e.g.
      Consult Transfer]
   o  Each CS MUST be associated to one CS-Group

   NOTE: The current metadata model allows each CS to be associated to
   only one CS-Group block in the model.  It does not allow a CS to be
   associated with multiple CS-Groups concurrently.  Do we want to allow
   CSs to be concurrently associated (different views) with multiple CS-
   Groups in the model ?

   For e.g. from the perspective of customer or from the perspective of
   Agent or supervisor.  I can guess that storing these different
   perspectives may be useful at SRS as there may be applications that
   may query for one view(a customer's view or agents view or
   supervisors view).If we need to accommodate this kind of thing in the
   model, a CS has to be associated with multiple CS-Groups
   simultaneously.  The tricky question here though is how the SRC knows
   these different perspectives(views) and assign unique IDS for each
   grouping.

          Participant


   A Communication Session block/element in the metadata model
   represents Communication Session and its properties needed as seen by
   SRC.

4.3.1.  Attributes

   A communication Session block SHALL have the following attributes:

   o  Call Termination Reason - This represents the reason why a CS was
      terminated.  This MAY be derived from SIP Reason header of CS
   o  Retention - This attributes represent the value/duration for which
      Media streams of the CS needs to be retained
   o  Force Deletion - This attribute can be sent to SRS by SRC to
      delete the Media Streams of that CS immediately

   NOTE: Depending on where the SRC is located the direction may have
   some significance.  For example a B2BUA acting as SRC and located at
   a edge of an Enterprise may know whether is incoming/outgoing.
   Otherwise in a lot of 3PCC situations,the UA is the recipient of the
   INVITE request, even if the user requested the call.  Also, if the
   call is established by transfer from somebody else, it might always
   be incoming from the perspective of the localuser but might also be
   incoming from the perspective of the remote user.  So it may be
   tricky to find the direction in all cases.

   NOTE: Discussions are needed to conclude on some of the attributes
   and any other attributes ( like Direction, Initiator e.t.c)

4.3.2.  Associations

   A Communication Session SHALL be associated to CS-Group and
   Participant.  Cardinalities between CS and Participant allows:

   o  CS to have atleast two or more participants
   o  Participant may be associated with zero or more CS's (It is
      possible, though unlikely, that there are participants who are not
      part of any CS).  An example of such a case is participants in a
      premixed media stream.  The SRC may have knowledge of such
      Participants, yet not have any signaling relationship with them.
      This might arise if one participant in CS is a conf focus.
      Another use case is if one UA in CS works in 3pcc mode to acquire
      an MoH media stream, this might be reflected as unique source for
      media stream without having a reported signaling relationship to
      it.

   o  The model also allows participants in CS that are not participants
      in the media.  An example is the identity of a 3pcc controller
      that has initiated a CS to two or more participants of the CS.
      Another example is the identity of a conference focus.  Of course
      a focus is probably in the media, but since it may only be there
      as a mixer, it may not report itself as a participant in any of
      the media streams.

   o  Participant Type - This attribute can have values as "internal" or
      "external" or "don't know" (in cases where it is not possible to
      determine).

   NOTE: Need to conclude on what other attributes [ like End point
   information(IP, Port e.t.c), Device Type, Participant Role e.t.c] are
   needed to be represented in the model

4.4.2.  Associations

   Cardinalities between participant and Media Stream allows:

   o  Participant to receives zero or more media streams
   o  Participant to send zero or more media streams.  (Same participant
      provides multiple streams e.g. audio and video)
   o  Media stream to be received by zero or more participants.  Its
      possible, though perhaps unlikely, that a stream is generated but
      sent only to the SRC and SRS, not to any participant.  E.g.  In
      conferencing where all participants are on hold and the SRC is
      collocated with the focus.  Also a media stream may be received by
      multiple participants (e.g.  Whisper calls, side conversations).
   o  Media stream to be sent by one or more participants (pre-mixed
      streams).

   NOTE: Example of a case where a participant may receive Zero or more
   streams - a Supervisor may have side conversation with Agent, while
   Agent converses with customer.

   A Media Stream block shall have properties of media as seen by SRC
   and sent to SRS.  Different instances of Media Stream block would be
   created whenever there is a change in media (e.g. dir change like
   pause/resume and/or codec change and/or participant change.).

4.5.1.  Attributes

   A Media Stream block SHALL have the following attributes:

   o  Start Time - Represents Media Start time at SRC.
   o  End Time - Represents Media End time at SRC.
   o  Codec - represents codec parameters
   o  Media Stream Reference - In implementations this can reference to
      m-line

   OPEN ITEM: Is it required to model media streams that are not
   recorded[ e.g SRC offered certain media types but SRS choose to
   accept only subset of them] ?

   OPEN ITEM: How do we represent the Information that the SRC has
   regarding privacy/access of information(media) being recorded as an
   attribute in Media Stream OR can this be app data ?

   OPEN ITEM: How do we represent hold/resume from SRC to SRS and pause/
   resume from SRS to SRC in the model?

4.5.2.  Associations

   A Media Stream SHALL be associated with Participant the details of
   which are described in the Participant block section.

4.6.  Application Data

   A recording metadata object MAY have a opaque application data.  This
   opaque data is intended to be used by vendor specific applications on
   SRS.


5.  Metadata Model Object Instances

   This section describes the metadata model object instances for
   different use cases of SIPREC.  For the sake of simplicity as the
   media streams sent by each of the participants is received by every
   other participant in these use cases, it is NOT shown in the object
   instance diagram.

5.1.  Use case 1: Basic Call

   Basic call between two Participants A and B. In this use case each
   participant sends one Media Stream.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Recording Session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog
   [RFC3261] and media session and therefore make use of existing SIP
   security mechanisms for securing the Recording Session and Media
   Recording Metadata.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Not Applicable
