Internet-Draft            MPLS-TP NM Framework              October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a framework for using the MPLS-TP NM
   requirements [1] for managing the elements and networks that support
   a Transport Profile for MPLS.

   This framework relies on the management terminology from the ITU-T to
   describe the management architecture that could be used for an
   MPLS-TP management network.

1.1.  Terminology

   Communication Channel (CCh): A logical channel between network
   elements (NEs) that can be used - e.g. - management plane
   applications or control plane applications.  The physical channel
   supporting the CCh is technology specific.  An example of physical
   channels supporting the CCh is a DCC channel within SDH.

   Data Communication Network (DCN): a network that supports Layer 1
   (physical), Layer 2 (data-link), and Layer 3 (network) functionality
   for distributed management communications related to the management
   plane, for distributed signaling communications related to the
   control plane, and other operations communications (e.g., order-wire/
   voice communications, software downloads, etc.).

   Equipment Management Function (EMF): the management functions within
   an NE.  See ITU-T G.7710 [2].

   Local Craft Terminal (LCT): An out-of-band device that connects to an
   NE for management purposes.

   Management Application Function (MAF): An application process that
   participates in system management.  See ITU-T G.7710 [2].

   Management Communication Channel (MCC): A CCh dedicated for
   management plane communications.

   Message Communication Function (MCF): The communications process that
   performs functions such as information interchange and relay.  See
   ITU-T M.3013 [6].

   Management Communication Network (MCN): A DCN supporting management
   plane communication is referred to as a Management Communication
   Network (MCN).

   MPLS-TP NE: a network element (NE) that supports MPLS-TP functions.
   Another term that is used for a network element is node.  In terms of
   this document, the term node is equivalent to NE.

   MPLS-TP network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed.

   Network Element Function (NEF): The set of functions necessary to
   manage a network element.

   Operations System (OS): A system that performs the functions that
   support processing of information related to operations,
   administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) for the
   networks, including surveillance and testing functions to support
   customer access maintenance.

   Signaling Communication Network (SCN): A DCN supporting control plane
   communication is referred to as a Signaling Communication Network
   (SCN).

   Signaling Communication Channel (SCC): a CCh dedicated for control
   plane communications.  The SCC may be used for GMPLS/ASON signaling
   and/or other control plane messages (e.g., routing messages).


2.  Management Architecture

   The management of the MPLS-TP network could be based on a multi-
   tiered distributed management systems, for example as described in
   ITU-T M.3010 [7] and ITU-T M.3060/Y.2401 [8].  Each tier provides a
   predefined level of network management capabilities.  The lowest tier
   of this organization model includes the MPLS-TP Network Element that
   provides the transport service and the Operations System (OS) at the
   Element Management Level.  The management application function within
   the NEs and OSs provides the management support.  The management
   application function at each entity can include agents only, managers
   only, or both agents and managers.  The management application
   function that include managers are capable of managing an agent
   included in other management application functions.

   The management communication to peer NEs and/or Operations Systems
   (OSs) is provided via the message communication function within each
   entity (e.g.  NE and OS).  The user can access the management of the
   MPLS-TP transport network via a Local Craft Terminal (LCT) attached
   to the NE or via a Work Station (WS) attached to the OS.

2.1.  Network Management Architecture

   A transport Management Network (MN) may consist of several transport
   technology specific Management Networks.  Management network
   partitioning (Figure 1) below from ITU-T G.7710 [2] shows an example
   of management network partitioning.  Notation used in G.7710 for a
   transport technology specific MN is x.MN, where x is the transport

   specific technology.  In the example "O.MSN" is equivalent to an
   optical management subnetwork, and "S.MSN" is equivalent to an SDH
   management subnetwork.  A MPLS-TP specific MN might be abbreviated as
   MPLS-TP.MN.  Where there is no ambiguity, we will use "MN" for an
   MPLS-TP specific MN, and "MPLS-TP.MN" (or "MPLS- TP MN") and "MN"
   where both are used in a given context.

                      Management Network Partitioning

                                 Figure 1

   The management of the MPLS-TP network is be separable from the
   management of the other technology-specific networks, and operate
   independently of any particular client or server layer management
   plane.

   A MPLS-TP Management Network could be partitioned into MPLS-TP
   Management SubNetworks ("MPLS-TP.MSN" or "MPLS-TP MSN", or just "MSN"
   where usage is unambiguous) for consideration of scalability (e.g.
   geographic or load balancing) or administrative (e.g. administrative
   or ownership).

   The MPLS-TP MSN could be connected to other parts of the MN through
   one or more LCTs and/or OSs.  The message communication function
   (MCF) of an MPLS-TP NE initiates/terminates, routes, or otherwise
   processes management messages over CChs or via an external interface.

   Multiple addressable MPLS-TP NEs could be present at a single
   physical location (i.e. site or office).  The inter-site
   communications link between the MPLS-TP NEs will normally be provided
   by the CChs.  Within a particular site, the NEs could communicate via
   an intra-site CCh or via a LAN.

2.2.  Element Management Architecture

   The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP NE provides the
   means through which a management system manages the NE.

   The EMF interacts with the NE's transport functions by exchanging
   Management Information (MI) across the Management Point (MP)
   Reference Points.  The EMF may contain a number of functions that
   provide a data reduction mechanism on the information received across
   the MP Reference Points.

   The EMF includes functions such as Date & Time, FCAPS (Fault,
   Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security) management, and
   Control Plane functions.  The EMF provides event message processing,
   data storage and logging.  The management Agent, a component of the
   EMF, converts internal management information (MI signals) into
   Management Application messages and vice versa.  The Agent responds
   to Management Application messages from the message communication
   function by performing the appropriate operations on (for example)
   the Managed Objects in a Management Information Base (MIB), as
   necessary.  The message communication function contains
   communications functions related to the outside world of the NE (i.e.
   Date & Time source, Management Plane, Control Plane, Local Craft
   Terminal and Local Alarms).

   The Date & Time functions keep track of the NE's date/time which is
   used by the FCAPS management functions to e.g. time stamp event
   reports.

   Below are diagrams that illustrate the components of the element
   management function of a network element.  The high-level
   decomposition of the NEF picture (Figure 2) provides the breakdown of
   the Network Element Function, then the equipment management function
   picture (Figure 3) provides the details of Equipment Management
   Function, and finally the message communication function picture
   (Figure 4) details the Message Communication Function.

2.3.  Standard Management Interfaces

   The MPLS-TP NM requirements [1] document places no restriction on
   which management interface is to be used for managing an MPLS-TP
   network.  It is possible to provision and manage an end-to-end
   connection across a network where some segments are created/managed/
   deleted, for example by netconf or snmp and other segments by CORBA
   interfaces.  Use of any network management interface for one
   management related purpose does not preclude use of another network
   management interface for other management related purposes, or the
   same purpose at another time.  The protocol(s) to be supported are at

   the discretion of the operator.

2.4.  Management and Control specific terminology

   Data Communication Network (DCN) is the common term for the network
   used to transport Management and Signaling information between:
   management systems and network elements, management systems to other
   management systems, and networks elements to other network elements.
   The Management Communications Network (MCN) is the part of the DCN
   which supports the transport of Management information for the
   Management Plane.  The Signaling Communications Network (SCN) is the
   part of the DCN which supports transport for signaling information
   for the Control Plane.  As shown in the communication channel
   terminology picture (Figure 5) each technology has its own
   terminology that is used for the channels that support management and
   control plane information transfer.  For MPLS-TP, the management
   plane uses the Management Communication Channel (MCC) and the control
   plane uses the Signaling Communication Channel (SCC).

2.5.  Management Channel

   The Communication Channel (CCh) provides a logical channel between
   NEs for transferring Management and/or Signaling information.  Note
   that some technologies provide separate communication channels for
   Management (MCC) and Signaling (SCC).

   MPLS-TP NEs communicate via the DCN.  The DCN connects NEs with
   management systems, NEs with NEs, and management systems with
   management systems.

3.  Fault Management

   A fault is the inability of a function to perform a required action.
   This does not include an inability due to preventive maintenance,



Mansfield, et al.        Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            MPLS-TP NM Framework              October 2009


   lack of external resources, or planned actions.  Fault management
   provides the mechanisms to detect, verify, isolate, notify, and
   recover from the fault.

3.1.  Supervision

   ITU-T G.7710 [2] lists five basic categories of supervision that
   provide the functionality necessary to detect, verify, and notify a
   fault.  The categories are: Transmission Supervision, Quality of
   Service Supervision, Processing Supervision, Hardware Supervision,
   and Environment Supervision.  Each of the categories provides a set
   of recommendations to ensure the fault management process is
   fulfilled.

3.2.  Validation

   ITU-T G.7710 [2] describes a fault cause as a limited interruption of
   the required function.  It is not reasonable for every fault cause to
   be reported to maintenance personnel.  The validation process is used
   to turn fault causes (events) into failures (alarms).

3.3.  Alarm Handling

   Within an element management system, it is important to consider
   mechanisms to support severity assignment, alarm reporting control,
   and logging.


4.  Configuration Management

   Configuration management provides the mechanisms to provision the
   MPLS-TP services, setup security for the MPLS-TP services and MPLS-TP
   network elements, and provides the destination for fault
   notifications and performance parameters.  Inventory reporting is
   also considered part of configuration management.

   Associated with configuration management are hardware and software
   provisioning and inventory reporting.

4.1.  LSP ownership handover

   MPLS-TP networks can be managed not only by Network Management
   Systems (i.e. management plane), but also by control plane protocols.
   The utilization of the control plane is not a mandatory requirement
   (see MPLS-TP Requirements [3]) but it is often used by network
   operators in order to make network configuration and LSP recovery
   both faster and simpler.




Mansfield, et al.        Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            MPLS-TP NM Framework              October 2009


   In networks where both CP and MP are provided, an LSP could be
   created by either (CP or MP).  The entity creating an LSP owns the
   data plane resources comprising that LSP.  Only the owner of an LSP
   is typically able modify/delete it.  This results in a need for
   interaction between the MP and CP to allow either to manage all the
   resources of a network.

   Network operators might prefer to have full control of the network
   resources during the set-up phase and then allow the network to be
   automatically maintained by the control plane.  This can be achieved
   by creating LSPs via the management plane and subsequently
   transferring LSP ownership to the control plane.  This is referred to
   as "ownership handover" RFC 5493 [9].  MP to CP ownership handover is
   then considered a requirement where a control plane is in use that
   supports it.  The converse (CP to MP ownership handover) is a feature
   that is recommended - but not required - for (G)MPLS networks because
   it has only minor applications (for example moving LSPs from one path
   to another as a maintenance operation).

   The LSP handover procedure has already been standardized for GMPLS
   networks, where the signaling protocol used is RSVP-TE RFC 3209 [4].
   The utilization of RSVP-TE enhancements are defined in [5].

   MP and CP interworking includes also the exchange of information that
   is either requested by the MP, or a notification by the CP as a
   consequence of a request from the MP or an automatic action (for
   example a failure occurs or an operation is performed).  The CP is
   asked to notify the MP in a reliable manner about the status of the
   operations it performs and to provide a mechanism to monitor the
   status of control plane objects (e.g.  TE Link status, available
   resources), and to log control plane LSP related operations.  Logging
   is one of the most critical aspects because the MP always needs to
   have an accurate history and status of each LSP and all data plane
   resources involved in it.


5.  Performance Management

   Performance statistics could overwhelm a management network, so it is
   important to provide flexible instrumentation that provides control
   over the amount of performance data to be collected.

   A distinction is made between performance data that is collected on-
   demand and data that is collected proactively.

   On-demand measurement provides the operator with the ability to do
   performance measurement for maintenance purpose such as diagnosis or
   to provide detailed verification of proactive measurement.  It is



Mansfield, et al.        Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            MPLS-TP NM Framework              October 2009


   used typically on specific LSP service instances for a limited time,
   thus limiting its impact on network performance under normal
   operations.  Therefore on demand measurement does not result in
   scaling issues.

   Proactive measurement is used continuously over time after being
   configured with periodicity and storage information.  Data collected
   from proactive measurement are usually used for verifying the
   performance of the service.  Proactive performance monitoring has the
   potential to overwhelm both the process of collecting performance
   data at a network element (for some arbitrary number of service
   instances traversing the NE), and the process of reporting this
   information to the OS.  As a consequence of these considerations,
   operators would typically limit the services to which proactive
   performance measurement would be applied to a very selective subset
   of the services being provided and would limit the reporting of this
   information to statistical summaries (as opposed to raw or detailed
   performance statistics).

9.  Security Considerations

   Provisions to any of the network mechanisms designed to satisfy the
   requirements described herein need to prevent their unauthorized use
   and provide a means for an operator to prevent denial of service
   attacks if those network mechanisms are used in such an attack.

   Solutions need to provide mechanisms to prevent private information
   from being accessed by unauthorized eavesdropping, or being directly
   obtained by an unauthenticated network element, system or user.

   Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization
   involves extracting a significant amount of information about network
