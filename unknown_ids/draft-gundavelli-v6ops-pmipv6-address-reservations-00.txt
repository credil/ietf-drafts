        Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifier for Proxy Mobile IPv6
       draft-gundavelli-v6ops-pmipv6-address-reservations-00.txt

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] requires all the mobile access gateways
   to use a fixed link-local and link-layer addresses on any of its
   access links that it shares with the mobile nodes.  This was intended
   to ensure a mobile node does not detect any change with respect to
   its layer-3 attachment even after it roams from one mobile access
   gateway to another.  In the absence of any reserved addresses for
   this use, it requires coordination across vendors and the manual
   configuration of these addresses on all the mobility elements in a
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  This document attempts to simplify this
   operational requirement by making reservation for special addresses
   that can be used for this purpose.

Internet-Draft        Reserved IPv6 IID for PMIPv6             July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility management
   protocol that enables IP mobility support for a mobile node without
   requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.  The
   mobility elements in the network ensure that the mobile node does not
   detect any change with respect to its layer-3 attachment even after
   it roams from one mobile access gateway to another and changes its
   point of attachment in the network.  All the mobile access gateways
   in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 use a fixed link-local address and link-layer
   address on any of its access links that they share with the mobile
   nodes.  It essentially ensures a mobile node after performing an
   handoff does not detect any link change.

   The base Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] all though required the use of a
   fixed link-local and a fixed layer-layer address, it did not reserve
   any specific addresses for this purpose and this is proving to be a
   operational challenge in deployments involving multi-vendor
   equipment.  To address this problem, this specification makes the
   following two reservations.  The mobility elements in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain MAY choose to use these fixed addresses.

   This specification reserves an IPv6 interface identifier for Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].  The reserved IPv6 interface identifier can be
   used by all the mobile access gateways in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
   on any of its access links that it shares with the mobile node.  The
   mobile access gateway can use this reserved IPv6 interface identifier
   for generating the link-local address that it uses in the Neighbor
   Discovery [RFC4861] related communication with the mobile node.  This
   fixed identifier needs to be reserved from the registry, "Reserved
   IPv6 Interface Identifiers".

   Furthermore, this specification also reserves a IANA Ethernet unicast
   address for Proxy Mobile IPv6 use.  This reserved link-layer address
   can by used by the mobile access gateway in a Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain, in the layer-2 header for all packet communication with the
   mobile node.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213], [RFC5844].  All the IPv6 addressing related terminology is
   to be interpreted as specified in [RFC4291].


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following two IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification reserves an IPv6 interface identifier
      for Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].  This fixed identifier needs to
      be reserved from the registry, "Reserved IPv6 Interface
      Identifiers".

   o  Action-2: This specification reserves a IANA Ethernet unicast
      address for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This address needs to be reserved
      from the block.  "IANA Ethernet Address block - Unicast Use".


4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations known at this point
   of time, beyond what are identified in [RFC5213] and [RFC5453].


5.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Jari Arkko and Dave Thaler for all the
   discussions around the use of fixed link-local and link-layer
   address, during the standardization of Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].
