Internet-Draft          In-Vehicle Emergency Call              July 2008


Abstract

   This document describes how to use a subset of the IETF-based
   emergency call framework for accomplishing emergency calling support
   in vehicles.  Simplifications are possible due to the nature of the
   functionality that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage
   of GPS.  Additionally, further profiling needs to be done regarding
   the encoding of location information.

Internet-Draft          In-Vehicle Emergency Call              July 2008


1.  Introduction

   Emergency calls made from vehicles can assist with the objective of
   significantly reducing road deaths and injuries.  Unfortunately,
   drivers often have a poor location-awareness, especially on urban
   roads (also during night) and abroad.  In the most crucial cases, the
   victim(s) may not be able to call because they have been injured or
   trapped.

   In Europe the European Commission has launched the eCall initiative
   that may best be described as a "user instigated or automatic system
   to provide notification to 'Public Safety Answering Point's (PSAP),
   by means of cellular communications, that a vehicle has crashed, and
   to provide coordinates, a defined minimum set of data, and where
   possible a voice link to the PSAP.".  The current specifications
   being developed to offer the eCall solution are defined to work with
   circuit switched telephony.  This document details how the same
   functionality can be accomplished using IP-based mechanisms.  Since
   cellular systems are being replaced with IP-based infrastructure this
   document complements the ambigous goal to provide widespread
   availability of in-vehicular emergency services solutions.

   This document is organized as follows:  Section 2 defines the
   terminology, Section 3 illustrates the required protocol
   functionality, Section 4 indicates the required data that has to be
   transmitted within a PIDF-LO and Section 5 shows an example message
   exchange.  This document concludes with the security consideratoins
   in Section 6 and IANA considerations in Section 7.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document re-uses a lot of the terminology defined in Section 3
   of [9].

Internet-Draft          In-Vehicle Emergency Call              July 2008


3.  Protocol Profile

   The usage of in-vehicular emergency calls does not require the usage
   of a Location Configuration Protocol since GPS is used.  Furthermore,
   since the GPS receiver is permanently turned on it can even provide
   useful information in cases where the car entered a tunnel.
   Consequently, there is no need to discover any LIS.

   Since the emergency call within the car is either triggered by a
   button or, in most cases, automatically thanks to sensors mounted in
   the car there is no need to learn a dial string.  This document
   registers a separate Service URN, namely 'urn:service:ecall', used
   specifically for emergency calls that are triggered by vehicles.

   The following list provides information about the sections and
   requires of [2] that are relevant to this specification:

   Identifying an emergency call:  Emergency calls are detected at the
      end point, i.e., by the vehicle, and the Service URN
      'urn:service:ecall' MUST be implemented by the end point and
      recognized by the VSP.  The requirements listed in Section 5 of
      [2] are therefore irrelevant to this specification, as they deal
      with identifying an emergency call based on dial strings.

   Location:  The encoding of the PIDF-LO [3] is described in Section 4.
      In an emergency, the end point adds the available location
      information to the initial SIP INVITE emergency call message.  In
      special cases a location update may be provided, using the
      procedure described in requirement ED-38 of Section 6.8 of [2];
      all other aspects of Section 6.8 from that document are not
      applicable to this specification.  Section 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.4,
      6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 of [2] are not applicable to this document.  For
      location conveyance in SIP [4] MUST be used.  Further aspects that
      are not relevant for this document are multiple locations (Section
      6.9 of [2]), location validation (Section 6.10 of [2]), default
      location (Section 6.11 of [2])

   LoST:  Emergency call routing support, for example utilizing LoST, is
      provided by VSP.  As such, the description in Section 8 of [2] is
      applicable to this document, except for requirement SP-25 and
      SP-26 regarding legacy devices.

   Signaling of emergency calls:  Section 9 of [2] is applicable to this
      document with the following exceptions:  video and real-time text
      are not supported by the end device, ED-60/AN-25 is not applicable
      as HELD is not used.  Additionally, ED-62 dealing with "SIP
      signaling requirements for User Agents" is simplified as follows.
      The initial SIP signaling method is an INVITE request with the

Internet-Draft          In-Vehicle Emergency Call              July 2008


      following setting:

      1.   The Request URI MUST be the service URN 'urn:service:ecall'.

      2.   The To header MUST be a service URN 'urn:service:ecall'.

      3.   The From header MUST be present and SHOULD be the AoR of the
           caller.

      4.   A Via header MUST be present.

      5.   A Contact header MUST be present which MUST be globally
           routable to permit an immediate call-back to the specific
           device which placed the emergency call.

      6.   Other headers MAY be included as per normal SIP behavior.

      7.   A Supported header MUST be included with the 'geolocation'
           option tag [4].

      8.   The device MUST include location by-value into the call.

      9.   A normal SDP offer SHOULD be included in the INVITE.  If
           voice is supported the offer SHOULD include the G.711 codec,
           if a voice channel can be established based on the equipment
           in the car.

      10.  If the device includes location-by-value, the UA MUST support
           multipart message bodies, since SDP will likely be also in
           the INVITE.

      11.  The UAC MUST include a "inserted-by=endpoint" header
           parameter on all Geolocation headers.  This informs
           downstream elements which device entered the location at this
           URI (either cid-URL or location-by-reference URI).

      12.  SIP Caller Preferences [5] MAY be used to signal how the PSAP
           should handle the call.  For example, a language preference
           expressed in an Accept-Language header may be used as a hint
           to cause the PSAP to route the call to a call taker who
           speaks the requested language.  SIP Caller Preferences may
           also be used to indicate a need to invoke a relay service for
           communication with people with disabilities in the call.

   Call backs:  The description in Section 10 of [2] is not relevant for
      this document.

   Mid-call behavior:  The description in Section 11 of [2] is fully
      applicable to this document.

   Call termination:  [This item is for further discussion.]

   Disabling of features:  The description in Section 13 of [2] is fully
      applicable to this document.

   Media:  Real-time text and video are not supported.  If voice calls
      are supported then the description in Section 14 is applicable to
      this document.

   Testing:  The description in Section 15 of [2] is fully applicable to
      this document.

4.  Data Profile

   Due to the requirement for a built-in GPS receiver only geodetic
   location information will be sent within an emergency call.
   Furthermore, the number of location shapes is is restricted.  Hence,
   the following location shapes of [6] MUST be implemented:  2d and 3d
   Point (see Section 5.2.1 of [6]), Circle (see Section 5.2.3 of [6]),
   and Ellipsoid (see Section 5.2.7 of [6]).  The coordinate reference
   systems (CRS) specified in [6] are also mandatory for this document.
   Furthermore, the direction of travel of the vehicle is important for
   dispatch and hence it MUST be included in the PIDF-LO.  The <bearing>
   element specified in [7] MUST be supported.

5.  Example

   Figure 1 shows an emergency call placed from a vehicle whereby
   location information information is directly attached to the SIP
   INVITE message itself.  The call is marked as an emergency call using
   the 'urn:service:ecall' service URN and the PSAP of the VoIP provider
   determines which PSAP to contact based on the provided location
   information.  As shown in the figure, this route determination may be
   based on LoST.  Then, the emergency call continues towards the PSAP
   and in this example it hits the ESRP, as the entry point to the PSAP
   operators emergency services network.  Finally, the emergency call
   will be received by a call taker and first reponders will be
   dispatched.
