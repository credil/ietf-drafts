   Recent progress of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) has introduced 
   new signal types (i.e., ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex) 
   and new Tributary Slot granularity (1.25Gbps).

   ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers, the compatibility problem should be 
   considered. In addition, a Higher Order ODU (HO ODU) link may not 
   support all the types of Lower Order ODU (LO ODU) signals defined by 
   the new OTN standards because of the limitation of the devices at the 
   two ends of a link. In these cases, the control plane is required to 
   run the capability discovering functions for the evolving OTN. 

   This document describes the extensions to the Link Management 
   Protocol (LMP) needed to discover the capability of HO ODU link, 
   including the granularity of Tributary Slot to be used and the LO ODU 
   signal types that the link can support.

1. Introduction 

   The Link Management Protocol (LMP) defined in [RFC4204] is being 
   developed as part of the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to 
   manage Traffic Engineering (TE) links. 

   Recently, great progress has been made for the Optical Transport 
   Networking (OTN) technologies in ITU-T. New ODU containers (i.e., 
   ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex) and a new Tributary 
   Slot (TS) granularity (1.25Gbps) have been introduced by the [G709-
   Amd3], [Gsup43] and [G709draft-v3], enhancing the flexibility of OTNs. 

   With the evolution and deployment of G.709 technology, the backward 
   compatibility problem requires to be considered. In data plane, the 
   equipment supporting 1.25Gbps TS can combine the specific Tributary 
   Slots together (e.g., combination of TS#i and TS#i+4 on an HO ODU2 
   link) so that it can interwork with other equipments which support 
   2.5Gbps TS. From the control plane point of view, it is necessary to 
   discover which type of TS is supported at both ends of a link, so 
   that it can choose and reserve the TS resources correctly in this 
   link for the connection. 

   Additionally, the requirement of discovering the signal types of 
   Lower Order ODU (LO ODU) that can be supported by a Higher Order ODU 
   (HO ODU) should be taken into account. Equipment at one end of an HO 
   ODU link may not support to transport some types of LO ODU signals 
   (e.g., may not support the ODUflex). In this case, this HO ODU link 
   should not be selected for those types of LO ODU connections.  

   From the perspective of control plane, it is necessary to discover 
   the capability of an HO ODUk or OTUk link including the granularity 
   of TS to be used and the LO ODU signal types that the link can 
   support. This document extends the LMP and describes the solution of 
   discovering HO ODU link capability.

3. Overview of the Evolving G.709 

   The traditional OTN standard [G709-Amd1] describes the optical 
   transport hierarchy (OTH) and introduces three ODU signal types (i.e., 
   ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3). The ODUj can be mapped into one or more

   Tributary Slots (with a granularity of 2.5Gbps) of OPUk where j<k. 
   The ODUj can also be mapped into OTUj (j=1, 2 or 3) directly. 

   Recent revisions of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 have introduced new 
   features for Optical Transport Networks (OTN) ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, 
   ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex. The new features for the evolutive OTN 
   are described in the separate ITU-T documents. ODU0, ODU2e and ODU4 
   are described in [G709-Amd3]. ODU3e1 and ODU3e2 are described in 
   [Gsup43]. And ODUflex is being developed in [G709draft-v3]. 

   The ITU-T documents also define the new multiplexing hierarchy for 
   the evolving OTN. In this multiplexing hierarchy, LO ODUj can be 
   mapped into an OTUj, or multiplexed into an HO ODUk (where j<k) by 
   occupying several tributary slots. 

   In case of LO ODUj mapping into OTUj, the following mappings are 
   defined: 

      o ODU1 into OTU1 mapping 

      o ODU2 into OTU2 mapping 

      o ODU3 into OTU3 mapping 

      o ODU4 into OTU4 mapping 

      o ODU2e into OTU2e mapping 

   In case of LO ODUj multiplexing into HO ODUk, a new Tributary Slot 
   granularity (i.e., 1.25Gbps) is introduced in [G709-Amd3]. For the 
   evolving OTN, the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) 
   into an ODUk (k > j) signal can be depicted as follows: 

       -  ODU0 into ODU1 multiplexing (with 1,25Gbps TS granularity) 

       -  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex into ODU2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS      
          granularity) 

      -  ODU1 into ODU2 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

       -  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e and ODUflex into ODU3 multiplexing 
         (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

       -  ODU1, ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

      -  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3 and ODUflex into ODU4 
          multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity)

       - ODU2e into ODU3e1 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity) 

       - ODU2e into ODU3e2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity) 

   In order to be backward compatible with the 2.5Gbps TS defined in 
   [G709-Amd1], both the 2.5Gbps TS and the 1.25Gbps TS can be used in 
   the two cases listed below: 

      o ODU1 into ODU2 multiplexing 

      o ODU1 and ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing 

3.1. Data Plane Backward Compatibility 

   Equipment supporting a 1.25Gbps TS structure for OPU2 or OPU3 must be 
   backward compatible with equipment which supports only the 2.5G TS 
   structure. Specific Tributary Slots must be combined together (e.g., 
   combination of TS#i and TS#i+4 on an HO ODU2 link) for the LO ODU at 
   one end of the HO ODU link which supports the 1.25Gbps TS structure, 
   so that the LO ODU can be carried on the HO ODU link correctly. 

   In the following example, suppose that the two ends of an ODU2 or 
   ODU3 link support different TS structure, where node A supports the 
   1.25Gbps TS structure, while node B supports the 2.5Gbps TS, as shown 
   in the figure below: 

          +-----+                            +-----+ 
          |     |                            |     | 
          |  A  +-------ODU2/ODU3 link-------+  B  | 
          |     |                            |     | 
          +-----+                            +-----+ 
     (Support 1.25G TS)                  (Support 2.5G TS) 
    

   o In case of ODU1 multiplexing into ODU2, node A maps the ODU1 into 
      the TS#i and TS#i+4 (where i<=4) (with the granularity of 1.25Gbps) 
      of OPU2, so that node B can retrieve the ODU1 from the TS#i (with 
      the granularity of 2.5Gbps) of the OPU2, and vice versa. 

   o In case of ODU1 multiplexing into ODU3, node A maps the ODU1 into 
      the TS#i and TS#i+16 (where i<=16) (with the granularity of 
      1.25Gbps) of OPU3, so that node B can retrieve the ODU1 from the 
      TS#i (with the granularity of 2.5Gbps) of the OPU3, and vice versa. 

   o In case of ODU2 multiplexing into ODU3, node A maps the ODU2 into 
      the TS#a/TS#a+16, TS#b/TS#b+16, TS#c/TS#c+16 and TS#d/TS#d+16 
      (where a<b<c<d<=16) (with the granularity of 1.25Gbps) of OPU3, so

      that node B can retrieve the ODU2 from the TS#a, TS#b, TS#c and 
      TS#d (with the granularity of 2.5Gbps) of the OPU3, and vice versa. 

4. Link Capability Discovery Requirements 

4.1. Discovering the Granularity of the TS 

   As described in section 3.1, if the two ends of a link use different 
   granularities of TS, The LO ODU must be mapped into specific combined 
   Tributary Slots in the end of link with TS of 1.25Gbps. 

   From the perspective of control plane, when creating a LO ODU 
   connection, the node MUST select and reserve specific TS for the 
   connection if the two ends of a link use different granularities of 
   TS. For example, for an ODU2 link, we suppose that node A only 
   supports the 2.5Gbps TS while node B supports the 1.25Gbps TS. When 
   node B receives a Path message from node A requesting an ODU1 
   connection, node B MUST reserve the TS#i and TS#i+4 (where i<=4) 
   (with the granularity of 1.25Gbps) and tell node A via the label 
   carried in the Resv message that the TS#i (with the granularity of 
   2.5Gbps) among the 4 slots has been reserved for the ODU1 connection. 
   Otherwise, the reservation procedure will fail. 

          +-----+         Path          +-----+ 
          |     |    ------------>      |     | 
          |  A  +-------ODU2 link-------+  B  | 
          |     |    <-------------     |     | 
          +-----+         Resv          +-----+ 
     (Support 2.5G TS)              (Support 1.25G TS) 
                           
   Therefore, for an ODU2 or ODU3 link, in order to reserve TS resources 
   correctly for a LO ODU connection, the control plane of the two ends 
   MUST know which granularity the other end can support before creating 
   the LO ODU connection. 

4.2. Discovering the Supported LO ODU Signal Types 

   Many new ODU signal types are introduced by [G709-Amd3], [Gsup43] and 
   [G709draft-v3], such as ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex. 
   It is possible that equipment does not always support all the LO ODU 
   signal types introduced by those new standards or drafts. If one end 
   of an HO ODU link can not support a certain LO ODU signal type, the 
   HO ODU link can not be selected to carry such type of LO ODU 
   connection. 

   For example, in the following figure, if the interfaces IF1, IF2, IF8, 
   IF7, IF5 and IF6 can support ODUflex signals, while the interfaces IF 
 
 
Zhang                    Expires March 2010                   [Page 6] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-g.709-lmp-discovery-00.txt       September 2009 


   3 and IF4 can not support ODUflex signals. In this case, if one 
   ODUflex connection from A to C is requested, link #1 and #2 should be 
   excluded, link #3 and link #4 are the candidates (the possible path 
   could be A-D-C through link #3 and link #4).    

                              +-----+ 
                    link #3   |     |  link #4 
            +-----------------+  D  +-----------------+ 
            |              IF8|     |IF7              | 
            |                 +-----+                 | 
            |                                         | 
            |IF1                                   IF6| 
         +--+--+              +-----+              +--+--+ 
         |     |    link #1   |     |    link #2   |     | 
         |  A  +--------------+  B  +--------------+  C  | 
         |     |IF2        IF3|     |IF4        IF5|     | 
         +-----+              +-----+              +-----+ 
    

   Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of an HO ODU link to 
   discover which types of LO ODU can be supported by the HO ODU link. 
   After discovering, the capability information can be flooded by IGP, 
   so that the correct path for an ODU connection can be calculated. 

5. Extensions: LMP Link Summary Message  

   [RFC4204] defines the Link Management Protocol (LMP) which consists 
   of four main procedures: control channel management, link property 
   correlation, link connectivity verificataion, and fault management. 
   As part of LMP, the link property correlation is used to verify the 
   consistency of the TE and data link information on both sides of a 
   link. This document extends the link property correlation procedure 
   to discover the capability of both sides of an HO ODU link. 

   The designated HO ODU overhead bytes (e.g., the GCC1 and GCC2 
   overhead bytes) can be used as the control channel to carry the LMP 
   message after the HO ODU link is created. The out-band Data 
   Communication Network (DCN) can also be used. 

5.1. Message Extension 

   Three messages are used for link property correlation: LinkSummary, 
   LinkSummaryAck and LinkSummaryNack Message. This document does not 
   change the basic procedure of LMP but just add a new subobject (HO

   ODU Link Capability Subobject) in the DATA_LINK object to carry the 
   capability of one end of an HO ODU link. 

   The formats of LinkSummary, LinkSummaryAck and LinkSummaryNack 
   messages are defined in [RFC4204]. 

5.1.1. LinkSummary Message 

   The local end of a TE link can send a LinkSummary message to the 
   remote end to start the negotiation about the capability that the TE 
   link can support.  

   One new Subobject named HO ODU Link Capability Subobject in the 
   DATA_LINK object is introduced by this document. This new subobect is 
   used to tell the remote end of the HO ODU link which are the TS 
   granularity and the LO ODU signal types that the local end can 
   support. When the DATA_LINK object carries the new HO ODU Link 
   Capability Subobject, the N flag SHOULD be set to 1 which means that 
   the subobject is negotiable.  

5.1.2. LinkSummaryAck Message 

   The LinkSummaryAck message is used to tell the remote end that it has 
   the same capability as the remote end after the LinkSummary message 
   is received by the local end. 

5.1.3. LinkSummaryNack Message 

   The LinkSummaryNack message is used to tell the remote end that it 
   has different capability from the remote end after the LinkSummary 
   message is received by the local end. The LinkSummaryNack message 
   also carries the HO ODU Link Capability Subobject in the DATA_LINK 
   object to tell the remote end the exact capability of the HO ODU link 
   after negotiation, i.e., the granularity of TS and the types of LO 
   ODU that both side of the HO ODU link can support. 

5.2. Object Definitions  

   A new HO ODU Link Capability subobject type is introduced to the DATA 
   LINK object to carry the HO ODU link capability information. The 
   format of the new subobject is defined as follow:

5.3. Procedures 

   The Link Summary messages used for capability discovery for HO ODUk 
   or OTUk link are sent between adjacent nodes after the HO ODU link is 
   created or driven by some events (e.g., an operator command). The 
   procedure is described below: 

   o The local end of the HO ODU link sends a LinkSummary message 
      including one or more DATA_LINK objects, each of which contains 
      the Local_Interface_Id, the Remote_Interface_Id, and the HO ODU 
      link capability subobject. This subobject carries the capability 
      that the local end can support, i.e., the granularity of TS and 
      the set of LO ODU signal types that the local end can support. The 
      LinkSummary message is sent to the remote end. 

   o On receipt of the LinkSummary message, the remote end of the HO 
      ODU link firstly determines whether the local/remote Interface_Id

      mappings match those that are stored locally as described in 
      [RFC4204], and then obtains the HO ODU link capability subobject 
      and determines the capability of the HO ODU link that both ends 
      can support. The detail procedures are as follow: 

      - Only if both ends support the 1.25Gbps TS, the remote end would 
         choose the 1.25Gbps as the negotiated granularity for the HO 
         ODU link. In other cases, the 2.5Gbps TS MUST be used (i.e., if 
         the local end can support 1.25Gbps, and the remote end can 
         support 2.5Gbps, and then the local end should imitate 2.5Gbps). 

      - The remote end compares the two sets of LO ODU signal types 
         that the local end and the remote end can support, and 
         calculates the intersection of them, i.e., extracts all the LO 
         ODU signal types that both two ends can support. This 
         intersection is the set of LO ODU signal types that the HO ODU 
         link can support. 

   o If both the two ends support the same capability, i.e., they 
      support the same granularity of TS and the same LO ODU signal 
      types, the remote end replies a LinkSummaryAck message to the 
      local end. So the both ends know what capability the HO ODU link 
      can support. 

   o If the two ends support different capabilities, i.e., they support 
      different granularities of TS or different LO ODU signal types, 
      the remote end replies a LinkSummaryNack message to the local end. 
      The LinkSummaryNack message carries an ERROR_CODE object and one 
      or more DATA_LINK objects. The ERROR_CODE object indicates that 
      the two ends of the HO ODU link support different capabilities, 
      and the DATA_LINK object carries the HO ODU link capability 
      subobject which contains the negotiated granularity of TS and the 
      set of LO ODU signal types that both ends can support. The local 
      end can learn the HO ODU link capability after receiving the 
      LinkSummaryNack message. 

   o If the remote end does not support the HO ODU link capability 
      negotiation procedure, the LinkSummaryNack message MUST be 
      responded with an ERROR_CODE indicating the reason of rejection.
