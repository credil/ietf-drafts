                 draft-randriamasy-alto-mobile-core-00

Abstract

   The ALTO working group provides guidance to P2P applications, which
   have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, that
   are able to provide a desired resource.  This guidance shall be based
   on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data
   transmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance.  The
   ultimate goal is to improve performance (or Quality of Experience) in
   the application while reducing resource consumption in the underlying
   network infrastructure.

   The present document addresses the case of ALTO transactions
   involving a peers connected via a mobile core network.  It proposes
   specific scopes and use cases for mobile core networks and as a first
   step, properties of paths and endpoints that allow to facilitate ALTO
   transaction within such a scope.

Internet-Draft              alto-mobile-core                October 2010


1.  Introduction

   An ALTO Server could support many properties about Endpoints beyond
   their network location or grouping.  For example, connection type,
   geographical location, and others may be useful to applications.  The
   current ALTO protocol draft [ID-alto-protocol5] considers the peer
   selection problem from a broadband ISP perspective and focuses on
   metrics that are almost static and relate mainly to topological
   distance and routing cost in IP networks.

   Mobile network resources are scarce and the endpoints may move.
   Therefore, Mobile operators may wish to integrate P2P techniques
   (including P2PTV) in order to take advantage of powerful and cheap
   techniques to deliver resources like TV channels, instead of using
   complex and costly client/server centralized solutions.  Such
   operators may need to optimize P2P traffic by selecting mobile
   endpoints based on the underlying mobile network topology itself.

   The present document proposes to define ALTO protocol features that
   are specific to Mobile Core networks.  As a first example, it
   proposes an extension to the ALTO protocol that allow to identify and
   locate a peer within a 3GPP mobile network.  It actually specifies
   3GPP network location identifiers to be conveyed in the ALTO
   messages.


2.  ALTO usage in Mobile Core Networks

   This section discusses an approach to perform peer selection using
   information from an ALTO server operated by a mobile network
   operator.

2.1.  Architecture and Peer Selection Model

   In the approach described here, we assume a peer selection model
   where the resource directory returns a list of potential resource
   providers.

   Figure 1 shows the Mobile Core-ALTO integrated architecture that is
   discussed in this document:

   The way the ALTO Server associates the network coordinates of a
   mobile user to a corresponding peer is out of the scope of the
   present document.

2.2.  ALTO Scope for Mobile Core Network

   Mobile core networks have smaller sizes as ISP Core networks in terms
   of topology.  On the other hand they have a higher degree of topology
   change in terms of their connections to end nodes.  Above all, they
   need to cope with limited resources.  This motivates and justifies
   the use of Mobile Core specific Alto services that report the
   mobility of particular endpoints thay support and that can afford the
   high dynamicity of ALTO information, because of the smaller size of
   the network the Alto servers report on.

2.2.1.  Spatial scope of Mobile Core ALTO

   The spatial scope of Mobile Core (MC) ALTO Servers is restricted to
   the MC.  One option is the MC ALTO Servers communicate with ALTO
   Servers managed by the same ISP but located and reporting on the ISP
   Core network.

2.2.2.  Time scope of Mobile Core ALTO

   Any information can have a lifetime as long a that of ISP core Alto.
   However MC ALTO can handle information with a shorter lifetime.  A
   reduced time scope serves mainly the purpose of tracking the mobility

   of attaches Endpoints.

2.3.  Scenario and use case

   Mobile Core ALTO integration is illustrated with the use case where:
   an ALTO client is embedded in the client, the endpoints evaluation
   and ranking are outsourced to the ALTO Server before the client
   performs the final selection.  It is then the duty of the resource
   consumer to invoke ALTO, in order to solicit the ISP guidance
   regarding this list.

   Figure 2. below shows an example of this scenario.

Figure 2: Mobile Core ALTO with an ALTO Client embedded in a P2P Client


   The use case proceeds as follows:

   1.  The P2P Client discovers peers from sources such as Peer Exchange
       (PEX) from other P2P Clients, Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), and
       P2P Trackers.

   2.  The P2P Client queries its ALTO Server, including discovered
       peers as the set of Destination Network Locations, and indicates
       the 'ordinal' Cost Mode (It means that the returned Cost Map
       indicates the ranking of the candidate peers) and its coordinates
       in the Mobile network.

   3.  The P2P Client connects to the peers in the order specified in
       the ranking.

   Do note that there may be an alternative way to integrate ALTO
   services into Mobile Core networks, where a P2P application that

Internet-Draft              alto-mobile-core                October 2010


   makes use of a centralized resource directory (in some specific P2P
   implementations called a "tracker").  In this scenario the ALTO
   servers receive queries only from few entities, i.e., the resource
   directories.  As these resource directories must be powerful machines
   anyway, it may be reasonable to send large amounts of ALTO guidance
   data to them, which will be cached there.  Furthermore, in this
   scenario it may be possible to hide the exact addresses of the peers
   from the ALTO server.  This latter case is out of scope of the
   present document.


3.  Example: ALTO usage in 3GPP framework

   This section provides an example of MC specific information involved
   in MC ALTO transaction.  The example information is the 3GPP location
   information on the client querying a MC ALTO Ranknig service.  Such
   informaiton is currently out of scope of the ALTO protocol.  The
   purpose is to initiate the introduction of MC specific information
   and define its consequences in the ALTO Protocol.

3.1.  3GPP Registration, Location and Routing Areas

   [3GPP.23.002] describes how works the 3GPP Location management.  It
   involves the following functions:

   o  HLR (Home Location Register): The HLR is a database that holds
      information concerning the subscribers.  It performs the following
      functions:

      *  handling of permanent subscriber data (identification,
         subscription information, service limitation)

      *  handling of temporary subscriber data:

         +  current VLR, SGSN addresses where the subscriber roams

         +  security information

      *  dialogue with the AuC (Authentication Center) database

   o  VLR (Visitor Location Register): The VLR contains all the
      subscriber data required for call handling and other purposes for
      mobile subscribers currently located in the area controlled by the
      VLR.  The VLR supports a mobile paging and tracking subsystem in
      the local area where the mobile is presently roaming.

   Several area types have been defined in UMTS to handle user mobility:

Internet-Draft              alto-mobile-core                October 2010


   o  Location Area (LA):

      *  an LA contains a group of cells, each cell belonging to one LA,

      *  LAs are used by the Core Network (CS domain) to get information
         on the user location when in the idle mode,

      *  LA consists of a number of cells belonging to the RNCs that are
         connected to the same CN node, i.e. one 3G_MSC/VLR,

      *  the mapping between one LA and the RNCs is handled within the
         MSC/VLR owning this LA.

   o  Routing Area (RA):

      *  an RA contains a group of cells, each cell belonging to one RA,

      *  RAs are used by the Core Network (PS domain) to get information
         on the user location when in the idle mode,

      *  one RA consists of a number of cells belonging to RNCs that are
         connected to the same CN node, i.e. one 3G_SGSN,

      *  the mapping between one RA and RNCs is handled within the SGSN
         owning this RA.

   o  UMTS Registration Area (URA): when the UE is in connected mode and
      is using common and/or shared channels, the network can locate it
      on the cell basis or on the URA basis, depending on its level of
      activity and mobility.

   o  Service Area (SA): one SA may consist of one country, be a part of
      a country or include several countries.

3.2.  ALTO messages

3.2.1.  3GPP Path Ranking Query/Response

   Below is the format of the ALTO Endpoint Ranking Query message, as
   described in [ID-alto-protocol5] .  It says the Query message from
   the ALTO Client MUST follow one of the forms described in the
   document.  The ALTO Query message allows an ALTO Client to query for
   costs amongst an arbitrary set of sources and destinations.

   Here, the ALTO Path Rating Lookup query message is used by mobile
   users to order the list of peers gathered by the P2P network itself
   (e.g. from a P2P tracker).  It follows the form that allows an ALTO
   Client query for costs from a single Endpoint or PID to all other

   PIDs.

      Method : 'POST'

      URI Path : '/cost/m'

      URI QS Params :

         'mode=[costmode]'

         'constraint=[constraint]'

      Headers :

      Body :

   As stated in [ID-alto-protocol5], the ALTO Path Ranking Response
   message MUST follow:

      Status Code includes:

         '200' if all PIDs specified in request are valid, or no PIDs
         are specified in request.

         '404' if at least one PID specified in request is not valid.

         '501' if specified cost type is not supported

         '501' if constraints not supported but are included

      Headers :

3.2.2.  3GPP Cost Map Specifications

   The 3GPP ALTO Path Ranking Query must carry the parameters that
   identify and locate the mobile user.  These parameters are described
   in Section 3.2.2.1

3.2.2.1.  User Identification

   The 3GPP ALTO query must contain the data and procedures which
   unambiguously and securely identify the mobile user.  These functions
   are typically embedded in a stand alone smart card.  This device is
   associated with a given user, and as such allows to identify this
   user regardless of the ME (Mobile Equipment) he uses.

Internet-Draft              alto-mobile-core                October 2010


   The USIM card (UMTS Subscriber Identity Module card) allows the
   identification of any mobile subscriber (MS) by the network.  In
   particular, the subscriber can borrow any mobile without changing
   anything from the network point of view since he keeps the same USIM-
   card.

   The USIM card contains the following information:

   o  the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI);

   o  the Mobile Station International ISDN Number (MSISDN);

   o  the preferred language and the UE options;

   o  the secret key K, for the security procedures;

   o  the ciphering and integrity algorithms, that are part of the
      security system;

   o  the temporary mobile subscriber identities for PS and CS domains
      (TMSI and P-TMSI);

   o  the location and routing area identities: LAI and RAI;

   o  the forbidden networks list;

   o  the services list (CS and PS domain).

   A unique IMSI is allocated to each subscriber MS in the UMTS system
   and is composed of three parts:

   1.  The Mobile Country Code (MCC) identifies uniquely the country of
       domicile of the MS.

   2.  The Mobile Network Code (MNC), identifies the home GSM PLMN of
       the MS.

   3.  Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) identifying the MS
       within a GSM PLMN.

   The National Mobile Subscriber Identity (NMSI) consists of the MNC
   and the MSIN.

   In order to support the subscriber identity confidentiality service,
   the VLRs and SGSNs may allocate Temporary Mobile Subscriber
   Identities (TMSI) to visiting MSs.  The VLR and SGSNs must be capable
   of correlating an allocated TMSI with the IMSI of the mobile UE to
   which it is allocated.

   A UE may be allocated two TMSIs, one for services provided through
   the MSC, and the other for services provided through the SGSN (P-TMSI
   for short).
