Abstract

   This memo corrects the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) production
   rule associated with generating IPv6 literals in RFC3261.  It also
   clarifies the rule for Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) comparison
   when the URIs contain textual representation of IP addresses.

Internet-Draft                SIP IPv6 ABNF                February 2008


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].


2.  Problem statement

2.1.  Extra colon in IPv4-mapped IPv6 address

   The ABNF [4] for generating IPv6 literals in RFC3261 [1] is
   incorrect.  When generating IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, the
   production rule may actually generate the following construct:

   [2001:db8:::192.0.2.1] - Note the extra colon before the IPv4
   address.

   The correct construct, of course, would only include two colons
   before the IPv4 address.

      Historically, the ABNF pertaining to IPv6 references in RFC3261
      was derived from Appendix B of RFC 2373 [6], which was flawed to
      begin with (see also RFC2373 errata at
      http://www.rfc-editor.org/cgi-bin/errataSearch.pl?rfc=2373.)
      RFC2373 has been subsequently obsoleted by RFC 4291 [5].

   The ABNF for IPv6 reference is reproduced from RFC3261 below:

     IPv6reference  =  "[" IPv6address "]"
     IPv6address    =  hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
     IPv4address    =  1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
     hexpart        =  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
     hexseq         =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
     hex4           =  1*4HEXDIG

   Note that the ambiguity occurs in the "IPv6address" production rule
   where the "IPv4address" non-terminal is prefixed by ":" token.
   Because the "hexpart" production rule is defined such that two of its
   alternatives already include the "::" token, this may yield to the
   faulty construction of an IPv6-mapped IPv4 address with an extra
   colon when expanding those alternatives.

2.2.  Comparing URIs with textual representation of IP addresses

   In SIP, URIs are compared for a variety of reasons.  Registrars
   compare URIs when they receive a binding update request, for
   instance.  Section 19.1.4 of RFC3261 [1] provides the rules for

Internet-Draft                SIP IPv6 ABNF                February 2008


   comparing URIs.  Among other rules, it states that:

      For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port
      components must match.

   Does the above rule then imply that the following URIs are equal:

      sip:bob@[::ffff:192.0.2.128] = sip:bob@[::ffff:c000:280]?

      sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:1] = sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:01]?

      sip:bob@[0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38] = sip:bob@
      [::FFFF:129.144.52.38]?

   In all of the above examples, the textual representation of the IPv6
   address is different, but these addresses are binary equivalent.
   Section 19.1.4 of RFC3261 does not provide any rule for URIs
   containing different textual representations of IPv6 addresses that
   all correspond to the same binary equivalent.

      Note that the same ambiguity occurs for IPv4 addresses, i.e., is
      192.0.2.128 = 192.00.02.128?  However, IPv6, with its compressed
      notation and the need to represent hybrid addresses (like IPv4-
      mapped IPv6 addresses) makes the representation issue more acute.
      The resolution discussed in Section 3.2 applies to textual
      representations of both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.


3.  Resolution

3.1.  Resolution for extra colon in IPv4-mapped IPv6 address

   The resolution to this ambiguity is simply to use the correct ABNF
   for the "IPv6address" production rule from Appendix A of RFC3986 [3].
   For the sake of completeness, it is reproduced below:
















Gurbani, et al.          Expires August 17, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                SIP IPv6 ABNF                February 2008


    IPv6address   =                             6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"

     h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
     ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
     IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
     dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT            ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT     ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35          ; 250-255


   Accordingly, following the SIP essential corrections process [7],
   this memo RECOMMENDS that the "IPv6address" and "IPv4address"
   production rules be deleted from RFC3261 and replaced with the
   production rules of the same name in RFC3986 (and reproduced above.)
   These changes, when made to RFC3261, will make "hexpart", "hexseq",
   and "hex4" production rules obsolete.  Thus this memo RECOMMENDS that
   the "hexpart", "hexseq", and "hex4" production rules be deleted from
   the ABNF of RFC3261.

3.2.  Clarification for comparison of URIs with textual representation
      of IP addresses

   The resolution to this ambiguity is a simple clarification
   acknowledging that the textual representation of an IP addresses
   varies, but it is the binary equivalence of the IP address that must
   be taken into consideration when comparing two URIs that contain
   varying textual representation of an IP address.

   Accordingly, following the SIP essential corrections process [7],
   this memo RECOMMENDS that the an existing rule from the bulleted list
   in Section 19.1.4 of RFC3216 be modified as follows:

Internet-Draft                SIP IPv6 ABNF                February 2008


   OLD:

   o  For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port
      components must match.

   NEW:

   o  For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port
      components must match.  If the host component contains textual
      representation of IP addresses, then the representation of those
      IP addresses may vary.  If so, the host components are considered
      to match if the different textual representations yield the same
      binary IP address.

   In addition, this memo RECOMMENDS that the text in the following
   paragraph be added to the existing list of examples in Section 19.1.4
   of RFC3261 in order to demonstrate the intent of the modified rule:

   The following URIs are equivalent because the underlying binary
   representation of the IP addresses are the same although their
   textual representations vary:

      sip:bob@[::ffff:192.0.2.128]
      sip:bob@[::ffff:c000:280]

      sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:1]
      sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:01]

      sip:bob@[0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38]
      sip:bob@[::FFFF:129.144.52.38]
