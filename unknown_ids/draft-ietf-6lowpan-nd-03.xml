	  <t>
	  This document specifies Neighbor Discovery optimized for 6LoWPAN. 
	  The 6LoWPAN format allows IPv6 to be used over energy and bandwidth 
	  constrained wireless networks often making use of multihop 
	  topologies. However, the use of standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery with 
	  6LoWPAN has several problems. Standard Neighbor Discovery was not designed 
	  for non-transitive wireless links, and the standard IPv6 link concept and 
	  heavy use of multicast makes it inefficient. This document specifies a new ND mechanism
	  allowing for the efficient detection of duplicate addresses over entire LoWPANs while avoiding or simplifying other ND operations. In addition it specifies context dissemination for use with router advertisements, claim and defend address generation,
	  and the support of Extended LoWPANs over backbone links.

	<section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

	  <t>The IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="RFC4944"/> document has specified 
	  how to carry IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 and similar networks with the
  	  help of an adaptation header which comes before the IP header.  
	  A link in 6LoWPAN is characterized as lossy, low-power, low bit-rate, short 
	  range, with many nodes saving energy with long deep sleep periods. Multicast as used in 
	  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> is not desirable in 
	  such a wireless low-power, lossy network. </t>
	  
	  <t>Moreover, LoWPAN links are non-symmetric and transient in nature; they are 
	  not always considered to be in a fixed network nor are they bounded by 
	  our standard definition of a wired-link. A LoWPAN is potentially composed of a potentially large amount of overlapping radio ranges, eventually federated by a backbone or a backhaul link. Although a given radio range
	  has broadcast capabilities, the aggregation of these is a complex Non-Broadcast
	  MultiAccess (NBMA, <xref target="RFC2491"/>) structure with no multicast 
	  capabilities. Link-local scope is in reality defined by 
	  reachability and radio strength. The standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
	  <xref target="RFC4861"/> control messages, the use of multicast and their 
	  default frequency also attribute to unnecessary waste of energy in LoWPANs.</t>

	  <t>Neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN provides for basic bootstrapping and network
	  operation, along with advanced features such as claim and defend address generation and 
	  Extended LoWPANs over backbone links, while avoiding the use of multicast flooding. 
	  The solution supports the use of both link-layer or LoWPAN mesh (Mesh Under) and IP routing (Route Over) multihop solutions. Unlike standard IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/>, this document specifically takes the characteristics of low-power, lossy wireless links into account.</t>
	  
	  <t>This specification introduces a registration mechanism over 
	  the radio edge of the NBMA network and proxy operation over the federating 
	  backbone or backhaul. That registration mechanism provides a service
	  somewhat similar to the Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) <xref target="RFC2022"/> for a limited purpose, and in a lot simpler and less generic fashion. For those link scope
	  multicasts that could not be avoided, such as for Router Advertisements, optimizations like the Trickle algorithm may be used to optimize the dissemination of the information in the Low Power network.</t>
	  
	  <t>The concept of a LoWPAN Whiteboard located at Edge Routers (ERs) is introduced, 
	  which allows for duplicate address detection and claim and defend addressing for the entire LoWPAN. Address resolution is not needed, and thus makes LoWPAN
	  operation power efficient and to reduces LoWPAN Node complexity. A new
	  registration/confirmation message sequence is specified, allowing nodes to 
	  register their IPv6 addresses with an Edge Router. </t>
	  
	  <t> The Whiteboard makes use of soft bindings, thus nodes send periodic registration messages in order to maintain their bindings. Changes in network topology, and mobility between ERs and LoWPANs are supported. The dissemination of 
	  RA information between LoWPAN Routers in multihop IP LoWPANs is also discussed.</t>
	  
	  <t>This document also specifies the seamless integration of an Extended LoWPAN with 
	  multiple edge routers on a shared backbone link (e.g. Ethernet) to form a 
	  single IPv6 subnet. This allows nodes to keep the same IPv6 address throughout 
	  a large network, and allows for easy communications with nodes over the backbone link and with other IPv6 hosts.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>The document defines two new ICMPv6 messages: Node Registration and Node Confirmation. In addition a new 6LOWPAN_ER anycast address is introduced, used by LoWPAN Routers in order to relay a registration message to any Edge Router.</t>
	  
	  <section anchor='goals+assumptions' title="Goals & Assumptions">

	  <t>This document has the following main goals and makes several assumptions.</t>

	  <t>Goals:
	    <list>
	    	 <t>o Enable ND operations over an entire LoWPAN, even with 
	    	 non-transitive links and over multihop IP hops.</t>
	  	 <t>o Minimize signalling by avoiding the use of multicast flooding and reducing the frequency of link scope multicast for ND messages inside the LoWPANs.</t>
	  	 <t>o Disseminate context information throughout the LoWPAN.</t>
	  	 <t>o Minimize the complexity of LoWPAN Nodes.</t>
	  	 <t>o Interconnect LoWPANs with backbone links seamlessly.</t>	  	 
	  	 <t>o Provide a mechanism for claim and defend addressing.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	  <t>Assumptions:
	    <list>
		 <t>o Link layer technology may be e.g. IEEE 802.15.4 as in <xref target="RFC4944"/>, or any other suitable link-layer.</t>
	    	 <t>o Link-local IPv6 addresses are derived from a unique identifier (e.g. EUI-64).</t>
	    	 <t>o There is a direct mapping between the IPv6 address IID and the link-layer address (as in e.g. <xref target="RFC4944"/>), thus address resolution is not required.</t>
	  	 <t>o A subnet includes all the LoWPAN Nodes, Edge Router(s) and optionally their backbone link sharing the same IPv6 prefix.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

        </section>

	  <section anchor='why+not' title="Why not standard IPv6 ND?">

	  <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> provides several 
	  important functions such as Router Discovery, Address Resolution, Duplicate 
	  Address Detection, Redirect, Prefix and Parameter Discovery.</t>
    	  
    	  <t>Following power-on and initialization of the network in IPv6 ethernet 
    	  networks, a node joins the solicited-node multicast address on the interface 
    	  and then performs duplicate address detection (DAD) for the acquired 
    	  link-local address by sending a solicited-node multicast message to the link. 
    	  After that it sends multicast messages to the all-router address to solicit 
    	  router advertisements. Once the host receives a valid router advertisement 
    	  with the "A" flag, it autoconfigures the IPv6 address with the advertised 
    	  prefix in the router advertisement (RA). Besides this, the IPv6 routers 
    	  usually send router advertisements periodically on the network. RAs are sent to the all-node multicast address. Nodes send Neighbor Solicitation/Neighbor
    	  Advertisement messages to resolve the IPv6 address of the destination 
    	  on the link. These NS/NA messages are also often multicast messages and 
    	  it is assumed that the node is on the same link and relies on the fact 
    	  that the destination node is always powered and generally reliable.</t>

	  <t>A LoWPAN network typically uses two types of L2 addresses - for example 16-bit 
	  short addresses and 64-bit unique addresses as defined in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. 
	  Moreover, the available L2 payload size on the order of less than 100 bytes 
	  where we often 
	  might need to use header compression and use a minimum payload. The network 
	  is lossy and low-powered, and it does not provide multicast capability at 
	  the link-layer, thus simulating multicast behavior by both using broadcast 
	  or sending a number of unicast messages, both expensive for the low-powered 
	  network and the low-processing capable nodes. Often these low-powered 
	  nodes conserve energy by using sleep schedules; waking them up to receive IPv6
	  signaling messages such as multicast messages for NS or periodic RAs is not
	  practical. Also they are not capable of processing address-resolution for their 
	  neighbors effectively. Due to the radio strength of its neighboring 
	  router or its own strength, a node may often move from one router to 
	  another without physically moving from one place to another. Considering 
	  the above characteristics in a LoWPAN, and the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> base protocol requirements, it was concluded that 
	  standard Neighbor Discovery is not suitable as it is and a 6LoWPAN-specific 
	  ND definition would be useful and efficient for the wide deployment of IPv6 
	  over low-powered wireless networks of embedded devices.</t>

	   <t>
	      Neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN provides additions and optimizations to IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/> specifically supporting 6LoWPAN. Basic Neighbor Discovery mechanisms are optimized, avoiding the use of multicast flooding and minimizing link-local multicast (broadcast) frequency. The detection of duplicate addresses is performed across the entire LoWPAN. This is achieved using a Whiteboard located on the Edge Routers of the LoWPAN network. An Extended LoWPAN topology over a shared backbone link is optionally supported. 
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
	      The following list summarizes ND for 6LoWPAN operations and the differences with <xref target="RFC4861"/>:
	      
		  <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Router Discovery:">As in <xref target="RFC4861"/> with the addition of new 6LoWPAN specific options to Router Advertisements.</t>
			
			<t hangText="Prefix Discovery:">The discovery of 6LoWPAN prefixes with context identifiers. Destinations are assumed to be off-link unless explicitly known to be a neighbor.</t>
			
			<t hangText="Address Autoconfiguration:">Stateless address autoconfiguration is supported as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Additionally a claim and defend address generation method is supported using the Whiteboard.</t>
			
			<t hangText="Address Resolution:">Not performed as there is a direct mapping between the IID and the link-layer address.</t>
			
			<t hangText="Next-hop Determination:">Next-hop determination is performed considering LoWPAN routing and link specifics, and is simplified compared

	      ND for 6LoWPAN is designed to work with a wide variety of 6LoWPAN topologies, including isolated Ad-hoc LoWPANs, Simple LoWPANs and Extended LoWPANs. A Simple LoWPAN topology is assumed by default in the text. The special case of Ad-hoc LoWPAN operation is described in <xref target="adhoc"/>. Edge Router operation and Extended LoWPAN functionality are described in <xref target="eroperation"/>. Edge Routers which will operate only in Simple LoWPANs do not need to support Extended LoWPAN functionality, such as Edge Routers which do not have a backbone link (but instead e.g. an ADSL interface).
	   </t>
	   
	   </section>

	   <section anchor='overviewlink' title="Links">
	   
	   <t>
	      The use of IEEE 802.15.4 or any other similar link-layer technology which exhibits the characteristics defined for a 6LoWPAN link such as low data-rates,
	      packet loss, limited range, asymmetricity and long sleep-cycles. This specification is able to deal with the non-symmetric, non-transitive nature of these links. 
	   </t>
	   <t>
	      ND for 6LoWPAN is agnostic to the use of link-layer mesh or <xref target="RFC4944"/> mesh techniques, which alleviate the otherwise non-transitive nature of wireless links. This so-called Mesh Under topology thus makes the entire link to appear to the IP layer as having a link-local scope covering all the 6LoWPAN interfaces in the LoWPAN. This kind of LoWPAN is made up of hosts and Edge Routers. This link still exhibits lossy, low-rate, asymmetric behaviour along with sleep cycles. 
	   </t>
	   <t>   
	      The non-transitive nature of the link can also be overcome using IP routing within the LoWPAN, also called a Route Over topology. LoWPAN Routers are used in the LoWPAN to provide routing between all nodes in the LoWPAN. LoWPAN Router operations are specified in <xref target="roperation"/>. Link-local scope includes the neighbors of each node within symmetric wireless range. Mesh Under and Route Over techniques are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to combine IP routing and mesh link-layers within a LoWPAN.
	   </t>

	   </section>

	   <section anchor='overviewbs' title="Bootstrapping">

	   <t>
	   	1. A Host first performs stateless autoconfiguration of its link-local unicast address for each LoWPAN interface from its EUI-64 as in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. When a LoWPAN Node wants to join a LoWPAN, it does so by listening for Route Advertisements from Edge Routers or LoWPAN Routers, or by broadcasting a Router Solicitation (RS) and receiving RA responses from on-link routers (see <xref target="figmessrsra"/>). If a valid prefix is advertised in the RA, the host will also form an optimistic global unique address with stateless address autoconfiguration. At this point the node has also chosen one or more default routers. 
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	2. Next the node will attempt to perform initial registration with an Edge Router. As the node is not yet known in a routing algorithm, and its addresses are optimistic, initial registration is always performed with a link-local 
	   	Edge Router or router by sending a unicast Node Registration (NR) message to it. Registering directly with an Edge Router is of course preferred as shown in  <xref target="figmessbasic"/> (the ER is differentiated by the Prf flag in its RA), although all LoWPAN Routers have the ability to relay NR/NC messages on behalf of a node as shown in <xref target="figmessrelay"/>.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	These message exchanges are illustrated below. The NR contains the addresses the node wants to register.  A node may request a short address to be generated on its behalf by including an Address Option with the A flag and an address of length 0 in the NR.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	3. The Edge Router replies either directly with a Node Confirmation (NC), or through the relaying router. Note that routers only exist in Route Over configurations, and in pure Mesh Under configurations nodes are always within link-local scope of an Edge Router. This NC includes the set of addresses now confirmed to be bound to the Whiteboard of the ER. The Host is now capable of using the LoWPAN fully, and the ER forwards on its behalf.

         <t>
         	The node may now send packets to any IPv6 address inside or outside the LoWPAN. Destinations are assumed to be off-link unless known to be within link-local scope (valid entry in the neighbor cache). Address resolution is not performed with neighbors as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, but instead the IID part of the IPv6 address directly corresponds to a MAC address. The support of NS/NA is optional for nodes. 
         </t>
	   <t>
	   	The Whiteboard address bindings and assignments are soft, and thus must 
	   	be renewed periodically as indicated by the lifetime of the binding.
	   	This is achieved by periodically sending a new NR to the ER. If a 
	   	host moves, or the network topology changes, and the current ER is 
	   	no longer available, the host then starts the registration process 
	   	with another ER. If the host is still in the same Extended LoWPAN (same subnet prefix), its IPv6 addresses remain the same. Claim and defend addresses generated by the Whiteboard must be remembered by the host and refreshed in order to keep the address. If the host moves to a different LoWPAN (thus with a different subnet prefix), the bootstrapping process is initiated again. See <xref target="sdoperation"/> for details on node operation.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   	LoWPAN Routers periodically send RAs to their neighbors. The Edge Router initiates the first RAs, and this information is included in the RAs of each router. RA periods can be optimized to reduce signalling using a Trickle algorithm. See <xref target="roperation"/> for detailed router operation.
         </t>

		</section>

		<section anchor='overviewof' title="Optional features">

	   <t>
	   	This documents specifies a method for forming Extended LoWPAN networks with multiple ERs on a backbone link. This optional Edge Router feature allows for the detection of duplicate addresses across the entire Extended LoWPAN and backbone links, seen as a single subnet. The method uniquely identifies the LoWPAN Host on the backbone, and overrides the claim on an address on behalf of a LoWPAN Host. Thus a Host can keep the same address, and appears the same to other hosts on the backbone link, regardless of moving its binding from one ER to another. See <xref target="eroperation"/> for a description of Extended LoWPAN operation. Extended LoWPAN operation does not require changes to node operation.
         </t>
         
         <t>
         	Ad-hoc LoWPAN operation is also supported. By configuring a router
         	to implement Simple LoWPAN Edge Router functionality, and by generating a 
         	ULA prefix, an Ad-hoc LoWPAN can operate in an identical manner to a Simple LoWPAN. <xref target="adhoc"/> explains the operation of Ad-hoc LoWPANs.

	     <t>
	       The Node Registration (NR) and Node Confirmation
	       (NC) messages are used by a node to register with an
	       ER, and for the ER to confirm the binding. Any option
	       that is not recognized MUST be skipped silently. The
	       Node Registration message is sent by the LoWPAN Node
	       to the link-local unicast IPv6 address of an on-link Edge Router
	       or LoWPAN Router. NR/NC messages may be sent over multiple 
	       IP hops within the LoWPAN by relaying routers, thus received messages with a 
	       hop limit less than 255 MUST be accepted by LoWPAN Routers from senders with 
	       a source address in the same LoWPAN. Relaying routers may also use
	       the 6LOWPAN_ER anycast address as the destination.
	     </t>  
	     <t>  
	       When registering the first time (the node still has optimistic addresses) it 
	       sends an NR to the link-local unicast address of an on-link 
	       ER or LoWPAN Router. The source address must be the IPv6 unspecified address
	       to comply with oDAD. 
	     </t>
	     <t>  
	       Nodes send susequent NR messages to an on-link ER or router, however the IPv6 source address is then the link-local IPv6 address of the sender. 
	       This same message format is also used for relayed 
	       NR/NC messages, with an alternative code that is set 
	       when the message has been relayed. When relaying, a new 
	       message is created with an updated checksum, and a code is
	       used to indicate relaying. The hop limit is not decremented 
	       when relaying.

	     <t>
	       NS/NA messages are also employed between ERs on the backbone link. 
	       For this use a unique identifier is required in
	       the message as an option to uniquely identify a
	       host's interface. The standard NS/NA message is used in this
	       document is as per <xref target="RFC4861"/> with the
	       an additional Owner Interface Identifier Option defined in this document.
	       The Owner Interface Identifier is the same as that carried in NR/NC messages
	       and associated with bindings.
	     </t>
	     
	     <t>
	       If NS/NA messages are sent on the LoWPAN link (which is not required by this specification), they do not carry link-layer address options, because of link non-transitivity and the Extended LoWPAN topologies do not preserve the MAC address. For the same reason redirect is not supported. Instead they MUST include the Owner Interface Identifier option to help resolve conflict.

	<section anchor='sdoperation' title="LoWPAN Node Specification">

	   <t>
	   This section specifies LoWPAN node operations, and explains the differences to <xref target="RFC4861"/> node operation, while specifying the new operations. Instead of relying on multicast ND messages for DAD and neighbor unreachability detection, LoWPAN Nodes send unicast messages to an Edge Router in the LoWPAN 
	   which keeps a Whiteboard of all bound addresses from nodes attached 
	   to that ER. Thus these functions are performed across the entire LoWPAN using the Whiteboard, which allows ND for 6LoWPAN to operate over asymmetric, non-transitive links and with sleeping nodes. Node complexity and energy consumption are reduced as address resolution and the support of redirect are not required, ND traffic is 
	   reduced and nodes do not need to answer NS messages. In an Extended LoWPAN topology, ND functions are performed across the entire Extended LoWPAN, and a node may change its point of attachment within the LoWPAN without changing its IPv6 addresses. Extended LoWPAN operation is transparent for nodes. 
         </t>

	<section anchor='sdoperationdata' title="Conceptual structures and variables">
	
	   <t>
	   LoWPAN Nodes make use of the same conceptual data structures as defined in <xref target="RFC4861"/> Section 5.1, with the following differences:
	   
	   	<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Neighbor Cache"> - The neighbor unreachability detection entry is not kept in this cache, but instead MAY be used with destination cache entries.</t>

			<t hangText="Destination Cache"> - The destination cache MAY include a neighbor unreachability detection entry, for destinations within the same LoWPAN.</t>
			
			<t hangText="Prefix List"> - The list of prefixes and their associated CID which are advertised in Router Advertisements, along with an associated invalidation timer. Each entry is associated with the LoWPAN prefix (CID = 0) and the sequence number last advertised in the 6LoWPAN Prefix Summary Option. Unlike in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, these prefixes are always assumed to be off-link.</t>

			<t hangText="Default Router List"> - As in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, with the addition that Edge Routers are also be tracked by entries in this list.    </t>
			
			<t hangText="Edge Router List"> - This new structure contains the list of Edge Routers the node is registered with an associated timeout and primary flag. This list may be combined with the Default Router List. Off-link ERs can be included in this list but this is not required as they can be reached using the 6LOWPAN_ER anycast address through a default router.</t>			
	   	</list>
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   These conceptual data structure may be realized in many ways. As LoWPAN Nodes have very limited memory the number of cache entries should be limited, duplicate entries between caches referenced, and full IPv6 addresses represented in a compressed format where possible.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   The neighbor discovery variables defined in <xref target="RFC4861"/> Section 6.3.2 are valid for 6LoWPAN for ND, and default values are overridden by information in Router Advertisements. The LinkMTU variable is always 1280 octets for 6LoWPAN. ReachableTime and RetransTimer variables are used for neighbor unreachability detection using the Whiteboard.
	   </t>
	
	</section>

	<section anchor='sdoperationfa' title="Interface initialization">

	   <t>
	   All nodes are required to autoconfigure at least one address, a link-local
	   address, which is derived from the IEEE 64-bit extended MAC
	   address that is globally unique to the interface as in <xref target="RFC4944"/>. 
         As a result, knowledge of the 64-bit address of another LoWPAN Node is enough 
         to derive its link-local address and reach it if on the same link. Another 
         consequence is that the link-local address is presumably unique on the Extended LoWPAN, which enables the use of Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection (oDAD) <xref target="RFC4429"/> over the backbone link and the LoWPAN. The address SHOULD be created as optimistic before it has been confirmed by an Edge Router.   
	   Due to the way 6LoWPAN networks perform address compression <xref target="RFC4944"/> nodes within a LoWPAN use addresses in a homogeneous way and the unicast IPv6 address IID resolves directly to a corresponding link-layer address. As a result, address resolution within the LoWPAN is not required.
	   </t>	  
	  
	   <t>
	   A node MUST join the all-nodes multicast address, which is used for receiving 
	   RAs from routers. A node MAY join other multicast addresses such as the solicited-node multicast address if its link-layer includes multicast support, but that is not required by this specification.
	   </t>
	  
	   <t> 
	   Nodes MAY learn the address of Edge Routers or routers using 
	   traditional means such as L2 configuration or Router Advertisement
	   messages as in <xref target="RFC4861"/>. When sending a Router Solicitation it MUST not have the SLLA Option, but instead MUST include the OII Option. If the sender of the RS has only optimistic addresses, it MUST not use them as the IPv6 source address for the RS, but instead uses the IPv6 unspecified address. This procedure is to comply with the use of optimistic addresses as per oDAD <xref target="RFC4429"/>.
	   </t>
	 
   	   <t>
	   The node SHOULD also form a global unicast address for
	   routing inside the LoWPAN and reachability from outside the LoWPAN. 
	   If a valid prefix is available from an RA ('A' flag is set), then a global unicast 
	   address is derived using stateless address autoconfiguration. This address is marked optimistic until confirmed by the ER. If the LoWPAN is operating in ad-hoc mode, then the prefix is a Unique Local IPv6 Address (ULA) prefix <xref target="RFC4193"/> as specified in <xref target="adhoc" />.
	   </t>
	  

      </section>

	<section anchor='sdoperationbind' title="Registration process">

	   <t>
	   The binding process is very similar to that of a MIPv6 mobile node, though
	   the messages used are new Neighbor Discovery ICMP messages. A LoWPAN Node
	   address is tentative or optimistic as long as the binding is not confirmed by the ER.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   The LoWPAN Node uses unicast Node Registrations with on-link ERs or LoWPAN Routers to perform the binding. The destination address is the link-local unicast address of an on-link ER or LoWPAN Router. While a nodes addresses are still optimistic (first registration in a LoWPAN), the IPv6 unspecified address must be used as the source. Registration SHOULD be preferred with on-link ERs rather than LoWPAN Routers if available. The Preference Flag of the RA is used to differentiate between ERs (Prf=01) and LoWPAN Routers (Prf=00). The M Flag of the RA indicates if an ER is available through a neighbor LoWPAN Router. If the M Flag is unset, that router SHOULD NOT be used for registration. Furthermore the ER Metric in the 6LoWPAN Prefix Summary Option SHOULD be used to choose a router to use for registration.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	   A unique Owner Interface Indentifier is included in the Node Registration so the binding can be identified throughout the LoWPAN. This is usually the EUI-64 identifier of the interface. The NR message includes an Address Option for each address to be registered. Thus the message is structured as follows:
	   </t>

	   <t>ICMPv6 (Node Registration (Address Option[0], Address Option[1], Address Option[n]))</t>

   	   <t>	   
	   This registration method includes a way of requesting a unique address from the ER by setting the 'A' flag in an Address Option during registration. This is useful for receiving a unique short link-layer address, and works in a claim and defend fashion. Address generation using this NR/NC mechanism is stateless. Although the address is generated by the ER and checked for uniqueness across the LoWPAN, it is just like any other address binding in the whiteboard of the ER after assignment. Thus in order to keep using this address the host must keep refreshing the address binding, including when moving to another ER in the same LoWPAN. 
	   </t>

	   <t>A unique Transaction ID (TID) is included by the host in the NR message and 
	   used to match replies. A lollipop mechanism is used. TID is set to 0 upon booting, 
	   and is incremented with each NR message. After reaching 0xFFFF, the value loops to 
	   16 (0x10) and is incremented from there. Thus the values between 0-15 MUST only used after a boot or reboot.</t>

	   <t> 
	   The acknowledgment to a Node Registration is a unicast Node Confirmation
	   message that contains the status of the binding. The source of the packet 
	   is the link-local address of the on-link ER or LoWPAN Router. The destination address 
	   is the link-local address of the node. An Address Option for each confirmed or 
	   assigned address is included. Upon successful completion in the Node Confirmation message, the LoWPAN Node sets the address from optimistic or tentative to preferred. 
	   See <xref target="messex" /> for detailed message examples.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
	   If a Node Confirmation is received with an error code (128 or greater), then the registration has failed. See <xref target="bumess" /> for an explanation of NR/NC codes. If no successful Node Confirmation is received within an implementation specific timeout and number of retries, then there may be no Edge Routers in the LoWPAN. See <xref target="adhoc" /> for more information on ad-hoc network operation.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
	   This specification also introduces the concept of a secondary binding.
	   For redundancy, a node might place a secondary binding with one or more
	   other Edge Routers on the same or different LoWPANs. The 'P' flag in the Router 
	   Registration Indentity Request Option indicates whether the binding is primary. A primary binding MUST be maintained with exactly one Edge Router in each LoWPAN at any time. The use of this mechanism for fault tolerance is explained in <xref target="eroperationfault" />.
	   </t>

	   <t>
         ER bindings have a timeout associated with them, therefore nodes must 
         periodically send a new Node Registration message to renew the bindings. If 
         a node no longer receives RCs from any router in the current subnet, the 
         registration process begins from the beginning.
	   </t>

      </section>

	<section anchor='sdoperationnh' title="Next-hop determination">

	  <t>
	  Next-hop determination is performed as in Section 5.2 of 
	  <xref target="RFC4861"/> with the following exceptions. All prefixes are assumed to be off-link as the subnet with that prefix may 
	  be larger than the link (non-transitive property), unless the 
	  destination address exists in the neighbor cache. Exact-match search is performed on the neighbor and destination caches. A node MAY attempt to transmit a packet to the link for destinations with the same LoWPAN prefix if no neighbor or destination cache entry is found before sending to a default router. Link-layer information and packet transmissions SHOULD be used to maintain the neighbor cache. Multicast addresses are considered to be on-link and are resolved as specified in <xref target="RFC4944"/> or relative future documents. A LoWPAN Node is not required to be a minimum of one buffer per neighbor as specied in <xref target="RFC4861"/>, as address lookup is not performed as part of next-hop determination.
	  </t>
	  
	   <t>
	   Care must be used with anycast addresses, as anycast address resolution is normally performed with a multicast NS/NA exchange in <xref target="RFC4861"/>. 
	   As LoWPAN Nodes are not required to perform address resolution, and do no need to answer NS messages, anycast addresses MUST be considered to be off-link. If a node does answer an NS with an NA, it MUST not include link-layer address options, but instead MUST include the OII Option.	   
	   </t>

      </section>


	<section anchor='sdoperationqa' title="Destination unreachability detection">

	   <t>
	   LoWPAN Nodes do not perform <xref target="RFC4861"/> address resolution, DAD or NUD. Therefore the implementation of NS/NA message support by a node is optional, and thus to minimize implementation size a node MAY choose not to support NS/NA messages. 
	   </t>

	   <t>
         In order to detect unreachable destinations, nodes SHOULD support type 1 ICMPv6 destination unreachable messages <xref target="RFC4443"/>. LoWPAN Routers or Edge Routers make use of ICMPv6 destination unreachable to indicate that delivery to that destination is not possible.

	    LoWPAN Routers are used in a route over configuration
	    where the network is composed of overlapping link-local
	    scopes. As a result, we extend ND as specified in
	    <xref target="RFC4861"/> to operate over such non-transitive LoWPAN links. This section describes
	    ND for 6LoWPAN router operations. Note that this section 
	    does not apply to pure Mesh Under LoWPANs where the are no LoWPAN Routers. In addition to the

	  <t>
	    Network configuration parameters carried in Router
	    Advertisements originate at edge routers and must
	    disseminate to all routers and hosts within the
	    LoWPAN. The 6LoWPAN Prefix Summary Option is used to support
	    information dissemination from one or more edge routers to
	    all other nodes in the LoWPAN. The option includes a "V"
	    flag which indicates that the information contained in the
	    Router Advertisement is valid. The option also includes a
	    sequence number to ensure that all nodes converge on the
	    same settings.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    Because Node Registration/Confirmation exchanges between LoWPAN Nodes and LoWPAN Routers only occur over link-local scope, such 
	    messages must be relayed
	    between nodes and ERs when separated by multiple
	    IP hops. Every LoWPAN Router MUST also serve as a relay to

	      When a router receives a Node Registration message

	      the message has been relayed. The IPv6 source address is set to

	      As initial Node Registration messages are sent with an unspecified IPv6 source address, the router needs to keep state regarding the node's OII to link-layer address mapping while waiting for the Node Confirmation.

	<section anchor='eroperation' title="LoWPAN Edge Router Specification">

	   <t>Edge Routers are the routers that connect LoWPANs to an IPv6 infrastructure via
	   backhaul or backbone links when such an infrastructure is available. To achieve
	   that role:<list>
	   <t>
	   Edge Routers MUST implement LoWPAN Router features on their LoWPAN interfaces, 
	   </t> 
	   <t>
	   Edge Routers MUST support Whiteboard registration for LoWPAN Nodes within 
	   their subnets. 
	   </t> 
	   <t>
	   Edge Routers MAY support the Extended LoWPAN modality
	   where a LoWPAN subnet is aggregated over a higher speed backbone link. 
	    </t> 
	   <t>Edge Routers supporting the extended LoWPAN modality MUST perform
	   ND proxy over the backbone on behalf of their registered LoWPAN Nodes.
	   </t>   
	   </list>
	   </t>  
	   <t>
	   This specification documents the LoWPAN Whiteboard, a conceptual data 
	   structure that is used by the Edge Routers to maintain LoWPAN Node registrations. 
	   This specification documents extensions to the <xref target="RFC4861"> 
	   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol </xref>
	   that enables a LoWPAN Node to locate an Edge Rsouter
	   and then claim and register addresses using unicast exchanges with that
	   Edge Router.</t>
	   
	   <t>
	   Another function of the Edge Router is to perform 6LoWPAN compression and 
	   uncompression between the LoWPAN and the rest of the IP network and ensure MTU 
	   compatibility.  Packets flow uncompressed over the Backbone or Backhaul Links
	   and are routed normally towards a Gateway or an Application sitting outside 
	   of the LoWPAN.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t> In the Extended LoWPAN case, the Edge Router also performs proxy ND
	   operations over the Backbone Link on behalf of the LoWPAN Nodes that are
	   registered to it. The draft documents the proxy ND operation by the Edge 
	   Routers over the Backbone link and the conflict resolution process that 
	   enables transparent micro-mobility for the LoWPAN Nodes.
	   </t>

	<section anchor='eroperationwb' title="The Whiteboard">
	   <t>The white board is a conceptual data structure that is maintained by the 
	   Edge Routers to store their knowledge of the registered LoWPAN Nodes.
	   Information maintained for each registered node includes:
		 <list style="hanging">
		   <t hangText="IPv6 address:">
		     The IPv6 address being registered. This is an IPv6 unicast address of any scope.

			 When the age reaches the registration lifetime, the whiteboard entry is removed.
		   </t>

		   </list>
	   It can be noted that no link-layer information is stored there. If the Edge Router
	   is also used as the default gateway for the LoWPAN node then it would possess LLA information in its neighbor cache. Otherwise, it will route packets towards the LoWPAN nodes and thus will not need or use the LLA of the LoWPAN node.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t> It can also be noted that in the Extended LoWPAN case, an Edge 
	   Router only maintains the information on the LoWPAN Nodes that are registered to it. 
	   So the full registry of all the LoWPAN Nodes in a subnet is actually distributed 
	   between the Edge Routers.
	   </t>
	</section>
   
   
   	<section anchor='eroperationsimple' title="Simple LoWPAN">
	
	   <t>The support of the Simple LoWPAN modality is REQUIRED. In that configuration,
	   a single Edge Router serves a subnet that is formed by the LoWPAN nodes that are
	   registered to that Edge Router, as represented in <xref target="figsimple"/>. 
	   The ER may be connected to an IP infrastructure and may inject the prefixes for
	   its subnet in the routed infrastructure.</t>
	   
	   <t>In a Simple LoWPAN, the Edge Router is the repository of all registrations
	   and can detect a registration collision by simply looking up its whiteboard, so 
	   the whiteboard is the reference for Neighbor Discovery operations.</t>
	   
       <t>
	   The Edge Router forms a link-local address in exactly the same way
	   as any other node on the LoWPAN, for instance based on its link layer
	   addresses to enable 6LoWPAN Header Compression. If the resulting address
	   is not present in the Whiteboard then the Edge Router owns the address
	   right away. The Edge Router announces itself using Router Advertisement (RA)
	   messages that are broadcasted periodically over the LOWPAN.
	   </t>
	   
   	</section>
   
	<section anchor='eroperationexp' title="Extended LoWPAN">
	
	   <t>The support of the Extended LoWPAN modality is OPTIONAL. In that modality,
	   a high speed Backbone Link interconnects multiple devices and Edge Routers to form a single subnet that encompasses IPv6 nodes attached to the Backbone Link and LoWPAN Nodes registered
	   to the Edge Routers as represented in <xref target="figextended"/>. As a result,
	   all further reference to the Backbone Link and ND proxy operation over that link
	   is OPTIONAL but come as a whole.</t>
	   
	   <t>
	   In the Extended LoWPAN modality, the Backbone Link is used as a reference for address ownership 
	   and registration collision detection. Addresses that are not found in the Whiteboard are queried over the backbone
	   using the ND operation in place for that type of link, typically <xref target="RFC4861"/>;
	   Edge Routers represent themselves and the LoWPAN Nodes that are proactively registered to them. 
	   An ND lookup over the backbone is not propagated over the LoWPANs, 
	   but answered by the Edge Router that has the registration for the target, if any. 
	   </t>
   	   
   	   <t>
	   To enable proxying over the Backbone Link, an Edge Router must join the
	   solicited-node multicast address on that link for all the registered 
	   addresses of the nodes in its LoWPANs. The Edge Router answers the
	   Neighbor Solicitation with a Neighbor Advertisement that indicates its own 
	   link-layer address in the Target link-layer address option.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
	   The Backbone Link Maximum Transmission Unit serves as base for Path MTU 
	   discovery and Transport layer Maximum Segment Size negotiation (see 
	   section 8.3 of <xref target="RFC2460"/>) for all nodes in the LoWPANs. 
	   To achieve this, the Edge Router announces the MTU of the Backbone Link 
	   over the LoWPAN using the MTU option in the RA message as prescribed 
	   in section "4.6.4. MTU" of <xref target="RFC4861"> IPv6 Neighbor 
	   Discovery </xref>. 
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>

	<section anchor='eroperationbind' title="Registration process">
	   
	   <t>An Edge Router configures the well-known 6LOWPAN_ER anycast
	   address on the LoWPAN interfaces where it serves as Edge Router. Note that
	   the Edge Router will accept Node Registration messages with a hop limit that is 
	   lower than 255 but it MUST drop a Node Registration that does not come from 
	   a LoWPAN interface that is associated to the same subnet.
	   </t>
	  
	   <t>
	   The new Owner Interface Identifier Option in ND messages that carries 
	   the node EUI-64 address and the lollipop mechanism on the TID
	   help differentiate an address collision from a new registration from the same node.
	   More details on collision detection 
	   and resolution are provided in <xref target="eroperationdad" />.
	   </t>
	   
	   
	   <t>
	   The Edge Router responds to a Node Registration with a Node Confirmation. 
	   If the source address of the NR was not the Unspecified Address, then the 
	   destination address in the confirmation is the source in the Registration.
	   If the source address of the NR was the Unspecified Address, then the ER
	   acts as LoWPAN Router for the source, and the destination address is the 
	   optimistic address being registered. The destination Link Layer address 
	   is not taken from the ND cache but from the source Link Layer address in the
	   NR. The source address is a unicast address of the ER that matches the scope
	   of the destination, preferrably the destination in the NR if it is not anycast.

	   <t>The remainder of this section deals with the case of an Extended LoWPAN configuration. In that case:

	   <t>When it inserts an address in its Whiteboard, an Edge Router SHOULD 
	   perform Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) over the Backbone Link to detect a collision.
	   Upon a new registration for a link-local, unique local or global unicast address 
	   based on an IEEE 64-bit extended MAC address, the Edge Router MAY use 
	   <xref target="RFC4429">Optimistic DAD</xref> on the Backbone Link. 
	   A positive acknowledgement can be sent to the 6LoWPAN node right away if oDAD is used on the Backbone Link. 
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
	   A LoWPAN Node should be able to join a different Edge Router at any 
	   time without the complexities of terminating a current registration 
	   and renumbering. To enable this, the ND operation on the backbone 
	   link upon a Node Registration/Confirmation flow wins the address ownership over an 
	   ND operation that is done asynchronously, on behalf of the same 
	   LoWPAN Node, upon a prior registration. So an Edge Router that would 
	   happen to have a binding for that same address for the same LoWPAN Node 
	   identified by its EUI-64 address will yield and depreciate its binding.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t> The override (O) bit is used to
	   differentiate a registration flow from the asynchronous defense of an address
	   by an Edge Router acting as a proxy. Upon a registration flow, an Edge Router
	   doing DAD or accepting a reregistration SHOULD set the override (O) bit in 
	   its NA messages. Asynchronously to the registration, the Edge Router SHOULD NOT 
	   set the override (O) bit in its NA messages and should yield to an NA message 
	   with the override (O) bit set.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
         So the Edge Router operation on the Backbone Link is similar to that of 
         a Home Agent as specified in <xref target="RFC3775">"Mobility Support for
         IPv6"</xref> yet different. In particular, the Neighbor Advertisement 
         message is used as specified in section "10.4.1. Intercepting Packets 
         for a Mobile Node" with the exception that the override (O) bit is not 
         set, indicating that this Edge Router acts as a proxy for the LoWPAN and 
         will yield should another Edge Router claim that address on the Backbone Link.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
	   This specification also introduces the concept of a secondary binding. 
	   Upon a secondary binding, the Edge Router will not announce or defend 
	   the address on the backbone link, but will be able to forward packets to 
	   the node over its LoWPAN interface. This feature is used for fault tolerance, 
	   explained in <xref target="eroperationfault" />.
	   </t>	
	   	
		
	   <t>
	   If the Edge Router is primary for a registration as indicated by the 
	   'P' flag and it is connected to a 
	   Backbone, then it SHOULD perform ND operations on the backbone. In particular 
	   the Egde Router SHOULD reject the 
	   registration if DAD fails on the backbone. When oDAD is used over the 
	   backbone the Edge Router MAY issue the Node Confirmation right away 
	   with a positive code, but if a collision is finally detected, it cancels 
	   the registration with an asynchronous Node Confirmation and a negative 
	   completion code on the same TID.
	   </t>
	   
	   <t>
	   If the NR message includes an Address Option with the 'A' flag set, this
	   indicated the request of stateless address generation. The ER aquires an appropriate, unique
	   link-layer address for the network either by generating it and performing DAD, or 
	   with some other method. If successful, this address is returned in an Address Option of
	   the NC with the 'A' flag set and the assigned IPv6 address formed from the generated link-layer address with the defualt prefix inline. 
	   </t>
	   
      </section>
        
	<section anchor='eroperationforw' title="Forwarding packets between a LoWPAN and an IPv6 infrastructure">
   
	   <t>
	   Upon receiving packets on one of its LoWPAN interfaces, the Edge 
	   Router checks whether it has a binding for the source address. 
	   If it does, then the Edge Router can forward the packet; 
	   otherwise, the Edge Router MUST discard the packet. 
	     </t> 
		 <t> If the packet is to be transmitted over a Backbone or Backhaul Link, then the 6LoWPAN sublayer 
	   is terminated and the full IPv6 packet is reassembled and expanded.
	   When forwarding a packet from the Backbone  or Backhaul Link towards a LoWPAN interface,
	   the Edge Router performs the 6LoWPAN sublayer operations of compression and
	   fragmentation and passes the packet to the lower layer for transmission.
	   </t>
	   
		 <t>From the standpoint of an Edge Router, the view of the subnet in the Extended LoWPAN modality
		is that all nodes in the subnet are either LoWPAN nodes registered to this ER
		 or on-link on the Backbone Link, though in fact
	   they might be proxide for by other ERs. If the destination is a LoWPAN node
	   registered to this ER, the ER will forward the packet over the LoWPAN interface either as a local
	   delivery if the node is on-link or via intermediate LoWPAN routers using the routing in place in the LoWPAN.
	   If the destination is not a registered LoWPAN node, then the ER acts as if the subnet was on-link on the
	   Backbone and looks up the node there using ND. If the node is not found there either, it is assumed unreachable
	   and an "Destination Unreachable" ICMP message is sent to the source as prescribed by  <xref target="RFC4443"/>.

      <section anchor='eroperationdad' title="Address collision detection and resolution">
      
		  
      <t>The assumption in this section is that the OII that is carried in the 
	  registration messages and in the NS/NA messages is globally unique. 
	  When this assumption fails, and additional collision resolution
	  mechanism takes place, as detailed in <xref target="eroperationduplicate" />.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>The address collision can be detected within the Edge Router if the
	  Edge Router already has a registration for a given address, or over the
	  Backbone Link using Duplicate Address Detection. In the latter case,
	  a new ND option, the Owner Interface Identifier Option is used in NS/NA messages to carry 
	  the Transaction ID and the Owner Interface Identifier that are required for the resolution
	  th conflict resolution. In any case, the Edge Router in charge 
	  of the resolution is the Edge Router that handles the registration.</t>
      
	  
	  <t>A registration is identified by the (OII, IPv6 address) pair. A conflict occurs
	  when a Node Registration is received for an IPv6 address that is already
	  registered with a different OII at the same or another Edge Router. The
	  resolution of such conflict is explained below.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>Additionally, the following principles apply to the resolution in the Extended LoWPAN modality:
	  <list>
	  <t>Mobility within a subnet is included and welcome. In an Extended LoWPAN,
	  a LoWPAN Node may migrate its registration to a new
	  Edge Router transparently and at any time. The protocol is designed to recognize
	  the mobility and silently cleanup the registration states.
	  </t>
	  <t>A synchronous operation wins against a delayed proxy operation. An Edge Router 
	  that processes a Node Registration normally takes over an existing registration 
	  maintained by a defendant Edge Router.
	  </t>
	  <t>The decision to migrate the registration from an Edge Router to another is
	  made by the Edge Router that processes a Node Registration message based on
	  its own states for that registration and ND exchanges over the Backbone
	  Link. 
	  </t>
	  <t> A conflict may also occur with a node that is already present on the Backbone
	  Link when the registration occurs, or with a node appears on the Backbone Link while
	  a registration already exists for its claimed address. 
	  The resolution of such conflict is done using standard Duplicate Address Detection
	  as prescribed by <xref target="RFC4862"/>. 
	  </t>
	  </list>
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>Upon a Node Registration message, an Edge Router looks up an existing
	  registration for that IPv6 address in its LoWPAN whiteboard. If the entry
	  does not exist then the Edge Router looks up the address over the Backbone
	  Link using the NS (DAD) mechanism. The Edge Router SHOULD include an Owner Interface
	  Identifier Option in the NS message. An Edge Router that defends that address
	  for an existing registration MUST include an Owner Interface
	  Identifier Option in the NA message and SHOULD NOT set set the Override (O) bit.
	  </t>
	  <t>If no entry is found for that address and DAD times out, the Edge Router 
	  accepts the registration:
	  it creates an entry on the whiteboard, sends a positive Node Confirmation Message
	  to the node, and advertises the address on the Backbone Link.
	  Since this happens asynchronously to the Node Registration, the Edge Router
	  SHOULD NOT set set Override (O) bit in the NA message.
	  </t>
	  <t>If an entry is found in the whiteboard for the same (OII, IPv6 address) pair,
	  additional checking is performed for duplicate OII detection as detailed in 
	  <xref target="eroperationduplicate"/>. If no duplication is detected, then the
	  Edge Router accepts the update of the reservation: it updates a entry on the
	  whiteboard, sends a positive Node Confirmation Message to the node, and
	  advertises the address on the Backbone Link. Since this happens synchronously
	  to the Node Registration, the Edge Router SHOULD set set Override (O) bit in the
	  NA message.
 	  </t>
	  <t>If the address is already present on the Backbone Link and defended by 
	  a remote Edge Router, then that Edge Router defends the address with the Override
	  (O) bit reset and the Owner Interface Identifier Option in the NA message.
	  </t>
	  <t> If the Edge Router receives an NA message during the DAD period, it 
	  checks for an Owner Interface Identifier Option in the NA message. 
	  If there is no OII or the (O) bit is set then this is a duplicate address,
	  DAD fails and the registration is rejected. If there is an Owner Interface
	  Identifier Option in the NA message and the OII is different, then DAD fails and
	  the registration is rejected. If the OII is the same, additional checking is
	  performed for duplicate OII detection as detailed in 
	  <xref target="eroperationduplicate"/>. If there is no duplication then the NA is
	  ignored and the DAD timer keeps going.</t>
	  
	  <t> If the Edge Router receives an NS (DAD) message from another node during the
	  DAD period, it checks for a Owner Interface Identifier Option in the NS message. 
	  If there is no OII then DAD fails and the registration is rejected. 
	  If there is an Owner Interface Identifier Option in the NA message and
	  the OII is different, then DAD fails and the registration is rejected. If the OII
	  is the same, then the greatest TID wins. In other words, if the TID in the
	  registration is smaller than or equal to the TID in the OII Option then DAD fails
	  and the registration is rejected.  Otherwise the NS is ignored and the DAD timer
	  keeps going.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t> Other Edge Routers are informed of a take over decision by an NA with the 
	  Override (O) bit set and silently set their own state to non-operational.
	  An Edge Router that looses ownership should attempt to keep the registration 
	  entry in the whiteboard till the end of the registration lifetime for the purpose 
	  of duplicate OII detection if memory capacity allows. The TID in the whiteboard
	  entry is updated with that in the OII option in the NA.

        <!--
	  is section should deal with the behaviour of the ERs in the following cases. 1. A node changes its primary registration from one ER to another (TID increases). 2. A node 
      reboots and registers again with the same or a new ER (TID resets). 3. A node enters a 
      network on accident or maliciously using an OII (EUI-64) which already is in use in the network. -->
	  <t>The TID is a sequential number that is used to control the normal operation
	  of a registration and detect a duplicate Owner Interface Identifier during 
	  the Neighbor Discovery operations. The TID is set by a node in its Router
	  Registration message and echoed by the Edge Router in the Node Confirmation
	  message. At least the 4 most recent values for a TID are also kept by the edge 
	  router in the whiteboard entry for validation purpose.
	  </t>
	  <t> The TID is maintained using the lollipop mechanism.
	  When a node starts or restarts, the TID is reset to zero. After that, it is
	  incremented with each Node Registration. When the TID reaches its maximum
	  value (0xFFFF) it wraps directly to its looping value at the base of the lollipop
	  that is 16. So a value in the straight part of the lollipop (between 0 and 0xF)
	  is only used after a reboot and before the circular part of the lollipop is entered.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  Upon a positive Node Confirmation, if the current TID is less than 16,
	  then the node sets it to 16. So a TID in the straight part denotes a node that 
	  just started/restarted and did not get registered yet.
	   </t>
	  <t>To compare TID1 and TID2, the following rules apply:
	  <list>
	  <t>If at least one of TID1 and TID2 is in the straight part of the lollipop
	  (smaller than 16) then they compare directly.
	  </t>
	  <t>If both TID1 and TID2 are in the circular part then TID2 is greater than TID1 if
	  (TID2 - TID1) is smaller than (TID1 - TID2).
	  </t>
	  </list>
	  </t>
      
	  <t>A TID value is consistent with the preceeding one if it is a small increment
	  or decrement (more or less 16) from it. During normal operations, the TIDs saved in
	  the white board entry should be consistent. As long as a TID is consistent with
	  the previous one, it appears that the new message is coming from the same source as
	  the previous one and there is no OII collision. 
	  If the TID is a small decrement then the registration messages crossed and that
	  message should be ignored, but still there's no collision.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t> If the TID jumps to a low value in the lollipop this can be interpreted as
	  either a new node competing for the OII and a reboot by the node owning the
	  registration.
	  With this specification, this situation is optimistically interpreted as a reboot
	  and not reported as a collision, but an actual collision will be detected and
	  filtered out next.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>Otherwise, if an inconsistent TID value is detected between the new TID and 
	  the most recently accepted value, then the Edge Router compares with the 
	  older TID values that are saved in the whiteboard entry for that registration.
	  This might occur for instance with an entry that was rendered non-operational
	  when the address was taken over by another Edge Router.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>If the new value is consistent with a recent value then it appears that 2
	  sources are competing for the same OII and an OII collision should be logged. 
	  In that case the greater TID wins, that is if the new TID is greater than the
	  previous one it is accepted, otherwise it is reported as a collision.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  If the new value is not consistent with a recent value saved in the whiteboard 
	  entry then it is rejected as a collision.

	If a LoWPAN Router in the Ad-hoc LoWPAN is configured to implement basic edge router Whiteboard functionality and generates a ULA prefix <xref target="RFC4193"/>, then ND for 6LoWPAN can be applied throughout the LoWPAN as specified in this document. There SHOULD be only one edge router in an Ad-hoc LoWPAN (just as in a Simple LoWPAN) to keep consistancy in the Whiteboard and ULA prefix.

	    <t>In the example the M flag is set to indicate that an ER is 
	    available through this router, the Preference flag is 00 for normal, 
	    and a 1200s Route Lifetime is advertised. A 6LoWPAN Prefix 
	    Information Option is included.</t>

	<section title="Security Considerations">

	<t>
	   The security considerations of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/>
	   apply.  Additional considerations can be found in <xref target="RFC3756"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	   This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently
	   protected, either by means of physical or IP security for the
	   backbone link or MAC sublayer cryptography.  In other words, model
	   1 from <xref target="RFC3756"/> applies.  In particular, it is expected that the
	   LoWPAN MAC provides secure unicast to/from Routers and secure
	   broadcast from the Routers in a way that prevents tampering with or
	   replaying the RA messages.  However, any future 6LoWPAN security
	   protocol that applies to Neighbor Discovery for 6LoWPAN protocol,
	   is out of scope of this document.
	</t>
	<t>
	   The use of EUI-64 for forming the Interface ID in the link local
	   address prevents the usage of Secure ND (<xref target="RFC3971"/> and <xref target="RFC3972"/>) and
	   address privacy techniques.  Considering the envisioned deployments
	   and the MAC layer security applied, this is not considered an issue
	   at this time.
	</t>
	<t>
	   The use of IP-level forwarding of NR/NC ND messages requires relaxed
	   checking of Hop Limit values in ND packets received, compared to
	   the validation required by <xref target="RFC4861"/>.  This may make ND vulnerable to
	   off-LoWPAN senders that accidentally or intentionally send ND
	   messages.  This specification states that Edge Routers MUST
	   implement measures to filter out such off-LoWPAN ND messages.
	</t>

         <t>
      	This document requires two new ICMPv6 message types:
       	
       	<list>
       		<t>Node Registration (TBD1)</t>
       		<t>Node Confirmation (TBD2)</t>
       	</list>
   
      	The document also requires four new ND option types under the 
      	subregistry "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats":
      	
      	<list>
       		<t>Address Option (TBD3)</t>

	      There is also the need for a new

      	and Routers; used as a functional address.
