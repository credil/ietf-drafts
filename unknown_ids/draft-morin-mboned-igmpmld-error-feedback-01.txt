Internet-Draft           IGMP/MLD Error Feedback               July 2008


1.  Introduction

   Requirements have been formulated for means to provide multicast
   receivers with error feedback when the IGMP/MLD Querier did not or
   could not process an IGMP/MLD Membership Report message
   ([I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req], section 4).  Operator's experience
   with IPTV deployments show that introducing such a feedback in IGMP
   exchanges between multicast receivers and multicast routing
   equipments would help provide a better service (e.g. a liaison
   between the IETF mboned working group and the DSLForum was made in
   December 2005 to discuss this issue, but didn't lead to a
   standardized solution).

   An examples case is when an IGMP Querier refuses to take into account
   an IGMP Membership Report because the number of multicast channels
   would surpass the allowed threshold for the service.  Many other
   examples of the case where an IGMP error feedback channel would be
   useful are presented in Section 6.2.

   This document describes new message encodings and the associated
   procedures, all of which being optional and preserving full backward
   and forward compatibility, and details the impact on the host API for
   multicast subscriptions.

   This document doesn't state yet whether the messages should be
   carried over IGMP, ICMP or another protocol, but tries to document
   the pros and cons of the different alternatives, to guide the
   decision process.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is the terminology used in [RFC3376]
   and [RFC3810].

   For readability, "Querier" and "Host(s)" will be used throughout this
   document, in place of "IGMP or MLD Querier" and "IGMP or MLD
   Host(s)".


3.  History and problem statement

   The DSLForum expressed interest for such a feature, which was
   discussed [magma-archive] in a liaison with the Magma IETF Working
   group.  The specifications described in this document try to address
   the comments exchanged on the magma WG mailing-list.

Internet-Draft           IGMP/MLD Error Feedback               July 2008


4.  Principle

   The procedures described in this memo are fully optional : their only
   intent is to carry informative data from the Querier to the Hosts.

   Most specifically, the intent is that:

   o  the procedures don't change the state machine of the Querier or
      Host, the information carried is only meant to provide information
      to the application subscribed to multicast data

   o  a Host implementing these specifications will behave correctly in
      the absence of these informations.

   o  the behavior of a Querier implementing these specifications is
      unchanged whether or not the hosts implement these specs.

   Last, these specifications are not meant to carry information about
   transient errors that the network is supposed to recover from, like
   network outages.


5.  Procedures

5.1.  Procedures on the IGMP/MLD Querier

   The following procedures introduce a new type of message : the
   Feedback message.  See section Section 6 for details about message
   encodings.

   Using these procedures a Querier can OPTIONALLY emmit a Feedback
   message after receiving an IGMP or MLD Membership Report message that
   it can not process (see Section 6.2 for example reasons on why a
   Querier would not process a Membership Report message).

   The Feedback message carries error type/sub-type field, and
   information about the group to which the error pertains.  Optionally,
   if IGMPv3/MLDv2 is used, and if the error message pertains to some
   specific sources, the addresses of the sources to which the error
   pertains are included in the message.

   The address to which the Feedback message will be sent is determined
   as follows:

   o  if IGMPv3/MLDv2 is used (and if the sender IP address is not
      0.0.0.0 or 0::0), the address of the sender of the Membership
      Report is used

Internet-Draft           IGMP/MLD Error Feedback               July 2008


   o  else, the group address specified in the Membership Report message
      is used

   The source address MUST be the same address as the address used for
   Query messages, and the TTL MUST be set to 1.

   If IGMPv2/MLDv1 is being used, not more than one Feedback message
   should be sent for a said Membership Report message.

   If IGMPv3/MLDv2 is being used, multiple feedback message MAY be sent
   if the group record of the IGMP/MLD message that triggered the error
   contained multiple source addresses.

   In any case the amount of Feedback messages sent on a link MUST be
   rate-limited,

5.2.  Procedures on the IGMP/MLD Host

   When a Host receives an Feedback message, it MAY process it.

   Processing a Feedback message consists in :

   o  MANDATORY checking that the TTL is set to 1

   o  OPTIONALLY checking that the message source address is the address
      of a known Querier

   o  parsing the Feedback message

   o  determining the network sockets for which the Feedback message is
      relevant (G is the group address of the Feedback message)

      *  if no source address is included in the Feedback message, the
         sockets are the sockets that have some active forwarding state
         related to G (subscribed to G with a non-null include list)

      *  if some source addresses are indicated in the Feedback message,
         the sockets are the sockets to which traffic from at least one
         of these sources, and toward G, would be forwarded

   o  notifying these sockets of the error (see Section 7)

   o  OPTIONALLY logging the error and/or doing any local action
      depending on policy

6.  Message encodings

6.1.  Feedback message

   The Feedback message is a subtype of IGMP message when used as a
   feedback to an IGMP message, and a subtype of ICMPv6 when used as a
   feedback to an MLD message.  It contains an error code, the multicast
   group address in error (optional), and the source addresses in error
   (optional).

   The encoding is common to the two types of messages (except the
   length of fields specifying addresses).
                        1                   2                   3

   Fields:

   Multicast Group Address:  IPv4 multicast group address of the group
      in error.  Possibly set to all zeros.  Contains an IPv4 address in
      the case of IPv4/IGMP, and an IPv6 address in the case of IPv6/
      MLD.

   Reserved:  Reserved for future use.  Set to zero on transmission;
      ignored upon receipt.

   Number of Sources:  Indicates the number of sources in error.
      Possibly set to zero.

   Source Address [1..n]:  Addresses of the multicast sources in error.
      In the case of IPv4/IGMP, all these fields are 32-bit fields
      containing IPv4 addresses.  In the case of IPv6/MLD, all these
      fields are 128-bit fields containing IPv6 addresses.

   The Multicast Group Address field MAY be set to all zeros (for
   instance, if the error is not specific to a said multicast group).

   A group record MAY include zero Source Address (it can be the case,
   for instance, for a feedback that is not specific to particular
   sources, or that relates to an ASM subscription).  It MUST NOT
   include any source in the following cases:

   o  the message that triggered the Feedback message is IGMPv3 or MLDv2
      and the group record that triggered the error contains no source
      address

   o  the message that triggered the Feedback message is IGMPv2 or MLDv1

6.2.  Error codes

   This section describes some proposed error codes:

   o  improper message : the Membership Report message is improper (the
      group address is not in the 224/0 or FF00::/8 range, or specified
      sources are improper addresses)

   o  IGMP or MLD version is not supported by querier

   o  wildcard on an SSM group : IGMPv2 or IGMPv3/MLDv2 with an Exclude
      source filter mode was used in the Report, but the group address
      is not in the SSM range of the Querier

   o  exclude source filter mode not supported by the Querier

   o  group administratively prohibited

   o  source(s) administratively prohibited

   o  resource limit reached

   o  multicast reception is disabled on the link

   o  multicast routing protocol issue

   [ This section will later be completed to include error code numbers
   ]

   Remember that the Feedback message is NOT meant to carry information
   about transient errors that the network is supposed to recover from,
   like for instance network outages.


7.  Feedback to the application layer

   This section gives an example of how the information from Feedback
   messages is supplied to applications subscribed to multicast streams,
   and which expect the reception of multicast datagrams on a socket,
   based on Linux extensions to the POSIX [posix] network socket API.

   A first requirement is full backward compatibility with applications

Internet-Draft           IGMP/MLD Error Feedback               July 2008


   not supporting these specifications : an application not supporting
   these specifications must not be affected by a Feedback message.  For
   instance, a wrong solution would be to return an error on a read() or
   recv() call.

   A second requirement is to allow an application to keep receiving
   data on a socket, even if some error was reported through a Feedback
   message, for a group or channel joined on this socket.  This is
   needed, for instance, in two cases : when a socket is used to join
   multiple distinct group or channels and only one of them is subject
   to an error ; when a socket is used to join only one multicast group,
   for which the Querier sends a Feedback message, but there are members
   for this group sending data on a directly connected link.

   The proposed solution is to rely on the use of the MSG_ERRQUEUE flag
   of the recvmsg()/recvfrom() POSIX calls.  This call allows the socket
   user to retrieve the network errors queued for the socket.

   The MLD component receiving an MLD Feedback message containing error
   condition reports the error to the application via the MSG_ERRQUEUE
   flag in the recvmsg()/recvfrom() calls.  The MSG_ERRQUEUE flag
   indicates the presence of a sock_extended_err data structure.  When
   the sock_extended_err data structure is passed to the application,
   the ee_origin field is set to 3 (SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6) in the case of
   an MLD Feedback message, and XX (SO_EE_ORIGIN_YYYY) in the case of an
   IGMP Feedback message [XX and YYY is to be determined in compliance
   with the relevant standard, 4 and SO_EE_ORIGIN_IGMP are proposed as
   interim values].  The Type and Code fields from the MLD Feedback
   message are copied into the ee_type and ee_code field of the
   sock_extended_err data structure.

   The addresses of the multicast group and sources in error can be
   retrieved as follows:

   o  in the IPv4 case, the group address and source address are stored,
      respectively, in the ee_info and ee_data fields,

   o  the group address and source address can be retrieved, in all
      cases, by calling functions returning a sockaddr pointer and which
      take into argument a sock_extended_err pointer (similarly as
      SOCK_EE_OFFENDER) and called SOCK_EE_MCAST_FEEDBACK_GRP and
      SOCK_EE_MCAST_FEEDBACK_SRC

   If the Feedback contains multiple sources addresses, a
   sock_extended_err will be added to the message queue for each such
   sources.

   An application receiving a sock_extended_err message from the MLD

   component MUST NOT terminate the multicast subscription to the group
   or source/group address in error, except possibly if it can be
   ascertained that the Feedback message comes from a legitimate Querier
   (e.g. thanks to a mechanism like SEND [RFC3971]), and if multicast
   traffic for the said group or channel is not expected from any host
   attached to a directly-connected link.

   ( Another proposal would be to allow the setsockopt() and
   set(ipv4)sourcefilter() calls [RFC3678] to return an error.  That
   would require the local network stack to wait for some time after
   sending a Membership Report message, before being able to return from
   the setsockopt()/set(ipv4)sourcefilter() call, and would not easily
   allow to carry detailed information about the specific group or
   channel in error.  Consequently, this approach doesn't seem a viable
   one. )


8.  Impact on IGMP/MLD proxies and equipments doing IGMP/MLD snooping

8.1.  IGMP/MLD Proxies

   To support this Feedback mechanism, an IGMP or MLD proxy [RFC4605]
   SHOULD send Feedback messages received on its Host side toward its
   Querier side(s) that have matching multicast memberships.  The
   procedures for sending the Feedback messages are then the same as for
   a normal Querier, as specified in Section 5: in particular the IGMP/
   MLD proxy MUST use its own address as the source address of the
   Feedback message.

   A new member of a multicast group already forwarded by the proxy on
   its Querier side, will have to wait for some time before having a
   chance to receive a Feedback message : timers will have to trigger
   before the Querier on the Host side of the proxy sends a Query,
   causing the proxy to send a Membership Report that may then cause the
   Querier on the Host side to send a Feedback message, and this
   Feedback message to be propagated to the new receiver.

   To quickly provide Feedback messages to receivers on its Querier
   side, the proxy MAY cache the Feedback messages that it receives on
   the Host side to later match them with Membership Report messages
   received on its Querier side, and send relevant Feedback messages in
   reaction to these.  If doing Feedback message caching, the proxy MUST
   keep only one Feedback message per (S,G) entry or (*,G) entry.  It
   MUST also remove a Feedback message from its cache, if a same
   Feedback message hasn't been sent in the last <> seconds by the
   Querier on its Host side.

   Last, an IGMP/MLD proxy MAY produce its own Feedback messages.  In

Internet-Draft           IGMP/MLD Error Feedback               July 2008


   that case it MUST still respect procedures of Section 5.

8.2.  Equipments doing IGMP/MLD snooping

   IGMP/MLD snooping equipments are expected to transparently
   interoperate with the procedures described in this document, given
   that RFC 4541 section 2.2.1(3) [RFC4541] states that "[a] switch that
   supports IGMP snooping must flood all unrecognized IGMP messages to
   all other ports".


9.  IGMP/MLD Hosts stacks not implementing the Feedback mechanism

   To allow applications running on an IGMP/MLD Host, whose networking
   stack or API does not implement the Feedback mechanism described in
   this spec, it is proposed that IGMP/MLD Querier implementing this
   specification can, when configured to do so, send each Feedback
   message twice : once with the encoding described in these
   specifications, and another time encapsulated in a UDP packet.

   The UDP message uses port xxx [TBD], with a payload identical to the
   IGMP or MLD Feedback message, except that the checksum is set to zero
   (the UDP message having its own checksum).


10.  IANA Considerations

   Request to IANA for IGMP and ICMPv6 type allocation will be needed
   for the messages defined in this document.

   [Whether or not it is needed to define a registry for the error codes
   used in IGMP/MLD Feedback messages will be later determined.]

   [Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.]


11.  Security Considerations

   Given that the specifications in this document do not change nor the
   state machine of the IGMP/MDLD Querier and Host stack, nor the
   datagrams that will be received by an application, they are not
   expected to introduce security issues not already existing with IGMP/
   MLD or the protocol used to carry the Feedback message.

   A possible issue would be to have wrong Feedback sent toward
   multicast applications.  Such an issue could arise if spoofed
   Feedback messages are sent and interpreted by multicast receiver

   hosts.  This issue is mitigated by the fact that IGMP/MLD Hosts MUST
   check that the TTL of the Feedback messages is 1, and MAY also check
   the source IP of the Feedback message against a list of known
   Queriers.

   Another possible issue is denial of service of the Querier function,
   that would be due to having the IGMP/MLD Querier be overloaded by
   Feedback messages to send.  This is mitigated by allowing the Querier
   to rate-limit the flow of Feedback messages.  On a LAN, such a rate-
   limiting would possibly result in some receivers not receiving the
   feedback message that they would have, which is a form of denial of
   service, but only on the Feedback function by itself, with no impact
   on the rest of the multicast group membership control protocol
   infrastructure.  This later type of denial of service might be
   mitigated by doing rate-limiting based on the source address of the
   receivers (the source address of the Membership Report triggering the
   Feedback message); but such mechanism may themselves be subject to
   weaknesses due to Membership Report spoofing.

   Acknowledgments go to DSLForum contributors who provided an initial
   proposal, to IETF participants that participated in the discussion on
   the magma WG list, from which guidance and inspiration was largely
   taken.  Thank you to Bill Fenner for providing detailed information
   on issues related to ICMP errors in reaction to multicast datagrams.

   Thanks to Toerless Eckert for his inputs and who offered a suggestion
   on how to handle application running on hosts not implementing the
   Feedback mechanism.

   Message encodings are largely inspired from Report message encodings
   found in[RFC3376].

Appendix A.  Protocol to carry error feedback messages

   ICMP and IGMP/MLD were possible candidates for carrying the Feedback
   message.  This section exposes the pros/cons of both alternatives,
   and ought to be removed once a decision is made on one of them.

A.1.  ICMP

   The Feedback message could be an ICMP message that would use a new
   ICMP message type (or possibly reusing existing types and codes).

   Pros:

   o  ICMP is already used to carry error messages between routers and
      hosts (e.g.. port unreachable message)

   o  ICMP has an extensible format which could easily be reused for the
      Feedback function described in this memo

   o  Implementations of network socket APIs already take into account
      ICMP messages

   Cons:

   o  ICMP has currently nothing to do with multicast today

   o  some RFC explicitly forbid the sending of ICMP in reaction to
      receiving multicast packets, and IGMP/MLD Membership Reports are
      multicast packets ([RFC1122] section 7.2 and 3.2.2, [RFC1812]
      section 4.3.2.7) (see [fenner-icmp-mcast])

   o  ICMP messages are (currently) never sent toward multicast
      addresses, whereas that would be required to send Feedback
      messages to IGMPv2/MLDv1 hostsSo we may say that the generic
      argument is that the restriction for ICMP ; this has lead to
      practical issues to integrate this approach into existing stacks,
      because of the need to work around sanity checks

A.2.  IGMP/MLD

   The Feedback message could be an IGMP or MLD message that would use
   new IGMP/MLD message types.

   Pros:

   o  IGMP and MLD are the protocols used for all operations related to
      multicast subscription

   Cons:

   o  possibly more work to define the encodings

   o  a new IANA registry might be needed to manage Feedback error codes

   o  definition of how the network socket API will be used to carry the
      information to the applications has to be defined
