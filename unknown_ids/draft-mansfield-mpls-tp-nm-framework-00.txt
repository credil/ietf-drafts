1. Introduction 

   This document provides a framework for using the MPLS-TP NM 
   requirements [1] for managing the elements and networks that 
   support a Transport Profile for MPLS. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in RFC 2119 [3]. 

   MPLS-TP NE: a network element (NE) that supports MPLS-TP 
   functions  

   MPLS-TP network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed  

   Equipment Management Function (EMF): the management functions 
   within an NE. See ITU-T G.7710 [2]. 

   Data Communication Network (DCN): a network that supports Layer 
   1 (physical), Layer 2 (data-link), and Layer 3 (network) 
   functionality for distributed management communications related 
   to the management plane, for distributed signaling 
   communications related to the control plane, and other 
   operations communications (e.g., order-wire/voice 
   communications, software downloads, etc.).  

   Management Communication Network (MCN): A DCN supporting 
   management plane communication is referred to as a Management 
   Communication Network (MCN).  

   Signaling Communication Network (SCN): A DCN supporting control 
   plane communication is referred to as a Signaling Communication 
   Network (SCN). 

   Communication Channel (CC): a logical channel between network 
   elements (NEs) that can be used - e.g. - management plane 
   applications or control plane applications. The physical channel 
   supporting the CC is technology specific. An example of physical 
   channels supporting the CC is a DCC channel within SDH. 

   Management Communication Channel (MCC): a CC dedicated for 
   management plane communications.

   Signaling Communication Channel (SCC): a CC dedicated for 
   control plane communications. The SCC may be used for GMPLS/ASON 
   signaling and/or other control plane messages (e.g., routing 
   messages). 

2. Management Architecture Consideration 

   The management of the MPLS-TP network could be based on a multi-
   tiered distributed management systems, for example as described 
   in ITU-T M.3010 [4] and M.3060 [5]. Each tier provides a 
   predefined level of network management capabilities. The lowest 
   tier of this organization model includes the MPLS-TP Network 
   Element that provides the transport service and the Operations 
   System (OS) at the Element Management Level. The management 
   application function within the NEs and OSs provides the 
   management support. The management application function at each 
   entity can include agents only, managers only, or both agents 
   and managers. The management application function that include 
   managers are capable of managing an agent included in other 
   management application functions. 

   The management communication to peer NEs and/or Operations 
   System (OSs) is provided via the message communication function 
   within each entity (e.g. NE and OS). The user can access the 
   management of the MPLS-TP transport network via a Local Craft 
   Terminal (LCT) attached to the NE or via a Work Station (WS) 
   attached to the OS. 

2.1. Network Management Architecture 

   A transport Management Network (MN) MAY consist of several 
   transport-technology-specific Management Networks. Notation used 
   in G.7710 [2] for a transport-technology-specific MN is x.MN, 
   where x is the transport specific technology.  For example, a 
   MPLS-TP specific MN might be MPLS-TP.MN.  Where there is no 
   ambiguity, we will use "MN" for an MPLS-TP specific MN, and 
   "MPLS-TP.MN" (or "MPLS-TP MN") and "MN" where both are used in a 
   given context.  

   The management of the MPLS-TP network is be separable from the 
   management of the other technology-specific networks, and 
   operate independently of any particular client or server layer 
   management plane. 

   A MPLS-TP Management Network could be partitioned into MPLS-TP 
   Management SubNetworks ("MPLS-TP.MSN" or "MPLS-TP MSN", or just 
   "MSN" where usage is unambiguous) for consideration of

   scalability (e.g. geographic or load balancing) or 
   administrative (e.g. administrative or ownership). 

   The MPLS-TP MSN could be connected to other parts of the MN 
   through one or more LCTs and/or OSs. The message communication 
   function of an MPLS-TP NE initiates/terminates, routes, or 
   otherwise processes management messages over CCs or via an 
   external interface. 

   Multiple addressable MPLS-TP NEs could be present at a single 
   physical location (i.e. site or office). The inter-site 
   communications link between the MPLS-TP NEs will normally be 
   provided by the CCs. Within a particular site, the NEs could 
   communicate via an intra-site CC or via a LAN. 

2.2. Element Management Architecture 

   The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP NE provides 
   the means through which a management system manages the NE.  

   The EMF interacts with the NE's transport functions and control 
   functions (i.e., control plane functions that reside in the NE) 
   by exchanging Management Information (MI) across the Management 
   Point (MP) Reference Points. The EMF may contain a number of 
   functions that provide a data reduction mechanism on the 
   information received across the MP Reference Points. 

   The EMF includes functions such as Date & Time and the FCAPS 
   (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security) 
   management functions. The EMF provides event message processing, 
   data storage and logging. The management Agent, a component of 
   the EMF, converts internal management information (MI signals) 
   into Management Application messages and vice versa. The Agent 
   responds to Management Application messages from the message 
   communication function by performing the appropriate operations 
   on (for example) the Managed Objects in a Management Information 
   Base (MIB), as necessary. The message communication function 
   contains communications functions related to the outside world 
   of the NE (i.e. Date & Time source, Management Plane, Control 
   Plane, Local Craft Terminal and Local Alarms). 

   The Date & Time functions keep track of the NE's date/time which 
   is used by the FCAPS management functions to e.g. time stamp 
   event reports.

2.3. Standard Management Interfaces 

   The MPLS-TP NM requirement document [1] places no restriction 
   on which management interface to be used for managing an MPLS-
   TP network. It is possible to provision and manage an end-to-
   end connection across a network where some segments are 
   created/managed/deleted, for example by netconf/XML or snmp/smi 
   and other segments by CORBA/IDL interfaces. Use of any network 
   management interface for one management related purpose does 
   not preclude use of another network management interface for 
   other management related purposes, or the same purpose at 
   another time However, an MPLS-TP NE is not expected to actively 
   support more than one management protocol in any given 
   deployment. The protocol to be supported is at the discretion 
   of the operator. 

2.4. Management Channel 

   The Communication Channel (CC) provides a logical channel 
   between NEs for transferring Management and/or Signaling 
   information. Note that some technologies provide separate 
   communication channels for Management (MCC) and Signaling (SCC).   

     . MPLS-TP NEs communicate via the DCN. The DCN connects NEs 
        with management systems, NEs with NEs, and management 
        systems with management systems.  

3. Fault Management Considerations 

   A fault is an anomaly in the network or network element.  Fault 
   management provides the mechanisms to detect, verify, isolate, 
   notify, and recover from the fault.  

4. Configuration Management Considerations 

   Configuration management provides the mechanisms to provision the 
   MPLS-TP services, setup security for the MPLS-TP services and MPLS-TP 
   network elements, and provides the destination for fault 
   notifications and performance parameters. 

5. Performance Management Considerations 

   Performance statistics can overwhelm a management network, so it is 
   important to provide flexible instrumentation that provides control 
   over the amount of performance data to be collected.  A distinction 
   is made between performance data that is collected on-demand and data 
   that is collected proactively.  On-demand measurement provides the

   operator the ability to issue a command to initiate a measurement.  
   Proactive measurement is something that happens continuously overtime 
   after being configured with a periodicity and storage requirements.   

6. Security Considerations 

   Provisions to any of the network mechanisms designed to satisfy 
   the requirements described herein are required to prevent their 
   unauthorized use.  Likewise, these network mechanisms MUST 
   provide a means by which an operator can prevent denial of 
   service attacks if those network mechanisms are used in such an 
   attack. 

   Solutions MUST provide mechanisms to prevent this private     
   information from being accessed by unauthorized eavesdropping,     
   or being directly obtained by an unauthenticated network     
   element, system or user. 

   Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization 
   involves extracting a significant amount of information about 
   network construction that the network operator MAY consider 
   private. 

7. IANA Considerations
