Abstract

   This document describes experiences of operational requirements and
   several considerations for ENUM-based softswitches concerning call
   routing between two Korean VoIP carriers, gained during the ENUM pre-
   commercial trial hosted by National Internet Development Agency of
   Korea (NIDA) in 2006.

   These experiences show that an interim solution can maintain the
   stability of on-going commercial softswitch system operations during
   the initial stage of ENUM service, where the DNS does not have
   sufficient data for the majority of calls.

1.  Introduction

   ENUM[1] is a mapping system based on DNS[2][3] that converts from an
   E.164[4] number to a domain name using 'Naming Authority
   Pointer(NAPTR)' resource record[5].  ENUM is able to store different
   service types (such as fax, email, homepage, SIP, H.323 and so on),
   for every E.164 number.  It originally focused on how end-users could
   gain access to other end-user's communications contact information
   through the Internet.

   Recently, discussion on the need to update RFC 3761 has begun, to
   ensure that the standard also works in the "Infrastructure ENUM"
   scenario, where ENUM provides routing information between carriers.

   When providing VoIP service, a VoIP carrier that wants to integrate
   various protocols typically uses a softswitch.  However, such a
   system is still inefficient for interconnection, number portability,
   and protocol information among carriers, because each softswitch does
   not have end-to-end routing information for all carriers.  This
   information can be stored in DNS, using ENUM.  Therefore, carriers
   can expect many benefits if they use ENUM within the call routing
   functions of their softswitches.

   To confirm these benefits and to verify the performance of ENUM-
   enabled softswitches, NIDA cooperated with two Korean VoIP service
   providers for an Infrastructure ENUM trial in 2006.  NIDA is a non-
   profit organization with a mandate to manage 2.8.e164.arpa.
   (representing the +82 country code of Korea).  NIDA promotes and
   facilitates technical cooperation on a national scale between
   partners, and this includes ENUM.  During the trial, NIDA provided a
   centralized ENUM DNS to each VoIP service provider for call routing.
   The data used in this Infrastructure trial was also accessible to the
   public (i.e. it was an Internet-based system, rather than a closed
   scheme).

2.  Call Routing on Softswitch

   In the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), hardware-based
   switches predominate in the network.  A softswitch provides similar
   functionality, but is implemented on a computer system by software.
   It typically have to support various signalling protocols (such as
   SIP[7], H.323[8], MGCP[9], and others), to make call connections for
   VoIP service, often on the boundary point between the circuit and
   packet network.

   To make a call, first of all a softswitch must discover routing
   information.  It has to process the E.164 number that comes from
   caller through its own routing table.  The goal is to determine how
   the call can be routed towards the callee, so that either the call
   can be processed through the softwitch or the caller can connect to
   the callee directly.

   Today, call routing is often based on a prefix of the dialled number.
   This is used very widely not only for legacy PSTN switch, but also
   for softswitches.  So, if a softswitch uses ENUM DNS for call
   routing, in the beginning, most of calls queried to ENUM DNS would
   fail if there are only a small group of carriers provisioning data
   into ENUM.  However a softswitch will have a higher success rate with
   ENUM DNS as the number of carriers grows, as the overall percentage
   of numbers provisioned in ENUM increases.  In short, ENUM as a long
   term solution has obvious benefits, but the problem lies in migrating
   from today's prefix based routing towards that long term ENUM-based
   solution.

3.  Infrastructure ENUM trial in Korea

   As described in Section 1, NIDA and two VoIP Service Providers built
   ENUM-processing modules into their softswitches, interconnected these
   via the IP network, and provisioned their customer numbers into a
   centralized ENUM DNS system operated by NIDA.  The carriers
   provisioned their E.164 numbers using EPP [10] to a centralized
   Registration Server (also operated by NIDA).  Changes to the ENUM
   data were implemented and updated to the ENUM DNS instantly, using
   DNS Dynamic Update [11].

   In the trial, the EPP-based provisioning sub-system was not
   integrated with the carrier's main customer provisioning systems or
   protocols, and as there were only two carriers a centralized ENUM
   system using EPP was a perfectly reasonable choice.

4.  Requirement for ENUM-based Softswitch

4.1.  call routing cases for DNS response code

   To use ENUM DNS, each softswitch needs to have an ENUM module that
   converts from E.164 number to the ENUM domain name (as defined in RFC
   3761) and processes a query to ENUM DNS.  This ENUM module uses the
   algorithm specified in RFC 3761.

   However, in the initial stage of ENUM DNS roll-out, ENUM shares call
   routing information from a limited number carriers.  There is the
   problem that a softswitch can't find all of the call routing
   information it needs only in ENUM.  To solve this problem, ENUM-based
   softswitches have to follow a consistent set of rules.  In the Korean
   trial, the rules were:

   1.  The ENUM module of the softswitch converts E.164 number coming
       from the VoIP subscriber to an ENUM domain name (as defined in
       RFC 3761).

   2.  The ENUM module, acting as a DNS stub resolver, sends a query to
       a recursive name server.

   3.  if the ENUM module receives a DNS answer, the call routing
       process may branch off in several ways, depending on the Rcode
       value in the DNS response message, as shown below.

       A.  Rcode=0 (No error condition)
           There is, potentially, an answer to the corresponding query.
           The normal call routing process needs to differentiate
           between the following conditions:

           +  If the response includes no URI that can be used to
              initiate a call (such as SIP or H.323).
              The call fails immediately.

           +  If there is more than one usable URI (such as a SIP and a
              H.323 URI, a pair of SIP URIs, or a pair of H.323 URIs),
              the softswitch picks one based on the preference and order
              values in the NAPTR RRSet.

       B.  Rcode=3 (Name error), 1 (Format Error), 2 (Server Failure), 4
           (Not Implemented) or 5 (Refused)
           There is no valid answer for the query.
           The softswitch has no choice but to convert the E.164 number
           with its vendor-specific method (such as a prefix-based
           method).  In this case, it means that the call has to be
           delivered through PSTN for onward call routing.

           It is also important to stress that the ENUM DNS servers MUST
           respond to all queries they receive from the softswitches.
           If the ENUM module in a softswitch does not receive a
           response, it will eventually time out, and the ENUM module
           will treat this as a DNS error.  However, the delay involved
           is long in terms of the normal call setup time, and should be
           avoided.

4.2.  type of domain routing

   If the DNS response has a valid URI such as SIP or H.323, the
   softswitch can resolve a domain name of that URI to route a call by
   searching two different sources.  One is a recursive nameserver, and
   the other is fixed routing table in softswitch, mapping from the
   domain name to the corresponding gateway's host name and IP address.

   If there are many points of interconnection, using a recursive
   nameserver is useful for resolving a domain name, but if there are
   just a few known carriers and they do not change the interconnection
   information frequently, a fixed routing table mapping domain name to
   corresponding gateway hostname and IP address is more efficient
   (rather than querying the recursive nameserver every time).  In
   addition, carriers would like to charge a interconnection fee for all
   received calls, so they tend to make interconnection only with
   trusted carriers based on some sort of agreement between these
   carriers.  They may agree on a specific gateway for this purpose.

   These two types of domain routing are also affected by the Rcode=0
   case described in Section 4.1.

   There are two choices for routing.  These are described and compared
   here:

   1.  Case for using fixed routing table

       A.  If domain name part of URI is found in the internal fixed
           routing table, the softswitch can use it.

       B.  If the domain name part of URI does not exist in the fixed
           routing table, the call is forwarded to the PSTN.

   2.  Case for using recursive nameserver

       A.  If domain name part of URI can be resolved via the recursive
           nameserver, softswitch can use it.

       B.  If domain name part of URI cannot be resolved on recursive
           nameserver for any reason (such as a response with no usable

           NAPTRs, or with Rcode=1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), call must be
           forwarded to PSTN.

   Case (1) seems inefficient because the administrator maintains two
   management points for numbers; the ENUM DNS and the softswitch
   itself.  However this configuration can minimize the call routing
   failure ratio during the transition period of ENUM (when there are
   relatively few provisioned ENUM entries).  Thus case (1) could
   reasonably be implemented on the softswitches during the trial phase,
   and hereafter as ENUM entries are populated, case (2) would be
   reasonable choice.

   With these requirements, the two carriers could use ENUM DNS for call
   routing without any impact on their on-going commercial VoIP service.

5.  Trial Results

   To provide a stable commercial service, an ENUM-based Softswitch must
   have a defined performance, in the same way as must a Non-ENUM
   Softswitch.  The only difference between these two types of
   softswitch is the searching mechanism for call routing information,
   which can be stored in softswitch itself or in the DNS.  Therefore a
   similar delay time for call routing is important to guarantee quality
   of Service.  During the trial, each carrier measured this delay time
   based on SIP protocol (the so called "Answer Delay time"), defined as
   elapsed time between requesting a call ('INVITE' message) and
   receiving a response ('200OK'message) [7].

               +------------------------+------+----------+
               |        Call Type       | ENUM | Non-ENUM |
               +------------------------+------+----------+
               |      Carrier A->A      | 2.33 |   2.28   |
               |                        |      |          |
               |      Carrier A->B      | 2.23 |   2.25   |
               |                        |      |          |
               | Carrier A->other(PSTN) | 4.11 |   3.79   |
               |                        |      |          |
               |      Carrier B->B      | 4.11 |   3.79   |
               |                        |      |          |
               |      Carrier B->A      | 2.19 |   2.19   |
               |                        |      |          |
               | Carrier A->other(PSTN) | 3.95 |   3.41   |
               +------------------------+------+----------+

                 Table 1: Average Answer Delay time (sec)

   As shown in Table 1, there is little difference in time (under a
   second) between the ENUM and Non-ENUM cases.  Therefore it is
   difficult for a caller with either carrier to notice the choice (ENUM
   or non-ENUM) as an aspect of quality when a call initiates.  This
   means that ENUM definitely works well with softswitches on a
   commercial basis.

   To make the trial more realistic, the resolver that was used by ENUM-
   based softswitch was a recursive nameserver that could be accessed
   publicly.  This was done as it was felt that a tough condition would
   be better to verify the fact that an ENUM-based softswitch works as
   well as Non-ENUM softswitch in providing a commercial VoIP service.

6.  'e164.arpa' considerations

   During the trial, the Infrastructure ENUM deployed in the
   2.8.e164.arpa zone could be accessed via the (public) Internet.  In
   this situation, each carrier questioned whether the centralized
   number management under the ENUM DNS was realistic or not.

   Another issue concerned responsibility for routing errors.  All
   carriers can use the shared ENUM data to route their calls.  However,
   if there are routing errors (due to the data being provisioned
   incorrectly), it is not always clear who has responsibility for these
   errors and who can correct the data.  The errors occur in the
   networks of the carriers placing the calls.  Unless the identity of
   the carrier responsible for delivering service to this telephone
   number is known, it is not obvious (to the carrier handling the
   error) who should be informed of these problems.

   In addition, the carriers also question why Infrastructure ENUM needs
   to be accessible publicly.  To prevent disclosure of telephone
   numbers, they prefer to access the ENUM DNS privately.  Therefore any
   ENUM module embedded in a softswitch needs to be flexible, to adopt
   these considerations during the interim period of ENUM.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document basically follows the same security consideration of
   RFC 3761 and 'draft-ietf-enum-infrastructure-05.txt'[6] because the
   ENUM DNS could be accessed publicly.

   In addition, If the recursive DNS handling ENUM queries coming from a
   softswitch is compromised by an attacker, it will be able to fail a
   call or cause delay to a call.  Therefore, the recursive DNS used
   should allow access from the local network to which the softswitch is
   connected, whilst restricting access from outside, using a proper
   access-list policy.
