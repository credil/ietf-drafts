                IPv6 RA Option for DS-Lite AFTR Element
                      draft-lee-6man-ra-dslite-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router
   Advertisement to allow IPv6 routers to advertise DS-Lite AFTR
   addresses to IPv6 hosts.  The provisioning of the AFTR information is
   crucial to access IPv4 connectivity services in a DS-Lite context.
   Means to ensure reliable delivery of this information to connecting
   hosts is a must.

   Furthermore, this RA option can be used as a means to distribute DS-
   Lite serviced customers among a set of deployed AFTRs without
   requiring a central knowledge of the underlying topology and deployed
   AFTRs.

Internet-Draft             RA for AFTR Element            September 2010


1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is an IPv6
   transition technique that provides IPv4 connectivity service to IPv6-
   enabled hosts.  In DS-Lite framework, the B4 element must tunnel the
   IPv4-in-IPv6 datagrams to the AFTR in the provider network.  As
   currently defined in Softwire WG, B4 element learns the AFTR address
   from DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option] and RADIUS
   [I-D.maglione-softwire-dslite-radius-ext].

   The provisioning of the AFTR information to connecting hosts is
   mandatory for the delivery of IPv4 connectivity services in the
   context of DS-Lite deployment.  As an analogy with IPv6 connectivity
   provisioning, the AFTR information is similar to both the assignment
   of an IPv6 address and a default IPv6 route.  Indeed, when no AFTR
   information is provisioned to a requesting hosts, no external IPv4
   address would be assigned and the IPv4 traffic won't be delivered
   outside the local domain.  In other terms, fail to provision an AFTR
   to B4 element will break IPv4 connectivity.

   Service providers need a reliable and flexible method to distribute
   the AFTR addresses to the B4 elements in customers' premises.  This
   document describes a mechanism to use a new IPv6 RA Option to
   advertise the AFTR address to the IPv6 hosts.


2.  Motivation

   A service provider may want to deploy DS-lite without using DHCP.
   Auto-configuration [RFC4861] allows an IPv6 host to learn the IPv6
   prefix and IPv6 default gateway solely from the Router Advertisement
   (RA).  In this memo, we define a new AFTR RA option so that a B4
   element can learn a set of AFTRs from the RA.


3.  Coexistence of RA Option and DHCPv6 Option

   The RA AFTR option and the DHCP option can be used together.  When
   the host receives a RA and the "O" flag is set in the RA, the host
   may send a DHCP request for AFTR provisioning.  If the DHCP server
   returns the DS-Lite tunnel option, the host may use the address in
   the option.  If the RA does not contain the AFTR option, the RA may
   send the DHCP request to obtain the AFTR configuration from the DHCP
   server regardless of whether the "O" flag is set in the RA or not.

Internet-Draft             RA for AFTR Element            September 2010


4.  Terminology

   This document uses terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  In addition, we define the
   following new terms:

   o  AFTR Option: IPv6 RA option to deliver AFTR information to IPv6
      hosts.

   o  AFTR Element List: A data structure for managing AFTR Element
      Information in the IPv6 protocol stack in addition to the Neighbor
      Cache and Destination Cache for Neighbor Discovery.


5.  Overview

   This document defines a new ND option called AFTR option that
   contains the list of IPv6 addresses of AFTR elements.  This new
   option advertises an available list of AFTR elements.  This option
   follows the procedures defined in [RFC4861].  AFTR element is only
   useful for B4 elements, ordinary IPv6 host must ignore this option.
   The IPv6 host with B4 element implemented may learn a list of AFTR
   elements in this option.  When the option contains multiple
   addresses, the B4 element configures and prioritize the AFTR elements
   based on local policy.

   The AFTR option can be sent along with other options in the same RA
   message simultaneously.  The router sending the AFTR option in RA
   must be configured with the AFTR information.  The information is
   provisioned in the first-hop router of the B4 elements.  The AFTR
   option can be used on any network that supports ND.


6.  Neighour Discovery Extension

   This AFTR configuration mechanism in this memo defines a new ND
   option in Neighbor Discovery: The AFTR Element option.

6.1.  AFTR Element Option

   The AFTR Element Option contains one or more IPv6 addresses of the
   AFTR elements.  All of the addresses share the same lifetime value.
   If a particular AFTR is configured to have different lifetime values,
   a new AFTR option can be used.  [RFC2119] shows the AFTR Element
   Option format.

   o  Lifetime is a 16-bit unsigned integer.  The lifetime associated
      with the AFTR elements in units of seconds.

   o  Addresses of IPv6 AFTR Elements contain one or more 128-bit IPv6
      addresses of the AFTR elements.  The number of addresses is
      determined by the Length field.  That is, the number if addresses
      is equal to (Length - 1) / 2.

6.1.1.  Procedure in IPv6 Host with B4 Implementation

   When the host receives the option via RA, it checks whether the
   option is valid.

      value into the B4 configuration.

   o  If the AFTR option is invalid, the host must discard the option.

Appendix A.  Load Balancing Use Case

   [[Note: The content of this section is still under discussion between
   authors.]]

   Load balancing and traffic dimensioning is one of the hot topic to be
   considered when deploying stateful devices such as AFTRs.  Service
   providers need means to distribute their DS-Lite serviced customers
   among a set of AFTR devices without experiencing any congestion
   neither traffic loss due to the overloading of a given AFTR while
   free AFTR resources are available.  This dimensioning task is not new
   per se.  In particular, VoIP service providers rely on DNS to
   redirect customer traffic to a given SBC (or P-CSCF) node.

   Various solutions to balance customer among a set of AFTRs can be
   considered as follows:

   o  DHCPv6 server returns an IPv6 address of an AFTR based on a
      identifier of the customer.  This logic is not natively supported
      by DHCPv6 servers and brings additional complexity to the DHCPv6
      server.

   o  DHCPv6 server returns a generic FQDN of AFTR nodes.  A DNS-based
      load balancing is implemented during the resolution of the FQDN.
      One of the drawbacks of this alternative is it does not guarantee
      that the same AFTR will be assigned to a requesting client.  In
      particular, the load balancing system must redirect a client to an
      AFTR where it has installed previous static port bindings;
      otherwise two distinct external IPv4 addresses will be used to
      represent the same client.

   o  DHCPv6 returns a geographical domain search name which will be
      used to redirect the client to a given AFTR.  The drawback of this
      option is that the DHCPv6 server needs to correlate the AFTR
      information with an identifier of the requesting customer.

   o  The DHCPv6 agent relay can insert locally configured information
      when responding back to a connecting client.  This processing can
      be simplified if the RA mode is used to convey the AFTR
      information.  The DHCPv6 agent relay has not to inspect the
      content of all received DHCP messages from the connecting clients

      (indeed, some of these clients may not be DS-Lite serviced and
      therefore the agent rely should not blindly insert the AFTR
      information).

   o  Etc.

   As an alternative to these modes, RA can be used to implicitly
   redirect DS-Lite serviced customers to a given AFTR without requiring
   any use of a customer identifier.  DHCPv6 servers are not modified.

   Access routers can be configured to insert an IP address or local
   FQDN when sending RAs to attached hosts.  The configuration of the
   information to be inserted in RA messages can be achieved using
   already deployed tools.


Appendix B.  Scope

   It was tempting to define a generic option which is an extension of
   [RFC4191] to indicate a route which is used by IPv4-in-IPv6 traffic.
   Since DS-Lite is the only technique which is required crossing a
   stateful device after the de-capsulation.  We decided to limit the
   applicability scope of this option to DS-Lite.
