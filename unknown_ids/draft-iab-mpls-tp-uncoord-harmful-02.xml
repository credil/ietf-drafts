    <abstract>
      <t>This document identifies problems that may result from the absence of
      formal coordination and joint development on protocols of mutual
      interest between standards development organizations. Some of these
      problems may cause significant harm to the Internet. The document
      suggests that a robust procedure is required prevent this from occurring
      in the future. The IAB has selected a number of case studies, such as
      T-MPLS, as recent examples to describe hazard to the Internet
      architecture as a result of uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol.</t>

      <t>This experience has resulted in a considerable improvement in the
      relationship between the IETF and the ITU-T. In particular, this was
      achieved via the establishment of the "Joint working team on MPLS-TP" .
      In addition, the leadership of the two organisations agreed to improve
      inter-organizational working practices so as to avoid conflict in the
      future between ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs.</t>

      <t>Whilst we use ITU-T - IETF interactions in these case studies, the
      scope of the document extends to all SDO that have an overlapping
      protocol interest with the IETF.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol, parameter, or code-point
      by a standards development organization (SDO), either through the
      allocation of a code-point without following the formal registration
      procedures, or by unilaterally modifying the semantics of the protocol
      or intended use of the code-point itself, poses a risk of harm to the
      Internet <xref target="RFC4775"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this document is to describe the various problems that
      may occur without formal coordination and joint development on protocols
      of mutual interest between SDOs. Some of the problems that arise may
      cause significant harm to the Internet. In particular, the IAB considers
      an essential principle of the protocol development process that only one
      SDO maintains design authority for a given protocol, with that SDO
      having ultimate authority over the allocation of protocol parameter
      code-points; defining the intended semantics, interpretation, and
      actions associated with those code-points.</t>

      <t>There is currently a joint IETF - ITU-T development effort underway,
      known as MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP), which is progressing rapidly
      to extend MPLS in a way that is consistent with the MPLS architecture,
      and fully satisfies the requirements of the transport network provider
      <xref target="LS26"></xref>. By way of a case study we will refer to the
      design and standardization process of the ITU-T protocol known as
      Transport MPLS (T-MPLS). Development of T-MPLS was abandoned <xref
      target="RFC5317"></xref> by ITU-T Study Group 15 due to inherent
      conflicts with the IETF MPLS design and in particular with the Internet
      architecture. These conflicts arose due to the lack of coordination with
      the IETF as the design authority for MPLS.</t>

      <t>The goal of this document is to demonstrate the importance of a
      coordinated approach to successful collaboration between SDOs, and to
      explain a model for inter-SDO collaborative protocol development that is
      being used successfully by the ITU-T and IETF.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Design Rules">
      <t>This section describes a number of protocol design rules needed to
      ensure the safe operation of a network. Whilst these rules will be
      familiar to many protocol designers the rules are restated here, to
      ensure that assumptions are clear and consistent. Differing assumptions
      have been at the root of may mis-coordinations and miscommunication
      between SDOs in the past.</t>

      <section title="Protocol Safety">
        <t>To understand the reasons why the IAB and the IETF regards
        uncoordinated use of code-points and/or protocol modification as
        posing a risk of harm to the Internet, it is necessary to recap some
        important principles of protocol design in large scale networks such
        as the Internet. Many end users and businesses have come to rely on
        the Internet as part of their critical infrastructure, thus large
        scale networks such as the Internet, represent significant economic
        value. Any outage in a large scale network due to a protocol failure
        will therefore result in significant commercial and political damage.
        When two incompatible protocols, or forms of the same protocol, are
        deployed without coordination, there is a serious risk that this may
        be catastrophic to the stability or security of the network.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, the scale and distributed nature of the Internet is
        such that it may be difficult or impossible to rid the network of the
        long- term consequences of the protocol incompatibility. Therefore,
        the following issues are of critical importance.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Importance of Invariants">
        <t>Invariants are core properties that are consistent across the
        network and do not change over extremely long time-scales. Protocol
        designers use such invariants as axioms in designing protocols. A
        protocol often places an absolute reliance on an invariant to resolve
        a design corner case. One example of an invariance in IP that was
        inherited in the design of MPLS is the invariant that a time to live
        (TTL) value is monotonically decreased and that a packet with
        TTL&lt;=1 will not be forwarded. This is a safety mechanism to
        mitigate the damaging effects of packet forwarding loops. Another
        example is the way that MPLS applies special semantics to the reserved
        label set <xref target="RFC3032"></xref> (0..15), and the notion that
        a Label Switched Router (LSR) is free to allocate labels with a value
        of 16 or greater for its own use.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Importance of Correct Identification">
        <t>A special type of invariant is the allocation of a code-point. A
        code-point may be used to identify a packet type or a component within
        a packet. Without these identifiers, a packet is an opaque sequence of
        bits. A packet parser operates by first identifying the code-point and
        then using the semantics associated with that code-point to interpret
        other components within the packet. Once a code-point is defined the
        interpretation of associated data and the consequential actions
        becomes a protocol invariant. Subsequent protocol development must
        adhere to those invariants. The semantics for an allocated code point
        must never change. If a future enhancement requires different
        semantics, interpretation, or action, then a new code point must be
        obtained.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Role of the Design Authority">
        <t>A code-point such as an IEEE Ethertype is allocated to a design
        authority such as the IETF. It is this design authority that
        establishes how information identified by the code-point is to be
        interpreted to associate appropriate invariants. Modification and
        extension of a protocol requires great care. In particular it is
        necessary to understand the exact nature of the invariants and the
        consequences of modification. This may not always be the case when
        protocols are modified by organizations without the experience of the
        original designers, or the design authority expert pool. Furthermore,
        since there can only safely be a single interpretation of the
        information identified by a code-point, there must be a unique
        authority responsible for authorizing and documenting the semantics of
        the information and consequential protocol actions.</t>

        <t>In the case of IP and MPLS technologies, the design authority is
        the IETF. The IETF has an internal process for evolving and
        maintaining the protocols for which it is the design authority. The
        IETF also has change processes in place <xref target="RFC4929"></xref>
        to work with other SDOs that require enhancements to its protocols and
        architectures. Similarly, the ITU has design authority for
        Recommendation E.164 <xref target="E.164"></xref> and allocates the
        relevant code points, even though the IETF has design authority for
        the protocols ("ENUM") used to access E.164 numbers through the
        Internet DNS <xref target="RFC3245"></xref>.</t>

        <t>It is a recommendation of this document that the IETF introduces
        additional change mechanisms to encompass all of the technical areas
        for which it has design authority.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Ships in the Night">
        <t>It may be tempting for a designer to assert that the protocol
        extensions it proposes are safe even though it breaks the invariants
        of the original protocol because these protocol variants will operate
        as ships in the night. That is, these protocol variants will never
        simultaneously exist in the same network domain and will never need to
        inter-work. This is a fundamentally unsound assumption for a number of
        reasons. First, it is infeasible to ensure that the two instances will
        never be interconnected under any circumstances. Second, even if the
        operators that deploy the protocols apply appropriate due diligence to
        ensure that the two instances do not conflict, it is infeasible to
        ensure that such conflicting protocols will not be interconnected
        under fault conditions.</t>

        <t>This assumption of ships in the night is particularly hazardous
        when the instances of the protocol share the same identifying
        code-point. This is because a system is unable to determine which
        variant of the protocol it has received, and hence how to correctly
        interpret the associated information or to determine what protocol
        actions may be safely executed.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Examples of Miscoordination ">
      <t>There are a variety of examples where lack of inter-SDO coordination
      has led to the publication of flawed protocol designs. This section
      describes a number of case studies that illustrate co-ordination
      issues.</t>

      <section anchor="t-mpls-case" title="T-MPLS As a Case Study">
        <t>A recent example where another SDO created a protocol based on
        misunderstandings of the IETF protocols is T-MPLS. T-MPLS was created
        in ITU-T in an attempt to design a packet transport method for
        transport-oriented networks. This is an example of the success that
        IETF protocols have enjoyed, and ITU-T's interest and selection of
        MPLS is a compliment to the IETF work. Quite late in the ITU-T design
        and specification cycle, there were a number of liaison exchanges
        between the ITU-T and the IETF, where the IETF became increasingly
        concerned about incompatibility of IETF MPLS procedures and
        technologies with ITU-T T-MPLS <xref target="RFC5317"></xref>.
        Extensive discussions took place regarding interpretation, definition,
        and misunderstandings regarding aspects such as MPLS Label 14, MPLS
        swap operation, TTL semantics, reservation of additional Labels, and
        EXP bits. If ITU-T had worked with IETF from the start in developing
        T-MPLS, these problems could have been avoided. A detailed analysis of
        the T-MPLS case is provided in <xref target="TMPLS-APP"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PPP over Sonet/SDH">
        <t>An example of where the IETF failed to co-ordinate with the ITU-T
        is <xref target="RFC1619"></xref>. In this draft the IETF misdefined
        PPP over SONET, erroneously stating that "no scrambling is needed
        during insertion into the SONET/SDH Synchronous Payload Envelope
        (SPE)." It was later determined by SONET experts operating in the
        ITU-T and in ANSI, that this error arose due to an incomplete
        understanding of the SONET scrambler. By not using a scrambler the
        protocol was attempting to transport non-transparent data over SONET.
        This resulted in lost or misinterpreted data in the PoS network. This
        impacted routing, signaling and end-user data traffic. Details of this
        work are described in <xref
        target="pppext-pppsonet-scrambler"></xref>. This problem would have
        been prevented if the IETF had worked with ITU-T and ANSI in initially
        developing <xref target="RFC1619"></xref> . The problem was resolved
        by working jointly with ITU-T and ANSI experts to publish <xref
        target="RFC2615"></xref>, which mandated the use of scrambling.</t>

        <t>Note that <xref target="RFC1619"></xref> was developed four years
        before the IETF and ITU-T agreed on formal procedures for cooperation,
        as documented in <xref target="RFC2436"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Managing Information Flow">
      <t>This section recommends that intra and inter SDO information flows
      require careful management in order to prevent the accidental extension
      of protocols without the complete coordination of the work with the
      relevant design authority.</t>

      <section title="Managing Information Flow within an SDO">
        <t>One cannot assume that an SDO is completely familiar with the
        internal structure, information exchange or internal processes of
        another SDO. Hence the initial contact point and the subgroup with
        which a long term working relationship is formed has a the duty to
        ensure that the work fully is notified and co-ordinated to all
        relevant parties withing the SDO.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Managing Information Flow between SDOs">
        <t>A recommendation is that as part of their document approval process
        SDOs should confirm that all protocol parameters code points, TLV
        identifiers, etc. have been authorized by the appropriate design
        authority (e.g., IANA, IETF, etc. in this case) and SDO approval from
        the design authority has been obtained prior to publishing protocol
        extensions. This confirmation should be an integral part of the
        approval or consent process as verifying that the normative references
        are qualified.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="MPLS-TP As Best Practice">
      <t>In order to bridge the gap between the two organizations, the IETF
      and the ITU-T established a joint working team (JWT) to assess whether
      it was possible to enhance existing MPLS standards to provide a best in
      class solution for transport networks. The outcome of this investigation
      is reported in <xref target="RFC5317"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The JWT proposed a design that was acceptable to both SDOs. This has
      lead to the creation of the MPLS-TP project. This is a joint project in
      which the ITU-T experts work with the IETF on protocol development
      tasks; and IETF members work within the ITU-T to understand
      requirements, and to assist in the creation of the ITU-T recommendations
      that describe MPLS-TP in which the technical definition is provided
      through normative references to IETF RFCs.</t>

      <t>Although the JWT approach allowed the IETF and the ITU-T to agree on
      a method of resolving the T-MPLS problem, this approach had a
      significant resource cost. The JWT required considerable protocol design
      expertise and IETF management time to agree on a suitable technical
      solution. A light weight process, starting with close coordination
      during the requirements phase, and continuing during the development
      phase, would likely reduce the resources needed to an acceptable level
      in the future.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IETF Change Process">
      <t>There is an MPLS-change-process <xref target="RFC4929"></xref> .
      However the IETF has yet not defined a change process that is applicable
      to all of its work areas. The problems described in this document
      indicate that the IETF need to develop a universal change process. The
      MPLS-change-process would seem to be a suitable starting point.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security considerations">
      <t>The uncoordinated development of protocols is poses a risk of harm to
      the Internet and must not be permitted. The enhancement or modification
      of a protocol can increase attack surfaces considerably and may
      therefore compromise the security or stability of the Internet. The IETF
      has a review process that combines cross area review with specialist
      security review by experts familiar with the development and deployment
      context of the Internet protocol suite. In particular, because of the
      Internet infrastructure's reliance on the IP and MPLS protocol suites,
      this security review process must be exercised with considerable
      diligence. Failure to apply this review process exposes the Internet to
      increased risk along both security and stability vectors.</t>

    <section title="Emerging Issues">
      <t>Although we have used T-MPLS as a case study, there are other ongoing
      ITU-T projects and core IETF specifications that could be the subject of
      either improved coordination or new conflicts, depending on whether or
      not the principles outlined in this document are adhered to by the IETF
      and ITU., Two current examples are: <xref target="Y.2015"></xref> , and
      <xref target="Q.Flowsig"></xref> . New areas with potential for
      cooperation or conflict are emerging from the work of ITU-T SG13
      Question 7, "IPv6" for example: <xref target="Y.ipv6split"></xref> and
      <xref target="Y.ipv6migration"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Improved coordination, of course, is not limited to the relationship
      between IETF and ITU-T. This issue is present between an set of SDOs.
      The IETF - ITU-T relationship has simply been used because there is a
      recent example where a potential disaster was, through much hard work,
      not only prevented, but turned into a net gain for all.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusion">
      <t>It is important that all SDOs developing standards that effect the
      operation of the Internet learn the lessons that arise from cases cited
      in this document. Uncoordinated parallel work between SDOs creates
      significant problems with potentially damaging operation impact to those
      that deploy and use the Internet. Both inter and intra SDO information
      flow needs to be well managed to ensure that all impacted parties are
      aware of work items. Finally, the IETF needs to develop a universal
      change process that encompasses all of its work areas.</t>

    <section anchor="TMPLS-APP" title="A Review of the T-MPLS Case ">
      <t>T-MPLS was created in ITU-T in an attempt to design an MPLS based
      packet transport method for transport-oriented networks. This appendix
      describes the technical issues that the IETF identified with the T-MPLS
      documents and their consequences.</t>

      <section title="Multiple Definitions of Label 14">
        <t>To appreciate why the use of MPLS Reserved Label 14 by the T-MPLS
        protocol represented a safety concern to the Internet, it is important
        to understand the current standards that use MPLS Reserved Label
        14.</t>

        <t>The governing standard on the use of MPLS Reserved Label 14 is
        <xref target="RFC3429"></xref>, "Assignment of the 'OAM Alert Label'
        for Multi-protocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) Operation and
        Maintenance (OAM) Functions".</t>

        <t>Label 14 is assigned to a specific protocol, namely, ITU-T
        Recommendation <xref target="Y.1711-2002"></xref>.</t>

        <t>ITU-T Recommendation [Y.1711-2002] has been superseded by newer
        versions, specifically: - <xref target="Y.1711-2004"></xref>, <xref
        target="Y.1711cor1"></xref> and <xref target="Y.1711am1"></xref>.</t>

        <t>All three documents are currently in-force as ITU-T
        Recommendations.</t>

        <t>The problem is that the changes made to Y.1711 were never reflected
        in an update to RFC 3429 which only defines the protocol as specified
        by the now superseded 2002 Recommendation. So for example, MPLS
        equipment responding to an MPLS packet containing Label 14 would
        expect to see the 2002 version of Y.1711 [Y.1711-2002] protocol and
        would not recognize any of the new function codes specified in Y.1711
        Amendment 1. This problem arises because Y.1711 does not have a
        version field, and RFC 3429 offers no other method to disambiguate
        non-interoperable versions of Y.1711. Having a version number in the
        protocol permits an implementer to codify non-interoperability.
        Furthermore, the IETF as the authority over Label 14 semantics has the
        final say over maintaining the interoperability of the protocol
        employing that code-point, unless the IETF explicitly delegates such
        authority.</t>

        <t>With regard to T-MPLS there was a lack of coordination between the
        ITU-T and the IETF over the redefinition of the semantics of MPLS
        label 14, which resulted in protocol definitions that conflicted with
        the IETF MPLS Architecture.</t>

        <t>The MPLS architecture <xref target="RFC3031"></xref>, defines a
        swap operation as an atomic function that replaces the top label in an
        MPLS label stack with another label which provides context for the
        next hop LSR. However the ITU-T Recommendations that specified the new
        OAM functions defined by Label 14 redefined the label swap operation
        as a POP, followed by a PUSH, thereby causing all LSRs to inspect the
        label stack for the presence of Label 14 at each hop. This proposed
        new behaviour conflicts with the IETF definition of a swap operation.
        The behaviour proposed in these specifications would have had major
        consequences for deployed hardware designs. The outcome would have
        been that the equipments built according to the two different
        specifications would have been incompatible. It is important that the
        atomic procedure defined in <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> is kept
        unchanged.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Redefinition of TTL Semantics">
        <t>The standard method of delivering an OAM message to an entity on a
        label switched path (LSP) such that the OAM message fate shares with
        the data traffic is to use TTL expiry. The IETF's Internet Protocol
        (IP) utilizes this mechanism for traceroute <xref
        target="RFC1393"></xref>, as does MPLS ping <xref
        target="RFC4379"></xref>.</t>

        <t>At one stage, the T-MPLS designers considered a multi-level OAM
        design in which the OAM packet was steered to its target by a process
        in which some nodes increased the TTL as they forwarded the OAM packet
        to its next hop. TTL is a safety device in the IETF IP and MPLS
        architecture that prevents a packet from continuously looping under
        fault conditions. Thus the proposed extension to support an enhanced
        OAM mechanism violated an MPLS design invariant specifically
        introduced to ensure safe operation of the Internet by preventing
        persistent forwarding loops.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reservation of Additional Labels">
        <t>The IETF MPLS protocol uses a small number of reserved labels <xref
        target="RFC3032"></xref> as a mechanism to provide additional context
        and to trigger some special processing operations in the forwarder.
        All other labels used for forwarding use semantics defined by the
        forwarding equivalence class (FEC). In an early implementation of
        T-MPLS the designers determined that they needed some additional
        labels to alert the forwarder that the packet needed special
        processing. Thus a conflict was thereby introduced between the
        behaviour of an IETF MPLS LSR, and LSRs that operate according to the
        specification in the ITU-T Recommendation. Thus some LSRs would
        attribute special semantics to labels 16..31, whist other LSRs would
        perform normal forwarding on them.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Redefinition of MPLS EXP Bits">
        <t>The early MPLS documents defined the form of the MPLS label stack
        entry <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>. This includes a three-bit field
        called the "EXP field". The exact use of this field was not defined by
        these documents, except to state that it was to be "reserved for
        experimental use".</t>

        <t>Although the intended use of the EXP field was as a "Class of
        Service" (CoS) field, it was not named a CoS field by these early
        documents because the use of such a CoS field was not considered to be
        sufficiently defined. Today a number of standards documents define its
        usage as a CoS field <xref target="RFC3270"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC5129"></xref>, and hardware is deployed that assumes this
        exclusive usage.</t>

        <t>The T-MPLS designers, unaware of the historic reason for the
        "provisional" naming of this field assumed that they were available
        for any experimental use and re-purposed them to indicate the
        maintenance entity level (a hierarchical maintenance mechanism).</t>

        <t>The intended use of the EXP field was subsequently carried in <xref
        target="RFC5462"></xref>, which reinforces this by formally changing
        the name to Traffic Class (TC).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Consequences for the Network Operators">
        <t>Transport network operators need a way to realize the statistical
        gain inherent in packet networking while retaining the familiar
        operational structure of their SONET/SDH networks. T-MPLS was an
        attempt to provide that functionality. However, by creating an
        incompatible variant of MPLS without tight coordination with IETF
        created a number of problems for network operators.</t>

        <t>Firstly, those operators that deployed T-MPLS in production
        networks will need to address the risk and complexity of transitioning
        their network to MPLS-TP. Secondly, there has been a consequential
        delay the necessary enhancements to MPLS to meet their needs <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements"></xref> as the IETF and ITU-T
        executed a redevelopment of MPLS-based transport network
        protocols.</t>

        <t>Fortunately, the two organizations are now working together to
        design the necessary enhancements</t>

        <t>The resulting technology, MPLS-TP, brings significant benefits to
        all. However this has not been without cost. Had things continued, we
        are not sure what would have happened, at the least, the larger MPLS
        community would have been denied the benefit of better OAM, and the
        transport community would have been denied the many benefits of an
        interoperable solution.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The Consequences for the SDOs">
        <t>The process of resolution required considerable resources and
        introduced a great deal of conflict between the IETF and the ITU-T,
        much of which was exposed to public scrutiny, to the detriment of both
        organizations. In particular this conflict resolution process consumed
        the very resources required to develop an optimal architecture for
        MPLS in transport networks.</t>
