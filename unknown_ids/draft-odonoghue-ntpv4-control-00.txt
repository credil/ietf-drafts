Internet-Draft            NTP Control Messages              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The text below is
   taken directly from RFC 1305.  Input is requested to update the text
   to reflect current practice.  This is required to fully obsolete RFC
   1305.

   In a comprehensive network-management environment, facilities are
   presumed available to perform routine NTP control and monitoring
   functions, such as setting the leap-indicator bits at the primary
   servers, adjusting the various system parameters and monitoring
   regular operations.  Ordinarily, these functions can be implemented
   using a network-management protocol such as SNMP and suitable
   extensions to the MIB database.  However, in those cases where such
   facilities are not available, these functions can be implemented
   using special NTP control messages described herein.  These messages
   are intended for use only in systems where no other management
   facilities are available or appropriate, such as in dedicated-
   function bus peripherals.  Support for these messages is not required
   in order to conform to this specification.

   The NTP Control Message has the value 6 specified in the mode field
   of the first octet of the NTP header and is formatted as shown below.
   The format of the data field is specific to each command or response;
   however, in most cases the format is designed to be constructed and
   viewed by humans and so is coded in free-form ASCII.  This
   facilitates the specification and implementation of simple management
   tools in the absence of fully evolved network-management facilities.
   As in ordinary NTP messages, the authenticator field follows the data
   field.  If the authenticator is used the data field is zero-padded to
   a 32-bit boundary, but the padding bits are not considered part of
   the data field and are not included in the field count.

   IP hosts are not required to reassemble datagrams larger than 576
   octets; however, some commands or responses may involve more data
   than will fit into a single datagram.  Accordingly, a simple
   reassembly feature is included in which each octet of the message
   data is numbered starting with zero.  As each fragment is transmitted
   the number of its first octet is inserted in the offset field and the
   number of octets is inserted in the count field.  The more-data (M)
   bit is set in all fragments except the last.

   Most control functions involve sending a command and receiving a
   response, perhaps involving several fragments.  The sender chooses a
   distinct, nonzero sequence number and sets the status field and R and
   E bits to zero.  The responder interprets the opcode and additional
   information in the data field, updates the status field, sets the R
   bit to one and returns the three 32-bit words of the header along



Mills & O'Donoghue       Expires April 26, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            NTP Control Messages              October 2011


   with additional information in the data field.  In case of invalid
   message format or contents the responder inserts a code in the status
   field, sets the R and E bits to one and, optionally, inserts a
   diagnostic message in the data field.

   Some commands read or write system variables and peer variables for
   an association identified in the command.  Others read or write
   variables associated with a radio clock or other device directly
   connected to a source of primary synchronization information.  To
   identify which type of variable and association a 16-bit association
   identifier is used.  System variables are indicated by the identifier
   zero.  As each association is mobilized a unique, nonzero identifier
   is created for it.  These identifiers are used in a cyclic fashion,
   so that the chance of using an old identifier which matches a newly
   created association is remote.  A management entity can request a
   list of current identifiers and subsequently use them to read and
   write variables for each association.  An attempt to use an expired
   identifier results in an exception response, following which the list
   can be requested again.

   Some exception events, such as when a peer becomes reachable or
   unreachable, occur spontaneously and are not necessarily associated
   with a command.  An implementation may elect to save the event
   information for later retrieval or to send an asynchronous response
   (called a trap) or both.  In case of a trap the IP address and port
   number is determined by a previous command and the sequence field is
   set as described below.  Current status and summary information for
   the latest exception event is returned in all normal responses.  Bits
   in the status field indicate whether an exception has occurred since
   the last response and whether more than one exception has occurred.

   Commands need not necessarily be sent by an NTP peer, so ordinary
   access-control procedures may not apply; however, the optional mask/
   match mechanism suggested elsewhere in this document provides the
   capability to control access by mode number, so this could be used to
   limit access for control messages (mode 6) to selected address
   ranges.


2.  NTP Control Message Format

   The format of the NTP Control Message header, which immediately
   follows the UDP header, is shown in Figure 1.  Following is a
   description of its fields.  Bit positions marked as zero are reserved
   and should always be transmitted as zero.

   Version Number (VN): This is a three-bit integer indicating the NTP
   version number, currently three (3).

Internet-Draft            NTP Control Messages              October 2011


   Mode: This is a three-bit integer indicating the mode.  It must have
   the value 6, indicating an NTP control message.

   Response Bit (R): Set to zero for commands, one for responses.

   Error Bit (E): Set to zero for normal response, one for error
   response.

   More Bit (M): Set to zero for last fragment, one for all others.

   Operation Code (Op): This is a five-bit integer specifying the
   command function.  Values currently defined include the following:

   Appendix C of RFC 1305.


3.  Status Words

   Status words indicate the present status of the system, associations
   and clock.  They are designed to be interpreted by network-monitoring
   programs and are in one of four 16-bit formats shown in Figure 6 and
   described in this section.  System and peer status words are
   associated with responses for all commands except the read clock
   variables, write clock variables and set trap address/port commands.
   The association identifier zero specifies the system status word,
   while a nonzero identifier specifies a particular peer association.
   The status word returned in response to read clock variables and
   write clock variables commands indicates the state of the clock
   hardware and decoding software.  A special error status word is used
   to report malformed command fields or invalid values.

3.1.  System Status Word

   The system status word appears in the status field of the response to
   a read status or read variables command with a zero association
   identifier.  The format of the system status word is as follows:

   Leap Indicator (LI): This is a two-bit code warning of an impending
   leap second to be inserted/deleted in the last minute of the current
   day, with bit 0 and bit 1, respectively, coded as follows:

   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  LI  |                       Meaning                              |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  00  | no warning                                                 |
   |  01  | read status command/response                               |
   |  10  | read variables command/response                            |
   |  11  | write variables command/response                           |

   System Event Counter: This is a four-bit integer indicating the
   number of system exception events occurring since the last time the
   system status word was returned in a response or included in a trap
   message.  The counter is cleared when returned in the status field of
   a response and freezes when it reaches the value 15.

   System Event Code: This is a four-bit integer identifying the latest
   system exception event, with new values overwriting previous values,
   and coded as follows:

+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

3.2.  Peer Status Word

   A peer status word is returned in the status field of a response to a
   read status, read variables or write variables command and appears
   also in the list of association identifiers and status words returned
   by a read status command with a zero association identifier.  The
   format of a peer status word is as follows:

3.3.  Clock Status Word

   There are two ways a reference clock can be attached to a NTP service
   host, as an dedicated device managed by the operating system and as a
   synthetic peer managed by NTP.  As in the read status command, the
   association identifier is used to identify which one, zero for the
   system clock and nonzero for a peer clock.  Only one system clock is
   supported by the protocol, although many peer clocks can be
   supported.  A system or peer clock status word appears in the status
   field of the response to a read clock variables or write clock
   variables command.  This word can be considered an extension of the
   system status word or the peer status word as appropriate.  The
   format of the clock status word is as follows:

   Clock Status: This is an eight-bit integer indicating the current
   clock status, with values coded as follows:

| Clock Status |                      Meaning                               |

|       0      | clock operating within nominals                            |

|     7-255    | reserved                                                   |

   Clock Event Code: This is an eight-bit integer identifying the latest
   clock exception event, with new values overwriting previous values.
   When a change to any nonzero value occurs in the radio status field,
   the radio status field is copied to the clock event code field and a

   system or peer clock exception event is declared as appropriate.

3.4.  Error Status Word

   An error status word is returned in the status field of an error
   response as the result of invalid message format or contents.  Its
   presence is indicated when the E (error) bit is set along with the
   response (R) bit in the response.  It consists of an eight-bit
   integer coded as follows:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Error Status |                    Meaning                                 |

4.  Commands

   Commands consist of the header and optional data field shown in
   Figure 6 of RFC 1305.  When present, the data field contains a list
   of identifiers or assignments in the form
   <<identifier>>[=<<value>>],<<identifier>>[=<<value>>],... where
   <<identifier>> is the ASCII name of a system or peer variable
   specified in Table 2 or Table 3 of RFC 1305 and <<value>> is
   expressed as a decimal, hexadecimal or string constant in the syntax
   of the C programming language.  Where no ambiguity exists, the
   <169>sys.<170> or <169>peer.<170> prefixes shown in Table 2 or Table
   4 of RFC 1305 can be suppressed.  Whitespace (ASCII nonprinting
   format effectors) can be added to improve readability for simple
   monitoring programs that do not reformat the data field.  Internet
   addresses are represented as four octets in the form [n.n.n.n], where
   n is in decimal notation and the brackets are optional.  Timestamps,
   including reference, originate, receive and transmit values, as well
   as the logical clock, are represented in units of seconds and
   fractions, preferably in hexadecimal notation, while delay, offset,
   dispersion and distance values are represented in units of
   milliseconds and fractions, preferably in decimal notation.  All
   other values are represented as-is, preferably in decimal notation.

   Implementations may define variables other than those listed in Table
   2 or Table 3 of RFC 1305.  Called extramural variables, these are
   distinguished by the inclusion of some character type other than
   alphanumeric or <169>.<170> in the name.  For those commands that
   return a list of assignments in the response data field, if the
   command data field is empty, it is expected that all available
   variables defined in Table 3 or Table 4 of RFC 1305 will be included
   in the response.  For the read commands, if the command data field is
   nonempty, an implementation may choose to process this field to
   individually select which variables are to be returned.

   Commands are interpreted as follows:

   Read Status (1): The command data field is empty or contains a list
   of identifiers separated by commas.  The command operates in two ways
   depending on the value of the association identifier.  If this
   identifier is nonzero, the response includes the peer identifier and
   status word.  Optionally, the response data field may contain other
   information, such as described in the Read Variables command.  If the
   association identifier is zero, the response includes the system
   identifier (0) and status word, while the data field contains a list
   of binary-coded pairs <<association identifier>> <<status word>>, one
   for each currently defined association.

   Read Variables (2): The command data field is empty or contains a
   list of identifiers separated by commas.  If the association
   identifier is nonzero, the response includes the requested peer
   identifier and status word, while the data field contains a list of
   peer variables and values as described above.  If the association
   identifier is zero, the data field contains a list of system
   variables and values.  If a peer has been selected as the
   synchronization source, the response includes the peer identifier and
   status word; otherwise, the response includes the system identifier
   (0) and status word.

   Write Variables (3): The command data field contains a list of
   assignments as described above.  The variables are updated as
   indicated.  The response is as described for the Read Variables
   command.

   Read Clock Variables (4): The command data field is empty or contains
   a list of identifiers separated by commas.  The association
   identifier selects the system clock variables or peer clock variables
   in the same way as in the Read Variables command.  The response
   includes the requested clock identifier and status word and the data
   field contains a list of clock variables and values, including the
   last timecode message received from the clock.

Internet-Draft            NTP Control Messages              October 2011


   Write Clock Variables (5): The command data field contains a list of
   assignments as described above.  The clock variables are updated as
   indicated.  The response is as described for the Read Clock Variables
   command.

   Set Trap Address/Port (6): The command association identifier, status
   and data fields are ignored.  The address and port number for
   subsequent trap messages are taken from the source address and port
   of the control message itself.  The initial trap counter for trap
   response messages is taken from the sequence field of the command.
   The response association identifier, status and data fields are not
   significant.  Implementations should include sanity timeouts which
   prevent trap transmissions if the monitoring program does not renew
   this information after a lengthy interval.

   Trap Response (7): This message is sent when a system, peer or clock
   exception event occurs.  The opcode field is 7 and the R bit is set.
   The trap counter is incremented by one for each trap sent and the
   sequence field set to that value.  The trap message is sent using the
   IP address and port fields established by the set trap address/port
   command.  If a system trap the association identifier field is set to
   zero and the status field contains the system status word.  If a peer
   trap the association identifier field is set to that peer and the
   status field contains the peer status word.  Optional ASCII-coded
   information can be included in the data field.
