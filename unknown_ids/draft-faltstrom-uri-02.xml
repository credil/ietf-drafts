		<abstract>
			<t>
				This document defines a new DNS resource record, called the Uniform
				Resource Identifier (URI) RR, for publishing mappings from hostnames
				to URIs.
			</t>
		</abstract>
	</front>
	<middle>
		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				This document explains the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) for
				storage of URIs, and how to resolve hostnames to such URIs that can be
				used by various applications. For resolution the application need to
				know both the hostname and the protocol that the URI is to be used
				for. The protocol is registered by IANA.
			</t>
			<t>
				Currently, looking up URIs given a hostname uses the <xref
        target="RFC3401">DDDS</xref> application framework with the DNS as a
        database as specified in <xref target="RFC3404">RFC 3404</xref>. This
        have a number of implications such as the
        inability to select what NAPTR records that match the query is
        interesting. The RRSet returned will always consist of all URIs
        "connected" with the domain in question.
			</t>
			<t>
				The URI resource record specified in this document create an ability
        for the querying party to select which ones of the NAPTR records one
        is interested in. This because data in the service field of the NAPTR
        record is included in the owner part of the URI resource record type.
			</t>
			<t>
				Querying for the URI resource record type is not replacing querying
        for the NAPTR (or <xref target="RFC3958">S-NAPTR</xref>) resource
        record type. Instead it is a complementary mechanism to use when one
        know already what service field is interesting. One can with the URI
        resource record type directly query for the specific subset of the
        otherwise possibly large RRSet given back when querying for NAPTR
        resource records.
			</t>
			<t>
				This document updates RFC 3958 and RFC 3404 by adding the flag "D" to
        the list of defined terminal flags in section 2.2.3 of RFC 3958 and
        4.3 of RFC 3404.
			</t>
			<t>
				The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
	   	</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Applicability Statement">
			<t>
				In general, it is expected that URI records will be used by clients
        for applications where the relevant protocol to be used is known, but
        for example extra abstraction given by separating a hostname from a
        point of service (as address by the URI) is needed. Example of such a
        situation is when an organisation have many domain names, but only one
        official web page.
			</t>
			<t>
				Applications MUST know the specific service fields to prepend the
        hostname with. Using repetitive queries for URI records MUST NOT be a
        replacement for querying for NAPTR or S-NAPTR records. NAPTR and
        S-NAPTR records are for discovery of the various services and URI for
        looking up access point for a given service. Those are two very
        different kinds of needs.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="DNS considerations">
			<t>
				Using prefix labels, such as underscored service tags, prevents the
        use of wildcards, as
        constructs as _s2._s1.*.example.net. are not possible in the DNS,
        see <xref target="RFC4592">RFC 4592</xref>. Besides, underscored
        service tags used for the URI RR (based on the NAPTR service
        descriptions) may have slightly different semantics than service tags
        used for underscored prefix labels that are used in combination with
        other (yet unspecified) RR types. This may cause subtle management
        problems when delegation structure that has developed within the
        context of URI RRs is also to be used for other RR types. Since the
        service labels might be overloaded applications should carefully check
        that the application level protocol is indeed the protocol they
        expect.
			</t>
			<t>
				Subtle management issues may also arise when the delegations from
        service to sub service label involves several parties and different
        stake holders.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="The format of the URI RR">
			<t>
				This is the format of the URI RR, whose DNS type code is TBD1 (to be
        assigned by IANA).
			</t>

Ownername TTL Class URI Priority Weight Target

				</artwork>
			</figure>
			<section title="Ownername, class and type">
		    <t>
		      The URI ownername is subject to special conventions.
		    </t>
		    <t>
		      Just like the <xref target="RFC2782">SRV RR</xref> the URI RR has service information
          encoded in its ownername. In order to encode the service for a
          specific owner name one use service parameters. Valid service
          parameters used are those as registered by IANA for
          Enumservice Registrations. The service parameters
          are reversed (subtype(s) before type), prepended with an underscore
          (_) and prepended to the owner name in separate labels. The
          underscore is prepended to the service parameters to avoid
          collisions with DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is
          reversed to make it possible to do delegations, if needed, to
          different zones (and therefore providers of DNS).
		    </t>
		    <t> 
		      For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service
		      with Service Parameter "A:B:C" for host example.com.. Then we
		      would query for (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_C._B._A.example.com","URI")
		    </t>   
		    <t>
		      The type number for the URI record is TBD1 (to be assigned by IANA).
		   	</t>
		   	<t>
		     	The URI resource record is class independent.
		   	</t>
		   	<t>
		     	The URI RR has no special TTL requirements.
		   	</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Priority">
				<t>
			    The priority of this target URI. A client MUST attempt to contact
          the URI with the lowest-numbered priority it can reach; URIs with
          the same priority SHOULD be tried in an order defined by the weight
          field. The range is 0-65535. This is a 16 bit unsigned integer in
          network byte order.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Weight">
				<t>
			    A server selection mechanism. The weight field specifies a
          relative weight for entries with the same priority. Larger weights
          SHOULD be given a proportionately higher probability of being
          selected. The range of this number is 0-65535. This is a 16 bit
          unsigned integer in network byte order.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Target">
				<t>
			    The URI of the target.  Resolution of the URI is according to
					the definitions for the URI Scheme the URI consists of.
				</t>
        <t>
          The URI is encoded as one or more &lt;character-string&gt; <xref
          target="RFC1035">RFC1035 section 3.3</xref>.
        </t>
			</section>
		  <section title="URI RDATA Wire Format">
		    <t>
		      The RDATA for a URI RR consists of a 2 octet Priority field,
		      a two octet Weight field, and a variable length target field.

		<section title="Definition of the flag 'D' for NAPTR records">
		  <t>
		    This document specifies the flag "D" for use as a flag in NAPTR
        records. The flag indicate a terminal NAPTR record because it denotes
        the end of the DDDS/NAPTR processing rules. In the case of a "D" flag,
        the Replacement field in the NAPTR record, prepended with the service
        flags, is used as the Owner of a DNS query for URI records, and normal
        URI processing as defined in this document is applied.
		  </t>
			<t>
			  The replacement field MUST NOT include any of the service parameters.
        Those are to be prepended (together with underscore) as described in
        other places in this document.
			</t>
			<t>
			  The Regexp field in the NAPTR record MUST be empty when the 'D' flag
        is in use.

			<section title="Homepage at one domain, but two domains in use">
				<t>
					An organisation have the domain names example.com and example.net,
          but the official URI http://www.example.com/. Given the service type
          "web" and subtype "http" (from the IANA registry), the following
          URI Resource Records could be made available in the respective
          zones (example.com and example.net):

		<section title="Relation to U-NAPTR">
			<t>
				The URI Resource Record Type is not a replacement for the U-NAPTR. It
        is instead an extension and more powerful second step in the
        resolution than the SRV record. As such, it could be referred to as
        the target in a terminal rule in any of the NAPTR specifications.
			</t>
			<t>
			  If one know exactly what service type one is looking for one can do a
        direct lookup of the URI record without first looking up the NAPTR. In
        the example below, if one where looking for EM:protA service in the
        example.com domain, one could look for the URI Resource Record Type
        with the owner _protA._EM.example.com directly.

			</t>
			<t>
				For example, if the URI in the resource record type has errors in it, applications
				using the URI resource record type for resolution should behave similarly as if the
				user typed (or copy and pasted) the URI. At least it must be clear to the user that
				the error is not due to any error from his side.

		<section title="Acknowledgements">
			<t>
			  Ideas on how to split the two different kind of queries "What services
        exists for this domain name" and "What is the URI for this service"
        came from Scott Bradner and Lawrence Conroy. Other people that have
        contributed to this document include Leslie Daigle, Olafur Gudmundsson,
        Ted Hardie, Peter Koch and Penn Pfautz.
