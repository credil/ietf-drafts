    <section title="Introduction and Terminology">

      <t>This document lists some clarifications and corrections to
      DNSSECbis, as described in <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref
      target="RFC4034"/>, and <xref target="RFC4035"/>.</t>

      <t>It is intended to serve as a resource for implementors and as
      a repository of items that need to be addressed when advancing
      the DNSSECbis documents from Proposed Standard to Draft
      Standard.</t>

      <section title="Structure of this Document">

        <t>The clarifications to DNSSECbis are sorted according to
        their importance, starting with ones which could, if ignored,
        lead to security and stability problems and progressing down
        to clarifications that are expected to have little operational
        impact.</t>

      <t>This section provides </t>

      <section title="NSEC3 Support" anchor="nsec3">
        
	<t><xref target="RFC5155"/> describes the use and behavior of
        the NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM records for hashed denial of
        existence.  Validator implementations are strongly encouraged
        to include support for NSEC3 as a number of highly visible
        zones are expected to use it.  Validators that do not
        support validation of responses using NSEC3 will likely be
        hampered in validating large portions of the DNS space.</t>

	<t><xref target="RFC5155"/> should be considered part of the
	DNS Security Document Family as described by <xref
	target="RFC4033"/>, Section 10.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="SHA-256 Support" anchor="sha256">

	<t><xref target="RFC4509"/> describes the use of SHA-256 as a
	digest algorithm for use with Delegation Signer (DS) RRs.
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsext-dnssec-rsasha256"/> describes
	the use of the RSASHA256 algorthim for use in DNSKEY and RRSIG
	RRs.  Validator implementations are strongly encouraged to
	include support for this algorithm for DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG
	records.</t>

	<t>Both <xref target="RFC4509"/> and <xref

	considered part of the DNS Security Document Family as
	described by <xref target="RFC4033"/>, Section 10.</t>

    <section title="Significant Concerns" anchor="major">

      <t>This section provides clarifications that, if overlooked,
      could lead to security issues or major interoperability
      problems.</t>

      <section title="Clarifications on Non-Existence Proofs"
	       anchor="nsec-bug">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.4 underspecifies the
	algorithm for checking non-existence proofs.  In particular,
	the algorithm as presented would incorrectly allow an NSEC or
	NSEC3 RR from an ancestor zone to prove the non-existence of
	other RRs at that name in the child zone or other names in the
	child zone.</t>
	      
	<t>An "ancestor delegation" NSEC RR (or NSEC3 RR) is one
	with:</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>the NS bit set,</t>
	    <t>the SOA bit clear, and</t>
	    <t>a signer field that is shorter than the owner name of
	    the NSEC RR, or the original owner name for the NSEC3
	    RR.</t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>Ancestor delegation NSEC or NSEC3 RRs MUST NOT be used to
	assume non-existence of any RRs below that zone cut, which
	include all RRs at that (original) owner name other than DS
	RRs, and all RRs below that owner name regardless of type.</t>

	<t>Similarly, the algorithm would also allow an NSEC RR at the
	same owner name as a DNAME RR, or an NSEC3 RR at the same
	original owner name as a DNAME, to prove the non-existence of
	names beneath that DNAME.  An NSEC or NSEC3 RR with the DNAME
	bit set MUST NOT be used to assume the non-existence of any
	subdomain of that NSEC/NSEC3 RR's (original) owner name.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Validating Responses to an ANY Query"
	       anchor="any-queries">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> does not address how to validate
	responses when QTYPE=*.  As described in Section 6.2.2 of
	<xref target="RFC1034"/>, a proper response to QTYPE=* may
	include a subset of the RRsets at a given name -- it is not
	necessary to include all RRsets at the QNAME in the
	response.</t>

        <t>When validating a response to QTYPE=*, validate all
        received RRsets that match QNAME and QCLASS.  If any of those
        RRsets fail validation, treat the answer as Bogus.  If there
        are no RRsets matching QNAME and QCLASS, validate that fact
        using the rules in <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.4 (as
        clarified in this document).  To be clear, a validator must
        not expect to receive all records at the QNAME in response to
        QTYPE=*.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Check for CNAME" anchor="check-cname">

	<t>Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> says little about
	validating responses based on (or that should be based on)
	CNAMEs.  When validating a NOERROR/NODATA response, validators
	MUST check the CNAME bit in the matching NSEC or NSEC3 RR's
	type bitmap.  If the CNAME bit is set, the validator MUST
	validate the CNAME RR and follow it, as appropriate.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Insecure Delegation Proofs">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.2 specifies that a
	validator, when proving a delegation is not secure, needs to
	check for the absence of the DS and SOA bits in the NSEC (or
	NSEC3) type bitmap.  The validator also needs to check for the
	presence of the NS bit in the NSEC (or NSEC3) RR (proving that
	there is, indeed, a delegation).  If this is not checked,
	spoofed unsigned delegations might be used to claim that an
	existing signed record is not signed.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Errors in Canonical Form Type Code List">

	<t>When canonicalizing DNS names, DNS names in the RDATA
	section of NSEC and RRSIG resource records are not
	downcased.</t>

	<t><xref target="RFC4034"/> Section 6.2 item 3 has a list of
	resource record types for which DNS names in the RDATA are
	downcased for purposes of DNSSEC canonical form (for both
	ordering and signing).  That list erroneously contains NSEC
	and RRSIG.  According to <xref target="RFC3755"/>, DNS names
	in the RDATA of NSEC and RRSIG should not be downcased.</t>

	<t>The same section also erroneously lists HINFO, and twice at
	that.  Since HINFO records contain no domain names, they are
	not subject to downcasing.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Interoperability Concerns" anchor="interop">

      <section title="Unknown DS Message Digest Algorithms" anchor="hash">

	<t>Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> includes rules for
	how to handle delegations to zones that are signed with
	entirely unsupported algorithms, as indicated by the
	algorithms shown in those zone's DS RRsets.  It does not
	explicitly address how to handle DS records that use
	unsupported message digest algorithms.  In brief, DS records
	using unknown or unsupported message digest algorithms MUST be
	treated the same way as DS records referring to DNSKEY RRs of
	unknown or unsupported algorithms.</t>

        <t>The existing text says:</t>

	<t>
	  <list>
	    <t>If the validator does not support any of the algorithms
	    listed in an authenticated DS RRset, then the resolver has
	    no supported authentication path leading from the parent
	    to the child.  The resolver should treat this case as it
	    would the case of an authenticated NSEC RRset proving that
	    no DS RRset exists, as described above.</t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>To paraphrase the above, when determining the security
	status of a zone, a validator discards (for this purpose only)
	any DS records listing unknown or unsupported algorithms.  If
	none are left, the zone is treated as if it were unsigned.</t>

        <t>Modified to consider DS message digest algorithms, a
        validator also discards any DS records using unknown or
        unsupported message digest algorithms.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Private Algorithms" anchor="private">

	<t>As discussed above, section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC4035"/>
        requires that validators make decisions about the security
        status of zones based on the public key algorithms shown in
        the DS records for those zones.  In the case of private
        algorithms, as described in <xref target="RFC4034"/> Appendix
        A.1.1, the eight-bit algorithm field in the DS RR is not
        conclusive about what algorithm(s) is actually in use.</t>

        <t>If no private algorithms appear in the DS set or if any
        supported algorithm appears in the DS set, no special
        processing will be needed.  In the remaining cases, the
        security status of the zone depends on whether or not the
        resolver supports any of the private algorithms in use
        (provided that these DS records use supported hash functions,
        as discussed in <xref target="hash"/>).  In these cases, the
        resolver MUST retrieve the corresponding DNSKEY for each
        private algorithm DS record and examine the public key field
        to determine the algorithm in use.  The security-aware
        resolver MUST ensure that the hash of the DNSKEY RR's owner
        name and RDATA matches the digest in the DS RR.  If they do
        not match, and no other DS establishes that the zone is
        secure, the referral should be considered BAD data, as
        discussed in <xref target="RFC4035"/>.</t>

        <t>This clarification facilitates the broader use of private
        algorithms, as suggested by <xref target="RFC4955"/>.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Caution About Local Policy and Multiple RRSIGs"
	       anchor="multi-rrsigs">

        <t>When multiple RRSIGs cover a given RRset, <xref
	target="RFC4035"/> Section 5.3.3 suggests that "the local
        resolver security policy determines whether the resolver also
	has to test these RRSIG RRs and how to resolve conflicts if
	these RRSIG RRs lead to differing results."  In most cases, a
	resolver would be well advised to accept any valid RRSIG as
	sufficient.  If the first RRSIG tested fails validation, a
	resolver would be well advised to try others, giving a
	successful validation result if any can be validated and
	giving a failure only if all RRSIGs fail validation.</t>

        <t>If a resolver adopts a more restrictive policy, there's a
        danger that properly-signed data might unnecessarily fail
        validation, perhaps because of cache timing issues.
        Furthermore, certain zone management techniques, like the
        Double Signature Zone-signing Key Rollover method described in
        section 4.2.1.2 of <xref target="RFC4641"/> might not work
        reliably.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Key Tag Calculation" anchor="key-tags">

        <t><xref target="RFC4034"/> Appendix B.1 incorrectly defines
        the Key Tag field calculation for algorithm 1.  It correctly
        says that the Key Tag is the most significant 16 of the least
        significant 24 bits of the public key modulus.  However, <xref
        target="RFC4034"/> then goes on to incorrectly say that this
        is 4th to last and 3rd to last octets of the public key
        modulus.  It is, in fact, the 3rd to last and 2nd to last
        octets.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Setting the DO Bit on Replies" anchor="clear-do-bit">

	<t><xref target="RFC4035"/> does not provide any instructions
	to servers as to how to set the DO bit.  Some authoritative
	server implementations have chosen to copy the DO bit settings
	from the incoming query to the outgoing response.  Others have
	chosen to never set the DO bit in responses.  Either behavior
	is permitted.  To be clear, in replies to queries with the
	DO-bit set servers may or may not set the DO bit.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Setting the AD bit on Replies" anchor="ad-bit">
    
        <t>Section 3.2.3 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> describes under
        which conditions a validating resolver should set or clear the
        AD bit in a response.  In order to protect legacy stub
        resolvers and middleboxes, validating resolvers SHOULD only
        set the AD bit when a response both meets the conditions
        listed in RFC 4035, section 3.2.3, and the request contained
        either a set DO bit or a set AD bit.</t>

        <t>Note that the use of the AD bit in the query was previously
        undefined.  This document defines it as a signal indicating
        that the requester understands and is interested in the value
        of the AD bit in the response.  This allows a requestor to
        indicate that it understands the AD bit without also
        requesting DNSSEC data via the DO bit.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Setting the CD bit on Requests" anchor="cd-bit">

        <t>When processing a request with the CD bit set, the resolver
        MUST set the CD bit on its upstream queries.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Nested Trust Anchors" anchor="nested-anchors">

	<t>A DNSSEC validator may be configured such that, for a given
	response, more than one trust anchor could be used to validate
	the chain of trust to the response zone.  For example, imagine
	a validor configured with trust anchors for "example." and
	"zone.example."  When the validator is asked to validate a
	response to "www.sub.zone.example.", either trust anchor could
	apply.</t>

	<t>When presented with this situation, DNSSEC validators
	SHOULD try all applicable trust anchors until one
	succeeds.</t>

        <t>There are some scenarios where different behaviors, such as
        choosing the trust anchor closest to the QNAME of the
        response, may be desired. A DNSSEC validator MAY enable such
        behaviors as configurable overrides.</t>
	
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Minor Corrections and Clarifications" anchor="minor">

      <section title="Finding Zone Cuts" anchor="grandparent">

	<t>Appendix C.8 of <xref target="RFC4035"/> discusses sending
	DS queries to the servers for a parent zone.  To do that, a
	resolver may first need to apply special rules to discover
	what those servers are.</t>

	<t>As explained in Section 3.1.4.1 of <xref
	target="RFC4035"/>, security-aware name servers need to apply
	special processing rules to handle the DS RR, and in some
	situations the resolver may also need to apply special rules
	to locate the name servers for the parent zone if the resolver
	does not already have the parent's NS RRset.  Section 4.2 of
	<xref target="RFC4035"/> specifies a mechanism for doing
	that.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Clarifications on DNSKEY Usage" anchor="keys">

	<t>Questions of the form "can I use a different DNSKEY for
	signing this RRset" have occasionally arisen.</t>

	<t>The short answer is "yes, absolutely".  You can even use a
	different DNSKEY for each RRset in a zone, subject only to
	practical limits on the size of the DNSKEY RRset.  However, be
	aware that there is no way to tell resolvers what a
	particularly DNSKEY is supposed to be used for -- any DNSKEY
	in the zone's signed DNSKEY RRset may be used to authenticate
	any RRset in the zone.  For example, if a weaker or less
	trusted DNSKEY is being used to authenticate NSEC RRsets or
	all dynamically updated records, that same DNSKEY can also be
	used to sign any other RRsets from the zone.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, note that the SEP bit setting has no effect on
        how a DNSKEY may be used -- the validation process is
        specifically prohibited from using that bit by <xref
        target="RFC4034"/> section 2.1.2.  It is possible to use a
        DNSKEY without the SEP bit set as the sole secure entry point
        to the zone, yet use a DNSKEY with the SEP bit set to sign all
        RRsets in the zone (other than the DNSKEY RRset).  It's also
        possible to use a single DNSKEY, with or without the SEP bit
        set, to sign the entire zone, including the DNSKEY RRset
        itself.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Errors in Examples" anchor="examples-nits">

        <t>The text in <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section C.1 refers to
        the examples in B.1 as "x.w.example.com" while B.1 uses
        "x.w.example".  This is painfully obvious in the second
        paragraph where it states that the RRSIG labels field value of
        3 indicates that the answer was not the result of wildcard
        expansion.  This is true for "x.w.example" but not for
        "x.w.example.com", which of course has a label count of 4
        (antithetically, a label count of 3 would imply the answer was
        the result of a wildcard expansion).</t>

        <t>The first paragraph of <xref target="RFC4035"/> Section C.6
        also has a minor error: the reference to "a.z.w.w.example"
        should instead be "a.z.w.example", as in the previous
        line.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Errors in RFC 5155" anchor="nsec3-nits">
        
        <t>A NSEC3 record, that matches an Empty Non-Terminal,
        effectively has no type associated with it. This NSEC3 record
        has an empty type bit map.  Section 3.2.1 of <xref
        target="RFC5155"/> contains the statement:</t>
        
        <t>
          <list>
            <t>Blocks with no types present MUST NOT be included.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>However, the same section contains a regular expression:</t>

        <t>
          <list>
            <t>Type Bit Maps Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length |
            Bitmap )+</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>The plus sign in the regular expression indicates that
        there is one or more of the preceding element. This means that
        there must be at least one window block. If this window block
        has no types, it contradicts with the first
        statement. Therefore, the correct text in RFC 5155 3.2.1
        should be:</t>

        <t>
          <list>
            <t>Type Bit Maps Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length |
            Bitmap )*</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">

      <t>This document does not make fundamental changes to the DNSSEC
      protocol, as it was generally understood when DNSSECbis was
      published.  It does, however, address some ambiguities and
      omissions in those documents that, if not recognized and
      addressed in implementations, could lead to security failures.
      In particular, the validation algorithm clarifications in <xref
      target="major"/> are critical for preserving the security
      properties DNSSEC offers.  Furthermore, failure to address some
      of the interoperability concerns in <xref target="interop"/>
      could limit the ability to later change or expand DNSSEC,
      including by adding new algorithms.</t>
