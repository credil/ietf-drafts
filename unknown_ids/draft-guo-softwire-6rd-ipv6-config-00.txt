 Internet-Draft  IPv6 Host Configuration in 6rd Deployment    March 2010 
  
 Abstract 

    This document proposes two new DHCPv4 options which allow IPv6 hosts 
    to obtain configuration information (e.g., DNS servers). The DHCPv6 
    Server Option in DHCPv4 provides the IPv6 address of DHCPv6 server 
    to the 6rd CPE. In result the 6rd CPE can relay DHCPv6 requests to 
    DHCPv6 servers. As an alternative, the IPv6 DNS Server Option is used 
    in the scenario where hosts only need the information of IPv6 DNS 
    servers.

 Internet-Draft  IPv6 Host Configuration in 6rd Deployment    March 2010 
  
     
 1. Terminologies 

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

 2. Introduction 

    IPv6 rapid deployment on IPv4 infrastructures (6rd)[RFC5569] enables 
    a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast service to 
    customer sites via its IPv4 network. [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] 
    provides a method for automatic IPv6 prefix delegation to sites. 

    However, there is no document which describes how the IPv6 hosts in 
    6rd obtain IPv6 configuration information automatically. In a 
    typical 6rd scenario, a dual-stack host can obtain configuration 
    information via DHCPv4. In such case, the IPv4 DNS server MUST 
    support AAAA Resource Record (RR) query. 

    For an IPv6-only host within a customer site, it would have to learn 
    IPv6 configuration information through some automatic methods, e.g., 
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)[RFC3315]. As 
    described in [RFC3315], "...The client MUST use a link-local address 
    assigned to the interface for which it is requesting configuration 
    information as the source address in the header of the IP datagram." 
    Since the link-local address can not travel through the 6rd domain, 
    the CPE MUST act as a DHCPv6 relay agent (or a DHCPv6 server). 

    Since 6rd CPEs derive the 6rd prefix from an extended DHCPv4 option, 
    the DHCPv6 server addresses can be learnt in a similar way (i.e., 
    via a new DHCPv4 option). As a result, IPv6 hosts can either get 
    configuration information from the CPE (acting as a DHCPv6 server) 
    directly or from a DHCPv6 server via the CPE (acting as a DHCP relay 
    agent). Details about this new DHCPv4 option and the related 
    procedure are described in Section 3. 

    In case that the default DNS server is the only configuration 
    information which the IPv6 hosts need, a to-be-defined IPv6 DNS 
    Server Option in DHCPv4 could be used as an alternative to the above 
    DHCPv4 option for DHCPv6 server. CPEs can learn the IPv6 DNS Server 
    address(es) through this new DHCPv4 option. The hosts in turn learn 
    the DNS server address information through the Router Advertisement 
    mechanism [RFC5006] or the stateless DHCPv6 mechanism (here the CPE 
    acts as a DHCP server). This new DHCPv4 option is described in 
    Section 4.

    Note that the methods described in this document can also be used in 
    other IPv6 migration scenarios, such as ISATAP [RFC5214].

    The DHCPv6 server is deployed in IPv6 network, DHCPv6 messages MUST 
    pass through IPv4 network with 6rd encapsulation. IPv6 hosts behind 
    the 6rd CPE SHOULD follow procedures depicted in Figure 2 when they 
    use DHCPv6 to obtain configuration information: 

        (1) The 6rd CPE acting as a DHCPv6 relay agent configures the 
       DHCPv6 servers according to the obtained DHCPv6 Server Option 
       from DHCPv4 server. 

       Note that the CPE SHOULD have a 6rd address in order to behave as 
       a relay agent. 

        (2) When receiving a DHCPv6 Information-request packet from an
       IPv6 host, the 6rd CPE SHOULD relay the message according to Relay 
       Agent Behavior defined in [RFC3315].

        (3) The DHCPv6 Relay-forward message passes 6rd domain and is sent 
       to DHCPv6 server. 

        (4) 6rd CPE receives the DHCPv6 Relay-reply message encapsulated 
       in a 6rd tunnel.  

        (5) 6rd CPE relays the DHCPv6 reply message to IPv6 host.
