Internet-Draft          Extension for Rapid Synch           January 2009


1.  Introduction

   Both "Extensions to RTCP Feedback Mechanism for Burst Streaming"
   [I-D.levin-avt-rtcp-burst] and "Unicast-Based Rapid Synchronization
   with RTP Multicast Sessions"
   [I-D.versteeg-avt-rapid-synchronization-for-rtp] introduce some
   reasons, such as the key information to appear in the stream, for a
   synchronization delay while joining a multicast group to receive
   video multicast streaming in a random point in time.  These reasons
   are main factors affecting the experience of multicast session
   synchronization.

   It is clear that the IETF needs to define a method to solve these
   reasons and improve multicast session synchronization which can be
   used to extend the existing RTP and RTCP mechanisms.  This document
   proposes extensions for rapid synchronization multicast session based
   on RTP control protocol(RTCP) to improve the experience of multicast
   session and reduce synchronization time when a receiver wishes to
   join another multicast session.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Rapid Synchronization Mechanism Description

   The real-time transport protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] provides video
   delivery services with real-time characteristics, such as video
   broadcasts in which receivers can frequently switch among different
   multicast sessions.  In order to achieve rapid synchronization and
   reduce the synchronization delay between multicast sessions, a cached
   Retransmission Server (RS) is employed to send an accelerated unicast
   streaming to the requesting Receiver and temporarily replace the
   multicast session.

   The set of new extended RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Messages
   defined in this document is designed to support rapid synchronization
   mechanism as described below:

   1) Receiver sends a rapid synchronization request for the new
   channel.  This request is sent in an extended RTCP Transport Layer
   Feedback Message "RTCP Rapid Synchronization Request (RSR)", which is
   defined in the Section 4.1.  The extended RTCP message contains the
   SSRC of the packet sender and the SSRC of media source.  The receiver
   indicates that it needs to receive media streaming with the key

   information "as soon as possible" using the default Bitrate on the
   first RSR request by sending the new extended RTCP RSR Message to the
   Retransmission Server.  Later, an adaptive Bitrate will be used for
   the following RTCP RSR Message requests.  The Adaptive Bitrate will
   be adjusted based on receiver's feedback of network transportation
   situation.
   Note that since no RTP packets have been received yet for this
   session, the SSRC must be obtained out-of-band or in-band.

   2) Retransmission Server receives the RTCP RSR Message, and decides
   whether to accept it or not.  The Retransmission Server sends a new
   extended RTCP Message "RTCP Rapid Synchronization Indication" (RSI)
   to the Receiver.  This new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message
   "RTCP Rapid Synchronization Indication" (RSI) is defined in
   Section 4.2.  The RTCP RSI Message contains the result of Rapid
   Synchronization Request, First sequence number of the unicast stream
   and the expected minimum interval of the extend RTCP Transport Layer
   Feedback Message "RTCP Synchronization Rate Adaptation (SRA)".

   3) If Retransmission Server grants the rapid synchronization request,
   it transmits the unicast media stream to Receiver at an accelerated
   rate.

   4) Since it receives the unicast burst media stream, Receiver can
   test for a maximum optimal network speed for the burst media stream
   transfer.  The method for testing the maximum optimal network speed
   is based on the receiving packets of unicast burst media stream.  If
   there is no packet loss, it indicates that higher bitrate is
   possible.  It indicates that lower bitrate is necessary if packet
   loss is higher.  The Receiver will make its feedback to
   Retransmission Server by sending a new extended RTCP Message "RTCP
   Synchronization Rate Adaptation (SRA)" according to the result of the
   maximum optimal network speed test, and give a Proposed Adaptive
   Bitrate.  This new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message "RTCP
   Synchronization Rate Adaptation (SRA)" is defined in Section 4.3.

   5) Receiving the RTCP SRA Message, the Retransmission Server adjusts
   its current transmitting bitrate to the maximum optimal bitrate
   according to the RTCP SRA Message proposal of the Receiver and the
   current condition of Retransmission Server.

   6) Once unicast burst media stream is synchronized with multicast
   media stream(that is to say, the unicast burst media catches up with
   Real-time multicast media stream, Retransmission Server first
   decreases its transmitting bitrate to a a lower rate, and then sends
   the RTCP Message "RTCP Synchronization Completed Notification (SCN)"
   to the Receiver to join the multicast session and terminate the
   unicast burst media stream.  This new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback

Internet-Draft          Extension for Rapid Synch           January 2009


   Message "RTCP Synchronization Completed Notification (SCN)" is
   defined in Section 4.4.

   7) After the Receiver receives the RTCP SCN Message, it immediately
   sends multicast session join message to start receiving real-time
   multicast media stream.

   8) When the Receiver receives the multicast RTP flow, it sends the
   RTCP Message "RTCP Synchronization Completed Response (SCR)" to the
   Retransmission Server to ask to terminate the unicast burst media
   stream.  This new RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Message "RTCP
   Synchronization Completed Response (SCR)" is defined in Section 4.5.
   The RTCP SCR message contains the first sequence number of the
   multicast RTP flow.

   9) When the Retransmission Server receives the first sequence number
   of the multicast RTP flow, it will transmit the unicast media stream
   until the first sequence number.

   10) When the Receiver requests to switch to a second channel, the
   rapid synchronization request message - the RTCP Transport Layer
   Feedback Message "RTCP Rapid Synchronization Request (RSR)" shall use
   the previous optimal bitrate for optimal rapid Synchronization of
   multicast session.


3.  Rapid Synchronization Mechanism Flow

   The flow diagram for rapid synchronization mechanism is illustrated
   in Figure 1.  This mechanism can be implemented using the extensions
   of RTCP Transport Layer Feedback Messages defined in this document.
   In this rapid synchronization mechanism, it can be supported by
   sending video streaming based on unicast with key information from
   Retransmission Server to Receiver.  In the meantime, Retransmission
   Server will adjust to the optimal maximum sending bitrate in terms of
   network situation based on Receiver's feedback.

   Receiver during rapid synchronization.

4.1.  RTCP Rapid Synchronization Request (RSR)

   The RTCP RSR Request message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=5.

   The RTCP RSR Request is mandatory.

   The RTCP RSR Request is used by Receiver to request rapid
   synchronization for a new multicast RTP session.

   The RTCP RSR field has the structure depicted in Figure 2.

   The Default Bitrate/Adaptive Bitrate field is four octets.  The
   Default Bitrate indicated by Receiver at the first time to request
   rapid synchronization, it depends on the Receiver's configuration.
   Adaptive Bitrate: Adaptive Bitrate is used when the Receiver requests
   a second rapid synchronization.  It is the final adaptive bitrate of
   previous rapid synchronization.  The Adaptive Bitrate will be
   adjusted dependence on network transportation situation.  The Default
   Bitrate/Adaptive Bitrate must be higher than multicast bitrate.

   Result

   The Result field is one octet.  The Result value are assigned as
   follows:

       1 for Success

       2 for Failure

   Min SRA Interval Flag (I): 1 bit

   When theMin SRA Interval Flag Bit is set to 1,the Min SRA Interval
   field indicates the interval in number of packets.  Otherwise, when
   theMin SRA Interval Flag Bit is set to 0,the Min SRA Interval field
   indicates the time interval.  Its default value is set to 0.

   Reserved

   The Reserved fields are one octet and are set to zero on
   transmission, and ignored on reception.

   Reason-type

   The Reason-type field is two octets.  The Reason-type field depends
   on the Result field.  This field defines the initial set of
   successful type when the Result field set to 1 (Success).  In the
   meantime, this field also defines the initial set of failure reason
   when the Result field set to 2 (Failure).

   for Success Result:

       1 for joining the multicast session immediately

       2 for waiting for notification to join multicast session

   First Unicast Sequence Number

   The First Unicast Sequence Numberfield is two octets.  The First

   Unicast Sequence Number field indicates the first packet that will be
   sent as part of the rapid synchronization.  This field allows
   Receiver to know if one or more packets are dropped at the beginning
   of rapid synchronization.  The First Unicast Sequence Number field is
   constructed by putting the 16-bit RTP sequence number.

   Min SRA Interval

   The Min SRA Interval field is two octets.  The Min SAR Interva field
   specifies the allowed minimum time/packet number before sending a
   Synchronization Rate Adaptation(SAR).  If theMin SRA Interval Flag
   Bit is set to 0, it is in units of 1/100 second.  Otherwise, the Min
   SRA Interval field indicates the interval in number of packets.  If
   network situation is unstable, Receiver will send the RTCP SAR
   Message at "Min SRA Interval" interval ( or receiving the packet
   number of the "Min SRA Interval").  When transmitting bitrate reach a
   stable state - maximum optimal bitrate, Receiver will send the RTCP
   SAR Message at longer interval and even won't send.

4.3.  RTCP Synchronization Rate Adaptation (SRA)

   The RTCP SAR Request message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=7.

   The RTCP SRA field has the structure depicted in Figure 4.

       2 for NACK

   Lost Packet Flag (L): 1 bit

   Lost Packet Flag Bit is set to 1 if the RTCP Synchronization Rate
   Adaptation message contains the PIDs of lost packets.

   Proposed Bitrate Increment Flag(I): 1 bit

   Proposed Bitrate Increment Flag Bit is set to 1 if the RTCP
   Synchronization Rate Adaptation message proposes to decrease the
   transmitting bitrate.  Proposed Bitrate Increment Flag Bit is set to
   0 if the RTCP Synchronization Rate Adaptation message proposes to
   increase the transmitting bitrate.

   Proposed Bitrate Increment

   The Proposed Bitrate Increment field is 31bits.  The Proposed Bitrate
   Increment field indicates a proposed reference value that the
   retranmission Server increases or decreases the increment of
   transmitting bitrate.  Increasing or decreasing transmitting bitrate
   depends on the Proposed Bitrate Increment Flag field.  If the
   Proposed Bitrate Increment Flag is set to 1, it meas that the
   transmitting bitrate will be decreased, otherwise,it will be
   increase.  If the Proposed Bitrate Increment field is equal to 0, it
   means that the transmitting bitrate is stable and don't need to
   change.

   Fraction lost

   The Fraction lost field is one octet.  The fraction of RTP data
   packets from Retransmission Server lost since the reception of the
   packet with Lowest sequence number received, expressed as a fixed
   point number with the binary point at the left edge of the field.
   (That is equivalent to taking the integer part after multiplying the
   loss fraction by 256.)  This fraction is defined to be the number of
   packets lost divided by the total number of packets expected between
   Lowest sequence number received and Highest sequence number received.
   If the loss is negative due to duplicates, the fraction lost is set
   to zero.

   Reserved

   The Reserved fields are three octets and are set to zero on
   transmission, and ignored by the receiver.

   The Number of packets lost field is two octets.

   Lowest sequence number received

   The Lowest sequence number received field is four octets.  The Lowest
   sequence number received field indicates that the packets were not
   lost before the Lowest sequence number.

   Highest sequence number received

   The Highest sequence number received field is four octets.  The
   Highest sequence number received field indicates that the highest
   sequence number of the packet has currently received.

4.4.  RTCP Synchronization Completed Notification (SCN)

   The RTCP SCN notification indication message is identified by
   PT=RTPFB and FMT=8.

   The RTCP SCN field has the structure depicted in Figure 5.
      0                   1                   2                   3

   Type

   The Type field is one octet.

       1 for joining the multicast group immediately

   When the Type field is set to 1, it indicates that Retransmission
   Server notifies Receiver to join multicast group at once, it also
   means that the unicast stream and the multicast stream are
   synchronized.

   Reserved

   The Reserved fields are three octets and are set to zero on
   transmission, and ignored by the receiver.

   Notification Mode Flag(M): 1 bit

   Notification Mode Flag Bit is set to 1 if the Type field is set to 1.
   Otherwise, it is other type.

   Final Optimal Adaptive Bitrate

   The Final Optimal Adaptive Bitrate field is four octets.  The Final
   Optimal Adaptive Bitrate field indicates the final optimal
   transmission rate from Retransmission Server to Receiver.  Receiver
   can use this rate to request subsequent Rapid Synchronization.

4.5.  RTCP Synchronization Completed Response(SCR)

   The RTCP SCR response message is identified by PT=RTPFB and FMT=9.

   The RTCP SCR field has the structure depicted in Figure 6.

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Type

       1 for the response of joining the multicast group immediately

   When the Type field is set to 1.  It indicates that the Receive
   responses the type of joining the multicast group immediately

   Reserved

   The Reserved fields are three octets and are set to zero on
   transmission, and ignored by the receiver.

   First Multicast Sequence Number

   The First Multicast Sequence Number field is two octets.  The First
   Multicast Sequence Number field indicates the first sequence number
   received from the multicast stream.  When Retransmission Server
   receives the message, it sends unicast stream until First Multicast
   Sequence Number.
