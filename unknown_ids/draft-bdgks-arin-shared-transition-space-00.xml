    <abstract>
      <t>This memo encourages the reservation of a Shared Transition Space, an
      IPv4 prefix designated for local use within service provider networks
      during the period of IPv6 transition. This address space has been
      proposed at various times in the IETF, and more recently by the ARIN
      policy development community.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>As the Internet community approaches exhaustion of unallocated IPv4
      numbers, the value of globally unique addresses is becoming manifest.
      More than ever network operators recognize the need to transition to the
      IPv6 address family. However, the immediate necessity of continued IPv4
      connectivity poses a near-term challenge - without adequate IPv4
      resources, most network operators must deploy more efficient addressing
      architectures and many must deploy address-sharing technologies.</t>

      <t>In order to facilitate these operators' need for near-term IPv4
      connectivity, <xref
      target="I-D.weil-shared-transition-space-request"></xref> proposes the
      reservation of a /10 IPv4 prefix for use in Service Provider (SP)
      networks. Referred to as Shared Transition Space, this address block
      would facilitate SP deployment of non-unique address plans that do not
      conflict with traditional Private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> address
      space. By using the Shared Transition Space operators may deploy CGN
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements"></xref> internal
      networks, extranet <xref target="RFC4364"></xref> communities, and/or
      SP-local services without consuming globally unique addresses.</t>

      <t>However, given the Feb 2011 depletion of the IANA Free Pool inventory
      <xref target="NRO-IANA-exhaust"></xref> it is not currently possible for
      the IANA to reserve an IPv4 /10 prefix as recommended in <xref
      target="I-D.weil-shared-transition-space-request"></xref>. Thus the ARIN
      community has proposed in Draft Policy <xref
      target="ARIN-2011-5"></xref> the reservation of a Shared Transition
      Space from the ARIN inventory of unallocated IPv4 numbers. After much
      discussion by the ARIN community, <xref target="ARIN-2011-5"></xref> was
      recommended by the ARIN Advisory Council for approval by the ARIN Board
      of Trustees.</t>

      <t>Essentially similar to <xref
      target="I-D.weil-shared-transition-space-request"></xref>, Draft Policy
      <xref target="ARIN-2011-5"></xref> is currently pending ARIN Board
      approval. The ARIN Board has asked for IAB clarification with regard to
      responsibilities outlined in <xref target="RFC2860"></xref> and has
      received a response <xref target="IAB-response"></xref> indicating that
      the IETF holds responsibility for the reservation of specialized address
      blocks. Thus, this memo is a discussion of the merits of a Shared
      Transition Space, and is a call for consensus between the IETF and RIR
      communities that such an address reservation should be made.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Background" title="Background">
      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>There are a number of use-cases for the Shared Transition Space.
        This section discusses the primary scenarios envisioned at the time of
        this writing.</t>

        <section title="CGN">
          <t>A primary use-case for the Shared Transition Space will be
          deployment in CGN internal networks, as described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements"></xref>. A key benefit of
          CGN is the ability to share a smaller number of Globally Unique
          Addresses (GUA) amongst a larger number of end-sites.</t>

          <t>In one CGN deployment scenario sometimes referred to as NAT444
          <xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr"></xref>, the CGN
          internal network is numbered with IPv4 addresses that are not
          globally routed while the end-sites are numbered with Private <xref
          target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses. In this scenario the Shared
          Transition Space will be used to provide contextually unique IPv4
          addresses to end-site CPE devices and intermediate
          infrastructure.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Extranet">
          <t>Another use-case for the Shared Transition Space is in building
          private Extranet community networks. In these networks, multiple
          end-sites administered by different organizations are connected
          together via VPN technology. Because different organizations may be
          using Private address space internally, an Extranet addressing plan
          is often unable to effectively use Private address space without
          conflicting. The Shared Transition Space will provide an alternative
          to the use of GUA space in such a scenario.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="SP Services">
          <t>In networks that contain local services (such as nameservers,
          content repositories or caches, etc) the Shared Transition Space
          will offer an alternative to GUA. For instance, video content
          servers that are available only to customers directly connected to
          the SP network might be addressed from the Shared Transition Space,
          preserving GUA for services that require global connectivity.</t>

          <section title="Private Intranet">
            <t>Many service providers have deployed a hierarchical network
            using Private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> space, which has
            served them well for many years. Due in large part to the
            explosive growth of new services they have run out of available
            private space. While it is possible to re-engineer internal
            networks, such activity is customer impacting and operationally
            complex. Making more private space available for service providers
            allows for a manageable transition to IPv6 without significant
            impact to customers.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Alternatives">
        <t>A number of possible alternatives to Shared Transition Space have
        been proposed and/or discussed by the Internet community. See, for
        instance, <xref
        target="I-D.azinger-additional-private-ipv4-space-issues"></xref> for
        a discussion of alternatives and potential issues. This section
        outlines these possible alternatives and briefly discusses their
        applicability.</t>

        <section title="Globally Unique">
          <t>Every discussion of the Shared Transition Space begins with an
          assumption that Globally Unique Addresses (GUA) are a preferable
          choice for numbering. This is almost always technically true.
          However, given the fundamental driver of IPv4 address exhaustion,
          GUA is not a pragmatic alternative to the Shared Transition
          Space.</t>

          <t>Additionally, if various organizations use various GUA ranges to
          number CGN zones, it will be difficult for other networks and/or
          systems to deterministically know if the endpoints are using true
          internet reachable IPs, or if the source network may be using them
          as CGN zone space. This situation would likely lead to additional
          technical issues during various leakage conditions, filter rule
          issues (routing) and for CDN or other third party providers who may
          be present within the source network, to name a few.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Private">
          <t>In each of the use-cases for Shared Transition Space, it may be
          possible to instead use Private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
          address space. In situations where all endpoints in the network are
          managed by a single organization, this may be a viable option.
          However when end-sites are administered by different organizations
          and/or individuals, the possibility of address conflict becomes a
          significant risk to operations.</t>

          <t>A study of DNS traffic <xref target="v6ops-msg06187"></xref> has
          shown that effectively all of the existing Private <xref
          target="RFC1918"></xref> address space is currently being used by
          end-sites attached to the Internet. While individual network
          environments may vary in this regard, most SP operators face the
          risk that their use of Private address space will conflict with
          their customer end-sites.</t>

          <t>In the event of conflict, it is possible that the end-site CPE
          will fail and/or not function correctly. Some CPE implementations
          are known to support overlapping addresses on the "inside" and
          "outside" interfaces, however many others are known to fail under
          such circumstances. For SP operators, the Shared Transition Space
          offers a less risky alternative to GUA that retains the benefit of
          non-conflict.</t>

          <t>Also, the use of Private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> address
          space on interfaces and hosts often causes default behaviours on
          such hosts which may not be desirable when the endpoint is actually
          connected to the Internet. There are often behavioural expectations
          for Internet connected endpoints, regardless of them being subject
          to a NAT.</t>

          <t>Incorrect affiliation of the WAN side interface being in a
          "protected" zone and/or on a trusted network may not be desirable.
          With NAT444 deployments, it is important that the endpoint (i.e.
          CPE) behave like any other internet node. One example of this from
          our testing was observed behaviours where some CPEs did not filter
          and/or firewall correctly when Private <xref
          target="RFC1918"></xref> address space was used on both WAN and LAN
          interfaces.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Class E">
          <t>One proposed alternative to Shared Transition Space is the
          re-classification and use of the 240.0.0.0/4 "Class E" address space
          as unicast. This has been proposed, for instance, by <xref
          target="I-D.fuller-240space"></xref> and <xref
          target="I-D.wilson-class-e"></xref>. While this alternative might be
          possible in tightly constrained environments, where all of the
          network elements are known to support Class E address space, it is
          not generally useful in the use-cases described above. At this time,
          a significant number of IPv4 stack implementations treat the Class E
          address space as reserved and will not route, forward, and/or
          originate traffic for that range.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Prefix Squatting">
          <t>An unfortunate alternative to the Shared Transition Space is
          "prefix squatting", in which the operator re-uses another
          organization's IPv4 allocation for their own numbering needs. When
          this approach results in the other organization's prefix being
          announced globally by the "squatting" operator, it is often referred
          to as "prefix hijacking". However, this discussion is focused on
          scenarios in which the prefix is not announced globally but is,
          rather, used for internal numbering only.</t>

          <t>In this scenario, the allocation may not be routed globally by
          the legitimate address holder, making it attractive for such
          purposes. Or it may be routed but "uninteresting" to the SP
          network's endpoints. In either case there is a potential for
          conflict in the event that any end-site actually wishes to
          communicate with the legitimate address holder. As such, this
          alternative is to be discouraged with prejudice.</t>

          <t>It is important to note that there are no behavioural advantages
          to using "squat space" over using assigned "shared space". Both
          options subject the CPE to the same general behaviours (GUA space,
          but not globally reachable). The only real difference is the
          negative impacts of squatting (as noted above) and the advantages of
          a community coordinated and standardized prefix.</t>

          <t>The primary reason that any network would be likely to adopt
          "prefix squatting" is if they are faced with the operational
          realities of CGN before/without the allocation of a shared
          transition space.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Regional Re-use of Allocated Prefix">
          <t>Similar to "Prefix Squatting" but significantly less dangerous,
          this alternative involves the reuse by an operator of their own
          address allocations. In this scenario, a network operator might use
          the same prefix for multiple "regions" and/or extranet communities.
          For instance, in CGN deployments the operator might reuse the same
          GUA prefix across multiple geographic regions (e.g. without
          announcing it globally).</t>

          <t>Here again, it is important to note that there are no behavioural
          advantages gained over a "shared space" but there is the added
          community cost of each network having to dedicate a unique block of
          addresses to this purpose, consuming far more resources than a
          single block of "shared space".</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Consortium">
          <t>In the event that the Internet community doesn't set aside an
          IPv4 prefix for Shared Transition Space, it is possible that a
          number of SP operators can come together and designate an address
          block to be "shared" amongst them for an identical purpose. This
          would have the same technical merits as an IETF and/or RIR sponsored
          Shared Transition Space, however it would lack the efficiency of a
          community coordinated and standardized prefix for such purposes,
          gain no behavioural advantages, remove the deterministic nature of
          managing a single range and also subjects the Internet (users of the
          space) to additional risk since any member of the consortium who has
          contributed space could later pull out and potentially cause
          disruptions in multiple networks.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Analysis" title="Analysis of Benefits">
      <section title="Continued Operation Post-exhaustion">
        <t>Availability of a Shared Transition Space helps SPs continue to
        meet the demands of IPv4 address and/or connectivity post exhaustion.
        For environments where CGN in a NAT444 scenario is necessary,
        addresses from this space can be used to provide intermediary network
        addressing assisting in provided IPv4 flow continuity for new or
        migrating customers.</t>

        <t>In other circumstances, the shared transition space allows SPs to
        number devices in the network which do not require globally
        reachablity without the need for fulfillment thorough an RIR.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Delayed Need for CGN Deployment">
        <t>If operators are required to us their individually allocated GUA
        where "shared space" would have applied, they will face exhaustion
        sooner and thus be forced to deploy CGN sooner as well. Operators can
        postpone this deployment of CGN by using "shared space" for internal
        uses, because that allows more efficient use of their remaining GUA in
        places where global uniqueness is truly mandatory.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Recovery of Existing Addresses">
        <t>The shared transition space can also be used to number and reclaim
        IPv4 addresses within provider networks which do not require global
        reachability. This option can be used by many networks worldwide, it
        provides an option for using currently assigned space much more
        efficiently.</t>

        <section title="Re-deployment Where Needed">
          <t>Operators can re-deploy recovered addresses for customers that
          need them (including new / static / GUA customers), hosted servers,
          etc. or to facilitate other efforts that might provide even more
          efficient use of GUA space within the network. The freed addresses
          can be assigned to endpoints which require IPv4 global reachablity
          and thus help delay and/or remove the need for CGN.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Return or Transfer">
          <t>In cases where the operator doesn't need the recovered addresses,
          they can be made available to others that do need them. This may be
          through voluntary return the RIR, or through transfer to another
          network operator (perhaps via a market mechanism).</t>

          <t>If an SP determines that the space recovered is not needed, the
          space can be returned or transferred through those mechanisms
          already in place with the RIRs. For example, in the ARIN region,
          there are such mechanisms already defined in the ARIN NRPM section
          8.3 <xref target="ARIN-NRPM-8.3"></xref>.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Impact on Allocations / RIR Inventory">
        <t>While making "shared space" available to the community, may or may
        not lessen the demand on the RIRs for allocations, it will help ensure
        that the address resources which remain in inventory are used most
        efficiently, maximizing the use of that inventory for services that
        require global routability.</t>

        <t>BENSON: note that I changed this to "may or may not" because I
        think it's arguable either way... If an SP doesn't need globally
        unique space to continue numbering (with a CGN) then that might slow
        the rate of allocation. On the other hand, unless RIRs police it, the
        SP's interest is aligned with continuing to make requests and "bank"
        them for later, so that wouldn't change the rate of allocation at
        all.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Benefit of Standardization">
        <t>Standardizing on a single block will help the community develop
        standard ways of selecting, routing, filtering and managing shared
        space. This task would be much more difficult or impractical for any
        of the alternative options.</t>

        <t>Standard internal routing policy and filtering can be applied
        uniformly inside network environments. Additionally, exchange points
        between networks can have standard policies applied allowing operators
        to protect each other from CGN zone IPs leaking between networks. This
        may not be possible with squat space since many operators will not
        divulge what space may be used and with Private <xref
        target="RFC1918"></xref> address space where each operator may only be
        able to free up certain portions of the space which are not likely to
        be consistent between networks.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 Deployments">
        <t>Operators will need to grapple with the need to provide IPv4 based
        flow continuity to customers post exhaustion. By removing the burden
        of operators needing to find adequate IPv4 address space to meet the
        needs that a shared transition space can fulfill, they can concentrate
        on the real task at hand: Deploying IPv6.</t>

        <t>Endless cycles can be avoided where operators squat, free up space
        and/or segment networks in an effort to find valid IPv4 space. The
        saved effort, time and cost can be re-directed to provided quality
        IPv6 connectivity therefore expiditing the removal of the overall need
        for IPv4 addresses and connectivity.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Analysis of Detractors' Arguments">
      <section title="It Breaks">
        <section title="NAT is Bad">
          <t>NAT is understood to be less then optimal <xref
          target="RFC6269"></xref>, especially when implemented as CGN <xref
          target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts"></xref>. That said, it is a
          necessary technology for many networks and cannot be completely
          avoided. Since the number of IPv4 internet endpoints will exceed the
          number of IPv4 addresses which are available for Internet
          connectivity, NATs are needed.</t>

          <t>While the authors agree that "NAT is bad", it must also be
          understood that shared transition space does not change the
          fundamental problems with NAT and so those problems will not be
          discussed at length here.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Breaks Bad Host Assumptions">
          <t>The use of GUA space (non-RFC1918) does in some circumstances
          break some functions. The most commonly cited function is 6to4.
          Although 6to4 can break, it's not commonly turned on by default.
          6to4 can also be "repaired" in some instances when used behind a CGN
          (NAT66) or managed by the network operator. Since the volume of
          impacted endpoints will be very low, operators can likely manage the
          disabling of 6to4 when needed.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Potential Misuse as Private Space">
          <t>The value of a Shared Transition Space may be diminished if
          misused by end-sites as generic Private addresses. Thus, the
          reservation must be clearly designated for use by SPs that are
          providing infrastructure as described herein.</t>

          <t>This is not a technical issue. As with any technology, the
          opportunity exists for a misuse. This however should not shroud the
          strong benefits of the shared address space option. Many
          technologies in use today can be used correctly or misused. This
          does not prevent the community from introducing those technologies
          since the good far outweighs the bad.</t>

          <t>As an example, the use of DiffServ <xref target="RFC2475"></xref>
          can result in punitive measures for some hosts in a network while
          favouring others bad on illegitimate rules. This however is not a
          good argument on why not to permit DiffServ.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="It's Not Needed">
        <section title="Nobody Will Use It">
          <t>This argument is simply incorrect. Post IPv4-exaustion, any SP
          that wishes to continue providing IPv4 connectivity will necessarily
          deploy network architectures and technologies that require such an
          address space.</t>

          <t>In absense of a designated Shared Transition Space, operators
          will use GUA space in essentially the same ways described in this
          memo, with or without IETF acknowledgement. The industry needs to
          recognize this and work in the best interests of the "real
          customer".</t>
        </section>

        <section title="ISPs Are Not Actually Growing">
          <t>While customer growth for some ISPs has slowed, for many service
          providers new services are growing at a faster rate than has been
          anticipated. Wireline voice customers for example require two-way
          communication paths to allow them to function properly. IP enabled
          televisions is another example of devices that support video and
          voice services and require IP addresses. In many cases the protocols
          that allow these devices to work have embedded IP addresses that do
          not work with NAT. The only way to maintain these services, which in
          many cases are considered lifeline, is to provide them with an IP
          address that is unique with the service provider network.</t>

          <t>Likewise, growth continues to exist in some geographical regions.
          While some areas have slower growth, as a result of significant
          penetration of Internet access, there are still many areas with
          unmet needs, growing populations, or both.</t>

        <section title="RIR IPv4 Inventory is Not Actually Exhausted">
          <t>With the IANA inventory essentially exhausted <xref
          target="NRO-IANA-exhaust"></xref> it is only a matter of time before
          each of the RIRs are unable to satisfy requests for IPv4 addresses.
          <xref target="GIH-When"></xref> In fact, the APNIC has already
          allocated all but their final /8 of inventory <xref
          target="APNIC-final-slash8"></xref> and is no longer making
          allocations larger than a /22 prefix. Each of the other RIRs is on a
          trajectory toward exhaustion in the near future.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="ISP IPv4 Inventory is Not Actually Exhausted">
          <t>While some SPs have existing inventory that will outlast the RIR
          inventories, this is not universally true. In fact, the distribution
          of IPv4 number resources amongst operators is highly variable (based
          on size, history, etc) and in the worst cases is already becoming
          problematic.</t>

      <section title="Address Inventory">
        <section title="Shared Transition Space Uses Up Address Inventory">
          <t>While true that the Shared Transition Space will consume some
          unallocated inventory, the impact is no greater than would be seen
          if individual SPs continue to request allocations of GUA for the
          scenarios described herein. It is possible, rather, that the Shared
          Transition Space might alleviate some near-term demand on RIR
          inventories. However, even if the RIR inventories are exhausted at
          the current rate, the reservation of a Shared Transition Space will
          enable continued deployment of IPv4 connectivity by SP networks - a
          clear benefit.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="/10 is not Enough">
          <t>There are many ISP networks that may require greater or lesser
          amounts of IPv4 number resources, as a Shared Transition Space.
          While a larger prefix (such as a /8) would allow for expanded
          applicability, to larger ISP networks, it is generally thought that
          a /10 will be adequate for a large number of network deployments.
          Likewise, a /10 seems to be appropriate given the current
          technological constraints and operational considerations of CGN
          deployment. On the other hand, a smaller prefix might not be large
          enough to apply in many modern network deployments. Thus, a /10
          prefix for Shared Transition Space is considered an appropriate
          compromise.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="It Won't Delay RIR Exhaustion">
          <t>It remains to be seen whether the reservation of a Shared
          Transition Space will delay the impending exhaustion of RIRs' IPv4
          inventory. Certainly, the availability of this Shared Transition
          Space will satisfy a number of demands that would otherwise become
          requests for GUA resources. However, whether this translates to an
          actual reduction in requests is up to the RIRs and requesting
          organizations.</t>

      <section title="IPv6 Arguments">
        <section title="Use IPv6 Instead">
          <t>Although IPv6 is the strategic long term answer fro IPv4 address
          exhaustion, it does not immediately solve IPv4 connectivity
          requirements. There is an entire eco-system which exists on the
          Internet which is not IPv6 ready at this time. IPv4 flow continuity
          will be required for a long period of time.</t>

          <t>Many businesses have long procurement and fulfilment cycles which
          will need to be used to upgrade networks to support IPv6. Also, the
          consumer (home) space is years away from being all IPv6 capable.
          Many homes are filled with IPv4 only consumer electronics,
          computers, TVs, accessories and other systems.</t>

          <t>There are still a number of products that are either not IPv6
          compliant, or for which the necessary criteria for being "IPv6
          compliant" is unclear or undefined. Some examples include security
          products (IDS/IPS in particular), a large number of software
          applications (MySQL is one example), and there are still production
          systems (both inside companies and as products) being rolled out
          that are not IPv6 aware (until very recently, this included all
          Linksys routers).</t>

          <t>The whole Internet needs to get to IPv6 more or less at the same
          time in order to avoid significant deployment of transition
          technologies. This proposal may help delay some transition
          technology deployment while IPv6 deployments move ahead. More IPv6
          should mean less transition technology.</t>

      <section title="History">
        <t>The proposal for additional Private space in order to survive IPv6
        transition dates back to <xref target="I-D.hain-1918bis"></xref> in
        April 2004, and more recently as Shared Transition Space <xref
        target="I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr"></xref> in June 2008 where a
        proposal to set aside "ISP Shared Space" has been made. During
        discussion of the more recent proposals many of the salient points
        where commented on including challenges with RFC1918 in the ISP NAT
        Zone, Avoidance of IP Address Conflicts, and challenges with
        240/4.</t>

        <t>This effort was followed up by <xref
        target="I-D.weil-opsawg-provider-address-space"></xref> in July 2010
        which was re-worked in November 2010 as <xref
        target="I-D.weil-shared-transition-space-request"></xref>. The latter
        two efforts continued to point out the operators need for Shared
        Transition Space, with full acknowledgement that challenges may arise
        with NAT444 as per <xref
        target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Most recently, following exhaution of the IANA's /8 pool <xref
        target="NRO-IANA-exhaust"></xref>, this proposal has been discussed by
        various RIR policy participants. As described herein, the body of ARIN
        policy development participants has recommended a Shared Address Space
        policy for adoption <xref target="ARIN-2011-5"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This history has shown that operators and other industry
        contributors have identified the need for a Shared Transition Space
        assignment based on clearly identified reasons. The previous work has
        also described the awareness of the challenges of this space, but
        points to this option as the most manageable and workable solution for
        IPv6 transition space.</t>

      <section title="Policy Text">
        <t>Draft Policy ARIN-2011-5</t>

        <t>Shared Transition Space for IPv4 Address Extension</t>

        <t>Date: 20 January 2011</t>

        <t>Policy statement:</t>

        <t>Updates 4.10 of the NRPM:</t>

        <t>A second contiguous /10 IPv4 block will be reserved to facilitate
        IPv4 address extension. This block will not be allocated or assigned
        to any single organization, but is to be shared by Service Providers
        for internal use for IPv4 address extension deployments until
        connected networks fully support IPv6. Examples of such needs include:
        IPv4 addresses between home gateways and NAT444 translators.</t>

        <t>Rationale:</t>

        <t>The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
        unallocated IPv4 addresses. During the transition period to IPv6, it
        is imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for devices
        and networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to IPv6.
        Consumers must be able to reach the largely IPv4 Internet after
        exhaustion. Without a means to share addresses, people or
        organizations who gain Internet access for the first time, or those
        who switch providers, or move to another area, will be unable to reach
        the IPv4 Internet.</t>

        <t>Further, many CPE router devices used to provide residential or
        small-medium business services have been optimized for IPv4 operation,
        and typically require replacement in order to fully support the
        transition to IPv6 (either natively or via one of many transition
        technologies). In addition, various consumer devices including
        IP-enabled televisions, gaming consoles, medical and family monitoring
        devices, etc. are IPv4-only, and cannot be upgraded. While these will
        eventually be replaced with dual-stack or IPv6 capable devices, this
        transition will take many years. As these are typically consumer-owned
        devices, service providers do not have control over the speed of their
        replacement cycle. However, consumers have an expectation that they
        will continue to receive IPv4 service, and that such devices will
        continue to have IPv4 Internet connectivity after the IPv4 pool is
        exhausted, even if the customer contracts for new service with a new
        provider.</t>

        <t>Until such customers replace their Home Gateways and all IPv4-only
        devices with IPv6-capable devices, Service Providers will be required
        to continue to offer IPv4 services through the use of an IPv4 address
        sharing technology such as NAT444. A recent study showed that there is
        no part of RFC1918 space which would not overlap with some IPv4
        gateways, and therefore to prevent address conflicts, new address
        space is needed.</t>

        <t>Service providers are currently presented with three options for
        obtaining sufficient IPv4 address space for NAT444/IPv4 extension
        deployments: (1) Request allocations under the NRPM; (2) share address
        space with other providers (this proposal); or (3) use address space
        allocated to another entity (i.e. 'squat'). Of the three options,
        option 2 (this proposal) is preferable, as it will minimize the number
        of addresses used for IPv4 extension deployments while preserving the
        authority of IANA and RIRs.</t>
