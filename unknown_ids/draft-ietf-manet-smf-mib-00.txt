Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                    April 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)
   [I-D.ietf-manet-smf].  SMF provides multicast duplicate packet
   detection (DPD) and supports algorithms for constructing an estimate
   of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) Minimum Connected Dominating Set
   (MCDS) for efficient multicast forwarding.  The SMF MIB also reports
   state information, performance metrics, and notifications.  In
   addition to configuration, this additional state and performance
   information is useful to management stations troubleshooting
   multicast forwarding problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   SMF provides methods for implementing DPD-based multicast forwarding
   with the optional use of CDS-based relay sets.  The MCDS is the
   smallest set of MANET nodes (comprising a connected cluster) which
   cover all the nodes in the cluster with their transmissions.  As the
   density of the MANET nodes increase, the fraction of nodes required
   in an MCDS decreases.  Using the MCDS as a multicast forwarding set
   then becomes an efficient multicast mechanism for MANETs.

   Various algorithms for the construction of estimates of the MCDS
   exist.  The Simplified Multicast Framework [I-D.ietf-manet-smf]



Cole, et al.            Expires October 26, 2009                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                    April 2009


   describes some of these.  It further defines various operational
   modes for a node which is participating in the collective creation of
   the MCDS estimates.  These modes depend upon the set of related MANET
   routing and discovery protocols and mechanisms in operation in the
   specific MANET node.

   A SMF routers' MIB contains SMF process configuration parameters
   (e.g. specific CDS algorithm), state information (e.g., current
   membership in the CDS), performance counters (e.g., packet counters),
   and notifications.

4.1.  SMF Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the SMF node process.

   Figure 1 (reproduced from Figure 4 of [I-D.ietf-manet-smf]) shows the
   relationship between the SMF Relay Set selection algorithm and the
   related algorithms, processes and protocols running in the MANET
   nodes.  The Relay Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon
   topology information gotten from the MANET Neighborhood Discovery
   Protocol (NHDP), from the specific MANET routing protocol running on
   the node, or from Layer 2 information passed up to the higher layer
   protocol processes.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the SMF RS process.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the SMF RS process in the router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      CDS multicast process on the router and the overall multicasting
      performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the SMF MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  smfMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the SMF MIB.

   o  smfMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the SMF
      MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the following
      groups:

   o

      *  Capabilities Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         the device uses to advertise its local capabilities with
         respect to, e.g., the supported RSSAs.

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall operation
         of the SMF RSSA and the resulting multicast performance.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the SMF RSSA process such as the Neighbor Table.

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the SMF RSSA process, typically statistics
         counters.

   o  smfMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this SMF MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the SMF MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus textual convention is imported from RFC 2579 [RFC2579].

5.2.  The Capabilities Group

   The SMF device supports a set of capabilities.  The list of
   capabilities which the device can advertise are:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                    April 2009


5.3.  The Configuration Group

   The SMF device is configured with a set of controls.  The list of
   configuration controls for the SMF device follow.

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv4 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv6 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD

   o  NHDP RSSA Message TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the RSSA
      Message TLV included in the NHDP exchanges.  (Question: Is this
      and the following two TLVs optional and are they included as a
      group or independently of one another?)

   o  NHDP RSSA Address Block TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is
      the RSSA Address Block TLV included in the NHDP exchanges.

   o  Router Priority TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the Router
      Priority TLV included in the NHDP exchanges.

5.4.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information.

   o  Node RSS State - is the node currently in or out of the Relay Set.

   o  Neighbors Table - a table containing current neighbors and their
      operational RSSA.

5.5.  The Performance Group

   The Performance subtree reports primarily counters that relate to SMF
   RSSA performance.  The SMF performance counters consists of per node
   and per interface objects: (Note: Need to have a discussion of the
   important and measurable events related to SMF RSSA multicast
   performance.)  (Note: Do we need to break these out by type, i.e., v4
   versus v6?)

   o  Total multicast packets received -

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                    April 2009


   o  Total multicast packets forwarded -

   o  Total duplicate multicast packets detected -

   o  Per interface statistics table with the following entries:

   o

      *  Multicast packets received

      *  Multicast packets forwarded

      *  Duplicate multicast packets detected

5.6.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the SMF-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.
   This group is currently empty.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SMF-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited

   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following SMF-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

            draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-00.txt. A few changes
            were made in the development of this draft.
            Specifically, the following changes were made:
               - Removed the smfGatewayFilterTable from this
                 draft.  It is a useful construct, e.g.,
                 an IPTABLES-MIB, but might best be handled
                 as a seperate MIB and worked within a
                 security focused working group.
               - Removed the smfReportsGroup. This capability
                 is being replaced with a new and more general
                 method for offline reporting.  This is being
                 worked as a new MIB module refered to as the
                 REPORT-MIB.
               - Rev'd as a new MANET WG document.

        DESCRIPTION
           "Updated draft of this MIB module published as
            draft-cole-manet-smf-mib-02.txt. Fairly extensive
            revisions and additions to this MIB were made
            in this version. Specifically, the following
            changes were made in development of this version:
               - added a Capabilities Group within the Objects
                 Group to allow the device to report supported
                 capabilities, e.g., RSSAs supported.
               - added administrative status objects for device
                 and interfaces
               - added multicast address forwarding tables, both
                 for configured (within Configuration Group) and
                 discovered (within the State Group).
               - added additional Performance counters related
                 to DPD functions.
               - Split up the performance counters into IPv4
                 and IPv6, for both global and per interface
                 statistics.
               - Split out the reports capability into a seperate
                 Reports Group under the Objects Group.

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                    April 2009


      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for



Cole, et al.            Expires October 26, 2009               [Page 39]

Internet-Draft                 The SMF MIB                    April 2009


   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Not applicable to draft 00

   1.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the SMF-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.   Clarify handling of the NHDP TLV message inclusions?

   2.   Can we develop a capabilities table for the supported RSSA
        algorithms?  And, if so, can each supported RSSA have a
        different set of configuration parameters?

   3.   Is the Gateway Filter table appropriate for this MIB or should
        it be handled in a separate MIB worked elsewhere?  How should
        this table be indexed and how should it represent the ordering
        of the rules (or chains)?  Should this be greatly simplified?
        How do we handle null values in the rules? --- This has been
        removed from the draft-ietf-smf-mib-00 version of the MIB.  It
        is probably more appropriate for a seperate MIB worked within a
        security focused working group.  It is a good construct however,
        e.g., defining an IPTABLES-MIB.

   4.   Is it useful to track the effectiveness of the coverage of the
        current RSSA?  Is it possible to track this?

   5.   Complete notification group.

   6.   Complete conformance group.

   7.   Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.

   8.   Update the text of the document to reflect the final state of
        the MIB.

   9.   Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   10.  Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.
