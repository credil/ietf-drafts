<section title="Introduction"> 
 
<t>An Embedded Experience Document is a component of the OpenSocial Core Gadget Specification
as defined in section C.15 of <xref target="OpenSocial" />. This Internet Draft
defines and registers the MIME Media Types for the JSON and XML forms of the 
Embedded Experience Document.</t> 
 
</section> 
 
<section title="Notational Conventions"> 
 
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119" /></t> 
  
</section> 
 
<section anchor="xml" title="Embedded Experience XML Documents"> 
 
<t>An Embedded Experience Document, when serialized as XML 1.0, can be 
identified with the following media type:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   MIME media type name:  application
   MIME subtype name:  embed+xml
   Mandatory parameters:  None.
   Optional parameters:
      "charset":  This parameter has semantics identical 
         to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" 
         media type as specified in [RFC3023].
   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of 
      "application/xml" as described in [RFC3023], Section 3.2.
   Security considerations:  As defined in this specification.
      In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" 
      convention, it shares the same security considerations 
      as described in [RFC3023], Section 10.
   Interoperability considerations:  There are no known 
      interoperability issues.
   Published specification:  This specification.
   Applications that use this media type:  No known applications
      currently use this media type.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in [RFC3023],
      Section 3.2.
   File extension:  .embed
   Fragment identifiers:  As specified for "application/xml" in
      [RFC3023], Section 5.
   Base URI:  As specified in [RFC3023], Section 6.
   Macintosh File Type code:  TEXT
