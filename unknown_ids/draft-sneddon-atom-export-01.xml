        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Atom Export Documents">

        <t>An Atom Export Document is an Atom Feed Document <xref
        target="RFC4287"/>.</t>

        <t>atom:entry elements are given purpose within the document by an
        atom:category element whose the scheme attribute is equal to
        "XXX-to-be-decided" and whose term attribute matches one of the below:

            <list style="numbers">

                <t>"post" signifies the entry represents a blog post.
                Furthermore, an atom:category with scheme
                "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" and term
                "http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post" SHOULD be
                treated as equivalent.</t>

                <t>"comment" signifies the entry represents a reply to a post
                which MUST be in the same Atom Export Document and which MUST
                be specified by an thr:in-reply-to element <xref
                target="RFC4685"/> within the entry. Furthermore, an
                atom:category with scheme
                "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" and term
                "http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment" SHOULD be
                treated as equivalent.</t>

            </list>  
        
        </t>

        <t>Such an atom:category element MUST be the first element child of the
        atom:entry. If it is not, implementations MUST NOT incur any meaning
        from it.</t>

        <t>Any atom:entry which does not have such an atom:category element is
        assigned absolutely no meaning by this specification.</t>

    <section title="Further Recommendations">
        
        <t>This section is informative.</t>

        <t>If an implementation wishes to store data beyond what is easily
        representable within Atom for importing/exporting state, it is
        recommended that a namespace is created to contain this extra metadata,
        and it is not coerced in an over-engineered manner into Atom.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, as they can contain extensions from <xref
        target="RFC4685"/>, please see that document too.</t>
