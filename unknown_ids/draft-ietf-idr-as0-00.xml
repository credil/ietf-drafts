    <abstract>
      <t>This document proscribes the use of AS 0 in BGP OPEN and AS_PATH /
      AS4_PATH BGP attribute.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Autonomous System 0 is listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number
      Registry as "Reserved - May be use to identify non-routed networks"
      (<xref target="IANA.AS_Numbers"></xref>).</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects"></xref> specifies that AS
      number zero in a ROA is used to mark an NLRI which is to be marked as
      Invalid.</t>

      <t>No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found in any BGP
      specification.</t>

      <t>As at least two implementations discard routes containing AS 0 (and
      to allow approaches such as the above) this document codifies this
      behavior.</t>

      <section title="Requirements notation">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Behavior">
      <t>This document specifies that a BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or
      propagate a route with an AS number of zero. If a BGP speaker receives a
      route which has an AS number of zero in the AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH)
      attribute, it SHOULD be logged and treated as a WITHDRAW. This same
      behavior applies to routes containing zero as the Aggregator or AS4
      Aggregator.</t>

      <t>In addition if a BGP speaker receives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN
      message, it MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with Error
      Code "OPEN Message Error" and subcode "Bad Peer AS" (see <xref
      target="RFC4271"></xref> Section 6.2). Obviously enough, a router MUST
      NOT initiate a connection claiming to be AS number zero.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The IANA is requested to update the Reference for number 0 in the
      "Autonomous System (AS) Numbers" registry to reference this
      document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>By allowing resource holders to say that AS 0 is the only valid
      origin for a route, we allow them to state that a particular address
      resource is not in use. By ensuring that all implementations that see AS
      0 in a route ignore that route, we prevent a malicious party from
      announcing routes containing AS 0 in an attempt to hijack those
      resources.</t>

      <t>In addition, by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an
      AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH) containing AS 0, this document makes the behavior
      better defined, and security gotchas often lurk in the undefined
      spaces.</t>
