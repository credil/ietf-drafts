1. Introduction

   [RFC 5296] defines the EAP Re-authentication Protocol to allow faster
   re-authentication of a previously authenticated peer. [RFC 4187]
   describes one Fast Re-authentication mechanism to make EAP AKA
   procedure faster and reduce the load of authentication center. These
   mechanisms are both based on the keys derived on the preceding full
   authentication. Thus the local AAA server in the visited domain
   visited by the peer needs not communicate with the home AAA server in
   the home domain.

   A Domain Specific Root Key (DSRK) derived from the EMSK, as defined
   in the [RFC 5295] can be used for bootstrapping security of a set of
   services within a domain. Also as described in [RFC5296], USRK is

   provided by the Home EAP server to the local domain server,
   Furthermore, a re-authentication Root Key may be derived from a
   Domain Specific Root Key (DSRK), for that purpose, this document
   specifies the transport of the DSRK using the Diameter EAP
   Application.



2. Terminologies and Conventions

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3. Diameter Support for Local Key transport

3.1. Protocol Overview

Before the local AAA server request DSRK from the home Diameter Server,
We assume the peer know the domain name of local domain. A local AAA
server, collocated with a Diameter proxy in the domain visited by the
peer, may request a DSRK from the home Diameter server by sending domain
name, in the initial full EAP exchange. This is done by including the
EAP-DSRK-Domain Name AVP in the Diameter EAP Request (DER) message.  The
EAP-DSRK-Domain Name AVP contains the domain or server identity required
to derive the DSRK.

In successful case, the DSRK is carried by the EAP-DSRK AVP in the
Diameter EAP Answer (DEA) message.  Along with the EAP-DSRK AVP, an EAP-
DSRK-Name AVP MUST be used to send the DSRK's keyname and an EAP- DSRK-
Lifetime AVP MUST be used to send the DSRK's lifetime.

Assume the peer has known the domain name associated with local domain
server. As regarding how the domain name is discovered by the peer is
beyond scope of this document. Firstly the peer sends EAP RSP/Identity
message containing domain name or domain Identity to the home Diameter
Sever to trigger USRK request. The EAP-RSP/Identify message is
encapsulated in an EAP-Local-Domain-Name AVP of a Diameter EAP Request
(DER) message by the NAS and sent to the Diameter server. Intermediate
Proxy AAA's may perform routing and forwarding functions.

The Diameter Server process the EAP RSP/Identity message in accordance
with [RFC4072] and responds with EAP Success message with DSRK included.
The Diameter Server must encapsulate the EAP Success in the EAP-DSRK AVP
of a Diameter EAP Answer(DEA)message.

                Figure 2: Re-auth Key transport
If the peer does not know the local domain name, ERP exchange can be run
to help the peer obtain the local domain name. The peer requests the
local ER for the local domain name by sending EAP Initiate/Re-auth
message. The message includes the local domain name request that
indicate to query the local domain name from the local server or the
home ER server. The local ER server receives DSRK using local key
transport mechanism described in the section 3.2 and derive the rRK,rIK
and RMSK using DSRK as the input, forward the Diameter EAP Finish to the
NAS, the local domain name and the rMSK is sent along with the EAP
success in the DEA message. The NAS receives the rMSK and forward the
EAP-Finish the peer with the local domain name included. The peer
extracts the local domain name from EAP Finish message and derive the
DSRK,rRK,rIK and rMSK.

(Editor's Note: it is not clear whether we extend DER/EEA or define new
Command Code to accommodate the two new EAP code,i.e.,EAP
Initiate/Finish )

4. Command Codes

This document re-uses the EAP application commands [RFC4072] and does
not define new command codes.

5. Attribute Value Pair Definitions

This section defines new AVPs for the ERP support within Diameter EAP
Application.

5.1. EAP-Local-Domain Name AVP

The EAP-DSRK-Domain Name is of type OctetString. This AVP contains the
domain name associated with local domain server which the EAP DSRK is
transported to.

5.2. EAP-DSRK AVP

The EAP-DSRK AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  This AVP
contains keying material to be used by the visited domain (i.e. the
DSRK).  Exactly how this keying material is derived and utilized is
beyond the scope of this document.

5.3. EAP-DSRK-Name AVP

The EAP-DSRK-Name AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  This AVP
contains the EMSKname as a default name or USRKname which uniquely
identifies the keying material.  How this name is derived is beyond the
scope of this document and defined in [RFC 5295].

5.4. EAP-DSRK-Lifetime AVP

The EAP-DSRK-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64 and
contains the DSRK lifetime in seconds.

5.5. EAP-rMSK AVP

The EAP-rMSK AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  This AVP
contains keying material to be used the peer and the authenticator in
the visited domain.  Exactly how this keying material is derived and
utilized is beyond the scope of this document.

5.6. EAP-rMSK-Name AVP

The EAP-rMSK-Name AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  This AVP
contains the EMSKname as a default name or rMSKname which uniquely
identifies the keying material.  How this name is derived is beyond the
scope of this document and defined in [RFC 5295].

5.7. EAP-rMSK-Lifetime AVP

The EAP-rMSK-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64 and
contains the rMSK lifetime in seconds.



6. AVP Occurrence Table

The following table lists the AVPs that may optionally be present in
the DER and DEA commands [RFC4072].

When the EAP-DSRK AVP is present in the DEA then the EAP-DSRK-Name and
the EAP-DSRK-Lifetime MUST also be present.
