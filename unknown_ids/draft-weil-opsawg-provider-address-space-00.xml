    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The majority of large network service providers are planning or are in the process of transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 in repines to the upcoming depletion of the IPv4 address pool. For large networks this transition represents a multi-year project that will 
      impact services and sectors in the network at various stages in the plan. Many of the strategies for the transition including dual-stack and a number of translation protocols require a large amount of dedicated or private IPv4 addresses for effective deployment
       in larger provider networks.  This becomes increasingly more challenging the closer the IANA global pool nears depletion, as is compounded by the fact that a number of these providers are nearing or have depleted the use of the Private RFC1918 address space.</t> 
      <t>It is imperative that address space requirements for these transition strategies is reserved quickly for this purpose. This document specifies a requirement to IANA to reserve a portion of the remaining unallocated space to for the enablement of a clean 
      transition strategy in large service provider networks.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation">
	<t>Deploying IPv6 into service provider core and metro networks is a fairly straightforward task. The hardware that exists in this portion of the network generally requires new software only to route and forward both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams. Moving outward from the 
	core towards the edges of the network, hardware resources available tend to diminish relative to the expected forwarding capacity.</t>
	<t>In broadband access provider networks, the move towards the far edge results in reduced hardware resources and less capability in the operating environments. These changes are significant when looking beyond the edge aggregation layer and into the residential
	 subscriber's home network. In this environment hosts and CPE routers tend to be purpose built for efficiency, cost, and ease of use. Devices functioning in the home gateway router role typically require replacement in order to fully support the transition to IPv6. 
	 The home gateway is a critical segment for any migration strategy. This device must implement a dual-stack environment facing the home LAN in order to support the various entertainment devices including IP enabled televisions, gaming consoles, medical and family 
	 monitoring devices among many others that will remain IPv4-only. While these will eventually be replaced with dual-stack or IPv6 capable devices; this transition will take many years.</t>
	<t>The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of unallocated IPv4 addresses.  At current projections, IANA will completely allocate its IPv4 address space during the second quarter of 2011.  The solution to this IPv4 address consumption is
	 to migrate Internet traffic to IPv6.  However, during the transition to IPv6, it is imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for devices and networks that are incapable of upgrading to IPv6.</t>
	<t>Mobile data access networks also have large sums of GPRS (2G) and UMTS (3G) UEs which have limited or no support of IPv6 operation.  Although mobile data equipment is refreshed on a higher frequency then Wireline counterparts, many handsets and other mobile
	  service termination equipment will remain IPv4 only for a long period of time.  Even with the operators? best intentions, support for Roaming (visitor equipment) will demand continued support for IPv4 until worldwide adoption reaches a certain threshold.</t>
	<t>In order to provide IPv4 service to new customers and/or devices once the IPv4 address space is exhausted, Service Providers must multiplex several subscribers behind a single IPv4 address using one of several techniques including 
	NAT444 <xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444"/> and Dual-Stack Lite <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite"/>.</t>
	</section>
	
    <section title="Dual-Stack Home Gateway Transition Scenarios">
	<t>This section details two use cases that require different technologies to address the support of the home network post IPv4 depletion.</t>
	<section title="Legacy IPv4-only Home Gateway">
		<t>In this model, the home gateway is unable to support dual-stack operation due to some combination of insufficient memory, processing power, or other operational limitations such as lack of vendor support. Also, many devices in the home will 
		only support the IPv4 protocol. There are only two options in this model: replace the Home Gateway and IPv4-only CPE devices or continue to offer IPv4-only services through the use of an IPv4 address sharing technology such as NAT444, as described 
		in <xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444"/>. The challenges associated with these deployments are identified in <xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr"/> and <xref target="I-D.ford-shared-addressing-issues"/>.</t>
		<t> Addressing solutions for dealing with the depletion of the IPv4 public address space and the lack of available private addresses within large providers are presented in <xref target="I-D.azinger-additional-private-ipv4-space-issues"/> as well as
		<xref target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr"/>. For larger Service Providers who require more than the 16 million Net-10 addresses, the preferred method for addressing the problems presented in both draft documents is to direct IANA to reserve a /8 
		from its unassigned IPv4 address pool.</t>
		</section>
		
	<section title="Dual-Stack Home Gateway">
		<t>In this model, the Home Gateway supports dual-stack operation natively on the LAN interface. The Home Gateway may also support Dual-stack on the WAN interface, or alternatively could deploy native IPv6 service and tunnel IPv4 traffic over IPv6 
		using methods specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite"/>. To maintain IPv4 operation on the WAN interface post IPv4 depletion, a CGN technology is required to offer NAT service, one within the Home Gateway and the other within the 
		provider's network. The tunneling approach has the potential benefit of removing the Home Gateway NAT, but still relies on the service provider NAT.</t>
		<t>Regardless of deployment model chosen, the deployment of the NAT will require new IPv4 public addressing. The preferred method for addressing either of the dual-stack Home Gateway models would be a unique IPv4 allocation out of the IANA unassigned pool.</t>
	</section>
    </section>
    <section title="Transition Address Requirements">
	<t>This document proposes the assignment of a single /8 CIDR block for use within large serve providers and large enterprises to enable an effective transition plan.  
	A single allocation that addresses all of the detailed Home Gateway transition scenarios presented in this document offers maximum utilization and flexibility to the Internet community. </t>
	<t>A single common IP block would also provide a common way for<xref target="RFC1918"/>-constrained environments to support IPv6 transition technologies without the need to select IP address space which is not assigned to them (address squatting)
	or implement complex overlapping strategies which inevitably impacts customer connectivity and performance.</t>
	<section title="Benefits of a Single Large Allocation">
		<t>There are a number of benefits related to the use of a single /8 assignment from the IANA free pool.</t>
		<t><list style="symbols">
			<t>Flexibility: Allocating a /8 address pool as Private Use allows flexibility in the type of transition mechanisms that can be deployed by Service Providers. Providers can expand the number of addresses available for internal network use beyond those provided in <xref target="RFC1918"/>. </t>
			<t>Efficiency: A Number of large and mid-sized providers are actively analyzing the use of Carrier Network Address Translators. The amount of public IPv4 address space needed to number these carrier address realms for large providers who lack enough <xref target="RFC1918"/> space should result in a net gain of available address public address space.</t> 
			<t>RFC1918 Overlap: Utilization of separate assignment can remove the challenge of <xref target="RFC1918"/> address overlap between the home network environment and the provider network.</t>
			<t>Removes need to use bogon/non-assigned Space: Providers can avoid the use of bogon and/or non-assigned space (to the local party) within their networks.  This type of address usage can be problematic to customers.</t>
			<t>Clear IP allocation for IPv6 transition technologies: A block reserved for transition usage can be well defined and provide best practices for transition technology deployment. </t>
			<t>Security:  Providers avoid the need to utilize smaller IP address space segments.  Single, large blocks are easier to build security polices around and result in better customer Internet experiences.  
			The provider can also treat long standing assigned <xref target="RFC1918"/> space within their network separately from the newly assigned ISP Shared Space which may have different security and policy needs.</t>
		</list></t>
	</section>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
	<t>This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security issues. Any /8 allocated for ISP use would not be routable on the Internet.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="IANA Considerations">
	<t>IANA is asked to reserve a /8 from its remaining pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses for use by large service providers for NAT444 address sharing. This allocation exhibits the characteristics of Private Use as described in <xref target="RFC5226"/> 
	in regards to IANA policy requirements.</t>
