     Abstract 

        This document describes a syntax which can be used to bind a generic 
        document (or any set of data, not necessarily protected by means of 
        cryptographic techniques) to one or more time-stamp tokens obtained 
        for that document, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning defined 
        in [TSP]. Additional types of temporal evidence are also supported.

        Whereas digital time stamping has become the standard technique for 
        proving the existence of a document before a certain point in time, 
        there is not a generally accepted syntax for keeping together one 
        document and the associated time-stamps in a single "bundle". Such a 
        syntax would facilitate keeping track of which time-stamps belong to 
        what documents and would therefore improve the efficiency of 
        timestamp-aware applications. 

        This document proposes a simple syntax based on [CMS], by defining a 
        new contentType.

     1. Introduction 

        Digital time stamping has become the standard technique for proving 
        the existence of a document before a certain point in time. Several 
        digital signature legislations around the world embrace the concept 
        and provide for time-stamping services as an approved means for 
        attesting the signing time and/or for extending the validity of 
        signed documents beyond the expiry date of the signer’s certificate.  

        However, while digital time stamping enhances digital signature, its 
        value does not depend on this latter. It can obviously be useful to 
        time-stamp a document even if this is not signed. And it can also be 
        useful, or even mandatory in some cases, to time-stamp a document in 
        its entirety, regardless of how many signatures it contains.

     Internet-Draft             timestampeddata                 January 2008 
         

        When a time-stamp is related to a digital signature, there already 
        exist a way to keep the two pieces together: [TSP] describes how one 
        or more TimeStampTokens can be included in a SignerInfo structure as 
        unsigned attributes. On the other hand, when time-stamps are not 
        related to a digital signature, there is no standard way to keep 
        together the time-stamped document and the related time-stamps.  

        In such cases two approaches are typically being adopted: 

        o  time-stamps are kept as separate files (keeping track of what 
           time-stamps belong to what documents is up to the user); 

        o  an ad hoc solution is adopted for specific applications, like e.g. 
           a ZIP archive or a proprietary "envelope" of some kind. 

        Both solutions are obviously inadequate when interoperability is 
        aimed at, like in this memo. 

        This document proposes a simple syntax for bundling one document 
        (actually, any kind of file) to the corresponding temporal evidence, 
        this latter being typically represented by one or more RFC 3161 
        TimeStampTokens [TSP]. Additional types of temporal evidence, like 
        e.g. an RFC 4998 EvidenceRecord, are also supported via an "open" 
        syntax. However, for the sake of interoperability, the emphasis is 
        given to TimeStampTokens. 

        The proposed syntax is broadly based on the [CMS] syntax. 

        This work is believed by the Author to "naturally" belong to either 
        the PKIX or the SMIME working group. To date, however, neither WG  
        has decided to adopt this proposal as a working item of theirs.  
        In the meantime, it is expected that this proposal be published as  
        an Informational RFC so that implementors can easily access and 
        reference it. 

     2. Syntax for TimeStampedData 

        The proposed data structure is called TimeStampedData. It is a new 
        variation of ContentInfo [CMS] marked by the following specific 
        contentType OID: 

         
        id-timestamped-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
        us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 9 }

     Internet-Draft             timestampeddata                 January 2008 
         

         
        This particular OID signals that the content field of the ContentInfo 
        has the following syntax: 

         
        TimeStampedData ::= SEQUENCE { 
           version        INTEGER { v1(1) }, 
           fileName       UTF8String, 
           mimeType       PrintableString, 
           content        OCTET STRING, 
           evidence       Evidence 
        } 

        Evidence ::= CHOICE { 
           timeStamps        [0] SET (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF TimeStampToken, 
           evidenceRecord    [1] EvidenceRecord 
           -- additional evidence types to be registered with the IETF 
        } 

         
        The version field contains the version number of the TimeStampedData 
        syntax. The initial version number is 1. 

        The fileName field contains the original filename (without path) of 
        the document which was time-stamped and whose content was inserted 
        into the TimeStampedData structure. 

        The mimeType field contains a MIME type (according to [MIME]) for the 
        bundled file. It is an advisory information which may help decide how 
        to open the file after having "detached" it from the TimeStampedData 
        structure, regardless of the filename extension (which could be 
        missing or unknown). 

        The content field carries the entire content, in its original format, 
        of the file which was time-stamped. The file need not be a document 
        in the strict sense; it can be any kind of file (e.g. an executable, 
        a database, etc). 

        The evidence field carries the evidence that the content data existed 
        before a certain point in time. The timeStampeddata syntax allows for 
        different types of evidence (like e.g. an EvidenceRecord according to 
        RFC 4998). However, this document mandates support for one type only: 
        a non-empy set of RFC 3161 TimeStampToken's [TSP]. 

        Additional types of evidence may be used after having registered them 
        (and having had a distinguishing tag assigned to them) with the IETF. 
        A suitable registration procedure should be defined for that purpose.

     3. Compliance requirements 

        Compliant applications MUST support the RFC 3161-based type of 
        evidence (i.e. the timeStamps CHOICE). 

        Compliant applications SHALL always populate the fileName field of 
        TimeStampedData structure with a non-empty string, which is supposed 
        to be the real name of the time-stamped file. Path information MUST 
        NOT be included. A valid example is "patent123.doc". An invalid 
        example is "c:\Documents and settings\John\Desktop\patent123.doc". 

        Compliant applications SHALL always populate the mimeType field of 
        TimeStampedData structure with a valid MIME content-type string. A 
        valid example is "application/pdf". An invalid example is "whatever". 

     4. Recommanded processing 

        When generating the TimeStampedData structure, applications are 
        supposed to behave like follows: 

        o  populate the version field with the integer value v1(1); 

        o  populate the fileName field with the real name of the file, 
           without path; 

        o  populate the mimeType field with an appropriate MIME type string, 
           preferably, or at least with "application/octet-stream"; 

        o  populate the content field with the entire contents of the file; 

        o  add the necessary evidence (e.g. one or more TimeStampTokens); 

        o  insert the TimeStampedData into a ContentInfo structure, with the 
           id-timestamped-data OID in the contentType field; 

        o  BER-encode the ContentInfo structure and save it with the same 
           name of the time-stamped file, but with the file extension 
           recommended in section 5. 

        When parsing an existing TimeStampedData structure, applications are 
        supposed to behave like follows: 

        o  check that the contentType field of the ContentInfo structure has 
           the expected value (id-timestamped-data) in its contentType field; 
           then, extract the inner TimeStampedData structure and continue 
           processing;

        o  check the version field (it should be v1); 

        o  check the fileName field (it must not be empty) and keep it for 
           later use; 

        o  check the mimeType field (it must not be empty) and keep it for 
           later use; 

        o  read the content field and prepare to save it in a separate file 
           and/or show it to the user; 

        o  check that the evidence field not be empty; extract the inner data 
           and prepare to show them to the user and/or save them to separate 
           files; 

        o  validate the evidence data (e.g. in case of timeStamps: check that 
           each TimeStampToken does indeed contain the hash of the time-
           stamped document and it was signed by a trusted TSA); 

        o  depending on the application, show the evidence data to the user; 

        o  depending on the application, show the time-stamped document to 
           the user, possibly by activating a suitable external "viewer"; if 
           the fileName extension is not sufficient to figure out the 
           suitable viewer, try using the mimeType field as an additional 
           hint; 

        o  depending on the application, save the content field into a 
           separate file with the name specified by the fileName field (or 
           let the user specify the desired filename). 

     5. Recommended file extensions 

        A file containing a TimeStampedData structure SHOULD bear the .tsd 
        extension. Example: "patent123.tsd" 

     6. Security Considerations 

        There are no security issues. 

     7. IANA Considerations 

        This document defines one object identifier under the pkcs7 arc: 

        id-timestamped-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
        us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 9 }
