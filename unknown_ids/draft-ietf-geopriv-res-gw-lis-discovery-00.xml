    <abstract>
      <t>The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part of home networking equipment. Discovering a Location Information Server (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information for location-based services. However, discovering a LIS when a residential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge, requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented by the gateway. </t>

      <t>This document describes a solution to this problem. The solution provides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery process based on the network addresses assigned to a Device. </t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>A Location Information Server (LIS) is a service provided by an access network. The LIS uses knowledge of the access network topology and other information to generate location for Devices. Devices within an access network are able to acquire location information from a LIS. </t>

      <t>The relationship between a Device and an access network might be transient. Configuration of the correct LIS at the Device ensures that accurate location information is available.  Without location information, some network services are not available. </t>

      <t>The configuration of a LIS address on a Device requires some automated configuration process. This is particularly relevant when it is considered that Devices might move between different access networks. <xref target="RFC5986">LIS Discovery</xref> describes a method that employs the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (<xref target="RFC2131">DHCPv4</xref>, <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref>) as input to U-NAPTR <xref target="RFC4848"/> discovery. </t>

      <t>A residential gateway, or home router, provides a range of networking functions for Devices within the network it serves. In most cases, these functions effectively prevent the successful use of DHCP for LIS discovery. </t>

      <t>The drawback with DHCP is that universal deployment of a new option takes a considerable amount of time. Often, networking equipment needs to be updated in order to support the new option. Of particular concern are the millions of residential gateway devices used to provide Internet access to homes and businesses. While <xref target="RFC5986"/> describes functions that can be provided by residential gateways to support LIS discovery, gateways built before the publication of this specification do not (and cannot) provide these functions. </t>

      <t>This document explores the problem of configuring Devices with a LIS address when a
        residential gateway is interposed between the Device and access network. <xref target="ps"/>
        defines the problem and <xref target="ip-dns"/> describes a method for determining a domain
        name that can be used for discovery of the LIS. </t>

      <t>In some cases, the solution described in this document is based on a <xref target="RFC3424"
          >UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF)</xref> method. For those cases, this solution is
        considered transitional until such time as the recommendations for residential gateways in
          <xref target="RFC5986"/> are more widely deployed. Considerations
        relating to UNSAF applications are described in <xref target="iab"/>. </t>

      <t><xref target="topo"/> shows a simplified network topology for fixed wire-line Internet
        access. This arrangement is typical when wired Internet access is provided. The diagram
        shows two network segments: the access network provided by an internet service provider
        (ISP), and the residential network served by the residential gateway. </t>

      <t>There are a number of variations on this arrangement, as documented in Section 3.1 of <xref
          target="RFC5687"/>. In each of these variations the goal of LIS
        discovery is to identify the LIS in the access network. </t>

      <t>A particularly important characteristic of this arrangement is the relatively small area
        served by the residential gateway. Given a small enough area, it is reasonable to delegate
        the responsibility for providing Devices within the residential network with location
        information to the ISP. The ISP is able to provide location information that identifies the
        residence, which should be adequate for a wide range of purposes. </t>

      <t>A residential network that covers a larger area might require a dedicated LIS, a case that
        is outside the scope of this document. </t>

      <t>The goal of LIS discovery is to identify a LIS that is able to provide the Device with
        accurate location information. In the network topology described, this means identifying the
        LIS in the access network. The residential gateway is a major obstacle in achieving this
        goal. </t>

      <section title="Residential Gateway">
        <t>A residential gateway can encompass several different functions including: modem,
          Ethernet switch, wireless access point, router, network address translation (NAT), DHCP
          server, DNS relay and firewall. Of the common functions provided, the NAT function of a
          residential gateway has the greatest impact on LIS discovery. </t>

        <t>An ISP is typically parsimonious about their IP address allocations; each customer is
          allocated a limited number of IP addresses. Therefore, NAT is an extremely common function
          of gateways. NAT enables the use of multiple Devices within the residential network.
          However NAT also means that Devices within the residence are not configured by the ISP
          directly. </t>

        <t>When it comes to discovering a LIS, the fact that Devices are not configured by the ISP
          causes a significant problem. Configuration is the ideal method of conveying the
          information necessary for discovery. Devices attached to residential gateways are usually
          given a generic configuration that includes no information about the ISP network. For
          instance, DNS configuration typically points to a DNS relay on the gateway device. This
          approach ensures that the local network served by the gateway is able to operate without a
          connection to the ISP, but it also means that Devices are effectively ignorant of the ISP
          network. </t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5986"/> describes several methods that can be
          applied by a residential gateway to assist Devices in acquiring location information. For
          instance, the residential gateway could forward LIS address information to hosts within
          the network it serves. Such an active involvement in the discovery process only works for
          new residential gateway devices that implement these recommendations. </t>

        <t>Where residential gateways already exist, direct involvement of the gateway in LIS
          discovery requires that the residential gateway be updated or replaced. The cost of
          replacement is difficult to justify to the owner of the gateway, especially when it is
          considered that the gateway still fills its primary function: Internet access. </t>

        <t>Existing residential gateways have proven to be quite reliable devices, some operating
          continuously for many years without failure. As a result, there are many operational
          gateways that are of a considerable age, some well outside the period of manufacturer
          support. Updating the software in such devices is not feasible in many cases. Even if
          software updates were made available, many residential gateways cannot be updated
          remotely, inevitably leading to some proportion that is not updated. </t>

        <t>This document therefore describes a method which can be used by Devices to discover their
          LIS without any assistance from the network.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="thirdparty" title="Use of Discovery for Third Party Queries">

        <t>It is desirable that any discovery mechanism is capable of being used by hosts outside of
          the access network. This facilitates third party queries (see <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-held-identity-extensions"/>) by enabling identification
          of the appropriate LIS. </t>

        <t>For example, in some jurisdictions, interim solutions for emergency services require that
          a voice service provider (VSP) or public safety answering point (PSAP) be able to request
          location information from the access network provider. These architectures mandate third
          party queries to accommodate calling devices that are unable to acquire their own location
          information and subsequently convey <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance"/> that
          information within call signalling. </t>

        <t>This document therefore describes a method which may also be used by third parties to
          discover the appropriate LIS based on the network address of the Device.</t>

        <t>Note that an access network that fully supports DHCP-based LIS discovery <xref
            target="RFC5986"/> might not need to provide a secondary
          discovery mechanism. However this method SHOULD be provided for the benefit of third
          parties and for Devices that are unable to use DHCP-based LIS discovery. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Additional and Optional Constraints">
        <t>Certain other properties of residential gateways constrain the potential solutions to
          this problem. </t>

        <t>A network firewall function is often provided by residential gateways as a security
          measure. Security features like intrusion detection systems help protect users from
          attacks. Amongst these protections is a port filter that prevents both inbound and
          outbound traffic on certain TCP and UDP ports. Therefore, any solution needs to consider
          the likelihood of traffic being blocked. </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="ip-dns" title="IP-based DNS Solution">

      <t><xref target="RFC5986">LIS discovery</xref> uses a DNS-based Dynamic
        Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) system as the basis of discovery. Input to this process
        is a domain name. Use of DHCP for acquiring the domain name is specified, but alternative
        methods of acquisition are permitted. </t>

      <t>This document specifies a means for a device to discover several alternative domain names
        that can be used as input to the DDDS process. These domain names are based on the IP
        address of the Device. Specifically, the domain names are a portion of the reverse DNS trees
        - either the <spanx style="verb">.in-addr.arpa.</spanx> or <spanx style="verb"
        >.ip6.arpa.</spanx> tree. </t>

      <t>A Device might be reachable at one of a number of IP addresses. In the process described, a
        Device first identifies each IP address that it is potentially reachable from. From each of
        these addresses, the Device then selects up to three domain names for use in discovery.
        These domain names are then used as input to the DDDS process. </t>

      <section title="Identification of IP Addresses">
        <t>A Device identifies a set of potential IP addresses that currently result in packets
          being routed to it. These are ordered by proximity, with those addresses that are used in
          adjacent network segments being favoured over those used in public or remote networks. The
          first addresses in the set are those that are assigned to local network interfaces. </t>

        <t>A Device can use the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) <xref target="RFC5389"/>
          to determine its public reflexive transport address. The host uses the <spanx style="verb"
            >Binding Request</spanx> message and the resulting <spanx style="verb"
            >XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS</spanx> parameter that is returned in the response. </t>

        <t>Alternative methods for determining other IP addresses MAY be used by the host. <xref
            target="UPnP-IGD-WANIPConnection1">Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)</xref> and <xref
            target="I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp">NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP)</xref> are both able
          to provide the external address of a residential gateway device when enabled. These as
          well as proprietary methods for determining other addresses might also be available.
          Because there is no assurance that these methods will be supported by any access network
          these methods are not mandated. Note also that in some cases, methods that rely on the
          view of the network from the residential gateway device could reveal an address in a
          private address range (see <xref target="assumptions"/>). </t>

        <t>In many instances, the IP address produced might be from a private address range. For
          instance, the address on a local network interface could be from a private range allocated
          by the residential gateway. In other cases, methods that rely on the view of the network
          (UPnP, NAT-PMP) from the residential gateway device could reveal an address in a private
          address range if the access network also uses NAT. For a private IP address, the derived
          domain name is only usable where the DNS server used contains data for the corresponding
          private IP address range. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Domain Name Selection">
        <t>The domain name selected for each resulting IP address is the name that would be used for
          a reverse DNS lookup. The domain name derived from an IP version 4 address is in the
            <spanx style="verb">.in-addr.arpa.</spanx> tree and follows the construction rules in
          Section 3.5 of <xref target="RFC1035"/>. The domain name derived from an IP version 6
          address is in the <spanx style="verb">.ip6.arpa.</spanx> tree and follows the construction
          rules in Section 2.5 of <xref target="RFC3596"/>. </t>

        <t>Additional domain names are added to allow for a single record to cover a larger set of
          addresses. If the search on the domain derived from the full IP address does not produce a
          NAPTR record with the desired service tag (e.g., <spanx style="verb">LIS:HELD</spanx>), a
          similar search is repeated based on a shorter domain name, using a part of the IP address:
            <list style="symbols">
            <t>For IP version 4, the resulting domain name SHOULD be shortened successively by one
              and two labels and the query repeated. This corresponds to a search on a /24 or /16
              network prefix. This allows for fewer DNS records in the case where a single access
              network covering an entire /24 or /16 network is served by the same LIS. </t>

            <t>For IP version 6, the resulting domain SHOULD be shortened sucessively by 16, 20 and
              24 labels and the query repeated. This corresponds to a search on a /64, /48 or /32
              network prefix.</t>

          </list> DNS queries on other prefixes than those listed above SHOULD NOT be performed to
          limit the number of DNS queries performed by Devices. If no LIS is discovered by this
          method, no more than four U-NAPTR resolutions are invoked for each IP address. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="When To Use This Method">
        <t>The DHCP method described in <xref target="RFC5986"/> SHOULD be
          attempted on all local network interfaces before attempting this method. This method is
          employed either because DHCP is unavailable, when the DHCP server does not provide a value
          for the access network domain name option, or if a request to the resulting LIS results in
          a HELD <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> error or equivalent. </t>

        <t>This method can also be used to facilitate third party queries, as described in <xref
            target="thirdparty"/>. Based on a known IP address, the LIS that serves that address can
          be identified as long as the corresponding NAPTR records are provided. </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="assumptions" title="Necessary Assumptions and Restrictions">
        <t>When used by a Device for LIS discovery this is an UNSAF application and is subject to
          the limitations described in <xref target="iab"/>. </t>

        <t>It is not necessary that the IP address used is unique to the Device, only that the
          address can be somehow related to the Device or the access network that serves the Device.
          This allows a degree of flexibility in determining this value, although <xref
            target="security">security considerations</xref> might require that the address be
          verified to prevent falsification. </t>

        <t>Addresses from <xref target="RFC1918">private address space</xref> MAY be used as input
          to this method. However, it is assumed that a DNS server with a view of the same address
          space is used in order to provide the corresponding DNS mappings; the public DNS does not
          contain useful records for all possible address spaces. </t>

        <t>This does not preclude the use of private address spaces; use of a private address space
          in discovery can provide an access network operator more granular control over discovery.
          This assumes that the DNS server used in the U-NAPTR resolution is able to view the
          address realm. Addresses from the public address space are more likely to be able to be
          resolved by any DNS server. Thus, use of the public reflexive transport addresses acquired
          from a STUN server provide better chance of the DNS server being able to produce a usable
          result. Therefore, access to a STUN server that is able to view addresses from the public
          Internet is necessary. </t>

        <t>This solution assumes that the public reflexive transport address used by a Device is in
          some way controlled by their ISP, or some other related party. This implies that the
          corresponding <spanx style="verb">.in-addr.arpa.</spanx> or <spanx style="verb"
          >.ip6.arpa.</spanx> record can be updated by that entity to include a useful value for the
          LIS address. </t>

      <section title="Failure Modes">
        <t>Successful use of private addresses relies on a DNS server that is able to see the
          private address space; therefore, a means to determine a public IP address is necessary.
          This document relies on STUN to provide the Device with a public reflexive transport
          address. Configuration of STUN server is necessary to ensure that this is successful. </t>

        <t>Alternative methods for discovering external IP addresses are possible, including UPnP
          and NAT-PMP. However, these methods might not be enabled on the residential gateway; thus,
          these methods cannot be relied upon. </t>

        <t>In cases where a virtual private network (VPN) or other tunnel is used, the entity
          providing a public IP address might not be able to provide the Device with location
          information. It is assumed that this entity is able to identify this problem and indicate
          this to the Device (using the <spanx style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> HELD error, or
          similar). This problem is described in more detail in <xref
            target="RFC5985"/>. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deployment Considerations">
        <t>An access network provider SHOULD provide NAPTR records for each public IP address that
          is used for Devices within the access network. If the access network provider uses NAT,
          any DNS internal to that NAT SHOULD also include records for the private address range. </t>

        <t>NAPTR records can be provided for individual IP addresses. To limit the proliferation of
          identical records, a single record can be placed at a the higher nodes of the tree
          (corresponding to /24 and /16 for IPv4; /64, /48 and /32 for IPv6). A record at a higher
          point in the tree (those with a shorter prefix) applies to all addresses lower in the tree
          (those with a longer prefix); records at the lower point override those at higher points,
          allowing for exceptions to be provided for at the lower point. </t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations described in <xref target="RFC5986"/>
      apply to the discovery process as a whole.  The primary security concern is with the potential
      for an attacker to impersonate a LIS.
      </t>

      <t>The added ability for a third party to discover the identity of a LIS does not add any
      concerns, since the identity of a LIS is considered public information.
      </t>

      <t>In addition to existing considerations, this document introduces further security
      considerations relating to the identification of the IP address.  It is possible that an
      attacker could attempt to provide a falsified IP addresses in an attempt to subvert the rest
      of the process. </t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5389"/> describes attacks where an attacker is able to ensure that a
      Device receives a falsified reflexive address. Even if the STUN server is trusted, an attacker
      might be able to ensure that a falsified address is provided to the Device. </t>

      <t>This attack is an effective means of denial of service, or a means to provide a
        deliberately misleading service. Notably, any LIS that is identified based on a falsified IP
        address could still be a valid LIS for the given IP address, just not one that is useful for
        providing the Device with location information. In this case, the LIS provides a HELD <spanx
          style="verb">notLocatable</spanx> error, or an equivalent. If the falsified IP address is
        under the control of the attacker, it is possible that misleading (but verifiable) DNS
        records could indicate a malicious LIS that provides false location information. </t>

      <t>In all cases of falsification, the best remedy is to perform some form of independent
        verification of the result. No specific mechanism is currently available to prevent attacks
        based on falsification of reflexive addresses; it is suggested that Devices attempt to
        independently verify that the reflexive transport address provided is accurate.</t>

      <t>Use of private address space effectively prevents use of the usual set of trust anchors for
        DNSSEC. Only a DNS server that is able to see the same private address space can provide
        useful records. A Device that relies on DNS records in the private address space portion of
        the <spanx style="verb">.in-addr.arpa.</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">.ip6.arpa.</spanx>
        trees MUST either use an alternative trust anchor for these records or rely on other means
        of ensuring the veracity of the DNS records. </t>

    <section anchor="iab" title="IAB Considerations">
      <t>The IAB has studied the problem of <xref target="RFC3424">Unilateral Self-Address Fixing
          (UNSAF)</xref>, which is the general process by which a client attempts to determine its
        address in another realm on the other side of a NAT through a collaborative protocol
        reflection mechanism, such as STUN. </t>

      <t>This section only applies to the use of this method of LIS discovery by Devices and does
        not apply to its use for third-party LIS discovery.</t>

      <t>The IAB requires that protocol specifications that define UNSAF mechanisms document a set
        of considerations. <list style="numbers">
          <t>Precise definition of a specific, limited-scope problem that is to be solved with the
            UNSAF proposal. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            <xref target="ps"/> describes the limited scope of the problem addressed in this
            document. </t>

          <t>Description of an exit strategy/transition plan. <vspace blankLines="1"/> <xref target="RFC5986"/> describes behaviour that residential gateways require in order for this short term solution to be rendered unnecessary. When implementations of the recommendations in LIS discovery are widely available, this UNSAF mechanism can be made obsolete.</t>

          <t>Discussion of specific issues that may render systems more "brittle". <vspace
              blankLines="1"/> A description of the necessary assumptions and limitations of this
            solution are included in <xref target="assumptions"/>. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Use of
            STUN for discovery of a reflexive transport address is inherently brittle in the
            presence of multiple NATs or address realms. In particular, brittleness is added by the
            requirement of using a DNS server that is able to view the address realm that contains
            the IP address in question. If address realms use overlapping addressing space, then
            there is a risk that the DNS server provides information that is not useful to the
            Device. </t>

          <t>Identify requirements for longer term, sound technical solutions; contribute to the
            process of finding the right longer term solution. <vspace blankLines="1"/> A longer
            term solution is already provided in <xref target="RFC5986"/>.
            However, that solution relies on widespread deployment. The UNSAF solution provided here
            is provided as an interim solution that enables LIS access for Devices that are not able
            to benefit from deployment of the recommendations in <xref
              target="RFC5986"/>. </t>

          <t>Discussion of the impact of the noted practical issues with existing deployed NATs and
            experience reports. <vspace blankLines="1"/> The UNSAF mechanism depends on the
            experience in deployment of <xref target="RFC5389">STUN</xref>. On the whole, existing
            residential gateway devices are able to provide access to STUN and DNS service reliably,
            although regard should be given to the size of the DNS response (see <xref
              target="RFC5625"/>). </t>
