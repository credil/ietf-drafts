        Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
        used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients allow
        users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put, but
        configuring them requires that the user know which mailboxes the
        server has set aside for these purposes.  This extension adds new optional
        mailbox attributes that a server may include in IMAP LIST command responses
        to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing configuration.

        Some IMAP message stores include special-use mailboxes, such as those
        used to hold draft messages or sent messages.  Many mail clients allow
        users to specify where draft or sent messages should be put, but

        to identify special-use mailboxes to the client, easing configuration.
      </t>

      <t>
        In addition, this extension adds an optional parameter on the IMAP
        CREATE command, allowing a client to assign a special use to a mailbox
        when it is created.  Servers may choose to support this part of the
        extension, but are not required to.
      </t>

      <section title="Conventions used in this document">
        <t>
          In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
          to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.
        </t>
      
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
          are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>        
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="New mailbox attributes identifying special-use mailboxes">
      <t>
        An IMAP server that supports this extension MAY include any or all of the
        following attributes in responses to the non-extended IMAP LIST command.
        The new attributes are
        included along with existing attributes, such as "\Marked" and "\Noselect".
        A given mailbox may have none, one, or more than one of these attributes.
        In some cases, a special use is advice to a client about what to put
        in that mailbox.  In other cases, it's advice to a client about what to
        expect to find there.
        There is no capability string related to the support of special-use
        attributes on the non-extended LIST command.
      </t>

      <t>
        For the extended list command <xref target="RFC5258"/>, this extension
        adds a new capability string, a new selection option,
        and a new return option, all called "SPECIAL-USE".
        Supporting implementations MUST include the "SPECIAL-USE" capability
        string in response to an IMAP CAPABILITY command.
        If the client specifies the "SPECIAL-USE" selection option, the LIST
        command MUST return only those mailboxes that have a special-use
        attribute set.
        If the client specifies the "SPECIAL-USE" return option, the LIST
        command MUST return the new special-use attributes on those mailboxes that
        have them set.
        The "SPECIAL-USE" return option is implied by the "SPECIAL-USE"
        selection option.
        The extended LIST command MAY return SPECIAL-USE attributes
        even if the client does not specify the return option.
      </t>

      <t>
        The new attributes defined here are as follows:
        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="5">
        <t hangText="&#92;Drafts"><vspace />
        This mailbox is used to hold draft messages -- typically, messages that
        are being composed but have not yet been sent.
        In some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with the
        "\Draft" message flag.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client put
        drafts here.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Flagged"><vspace />
        This mailbox presents all messages marked in some way as "important".
        When this special use is supported, it is likely to represent a
        virtual mailbox collecting messages (from other mailboxes) that are
        marked with the "\Flagged" message flag.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Junk"><vspace />
        This mailbox is where messages deemed to be junk mail are held.
        Some server implementations might put messages here automatically.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice to a client-side spam filter.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Sent"><vspace />
        This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that have been sent.
        Some server implementations might put messages here automatically.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client save
        sent messages here.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Trash"><vspace />
        This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted, or marked
        for deletion.
        In some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,
        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with the
        "\Deleted" message flag.
        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that chooses
        not to use the IMAP "\Deleted" model should use this as its trash
        location.
        In server implementations that strictly expect the IMAP "\Deleted"
        model, this special use is likely not to be supported.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;All"><vspace />
        This mailbox presents all messages in the user's message store.
        Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those in \Trash
        and \Junk.
        When this special use is supported, it is almost certain to represent a
        virtual mailbox.
        </t>
        <t hangText="&#92;Archive"><vspace />
        This mailbox is used to archive messages.
        The meaning of an "archival" mailbox is server-dependent; typically, it will be used to
        get messages out of the inbox, or otherwise keep them out of the user's way, while still
        making them accessible.
        </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>
        All of the above attributes are OPTIONAL, and any given server or message
        store may support any combination of the attributes, or none at all.
        In most cases there will likely be at most one mailbox with a given attribute
        for a given user, but
        in some server or message store implementations it might be possible for
        multiple mailboxes to have the same special-use attribute.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Special-use attributes are likely to be user-specific.
        User Adam might share his \Sent mailbox with user Barb, but that mailbox is
        unlikely to also serve as Barb's \Sent mailbox.
        It's certainly possible for Adam and Barb to each set the \Sent use on the same
        mailbox, but that would be done by specific action (see the sections below).
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Extension to IMAP CREATE command to set special-use attributes">
      <t>
        As an OPTIONAL feature, a server MAY allow clients to designate a
        mailbox, at creation, as having one or more special uses.  This
        extension defines the "USE" parameter to the IMAP CREATE command
        for that purpose (using the syntax defined in RFC 4466 section 2.2
        <xref target="RFC4466" />).
        The new OPTIONAL "USE" parameter is followed by a parenthesized list
        of zero or more special-use attributes, as defined above.
      </t>

      <t>
        In some server implementations, some special uses may imply automatic
        action by the server.
        For example, creation of a "\Junk" mailbox
        might cause the server to start placing messages that have been
        evaluated as spam into the mailbox.        
      </t>

      <t>
        In some server implementations, some special uses may result in a
        mailbox with unusual characteristics or side effects.
        For example, creation of an "\All" mailbox might cause the server to
        create a virtual mailbox, rather than a standard one, and that mailbox
        might behave in unexpected ways (COPY into it might fail, for example).
      </t>

      <t>
        Servers MAY allow the creation
        of a special-use mailbox even if one so designated already exists, having
        the effect of moving the special use from the old mailbox to the
        new one.  Alternatively, servers MAY refuse the creation, considering
        the designation to be a conflict.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the server can not create a mailbox with the designated special use
        defined, for whatever reason, it MUST NOT create the mailbox, and MUST
        respond to the CREATE command with a tagged NO response.
        If the reason for the failure is related to the special-use attribute
        (the specified special use is not supported or cannot be assigned to
        the specified mailbox), the server SHOULD include the new "USEATTR"
        response code in the tagged response (see <xref target="example-create" />
        for an example).
      </t>

      <t>
        An IMAP server that supports this OPTIONAL feature will advertise the
        CREATE-SPECIAL-USE capability string.  Clients MUST NOT use the "USE"
        parameter unless the server advertises the capability.
        Note that this capability string is different from the SPECIAL-USE
        string defined above, and a server that supports both functions MUST
        advertise both capability strings.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IMAP METADATA entry for special-use attributes">
      <t>
        If a server supports this extension and the METADATA extension
        <xref target="RFC5464" />, it SHOULD tie the special-use attributes
        for a mailbox to its metadata entry "/shared/specialuse".
        The value of /shared/specialuse is either NIL (if there are no
        special-use attributes for that mailbox) or a space-separated list
        of special-use attributes, presented the same way they would be
        presented in the LIST command response.
      </t>

      <t>
        Such a server MAY allow the setting of special-use attributes through
        the METADATA mechanisms, thereby allowing clients to change
        the special uses of existing mailboxes.
        These changes might have side effects, as the server automatically
        adjusts the special uses accordingly, just as it might do with
        CREATE USE, above.
        See <xref target="example-metadata"/> for an example.
      </t>

      <t>
        A server that supports this MUST check the validity of changes to the
        special-use attributes that are done through the metadata in the same
        way that it checks validity for the CREATE command and for any internal
        mechanisms for setting special uses on mailboxes.  It MUST NOT
        just blindly accept setting of these metadata by clients, which might
        result in the setting of special uses that the implementation does not
        support, multiple mailboxes with the same special use, or other
        situations that the implementation considers invalid.        
      </t>
    </section>

        <t>
          This example shows an IMAP LIST response from a server that supports

      <t>
        CREATE command "USE" parameter and metadata extension:
        In some server implementations, some special uses may imply automatic
        action by the server.  For example, creation of a "\Junk" mailbox
        might cause the server to start placing messages that have been
        evaluated as spam into the mailbox.  Implementors SHOULD
        consider the consequences of allowing a user (or client program)
        to designate the target of such automatic action.
      </t>

      <t>
        Example: If a user is allowed to give the "\Junk" attribute to a shared mailbox,
        legitimate mail that's misclassified as junk (false positives) will be put into that
        shared mailbox, exposing the user's private mail to others.  The server might
        warn a user of that possibility, or might refuse to allow the specification to be
        made on a shared mailbox.  (Note that this problem exists independent of this
        specification, if the server allows a user to share a mailbox that's already in use
        for such a function.)
