	<abstract>
		<t> This memo presents extensions to the DomainKeys Identified
		    Mail (DKIM) specification to allow for detailed reporting
		    of message authentication failures in an on-demand
		    fashion. </t>
	</abstract>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="DKIM"/> introduced a mechanism for message
		    signing and authentication.  It uses digital signing to
		    associate a domain name with a message in a reliable
		    (i.e. not forgeable) manner.  The output is a verified
		    domain name that can then be subjected to some sort of
		    evaluation process (e.g., advertised sender policy,
		    comparison to a known-good list, submission to a
		    reputation service, etc.). </t>

		<t> Deployers of message authentication technologies
		    are increasingly seeking visibility into DKIM verification
		    failures and conformance failures involving the
		    published signing practices (e.g., <xref target="ADSP"/>)
		    of an Administrative Management Domain (ADMD; see
		    <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>). </t>

		<t> This document extends <xref target="DKIM"/> and
		    <xref target="ADSP"/> to add an optional reporting
		    address and some reporting parameters. </t>

	<section anchor="dkim-reports" title="Optional Reporting for DKIM">
		<t> A domain name owner employing <xref target="DKIM"/> for
		    email signing and authentication might want to know when
		    signatures in use by specific keys are not successfully
		    verifying.  Currently there is no such mechanism
		    defined. </t>

		<t> This document adds optional "tags" (as defined in
		    <xref target="DKIM"/>) to the DKIM-Signature header field
		    and the DKIM key record in the DNS, using the formats
		    defined in that specification. </t>

			    fields when a Signer wishes to request that
			    reports of failed verifications be generated
			    by a Verifier:

			<list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="rd="> Reporting Domain
				(plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value
				MUST be a string containing a DNS domain name.
				This value will be used by the Verifier to

		<section anchor="dkim-rep-tags"
		         title="DKIM Reporting TXT Record">
			<t> When a Signer wishes to advertise that it wants
			    to receive failed verification reports, it also
			    places in the DNS a TXT resource record (RR)
			    whose content follows the same general syntax as
			    DKIM key records, as defined in Section 3.6.1 of
			    <xref target="DKIM"/>, in that it is made up of
			    a sequence of tag-value objects.  In this case,
			    the tags and values comprise the parameters to
			    be used when generating the reports.  The Verifier
			    (if it supports this extension) will request the
			    content of this record when it sees an "rd=" tag
			    in a DKIM-Signature header field. </t>

			<t> The reassembly rules of Section 3.6.2.2 of
			    <xref target="DKIM"/> also apply here if the
			    reporting TXT record consists of several string
			    fragments. </t>

			<t> Any tag found in the content of this record that
			    is not registered with IANA as described in
			    <xref target="iana-dkim-rep-tags"/> MUST be
			    ignored. </t>

			<t> The initial list of tags supported for the
			    reporting TXT record is as follows:

			    <list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="ra="> Reporting Address
				(plain-text; REQUIRED).  A
				dkim-quoted-printable string (see Section
				2.11 of <xref target="DKIM"/>) containing the
				local-part of an email address to which a
				report SHOULD be sent when mail fails
				DKIM verification for one of the reasons
				enumerated below.  The value MUST be
				interpreted as a local-part only.  To
				construct the actual address to which the
				report is sent, the verifier simply appends to
				this value an "@" followed by the domain
				name found in the "rd=" tag of the
				DKIM-Signature header field.  Therefore, an
				ADMD making use of this specification MUST
				ensure that an email address thus constructed
				can receive reports generated as described in
				<xref target="generation"/>.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-ra-tag = %x72.61 *WSP "=" *WSP qp-section
					</artwork></figure></t>

				<t hangText="rp="> Requested Report Percentage
				(plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "100").  The
				value is an integer value from 0 to 100
				inclusive that indicates what percentage of
				incidents of signature authentication failures,
				selected at random, are to cause reports to be
				generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT
				issue reports for more than the requested
				percentage of incidents.  Report generators
				MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in
				<xref target="ARF"/> to indicate that there
				are more reportable incidents than there are
				reports.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-rp-tag = %x72.70 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*3DIGIT
					</artwork></figure></t>

				<t hangText="rr="> Requested Reports
				(plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
				value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens
				representing those conditions under which a
				report is desired.  See
				<xref target="requests-dkim"/> for a list of
				valid tags.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-rr-type = ( "all" / "s" / "v" / "x" )
    rep-rr-tag = %x72 %x6f *WSP "=" *WSP rep-rr-type
                 *WSP 0* ( ":" *WSP rep-rr-type )
					</artwork></figure></t>

				<t hangText="rs="> Requested SMTP Error String
				(text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value is a
				dkim-quoted-printable string that the
				publishing ADMD requests be included in
				<xref target="SMTP"/> error strings if
				messages are rejected during the delivery SMTP
				session.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-rs-tag = %x72 %x73 *WSP "=" qp-section
					</artwork></figure></t>
				</list> </t>

			<t> In the absence of an "ra=" tag, all other tags
			    listed above MUST be ignored.  In other words,
			    an implementation MUST NOT have a default value
			    for the "ra=" tag. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="dkim-algorithm"
		         title="DKIM Reporting Algorithm">
			<t> The following algorithm, or one semantically
			    equivalent to it, MUST be applied when an
			    implementation is equipped to generate reports
			    in compliance with this specification and its
			    evaluation of the DKIM-Signature header field
			    (see <xref target="DKIM"/>) on a message
			    fails for some reason.  Note that this processing
			    is done as a reporting extension only; the outcome
			    of the specified DKIM evaluation is otherwise
			    unaffected. 
			   
			<list style="numbers">
				<t> If the DKIM-Signature field did not
				    contain an "rd=" tag, terminate. </t>

				<t> Issue a <xref target="DNS"/> TXT query to
				    the name that results from appending
				    the value of the "rd=" tag to the string
				    "_report._domainkey".  For example, if a
				    DKIM-Signature header field contains
				    "example.com", issue a DNS TXT query to
				    "_report._domainkey.example.com". </t>

				<t> If the DNS query returns anything other
				    than a success status code (0), also
				    known as NOERROR, the implementation
				    MAY log this locally; in either case,
				    terminate. </t>

				<t> If the resultant TXT is in several
				    string fragments, reassemble it as
				    described in Section 3.6.2.2 of
				    <xref target="DKIM"/>. </t>

				<t> If the TXT content is syntactically
				    invalid, the implementation MAY log this
				    locally; in either case, terminate. </t>

				<t> If the reason for the signature evaluation
				    failure does not match one of the report
				    requests found in the "rr=" tag (or its
				    default value), terminate. </t>

				<t> If a report percentage ("rp=") tag was
				    present, select a random number between
				    0 and 99, inclusive; if the selected number
				    is higher than the tag's value,
				    terminate. </t>

				<t> Determine the reporting address by
				    extracting the value of the "ra=" tag
				    and appending to it "@" followed by
				    the domain name found in the "rd=" tag
				    of the DKIM-Signature header field. </t>

				<t> Construct and send a report in compliance
				    with <xref target="generation"/> of this
				    memo that includes as its intended
				    recipient the address constructed in the
				    previous step. </t>

				<t> If the <xref target="SMTP"/> session
				    during which the DKIM signautre was
				    evaluated is still active and the SMTP
				    server has not already given its response
				    to the DATA command that relayed the
				    message, and an "rs=" tag was present
				    in the TXT record, the SMTP server SHOULD
				    include the decoded string found in the
				    "rs=" tag in its SMTP reply to the DATA
				    command. </t>
			</list> </t>

			<t> This algorithm has the following advantages over
			    previous implementations:

			    <list style="letters">
				<t> If the DKIM signature fails to verify,
				    no additional DNS check is made to see
				    if reporting is requested; the request
				    is active in that it is included in the
				    DKIM-Signature header field.  (Previous
				    implementations included the reporting
				    address in the DKIM key record, which is
				    not queried for certain failure cases.
				    This meant, for full reporting, that the
				    key record had to be retrieved even when
				    it was not otherwise necessary.) </t>

				<t> The request is confirmed by the presence
				    of a corresponding TXT record in the DNS,
				    since the Signer thus provides the
				    parameters required to construct and send
				    the report.  This means a malicious
				    Signer cannot falsely assert that someone
				    else wants failure reports.  It can cause
				    additional DNS traffic against the domain
				    listed in the "rd=" signature tag, but
				    negative caching of the requested DNS
				    record will help to mitigate this
				    issue. </t>

				<t> It is not possible for a Signer to direct
				    reports to an email address outside of its
				    own domain, preventing distributed
				    email-based denial-of-service attacks. </t>
			    </list></t>

	<section anchor="dkim-adsp-update"
	         title="Optional Reporting Address for DKIM-ADSP">
		<t> There also exist cases in which a domain name owner
		    employing <xref target="ADSP"/>

		    such mechanism defined. </t>

		<t> This document adds the following optional "tags"

			    time-sensitive information. </t>

			<t> In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is
			    often suggested that report generators only create
			    these (or any) ARF reports after an out-of-band
			    arrangement has been made between two parties.
			    This mechanism then becomes a way to adjust
			    parameters of an authorized abuse report feedback
			    loop that is configured and activated by private
			    agreement rather than starting to send them
			    automatically based solely on data found in
			    the DKIM signatures, which could have been
			    fraudulently inserted. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="multiple-incidents"
		         title="Reporting Multiple Incidents">
			<t> If it is known that a particular host generates
			    abuse reports upon certain incidents, an attacker
			    could forge a high volume of messages that will
			    trigger such a report.  The recipient of the
			    report could then be innundated with reports.
			    This could easily be extended to a distributed
			    denial-of-service attack by finding a number of
			    report-generating servers. </t>

			<t> The incident count referenced in
			    <xref target="ARF"/> provides
			    a limited form of mitigation.  The host
			    generating reports may elect to send reports only
			    periodically, with each report representing a
			    number of identical or near-identical incidents.
			    One might even do something inverse-exponentially,
			    sending reports for each of the first ten
			    incidents, then every tenth incident up to 100,
			    then every 100th incident up to 1000, etc.
			    until some period of relative quiet after which
			    the limitation resets. </t>

			<t> The use of this for "near-identical" incidents
			    in particular causes a degradation in reporting
			    quality, however.  If for example a large number
			    of pieces of spam arrive from one attacker,
			    a reporting agent may decide only to send a
			    report about a fraction of those messages.
			    While this averts a flood of reports to a
			    system administrator, the precise details of
			    each incident are similarly not sent. </t>
