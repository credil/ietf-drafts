    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>This document defines the characteristics, technical assignment and registration requirements for Centrally Assigned Local IPv6 addresses in the framework defined in <xref target="ULA" pageno="false" format="default" />.  There are organizations looking for address space that is independent of the ranges used for public Internet routing, yet they also need the uniqueness of central assignment which the locally assigned ULA block cannot provide.  A stumbling block in earlier attempts at defining the Centrally Allocated portion of the ULA prefix range (ULA-C) was the lack of public policy at the RIR's for organizations to acquire PI address prefixes, so the ULA-C effort was seen as an end-run around the public policy process.  As the ability to acquire PI space is now resolved by assignment policy, it is time to resurrect the definition for the lower half of the ULA prefix range. At the same time, this document will defer as much policy as possible, and focus on technical definition. To make the range useful to a wide range of organizations, the requirements to register a ULA-C prefix should be less stringent than the requirements to acquire a PI prefix, but non-trivial and sufficient to keep them from becoming an attractive nuisance to bypass PI policy. For the sake of policy continuity the IAB should strongly consider organizatoinal alignment for the managemnet of the ULA-C prefix with that for globally routable prefixes.<xref target="NUMBERS" pageno="false" format="default" /></t>
      <t>In any case, the prefixes defined here are not expected to appear in the routing system for the global Internet.  A frequent question is how this prefix differs from a PI assignment. The simple answer is in expectation of global public routability.  A PI assignment has the expectation that it could appear in the global DFZ, where a ULA-C registration is expected to be limited reach as service providers are free to, and expected to filter the entire FC00::/7 prefix as bogon space.  Recognizing that this is a policy statement; the appropriate use of these prefixes is within a single network administration, or between privately interconnected networks that want to ensure that private communications do not accidentally get routed over the public Internet as might happen with PI.</t>
      <t>Centrally registered Local IPv6 unicast addresses have the following characteristics:<figure title="" suppress-title="false" align="left" alt="" width="70%" height=""><artwork xml:space="preserve" name="" type="" align="left" alt="" width="" height="">

      <t>Where the Unique Local Address prefixes defined in <xref target="ULA" pageno="false" format="default" />were probabilistically unique, the major difference between those and the Centrally Allocated local address prefixes defined in this document is that the ULA-C prefixes are registered and verified unique before assignment, with the registrations escrowed to resolve any disputes regarding duplicate assignments.</t>
      <t>It is expected that network administrators of larger organizations, or those with business practice or governmental requirements to avoid conflict in future mergers or acquisitions will prefer central assignments, while most small or disconnected organizations will prefer local assignments.  It is recommended that network administrations which are planning to use Local IPv6 address prefixes, for extensive inter-site communication over a long period of time, use a Centrally Allocated prefix as there is no possibility of assignment conflicts when interconnecting or merging networks.  Individual administrations are free to choose either approach, and in fact may choose both, with a Centrally Allocated prefix for their production networks while using locally allocated prefixes in their experimental or lab networks. </t>

      <section title="DNS Issues" toc="default">
        <t>Given their inherent uniqueness, AAAA and PTR records for centrally assigned local IPv6 addresses may be installed and appear in the global DNS.  This may be useful if these addresses are being used for site to site or VPN style applications, or for sites that wish to avoid separate or split-DNS systems for inside and outside traffic.  Any operational issues relating to this are beyond the scope of this document.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Routing Considerations" toc="default">
        <t>Section 4.1 of <xref target="ULA" pageno="false" format="default" />provides operational guidelines that inhibit default routing of local addresses between sites.  During the initial attempts at defining the ULA-C space, concerns were raised to the IPv6 working group and to the IETF as a whole that lacking an alternative, sites would attempt to use local address prefixes as globally routed, provider-independent (PI) prefixes.  Subsequent policy changes have mitigated these concerns by allowing for PI assignments.  This section describes why using local addresses in place of PI prefixes is unadvisable, and why existing RIR mechanisms for acquiring PI prefix blocks should be used instead.</t>
        <section title="From the standpoint of the Internet" toc="default">
          <t>IPv6 unicast addresses are designed to be routed hierarchically down to physical subnet (link) level and only have to be flat-routed within the physical subnet prefix.  Attempting to use IPv6 local address prefixes publicly would result in them being flat-routed over the wide area Internet, and thus a larger routing table.  This contravenes the operational assumption that for global public routing, long prefixes will be aggregated into fewer short prefixes to limit the table size and convergence time of the routing protocol.  </t>
          <t>Collecting all local-use prefixes under one short designator prefix (FC00::/7) simplifies the development and maintenance of bogon route filters.  Given that everything registered under the procedures defined in this document are intended for local, non-public use only, it is expected to be common practice for all public service providers to filter any prefixes within the entire ULA range (both centrally registered and locally defined), and remove them from the public global routing table.  The alternative would be to enumerate every prefix that should not be publicly routed, and then hope that there are no operational errors that inadvertently allow a private prefix to be propagated publically. </t>
          <t>Entities wishing to use IPv6 Provider Independent Addresses (PI
Space) in such larger routing contexts should consult the Regional
Internet Registries policies relating to the assignment of PI Space
[RIR-PI].
</t>
        </section>
        <section title="From the Standpoint of a local network administrator" toc="default">
          <t>The operational guidelines regarding routing of centrally allocated
local addresses is that such address prefixes should be readily
routed within a site or comparable administrative routing domain.</t>
          <t>By default, such prefixes should not be announced beyond such a local scope, due to the non-aggregateability of these prefixes within the global routing system and the potential negative impact on the total size of the routing space in large scale Internet environments.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>Local IPv6 address prefixes do not provide any inherent security to the nodes that use them.  They may be used with filters at site boundaries to keep Local IPv6 traffic inside of the site, but this is no more or less secure than filtering any other type of global IPv6 unicast address prefixes.</t>
      <t>They should be filtered by public network operators to ensure that publicly routed prefixes are publicly documented, but beyond accountability there is no security aspect related to propagating the route.  On the other hand, the lack of a public routing entry is considered by many to be one layer in a defense-in-depth strategy, so widespread practice of filtering the entire ULA prefix range would automatically provide that layer even for sites that don't implement an explicit filter of their own.</t>
      <t>Local IPv6 address prefixes do allow for address-based security mechanisms, including IPSEC, across end to end VPN connections or other private interconnects.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="IANA Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>The IAB is expected to instruct IANA to designate an assignment authority for Centrally Allocated Unique Local IPv6 unicast address prefixes.  This assignment authority shall comply with the requirements described in Section 3.2 of this document, including in particular assignment on a permanent basis and with sufficient provisions to avoid hoarding of numbers.  The IAB MAY instruct IANA to designate itself as the assignment and registration authority, and IANA in turn MAY choose to delegate the day-to-day operational functions to the same organizations that handle publicly routed prefixes to maintain consistency between assignment policies.</t>
      <t>The designated assignment authority is required to document how they will meet the requirements described in Section 3.2 of this document in an RFC, which will be shepherd through the IETF by the IAB.</t>

            <t>Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), specifies its normal structure and summarizes information useful for its implementation. NTP provides the mechanisms to synchronize time and coordinate time distribution in a large, diverse internet operating at rates from mundane to lightwave. It uses a returnable-time design in which a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical-master-slave configuration synchronizes local clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or radio. The servers can also redistribute reference time via local routing algorithms and time daemons.</t>
