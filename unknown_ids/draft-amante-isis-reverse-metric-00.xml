      <t>
	This document describes an improved IS-IS neighbor management
	scheme which can be used to enhance network performance by
	allowing operators to quickly and accurately shift traffic away from
	a point-to-point or multi-access LAN interface by allowing one IS-IS
	router to signal to a second, adjacent IS-IS neighbor to adjust its
	IS-IS metric that should be used to temporarily reach the first
	IS-IS router during network maintenance events.

    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The IS-IS <xref target='ISO 10589'/> routing protocol has been
	widely used in Internet Service Provider IP/MPLS networks.
	Operational experience with the protocol, combined with ever
	increasing requirements for lossless operations have demonstrated
	some operational issues.  This document describes one issue and
	a new mechanism for improving it.
      </t>
      <section anchor="link-isolation" title="Link Isolation Challenges">
	<t>
	  During network maintenance events, operators substantially
	  increase the IS-IS metric simultaneously on both devices attached
	  to the same link.  In doing so, the devices generate new
	  Link State Protocol Data Units (LSP's) that are flooded throughout
	  the network and cause all routers to gradually shift traffic onto
	  alternate paths with very little, to no, disruption to in-flight
	  communications by applications or end-users.  When performed
	  successfully, this allows the operator to confidently perform
	  disruptive fault diagnosis and restoration on a link without
	  disturbing ongoing communications in the network.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The challenge with the above solution are as follows.  First, it is
	  quite common to have routers with several hundred interfaces
	  onboard and individual interfaces that are transferring several
	  hundred Gigabits/second to Terabits/second of traffic.  Thus, it is
	  imperative that operators accurately identify the same point-to-point
	  link on two, separate devices in order to increase (and, afterward,
	  decrease) the IS-IS metric appropriately.  Second, the aforementioned
	  solution is very time consuming and even more error-prone to perform
	  when its necessary to temporarily remove a multi-access LAN from the
	  network topology.  Specifically, the operator needs to configure ALL
	  devices's that have interfaces attached to the multi-access LAN with
	  an appropriately high IS-IS metric, (and then decrease the IS-IS metric
	  to its original value afterward).  Finally, with respect to
	  multi-access LAN's, there is currently no method to bidirectionally
	  isolate only a single node's interface on the LAN when performed
	  more fine-grained diagnosis and repairs to the multi-access LAN.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In theory, use of a Network Management System (NMS) could improve the
	  accuracy of identifying the appropriate subset of routers attached to
	  either a point-to-point link or a multi-access LAN as well as
	  signaling from the NMS to those devices, using a network management
	  protocol, to adjust the IS-IS metrics on the pertinent set of
	  interfaces.  The reality is that NMS are, to a very large extent, not
	  used within Service Provider's networks for a variety of reasons.  In
	  particular, NMS do not interoperate very well across different vendors
	  or even separate platform families within the same vendor.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The risks of misidentifying one side of a point-to-point link or
	  one or more interfaces attached to a multi-access LAN and
	  subsequently increasing its IS-IS metric are potentially increased
	  latency, jitter or packet loss.  This is unacceptable given the
	  necessary performance requirements for a variety of applications, the
	  customer perception for near lossless operations and the associated,
	  demanding Service Level Agreement's (SLA's) for all network services.

      <t>
	This document proposes that the routing protocol itself be the
	transport mechanism to allow one IS-IS router to advertise to an
	adjacent node on a point-to-point or multi-access LAN link a "reverse
	metric" in a IS-IS Hello (IIH) PDU.  This would allow an operator to
	only configure a single router, set a "reverse metric" on a link and
	have traffic bidirectionally shift away from that link gracefully
	to alternate, viable paths.

	The Reverse Metric TLV Type is TBD.  Please refer to IANA Considerations,
	in <xref target='IANA'/>, for more details.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	The Metric field contains a 24-bit unsigned integer equal to the
	IS-IS metric a neighbor SHOULD set in its own IS Neighbors
	TLV or Extended IS Reachability TLV for point-to-point links, or
	Pseudonode LSP by the Designated Intermediate System (DIS) for 
	multi-access LAN's, back toward the router that originated this
	Reverse Metric TLV.  An IS-IS neighbor MUST overwrite the existing
	IS-IS metric, in its corresponding IS Neighbors, Extended IS
	Reachability TLV or Pseudonode LSP, with the value it received in
	the Metric field of the Reverse Metric TLV.
      </t>
      <t>
	The Metric field may be a "default metric", in the range of 0-63, or
	a "Traffic Engineering Default Metric" <xref target='RFC5305'/>, in the
	range of 0-2^(24-1) depending on the configuration of router's interface
	that is originating the Reverse Metric TLV.  It is RECOMMENDED that
	implementations, by default, place the appropriate maximum default
	metric value, 63 or 2^(24-1), in the Metric field of the Reverse Metric
	TLV, since the most common use is to remove the link from the topology,
	except for use as a last-resort path.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	There is currently only two Flag bits defined.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	W bit (0x01): The "Whole LAN" bit is only used in the context of
	multi-access LAN's.  When a Reverse Metric TLV is transmitted from a
	(non-DIS) node to the DIS, if the "Whole LAN" bit is set (1), then a
	DIS MUST replace the IS-IS metric for all nodes in the Pseudonode LSP
	with the Metric value received in the Reverse Metric TLV.  If the
	"Whole LAN" bit is not set (0), then a DIS MUST replace the IS-IS
	metric in the Pseudonode LSP for just the node from whom the
	Reverse Metric TLV was received.  Please refer to the Elements of
	Procedure, in <xref target="procedure-elements"/>, for
	additional details.  In addition, the W bit MUST be unset (0) when a
	Reverse Metric TLV is transmitted in a IIH PDU onto a point-to-point
	link to an IS-IS neighbor.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	S bit (0x02): The "TE sub-TLV" bit MUST be set (1) when an IS-IS router
	wishes to signal that its neighbor alter parameters contained in the
	neighbor's IPv4 and/or IPv6 Traffic Engineering "Extended IS
	Reachability TLV", as defined in <xref target='RFC5305'/> for IPv4 and
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-isis-ipv6-te"/> for IPv6.  An IS-IS router
	MUST overwrite only the subset of its own TE sub-TLV's with those
	sub-TLV's received from a neighbor in the Reverse Metric TLV.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	The S bit MUST NOT be set (0) when an IS-IS router does not have TE
	sub-TLV's that it wishes to send to its IS-IS neighbor.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	The values used for the "IPv4 Interface Address" and "IPv6 Interface
	Address" TE sub-TLV's MUST be set to all zero when sent inside a Reverse
	Metric TLV.  In addition, the "IPv4 Neighbor Address" and "IPv6
	Neighbor Address" TE sub-TLV's MUST be set to local node's interface
	address(es) that is originating a Reverse Metric TLV.

	  <t>
	A router SHOULD first update its own IS-IS metric and/or Traffic
	Engineering parameters in its IS Neighbors TLV, Extended IS Reachability
	TLV or Pseudonode LSP, then recompute its SPF tree plus corresponding
	route metrics and, lastly, flood its updated LSP's, using normal IS-IS
	mechanisms, as well as start advertising a Reverse Metric TLV in IIH's
	toward a neighbor.  A router MUST advertise a Reverse Metric TLV toward a 
	neighbor only for the period during which it wants a neighbor to 
	temporarily update its IS-IS metric or TE parameters.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	When a router receives a Reverse Metric TLV it MUST immediately update
	its own IS Neighbors TLV, Extended IS Reachability TLV or Pseudonode LSP
	with the received value(s) in the Metric field or TE sub-TLV's, then
	recalculate its SPF tree and associated route metrics and, finally, flood
	its updated LSP's to other IS-IS routers.  Note that on a Multi-Access
	LAN, only the DIS SHOULD act upon information contained in a received
	Reverse Metric TLV.  All non-DIS nodes MUST silently ignore a received
	Reverse Metric TLV.  Please refer to
	<xref target="lan-procedures"/> for additional details with respect to
	Multi-Access LAN's and the Reverse Metric TLV.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	Routers that receive a Reverse Metric TLV MAY send a syslog message or
	SNMP trap, in order to assist in rapidly identifying the node in the
	network that is asserting an IS-IS metric or Traffic Engineering
	parameters different from that which is configured locally on the device.
	Routers MUST scan the Metric value and TE sub-TLV's in all subsequently
	received Reverse Metric TLV's.  If changes are observed by a receiver
	of the Reverse Metric TLV in the Metric value, number of TE
	sub-TLV's or data in the TE sub-TLV's, the receiving router MUST
	update its advertised IS-IS metric or Traffic Engineering parameters
	in the appropriate TLV's, recompute its SPF tree and corresponding
	metrics to IP prefixes and, finally, flood new LSP's to other
	IS-IS routers.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	When a router stops receiving a Reverse Metric TLV it MUST immediately
	update its own IS Neighbors TLV, Extended IS Reachability TLV or
	Pseudonode LSP with the previously configured IS-IS metric value and/or
	Traffic Engineering parameters, recalculate its SPF and associated route
	metrics and flood updated LSP's within the IS-IS domain.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	It is RECOMMENDED that implementations provide a capability to disable
	any changes to a node's default metric or Traffic Engineering
	parameters based upon receipt of properly formatted Reverse Metric TLV's.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	If the router does not understand the Reverse Metric TLV or is
	explicitly configured to ignore received Reverse Metric TLV's, then it
	will not update nor flood a new IS Neighbors TLV, Extended IS
	Reachability TLV or Pseudonode LSP and should not recompute its SPF
	tree or update metrics associated with corresponding routes.
	  </t>
	<section anchor="lan-procedures"
             title="Multi-Access LAN Procedures">
	  <t>
	In the case of multi-access LAN's, the "W" Flags bit is used to
	signal from a non-DIS to the DIS whether to change the metric and/or
	Traffic Engineering parameters for all nodes in the Pseudonode LSP or
	a single node on the LAN, (the originator of the Reverse Metric TLV).
	  </t>
	  <t>
	A non-DIS node, i.e.: Router B, attached to a multi-access LAN will
	send a Reverse Metric TLV with the W bit set to 0 to the DIS, when
	Router B wishes the DIS to replace the metric and/or TE parameters
	contained in the Pseudonode LSP specific to just Router B.  Other
	non-DIS nodes, i.e.: Routers C and D, may simultaneously send a Reverse
	Metric TLV with the W bit set to 0 to request the DIS replace their
	respective metric and/or TE parameters contained in the Pseudonode LSP.
	When the DIS receives a properly formatted Reverse Metric TLV with the
	W bit set to 0, the DIS MUST only change the metric and/or
	TE parameters contained in its Pseudonode LSP for the specific neighbor
	that sent the Reverse Metric TLV.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	It is possible for one node, Router A, to signal to the DIS with the
	W bit set to 1, in which case the DIS would replace the metric and/or
	TE parameters for all neighbor adjacencies in the Pseudonode LSP with
	the Metric value in the Reverse Metric TLV and transmit a new Pseudonode
	LSP to all nodes in the IS-IS domain.  Later, a second node on the LAN,
	Router B, could signal to the DIS with the W bit also set to 1.  In this
	case, the DIS MUST use the Reverse Metric TLV Value field(s) advertised
	by the router with highest MAC address of the two routers from which it
	received a Reverse Metric TLV, Router A or B.  If Router B's MAC address
	was highest, then the DIS MUST update the metric and/or Traffic
	Engineering parameters for all neighbors in its Pseudonode LSP and flood
	the LSP to all nodes in the IS-IS domain.  On the other hand, if Router
	A's MAC address was highest the DIS will ignore Router B's Reverse
	Metric TLV and continue to use Router A's Reverse Metric TLV Value
	field(s) for all neighbors in the Pseudonode LSP.  When this occurs, the
	DIS MAY send a single syslog message or SNMP trap indicating that it has
	received a Reverse Metric TLV from a neighbor, but is ignoring it due to
	it being received from a neighbor with a lower MAC address.
      </t>
	  <t>
	Another scenario is that one node, Router A, may signal the DIS with
	the W bit set to 1.  The DIS would update the metric for all
	neighbors in the Pseudonode LSP and flood the LSP.  Later, a second node
	on the LAN, Router B, could signal the DIS with the W bit set to 0,
	which indicates to the DIS that Router B is requesting the DIS only
	update the metric and/or TE parameters for Router B in the Pseudonode
	LSP.  The DIS MUST honor a neighbor's Reverse Metric TLV to update its
	individual IS-IS metric and/or TE parameters in the Pseudonode LSP even
	if the DIS receives prior or later requests to assert a Whole LAN metric
	or TE parameter(s) change from other nodes on the same LAN.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	Local configuration on the DIS to adjust the default metric(s)
	contained in the Pseudonode LSP, as documented in
	<xref target="I-D.shen-isis-oper-enhance"/> MUST take precedence over
	received Reverse Metric TLV's.

    <section anchor="example-use-case"
             title="Reverse Metric TLV Example Use Case">

	  <t>
	The following is a brief example illustrating one use case of the Reverse
	Metric TLV.  In order to isolate a point-to-point link from the IS-IS
	network, an operator would configure one router, Router A, attached to a
	point-to-point link with a "Reverse Metric".  This should not affect
	the configuration of the existing IS-IS default metric previously
	configured on the router's interface.  Assuming Router A is using
	IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering <xref target='RFC5305'/>, this
	should trigger Router A to update its Traffic Engineering Default Metric
	sub-TLV in its own Extended IS Reachability TLV, recompute its SPF tree
	and corresponding metrics to IP prefixes in the IS-IS domain and begin
	the process of flooding a new LSP throughout the network.  Router A would
	also begin transmitting a Reverse Metric TLV, with an appropriate Metric
	value, in an IIH PDU, to its adjacent neighbor, Router B.  Upon receipt
	of the Reverse Metric TLV, Router B would also update its Traffic
	Engineering Default Metric sub-TLV with the received Metric value in
	the Reverse Metric TLV, recalculate its SPF tree and associated route
	topology as well as start flooding a new LSP containing the updated
	Extended IS Reachability TLV throughout the network.  As nodes in the
	network receive the associated LSP's from Router A and B and recalculate
	a new SPF tree, and route topology, traffic should gracefully shift onto
	alternate paths away from the A-B link; ultimately, after all nodes in
	the network recompute their SPF tree link A-B should only be used
	as a link of last-resort.  The operator can inspect traffic counters on
	the A-B interface to determine if the link was successfully isolated
	from the topology and proceed with necessary fault diagnosis or
	maintenance of the associated link.
	   </t>
	   <t>
	When the maintenance activity is complete, the operator would remove
	the reverse metric configuration from Router A, which would cease
	advertisement of the Reverse Metric TLV in IIH PDU's to Router B.
	Both routers would revert to their originally configured IS-IS
	metric, recompute new SPF trees and corresponding metrics to IP prefixes
	and originate new LSP's.  As the new LSP's are received and
	SPF is recalculated by nodes in the IS-IS domain, traffic should
	gradually shift back onto link A-B.
