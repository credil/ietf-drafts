Abstract

   Many Service Providers (SPs) offer Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   services to their customers using a technique in which Customer Edge
   (CE) routers are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers.  The
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's
   routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the
   provider's backbone.  This is known as a "BGP/MPLS IP VPN".
   Originally only IPv4 was supported and it was later extended to
   support IPv6 VPNs as well.  Extensions were later added for the
   support of the Open Shortest Path First protocol version 2 (OSPFv2)
   as a PE-CE routing protocol for the IPv4 VPNs.  This document extends
   those specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE
   routing protocol.  The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to
   that of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


1.  Introduction

   [rfc4364] offers Service Providers (SPs) a method for providing
   Layer-3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to subtending customer
   networks.  Using the procedures defined in [rfc4364], provider edge
   (PE) routers separate customer VPN routing information into Virtual
   Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables.  The Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP) is used to disseminate customer network VPN routes between PE
   VRFs configured in the same VPN.

   The initial BGP/MPLS IP VPN specification enabled PE routers to learn
   routes within customer sites through static routing, or through a
   dynamic routing protocol instantiated on the PE-CE link.
   Specifically, [rfc4364] (and its predecessor, [rfc2547]) included
   support for dynamic routing protocols such as BGP, RIP, and OSPFv2.
   The OSPFv2 as the Provider/Customer Edge Protocol for BGP/MPLS IP
   Virtual Private Networks specification [rfc4577] further updates the
   operation of OSPFv2 as the PE-CE routing protocol by detailing
   additional extensions to enable intra-domain routing connectivity
   between OSPFv2-based customer sites.

   While [rfc4364] was defined for IPv4 based networks, [rfc4659]
   extends the BGP/MPLS IP VPN framework to support IPv6 VPNs.  This
   includes the capability to connect IPv6 based sites over an IPv4 or
   IPv6 SP backbone.  It is expected that OSPFv3 will be used as the IGP
   for some IPv6 VPNs just as the OSPFv2 was used for IPv4 VPNs.  The
   advantages of using OSPFv3 as a PE-CE protocol are the same as for
   the IPv4 VPN deployment.

   This document defines the mechanisms required to enable the operation
   of OSPFv3 as the PE-CE Routing Protocol in BGP MPLS/IP VPNs.  In
   doing so, it reuses, and extends where necessary, the "BGP/MPLS IP
   VPN" method for IPv6 VPNs defined in [rfc4659], and OSPFv2 as the
   PE-CE routing protocol defined in [rfc4577].  This document also
   includes the specifications for maintaining intra-domain routing
   connectivity between OSPFv3-based customer sites across a SP
   backbone.

   We presuppose familiarity with the contents of [rfc4364], [rfc4659],
   [rfc4577], [rfc4576], [rfc5340] and [rfc2328].

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements

   The benefits and considerations associated with deploying OSPFv3 as
   the PE-CE routing protocol are similar to those described in
   [rfc4577].  The requirements described in Section 3 of [rfc4577]
   remain semantically identical for the deployment of OSPFv3.

   [rfc5340] describes the modifications required to OSPF to support
   IPv6.  In that specification, many of the fundamental mechanisms
   associated with OSPFv2 remain unchanged for OSPFv3.  Consequently,
   the operation of OSPFv3 as the PE-CE routing protocol is very similar
   to OSPFv2 as the PE-CE protocol.

3.1.  OSPFv3 Specificities

   Section 2.0 of [rfc5340] describes differences between OSPFv3 and
   OSPFv2.  Several of these changes will require modifications to the
   architecture described in [rfc4577].  These differences and their
   corresponding impact to [rfc4577] are described below:

      New LSA types:

      For an IPv6 MPLS/VPN architecture where customers interface to
      providers through OSPFv3, traditional BGP/OSPF interactions
      specify that VPN-IPv6 reachability information redistributed into
      OSPFv3 will be expressed as an AS-External OSPFv3 LSAs.  Instead,
      it may be desirable to view these LSAs as AS-internal (inter-area-
      prefix, and intra-area-prefix) LSAs.  For the encoding of OSPFv3
      LSAs, a new OSPFv3 Route Extended Community attribute is defined
      in Section 4.4.

      Multiple instances over a link:

      OSPFv3 operates on a per-link basis as opposed to OSPFv2, which
      operates on a per-IP-subnet basis.  The support of multiple OSPFv3
      protocol instances on a link changes the architecture described in
      [rfc4577]. [rfc4577] specifies that each interface belongs to no
      more than one OSPF instance.  For OSPFv3, multiple instances can
      be established over a single interface, and associated with the
      same VRF.  To distinguish between routes originated from different
      OSPFv3 instances, an Instance ID field is carried in a newly-
      defined OSPFv3 Route Extended Community attribute.

      In addition to establishing multiple OSPFv3 instances over a
      single PE-CE link, multiple OSPFv3 instances can also be
      established across a sham link.  This enables multiple OSPFv3
      instances associated with a VRF to independently establish intra-
      area connectivity to other OSPFv3 instances attached to a remote

      PE VRF.  Support for multiple OSPFv3 instances across the sham
      link is described in Section 5.

4.  BGP/OSPFv3 Interaction Procedures for PE Routers

4.1.  VRFs and OSPFv3 Instances

   The relationship between VRFs, interfaces, and OSPFv3 instances on a
   PE router is described in the following section.

   As defined in [rfc4364], a PE router can be configured with one or
   more VRFs.  Each VRF configured on the PE corresponds to a customer
   VPN, and retains the destinations that are reachable within that VPN.
   Each VRF may be associated with one or more interfaces, which allows
   multiple sites to participate in the same VPN.  If OSPFv3 is
   instantiated on an interface associated with a VRF, the VRF will be
   populated with OSPFv3 routing information.

   As OSPFv3 supports multiple instances on a single interface, it is
   therefore possible that multiple customer sites can connect to the
   same interface of a PE router (e.g., through a layer 2 switch) using
   distinct OSPFv3 instances.  However, since a PE interface can be
   associated with only one VRF, all OSPFv3 instances running on the
   same interface MUST be associated with the same VRF.

   Since multiple OSPFv3 instances can be associated with a single VRF,
   an additional mechanism is needed to demultiplex routes across these
   instances.  When a PE supports multiple OSPFv3 instances in a VRF, a
   local Instance ID is assigned to the "link" that spans over the MPLS
   VPN backbone (PE-PE).  As specified in [rfc5340], the Instance ID has
   link-local significance only.  Therefore, the Instance IDs assigned
   to the PE-PE "link" need not be the same as the Instance IDs assigned
   to the PE-CE links.  By default, this Instance ID is set to NULL.
   The OSPFv3 Domain ID and local Instance ID associated with the MPLS
   backbone may be used to demultiplex routes for multiple instances.
   Further details on Domain IDs and Instance IDs are provided in
   Section 4.1.2.

4.1.1.  Independent OSPFv3 Instances in PEs

   Similar to [rfc4577], the PE must associate at least one OSPFv3
   instance for each OSPFv3 domain to which it attaches, and each
   instance of OSPFv3 MUST be associated with a single VRF.

   The support of multiple PE-CE OSPFv3 instances per PE interface does
   not change the paradigm that an OSPF instance can be associated with
   only a single VRF.  Furthermore, for each instance instantiated on
   the interface, the PE establishes adjacencies with corresponding CEs

   associated with the instance.  Note that although multiple instances
   may populate a common VRF, they do not leak routes to one another,
   unless configured to do so.

4.1.2.  OSPFv3 Domain and PE-PE Link Instance Identifiers

   The OSPFv3 Domain ID describes the administrative domain of the OSPF
   instance which originated the route.  It has an AS wide significance
   and is one of the parameters used to determine whether a VPN-IPv6
   route should be translated as an Inter-area-prefix-LSA or External-
   LSA.  Each OSPFv3 instance MUST have a primary Domain ID which is
   transported along with the VPN-IPv6 route in a BGP attribute over the
   MPLS VPN backbone.  Each OSPFv3 instance may have a set of secondary
   Domain IDs which applies to other OSPFv3 instances within its
   administrative domain.

   The primary Domain ID may either be configured or may be set to a
   value of NULL.  The secondary Domain IDs are only allowed if a non-
   null primary Domain ID is configured.  The Domain ID may be
   configured on a per-OSPFv3 instance basis or per-VRF.  If the Domain
   ID is configured on the VRF level, consequently all OSPFv3 instances
   associated with the VRF will share the same Domain ID.

   The OSPFv3 PE-PE "link" Instance ID has local significance for the
   PE-PE "link" over the MPLS VPN backbone within a VRF.  This link
   Instance ID is used for the support of multiple OSPFv3 instances
   within the same VRF and it is also transported along with the VPN-
   IPv6 route in a BGP attribute over the MPLS VPN backbone.  A PE-PE
   "link" Instance ID is needed only if multiple OSPFv3 instances are
   supported, otherwise it is set to NULL.  When multiple instances are
   associated with a VRF, each instance should have a unique PE-PE
   "link" Instance ID.

   The <Domain ID, Instance ID> tuple is used to determine whether an
   incoming VPN-IPv6 route belongs to the same domain as the receiving
   OSPFv3 instance.  An incoming VPN-IPv6 route is said to belong to the
   same domain if both conditions below are met

   1.  A non-NULL incoming Domain ID matches either the local primary or
       one of the secondary Domain IDs.  If the local Domain ID and
       incoming Domain ID are NULL, it is considered a match.

   2.  A non-NULL incoming Instance ID matches the local Instance ID.
       If the local Instance ID and incoming Instance ID are NULL, it is
       considered a match.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


4.2.  OSPFv3 Areas

   Sections 4.1.4 and 4.2.3 of [rfc4577] describe the characteristics of
   a PE router within an OSPFv2 domain.  The mechanisms and expected
   behavior described in [rfc4577] are applicable to an OSPFv3 domain.

4.3.  VRFs and Routes

   From the perspective of the CE, the PE appears as any other OSPFv3
   neighbor.  There is no requirement for the CE to support any
   mechanisms of IPv6 BGP/MPLS VPNs or for the CE to have any awareness
   of the VPNs, thereby enabling any OSPFv3 implementation to be used on
   a CE.

   Because the export and import policies might cause different routes
   to be installed in different VRFs of the same OSPFv3 domain, the MPLS
   VPN backbone cannot be considered as a single router from the
   perspective of the domain's CEs.  Rather, each CE should view its
   connected PE as a separate router.

   The PE uses OSPFv3 to distribute routes to CEs, and MP-BGP [rfc2858]
   to distribute VPN-IPv6 routes to other (remote) PE routers as defined
   in [rfc4659].  An IPv6 prefix installed in the VRF by OSPFv3 is
   changed to a VPN-IPv6 prefix by the addition of an 8-octet Route
   Distinguisher (RD) as discussed in Section 2 of [rfc4659].  This VPN-
   IPv6 route can then be redistributed into MP-BGP according to an
   export policy that adds a Route Target Extended Communities (RT)
   attribute to the NLRI [rfc4360].  An IPv6 Address Specific BGP
   Extended Communities attribute as described in [BGP-EXTCOMM-IPV6] may
   also be attached to the route.

   Domain IDs and Instance IDs are used to distinguish between OSPFv3
   instances.  When an OSPFv3-distributed route is redistributed into
   MP-BGP, the Domain ID, OSPFv3 Router ID, Area, OSPFv3 Route Type,
   External Route Type, Options fields, and Instance ID are also carried
   in an attribute of the MP-BGP route.

   A PE receiving a VPN-IPv6 NLRI from MP-BGP uses an import policy to
   determine, based on the RT, whether the route is eligible to be
   installed in one of its local VRFs.  The BGP decision process selects
   which of the eligible routes are to be installed in the associated
   VRF, and the selected set of VPN-IPv6 routes are converted into IPv6
   routes by removing the RD before installation.

   An IPv6 route learned from MP-BGP and installed in a VRF might or
   might not be redistributed into OSPFv3, depending on the local
   configuration.  For example, the PE might be configured to advertise
   only a default route to CEs of a particular OSPFv3 instance.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


   Further, if the route is to be redistributed into multiple OSPFv3
   instances, the route might be advertised using different LSA types in
   different instances.

   If an IPv6 route learned from MP-BGP is to be redistributed into a
   particular OSPFv3 instance, the OSPFv3 Route Extended Community
   attribute (Section 4.4) of the VPN-IPv6 route is used to determine
   whether the OSPFv3 instance from which the route was learned is the
   same as the OSPFv3 instance into which the route is to be
   redistributed.

4.3.1.  OSPFv3 Routes on PE

   VRFs may be populated by both OSPFv3 routes from a CE or VPN-IPv6
   routes from other PEs via MP-BGP.  OSPFv3 routes are installed in a
   VRF using the OSPFv3 decision process.  As described in [rfc4577],
   OSPFv2 routes installed in a VRF may be redistributed into BGP and
   disseminated to other PEs participating in the VPN.  At these remote
   PEs, the VPN-IPv6 routes may be imported into a VRF and redistributed
   into the OSPFv3 instance(s) associated with that VRF.

   As specified in [rfc4659], routes imported and exported into a VRF
   are controlled by the Route Target (RT) Extended Communities
   attribute.  OSPFv3 routes that are redistributed into BGP are given a
   RT that corresponds to the VRF.  This RT is examined at remote PEs.
   In order to import a route, a VRF must have a RT that is identical to
   the route's RT.  For routes which are eligible to be imported into
   the VRF, the standard BGP decision process is used to choose the
   "best" route(s).

   When a route is advertised from a CE to a PE via OSPFv3 and that
   route is installed in the VRF associated with the CE, the route is
   advertised to other locally attached CEs under normal OSPFv3
   procedures.

   The route is also redistributed into MP-BGP to be advertised to
   remote PEs.  The information necessary for accurate redistribution
   back into OSPFv3 by the remote PEs is carried in an OSPFv3 Route
   Extended Communities attribute (Section 4.4).  The relevant local
   OSPFv3 information encoded into the attribute is:

      The Domain ID of the local OSPFv3 process.  If no Domain ID is
      configured, the NULL identifier is used.

      The Instance ID of the PE-PE "link"

      The Area ID of the PE-CE link.

      The PE's Router ID associated with the OSPFv3 instance.

      The Route Type, as determined by the LSA type from which the route
      was learned.

      The Options fields (External metric-type)

   A Multi-Exit-Discriminator (MED) attribute SHOULD also be set to the
   value of the OSPFv3 distance associated with the route plus 1, when
   the OSPFv3 route is redistributed into the MP-BGP.

4.3.2.  VPN-IPv6 Routes Received from MP-BGP

   When a PE receives a valid VPN-IPv6 route from MP-BGP and has
   identified an association with a local VRF, it must determine:

      Whether a route to the corresponding IPv6 prefix is to be
      installed in the VRF;

      Whether the installed IPv6 route is to be redistributed to one or
      more local OSPFv3 instances; and

      What OSPFv3 LSA type is to be used when advertising the route into
      each OSPFv3 instance

   An IPv6 route derived from a received VPN-IPv6 route is not installed
   in the associated local VRF if:

      The BGP decision process identifies a better route to the
      destination NLRI

      A configured import policy prohibits the installation of the route

   The PE advertises the IPv6 route learned from MP-BGP to attached CEs
   via OSPFv3 if:

      No configured filtering prohibits redistributing the route to
      OSPFv3

      No configured policy blocks the route in favor of a less-specific
      summary route

      No OSPFv3 route to the same prefix exists in the VRF.

   The subsequent sections discuss the advertisement of routes learned
   from MP-BGP, and the rules for determining what LSA types and what
   CEs to advertise the routes to.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


   When the PE sends an LSA to a CE, it sets the DN bit in the LSA to
   prevent looping.  The DN bit is discussed in Section 4.5.1.

4.3.2.1.  OSPF Inter-Area Routes

   A PE advertises an IPv6 route using an Inter-Area-Prefix (type
   0x2003) LSA under the following circumstances:

      The OSPFv3 domain from which the IPv6 route was learned is the
      same (as determined by the <Domain ID, Instance ID> tuple) as the
      domain of the OSPFv3 instance into which it is to be
      redistributed; AND

      The IPv6 route was advertised to a remote PE in an Intra-Area-
      Prefix (type 0x2009) OR an Inter-Area-Prefix (type 0x2003) LSA.

   Note that under these rules the PE represents itself as an ABR
   regardless of whether or not the route is being advertised into the
   same area number from which the remote PE learned it (that is,
   whether the VPN-IPv6 route carries the same or different area
   numbers).

4.3.2.2.  OSPF Intra-Area Route

   A route is advertised from a PE to a CE as an intra-area route using
   an Intra-Area-Prefix (type 0x2009) LSA only when sham links are used,
   as described in Section 5.  Otherwise routes are advertised as either
   inter-area (Section 4.3.2.1) or external (Sections 4.3.2.3) routes.

4.3.2.3.  OSPF External Routes And NSSA Routes

   A PE considers an IPv6 route to be external under the following
   circumstances:

      The OSPFv3 domain from which the route was learned is different
      (as determined by the <Domain ID, Instance ID> tuple) from the
      domain of the OSPFv3 instance into which it is redistributed; OR

      The OSPFv3 domain from which the route was learned is the same as
      the domain of the OSPFv3 instance into which it is redistributed
      AND it was advertised to the remote PE in an AS-External (type
      0x4005) or a Type-7 (type 0x2007, NSSA) LSA; OR

      The route was not learned from an OSPFv3 instance

   To determine if the learned route is from a different domain, the
   <Domain ID, Instance ID> tuple associated with the VPN-IPv6 route (in
   the OSPFv3 Route Extended Communities attribute or attributes) is

   compared with the local OSPFv3 Domain ID and Instance ID, if
   configured.  Compared Domain IDs are considered identical if:

   1.  All six bytes are identical; or

   2.  Both Domain IDs are NULL (all zeroes).

   Note that if the VPN-IPv6 route does not have a Domain ID in its
   attributes, or if the local OSPFv3 instance does not have a
   configured Domain ID, in either case the route is considered to have
   a NULL Domain ID.

   An IPv6 route that is determined to be external might or might not be
   advertised to a connected CE, depending on the type of area to which
   the PE-CE link belongs and whether there is a configured policy
   restricting its advertisement.

   If there are multiple external routes to the same prefix, the
   standard OSPFv3 decision process is used to select the "best" route.

   If the external route is to be advertised and the area type of the
   PE/CE link is NSSA, the PE advertises the route in a Type-7 (type
   0x2007) LSA; otherwise the external route is advertised in an AS-
   External (type 0x4005) LSA.

   The DN bit of the LSA advertising the external route MUST be set, as
   described in Section 4.5.1.

   If the VPN-IPv6 route indicates a route type-1 metric, the PE
   advertises the external route with that metric-type; otherwise the
   metric-type of the external IPv6 route is set to type-2 by default.

4.4.  OSPFv3 Route Extended Communities Attribute

   OSPFv3 routes from one site are translated and delivered
   transparently to the remote site as BGP VPN-IPv6 routes.  The
   original OSPFv3 routes carry OSPFv3 specific information which need
   to be communicated to the remote PE to ensure transparency.  BGP
   extended communities are used to carry the needed information to
   enable the receiving side to reconstruct a database just as in the
   OSPFv2 case.

   All OSPFv3 routes added to the VRF routing table on a PE router are
   examined to create a corresponding VPN-IPv6 route in BGP.  Each of
   the OSPFv3 routes MUST have a corresponding BGP Extended Community
   Attribute which contains and preserves the OSPFv3 information
   attached to the original OSPFv3 route.

   This document defines a new BGP attribute in the proposed "IPv6
   Address Specific Extended Community" registry described in Section 3
   of [BGP-EXTCOMM-IPV6].  The OSPFv3 Route Extended Community Attribute

   OSPFv3 Router ID, OSPFv3 Area ID, OSPFv3 Route type, Options, and an

               The OSPFv3 Route Extended Community Attribute

   This attribute is MANDATORY for all OSPFv3 routes in a VRF instance
   on a PE router.  The fields of this new BGP Extended Community
   attribute are described in the following sections.

      OSPFv3 Domain IDs field : 6 bytes

      Each OSPFv3 Instance within a VRF MUST have a Domain ID.  The
      Domain ID may be configured at the VRF level or at the OSPFv3
      Instance level.  The OSPFv3 Domain ID is a 6-byte number and its
      default value if none is configured should be NULL.

      OSPFv3 Router ID field : 4 bytes

      The OSPFv3 Router ID is a 32 bit number as in OSPFv2.  This field
      is OPTIONAL and may be set to 0.

      OSPFv3 Area ID : 4 bytes

      The Area ID field indicates the 32-bit Area ID to which the route
      belongs.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


      OSPFv3 Route Types : 1 byte

      To accommodate OSPFv3 LSA types, the OSPF Route Type field is
      encoded as follows:


       Route Type  Route Type      LSA Type   Description
         Code
       -----------------------------------------------------------
         0x30     Inter-area         0x2003   Inter-area-prefix-LSA
         0x50     External           0x2005   AS-external-LSA
         0x70     NSSA               0x2007   NSSA-LSA
         0x90     Intra-area-prefix  0x2009   Intra-area-prefix-LSA


                     The OSPFv3 Route Type Field Encoding

      OSPFv3 Options : 1 byte

      The Options field indicates if the route carries a type-1 or
      type-2 metric.  Setting the least significant bit in the field
      indicates that the route carries a External type-2 metric.

      OSPFv3 Instance ID field : 1 byte

      The OSPFv3 Instance ID field is defined to carry the OSPFv3
      Instance ID which is a one-byte number.  The OSPFv3 Instance ID is
      configured for the "link" simulated by the MPLS VPN backbone.
      This attribute MAY be present whether several OSPFv3 instances are
      defined or not.  The Instance ID default value is 0.

4.5.  Loop Prevention Techniques

   In some topologies, it is possible for routing loops to occur due to
   the nature and manner of route reachability propagation.  One such
   example is the case of a dual homed CE router connected to two PEs;
   those PE routers would receive this information both through their CE
   and their peer PE.  As there is transparent transport of OSPFv3
   routes over the BGP/MPLS backbone, it is not possible for the PE
   routers to determine whether they are within a loop.

   The loop scenarios in OSPFv3 topologies are identical to those in the
   OSPFv2 topologies described in Section 4.2.5.1 and Section 4.2.5.2 of
   [rfc4577].  Of the two loop preventions mechanisms described in the
   sections aforementioned, only the DN bit option will be supported in
   the OSPFv3 implementation.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


4.5.1.  OSPFv3 Down Bit

   Section 1 and Section 3 of [rfc4576] describe the usage of the DN-bit
   for OSPFv2 and are applicable for OSPFv3 for inter-area-prefix LSAs,
   NSSA LSAs and External LSAs.  Similarly, the DN-bit must be set in
   inter-area-prefix-LSAs, NSSA-LSAs and AS-External-LSAs, when these
   are originated from a PE to a CE, to prevent those prefixes from
   being re-advertised into BGP.  As in [rfc4577], any LSA with the DN
   bit set must not be used for route calculations.

   The DN bit MUST be clear in all other LSA types.  The OSPFv3 DN-bit
   format is described in Appendix 4.1.1 of [rfc5340].

4.5.2.  Other Possible Loops

   The mechanism described in Section 4.5.1 of this document is
   sufficient to prevent looping if the DN bit information attached to a
   prefix is preserved in the OSPF domain.  As described in Section
   4.2.5.3 of [rfc4576], caution must be exercised if mutual
   redistribution is performed on a PE causing loss of loop prevention
   information.

5.  OSPFv3 Sham Links

   This section modifies the specification of OSPFv2 sham links (defined
   in Section 4.2.7 of [rfc4577]) to support OSPFv3.  Support for OSPFv3
   sham links is an OPTIONAL feature of this specification.

   A sham link enables a VPN backbone to act as an intra-area link.  It
   is needed when two sites are connected by an intra-area "backdoor"
   link and the inter-area MPLS VPN backbone route would be less
   preferable due to OSPF route preference rules.  The figure below
   shows the instantiation of a sham link between two VPN sites.



                             (VPN backbone)
        (site-1)      <-------- sham link -------->      (site-2)
         CE1 -------- PE1 -------- P ---------- PE2 -------- CE2
          |                                                   |
          |___________________________________________________|
               <------------ backdoor link -------------->
                        (OSPF intra-area link)

                                 Sham Link

   Much of the operation of sham links remains semantically identical to
   what was previously specified.  There are, however, several



Pillay-Esnault, et al.  Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


   differences that need to be defined to ensure the proper operation of
   OSPFv3 sham links.

   One of the primary differences between sham links for OSPFv3 and sham
   links as specified in [rfc4577] are for configurations where multiple
   OSPFv3 instances populate a VRF.  It may be desirable to provide
   separate intra-area links between these instances over the same sham
   link.  To achieve this, multiple OSPFv3 instances may be established
   across the PE-PE sham link to provide intra-area connectivity between
   PE-CE OSPFv3 instances.

   Note that even though multiple OSPFv3 instances may be associated
   with a VRF, a sham link is still thought of as a relation between two
   VRFs.

   Another modification to OSPFv2 sham links is that OSPFv3 sham links
   are now identified by 128-bit endpoint addresses.  Since sham links
   end-point addresses are now 128-bits, they can no longer default to
   the RouterID, which is a 32-bit number.  Sham link endpoint addresses
   MUST be configured.

   Sham link endpoint addresses MUST be distributed by BGP as routeable
   VPN IPv6 addresses whose IPv6 address prefix is 128 bits long.  As
   specified in [rfc4577], these endpoint addresses MUST NOT be
   advertised by OSPFv3.

   If there is a BGP route to the remote sham link endpoint address, the
   sham link appears to be up.  Conversely, if there is no BGP route to
   the sham link endpoint address, the sham link appears to be down.

5.1.  Creating A Sham link

   The procedures for creating an OSPFv3 sham link are identical to
   those specified in Section 4.2.7.2 of [rfc4577].  Note that the
   creation of OSPFv3 sham links requires the configuration of both
   local and remote 128-bit sham link endpoint addresses.  The local
   Sham link endpoint address associated with a VRF MAY be used by all
   OSPFv3 instances that are attached to that VRF.  The OSPFv3 PE-PE
   "link" Instance ID is used to demultiplex multiple OSPFv3 instance
   protocol packets exchanged over the sham link.

5.2.  OSPF Protocol On Sham link

   Much of the operation of OSPFv3 over a sham link is semantically the
   same as the operation of OSPFv2 over a sham link, as described in
   Section 4.2.7.3 of [rfc4577].  This includes the methodology for
   sending and receiving OSPFv3 packets over sham links, as well as
   Hello/Router Dead Intervals.  Furthermore, the procedures associated



Pillay-Esnault, et al.  Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 as a PE-CE routing protocol         March 2009


   with the assignment of sham link metrics adhere to those set forth
   for OSPFv2.  OSPFv3 sham links are treated as on demand circuits.

   Although the operation of the OSPFv3 protocol over the sham link is
   the same as OSPFv2, multiple OSPFv3 instances may be instantiated
   across this link.  By instantiating multiple instances across the
   sham link, distinct intra-area connections can be established between
   PE-PE OSPFv3 instances associated with the endpoint addresses.

   For example, if two OSPFv3 instances (O1, O2) attach to a VRF V1, and
   on a remote PE, two other OSPFv3 instances (O3, O4) attach to a VRF
   V2, it may be desirable to connect, O1 and O3 with an intra-area
   link, and O2 and O4 with an intra-area link.  This can be
   accomplished by instantiating two OSPFv3 instances across the sham
   link, which connects V1 and V2.  O1 and O3 can be mapped to one of
   the sham link OSPFv3 instances; O2 and O4 can be mapped to the other
   sham link OSPFv3 instance.

   One difference from Section 4.2.7.3 of [rfc4577] is the addition of
   Type 0x2009 intra-area-prefix LSAs, and the flooding of these LSAs
   across the sham link.  Furthermore, where prefixes associated with
   OSPFv2 sham links are advertised in Type-1 LSAs, prefixes associated
   with OSPFv3 sham links are advertised as OSPFv3 Type 0x2009 LSAs.
   This change is required based on [rfc5340], which states that
   loopback interfaces are advertised in intra-area-prefix LSAs.

5.3.  OSPF Packet Forwarding On Sham Link

   The rules associated with route redistribution, stated in Section
   4.2.7.4 of [rfc4577], remain unchanged in this specification.
   Specifically:

      If the next hop interface for a particular route is a sham link,
      then the PE SHOULD NOT redistribute that route into BGP as a VPN-
      IPv6 route.

      Any other route advertised in an LSA that is transmitted over a
      sham link MUST also be redistributed (by the PE flooding the LSA
      over the sham link) into BGP.

   When redistributing these LSAs into BGP, they are encoded with the
   OSPFv3 Route Extended Community, as defined in Section 4.4 of this
   document.

   When forwarding a packet, if the preferred route for that packet has
   the sham link as its next hop interface, then the packet MUST be
   forwarded according to the corresponding BGP route (as defined in
   [rfc4364] and [rfc4659]).

6.  Multiple Address Family Support

   The support of multiple address families (AF) in OSPFv3 is described
   in [OSPF-AF-ALT].  [OSPF-AF-ALT] differentiates between AF using
   reserved ranges of Instance IDs for each AF.

   The architecture described in this document is fully compatible with
   [OSPF-AF-ALT].  The OSPFv3 PE-CE protocol can support multiple
   address families across a MPLS VPN backbone.  All AFs redistributed
   from OSPFv3 into BGP on a PE MUST contain the OSPFv3 Route Extended
   Community Attribute.

   Note that since [OSPF-AF-ALT] does not support multiple AFs across
   virtual links, this document only addresses support for unicast IPv6
   addresses across the sham link.

7.  Security Considerations

   The extensions described in this document are specific to the use of
   OSPFv3 as the PE-CE protocol and do not introduce any concerns
   regarding the use of BGP as transport of IPv6 reachability over the
   MPLS Backbone.  The Security considerations for the transport of IPv6
   reachability information using BGP are discussed in Section 11 of
   [rfc4659] and are not altered.

   The new extensions defined in this document do not introduce any new
   security concerns other than those already defined in Section 6 of
   [rfc4577].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP attribute in the proposed "IPv6
   Address Specific Extended Community" registry described in Section 3
   of [BGP-EXTCOMM-IPV6].  This document makes the following assignments
   in the "IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community" registry.
