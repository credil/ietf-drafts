Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework                  June 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation and Background

   This document describes a framework for a Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  It presents the architectural
   framework for MPLS-TP, definining those elements of MPLS applicable
   to supporting the requirements in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements] and
   what new protocol elements are required.

   Bandwidth demand continues to grow worldwide, stimulated by the
   accelerating growth and penetration of new packet based services and
   multimedia applications:

   o  Packet-based services such as Ethernet, Voice over IP (VoIP),
      Layer 2 (L2)/Layer 3 (L3) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), IP
      Television (IPTV), Radio Access Network (RAN) backhauling, etc.,

   o  Applications with various bandwidth and Quality of Service (QoS)
      requirements.

   This growth in demand has resulted in dramatic increases in access
   rates that are, in turn, driving dramatic increases in metro and core
   network bandwidth requirements.

   Over the past two decades, the evolving optical transport
   infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET)/Synchronous
   Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network (OTN)) has
   provided carriers with a high benchmark for reliability and
   operational simplicity.  To achieve this, these existing transport
   technologies have been designed with specific characteristics :

   o  Strictly connection-oriented connectivity, which may be long-lived
      and may be provisioned manually or by network management.

   o  A high level of protection and availability.

   o  Quality of service.

   o  Extended OAM capabilities.

   Carriers are looking to evolve such transport networks to support
   packet based services and networks, and to take advantage of the
   flexibility and cost benefits of packet switching technology.  While
   MPLS is a maturing packet technology that is already playing an
   important role in transport networks and services, not all of MPLS's
   capabilities and mechanisms are needed and/or consistent with
   transport network operations.  There are also transport technology

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework                  June 2009


   characteristics that are not currently reflected in MPLS.

   The types of packet transport services delivered by transport
   networks are very similar to Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks defined
   by the IETF.

   There are thus two objectives for MPLS-TP:

   1.  To enable MPLS to be deployed in a transport network and operated
       in a similar manner to existing transport technologies.

   2.  To enable MPLS to support packet transport services with a
       similar degree of predictability to that found in existing
       transport networks.

   In order to achieve these objectives, there is a need to create a
   common set of new functions that are applicable to both MPLS networks
   in general, and those blonging to the MPLS-TP profile.

   MPLS-TP therefore defines a profile of MPLS targeted at transport
   applications and networks.  This profile specifies the specific MPLS
   characteristics and extensions required to meet transport
   requirements.  An equipment conforming to MPLS-TP MUST support this
   profile.  An MPLS-TP conformant equipment MAY support additional MPLS
   features.  A carrier may deploy some of those additional features in
   the transport layer of their network if they find them to be
   beneficial.

1.2.  Applicability

   Figure 1 illustrates the range of services that MPLS-TP is intended
   to address.  MPLS-TP is intended to support a range of layer 1, layer
   2 and layer 3 services, and is not limited to layer 3 services only.
   Networks implementing MPLS-TP may choose to only support a subset of
   these services.

                      Figure 1: MPLS-TP Applicability

   The diagram above shows the spectrum of services that can be
   supported by MPLS.  MPLS-TP solutions are primarily intended for
   packet transport applications.  These can be deployed using a profile
   of MPLS that is strictly connection oriented and does not rely on IP
   forwarding or routing (shown on the right hand side of the figure),
   or in conjunction with an MPLS network that does use IP forwarding
   and that supports a broader range of IP services.  This is the multi-
   service solution in the centre of the figure.

1.3.  Scope

   This document describes a framework for a Tranport Profile of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP).  It presents the
   architectural framework for MPLS-TP, definining those elements of
   MPLS applicable to supporting the requirements in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements] and what new protocol elements are
   required.

   This document describes the architecture for MPLS-TP when the LSP
   client is a PW.  The transport of IP and MPLS, other than carried
   over a PW, is outside the scope of this document.  This does not
   preclude the use of LSPs conforming to the MPLS transport profile
   from being used to carry IP or other MPLS LSPs by general purpose
   MPLS networks.

2.  Introduction to Requirements

   The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements], [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements],
   and [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req].  This section provides a brief
   reminder to guide the reader.  It is not intended as a substitute for
   these documents.

   MPLS-TP MUST NOT modify the MPLS forwarding architecture and MUST be
   based on existing pseudowire and LSP constructs.  Any new mechanisms
   and capabilities added to support transport networks and packet
   transport services must be able to interoperate with existing MPLS
   and pseudowire control and forwarding planes.

   Point to point LSPs MAY be unidirectional or bi-directional, and it
   MUST be possible to construct congruent Bi-directional LSPs.  Point
   to multipoint LSPs are unidirectional.

   MPLS-TP LSPs do not merge with other LSPs at an MPLS-TP LSR and it
   MUST be possible to detect if a merged LSP has been created.

   It MUST be possible to forward packets solely based on switching the
   MPLS or PW label.  It MUST also be possible to establish and maintain
   LSPs and/or pseudowires both in the absence or presence of a dynamic
   control plane.  When static provisioning is used, there MUST be no
   dependency on dynamic routing or signaling.

   OAM, protection and forwarding of data packets MUST be able to
   operate without IP forwarding support.

   It MUST be possible to monitor LSPs and pseudowires through the use
   of OAM in the absence of control plane or routing functions.  In this
   case information gained from the OAM functions is used to initiate
   path recovery actions at either the PW or LSP layers.

3.  Transport Profile Overview

3.1.  Packet Transport Services

   The types of packet transport services provided by existing transport
   networks are similar to MPLS Layer 2 VPNs.  A key characteristic of
   packet transport services is that the network used to provide the
   service does not participate in the any IP routing protocols present
   in the client, or use the IP addresses in client packets to forward
   those packets.  The network is therefore transparent to IP in the
   client service.

   MPLS-TP MUST use one of the Layer 2 VPN services defined in [PPVPN
   architecture] to provide a packet transport service.

   MPLS-TP LSPs MAY also be used to transport traffic for which the
   immediate client of the MPLS-TP LSP is not a Layer 2 VPN.  However,
   for the purposes of this document, we do not refer to these traffic
   types as belonging to a packet transport service.  Such clients
   include IP and MPLS LSPs.

3.2.  Architecture

   The architecture for a transport profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) is based
   on the MPLS [RFC3031], pseudowire [RFC3985], and multi-segment
   pseudowire [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch] architectures, as illustrated
   in Figure 2.

   Section 3.3.

   This document describes the architecture for MPLS-TP when the LSP
   client is a PW.  The transport of IP and MPLS, other than carried
   over a PW, is outside the scope of this document.  This does not
   preclude the use of LSPs conforming to the MPLS transport profile
   from being used to carry IP or other MPLS LSPs by general purpose
   MPLS networks.  LSP hierarchy MAY be used within the MPLS-TP network,
   so that more than one LSP label MAY appear in the label stack.

        Figure 3: Domain of MPLS-TP Layer Network using Pseudowires

   Figure (Figure 3) illustrates the protocol stack to be used when
   pseudowires are carried over MPLS-TP LSPs.

   When providing a VPWS, VPLS, VPMS or IPLS, pseudowires MUST be used
   to carry a client service.  For compatibility with transport
   nomenclature, the PW may be referred to as the MPLS-TP Channel and
   the LSP may be referred to as the MPLS-TP Path.

   Note that in MPLS-TP environments where IP is used for control or OAM
   purposes, IP MAY be carried over the LSP demultiplexers as per
   RFC3031 [RFC3031], or directly over the server.

   PW OAM, PSN OAM and PW client data are mutually exclusive and never
   exist in the same packet.

   The MPLS-TP definition applies to the following two domains:

   o  MPLS-TP Forwarding Domain

   o  MPLS-TP Transport Domain

3.3.  MPLS-TP Forwarding Domain

   A set of client-to-MPLS-TP adaptation functions interface the client
   to MPLS-TP.  For pseudowires, this adaptation function is the PW
   forwarder shown in Figure 4a of [RFC3985].  The PW label is used for
   forwarding in this case and is always at the bottom of the label
   stack.  The operation of the MPLS-TP network is independent of the
   payload carried by the MPLS-TP PW packet.

   MPLS-TP is itself a client of an underlying server layer.  MPLS-TP is
   thus bounded by a set of adaptation functions to this server layer
   network.  These adaptation functions provide encapsulation of the
   MPLS-TP frames and for the transparent transport of those frames over
   the server layer network.  The MPLS-TP client inherits its QoS from
   the MPLS-TP network, which in turn inherits its QoS from the server
   layer.  The server layer must therefore provide the neccesary Quality
   of Service (QoS) to ensure that the MPLS-TP client QoS commitments
   are satisfied.

   MPLS-TP LSPs use the MPLS label switching operations defined in
   [RFC3031].  These operations are highly optimized for performance and
   are not modified by the MPLS-TP profile.

   During forwarding a label is pushed to associate a forwarding
   equivalence class (FEC) with the LSP or PW.  This specifies the
   processing operaton to be performed by the next hop at that level of
   encapsulation.  A swap of this label is an atomic operation in which
   the contents of the packet after the swapped label are opaque to the
   forwarder.  The only event that interrupts a swap operation is TTL
   expiry, in which case the packet may be inspected and either
   discarded or subjected to further processing within the LSR.  TTL
   expiry causes an exception which forces a packet to be further
   inspected and processed.  While this occurs, the forwarding of
   succeeding packets continues without interruption.  Therefore, the
   only way to cause a P (intermediate) LSR to inspect a packet (for
   example for OAM purposes) is to set the TTL to expire at that LSR.

   MPLS-TP PWs support the PW and MS-PW forwarding operations defined
   in[RFC3985] and [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch].

   The Traffic Class field (formerly the MPLS EXP field) follows the
   definition and processing rules of [RFC5462] and [RFC3270].  Only the
   pipe and short-pipe models are supported in MPLS-TP.

   The MPLS encapsulation format is as defined in RFC 3032[RFC3032].
   Per-platform label space is used for PWs.  Either per-platform or
   per-interface label space may be used for LSPs.

   Point to point MPLS-TP LSPs can be either unidirectional or
   bidirectional.  Point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP LSPs are unidirectional.
   Point-to-multipont PWs are currently being defined in the IETF and
   may be incorporated in MPLS-TP if required.

   It MUST be possible to configure an MPLS-TP LSP such that the forward
   and backward directions of a bidirectional MPLS-TP LSP are co-routed
   i.e. they follow the same path.  The pairing relationship between the
   forward and the backward directions must be known at each LSR or LER
   on a bidirectional LSP.

   Per-packet equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing is not
   applicable to MPLS-TP LSPs.

   Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is disabled on MPLS-TP LSPs by default.

   Both E-LSP and L-LSP are supported in MPLS-TP, as defined in RFC 3270
   [RFC3270]

3.4.  MPLS-TP Transport Domain

   This document specifies the architecture when the client of the
   MPLS-TP LSP is a PW.  Note, however, that in MPLS-TP environments
   where IP is used for control or OAM purposes, IP MAY be carried over
   the the LSPs or directly over the server, as described in
   Section 3.2.  In this case, the MPLS-TP transport domain consists of
   the PW encapsulation mechanisms, including the PW control word.

3.5.  Addressing

   Editor's note: This section will be updated after publication of the
   MPLS-TP Addressing Architecture draft.

   MPLS-TP distinguishes between adressing used to identify nodes in the
   network, and identifiers used for demultiplexing and forwarding.
   This distinction is illustrated in Figure 4.

                      Figure 4: Addressing in MPLS-TP

   Editor's note: The figure above arose from discussions in the MPLS-TP
   design team.  It will be clarified in a future verson of this draft.

   IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are used to identify MPLS-TP nodes by default
   for network management and signaling purposes.

   In the forwarding plane, identfiers are required for the service
   context (provided by the FEC), and for OAM.  OAM requires both a
   demultiplexer and an address for the source of the OAM packet.

   For MPLS in general where IP addressing is used, IPv4 or IPv6 is used
   by default.  However, MPLS-TP must be able to operate in environments
   where IP is not used in the forwarding plane.  Therefore, the default
   mechanism for OAM demultiplexing in MPLS-TP LSPs and PWs is the
   generic associated channel.  Forwarding based on IP addresses for
   user or OAM packets is NOT REQUIRED for MPLS-TP.

   RFC 4379 [RFC4379]and BFD for MPLS LSPs [I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls] have
   defined alert mechanisms that enable a MPLS LSR to identify and
   process MPLS OAM packets when the OAM packets are encapsulated in an
   IP header.  These alert mechanisms are based on TTL expiration and/or
   use an IP destination address in the range 127/8.  These mechanisms
   are the default mechanisms for MPLS networks in general for

   identifying MPLS OAM packets when the OAM packets are encapsulated in
   an IP header.  MPLS-TP must not rely on these mechanisms, and thus
   relies on the GACH/GAL to demultiplex OAM packets.

3.6.  Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)

   MPLS-TP supports a comprehensive set of OAM capabilities for packet
   transport applications, with equivalent capabilities to those
   provided in SONET/SDH.

   MPLS-TP defines mechanisms to differentiate specific packets (e.g.
   OAM, APS, MCC or SCC) from those carrying user data packets on the
   same LSP.  These mechanisms are described in RFC5586 [RFC5586].

   MPLS-TP requires [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements] that a set of
   OAM capabilities is available to perform fault management (e.g. fault
   detection and localization) and performance monitoring (e.g. packet
   delay and loss measurement) of the LSP, PW or section.  The framework
   for OAM in MPLS-TP is specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].

   OAM and monitoring in MPLS-TP is based on the concept of maintenance
   entities, as described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].  A
   Maintenance Entity can be viewed as the association of two (or more)
   Maintenance End Points (MEPs) (see example in Figure 5 ).  The MEPs
   that form an ME should be configured and managed to limit the OAM
   responsibilities of an OAM flow within a network or sub- network, or
   a transport path or segment, in the specific layer network that is
   being monitored and managed.

   Each OAM flow is associated with a single ME.  Each MEP within an ME
   resides at the boundaries of that ME.  An ME may also include a set
   of zero or more Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs), which reside
   within the Maintenance Entity.  Maintenance end points (MEPs) are
   capable of sourcing and sinking OAM flows, while maintenance
   intermediate points (MIPs) can only sink or respond to OAM flows.

   o  An LSP Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (LTCME), allowing
      monitoring and management of an LSP Tandem Connection (or LSP
      Segment) between any LER/LSR along the LSP. o A MS-PW Tandem
      Connection Maintenance Entity (PTCME), allows monitoring and
      management of a SS/MS-PW Tandem Connection (or PW Segment) between
      any T-PE/S-PE along the (MS-)PW.  Note that the term Tandem
      Connection Monitoring has historical significance dating back to
      the early days of the telephone network, but is equally applicable
      to the two-level hierarchal architectures commonly employed in
      todays packet networks.

   Individual MIPs along the path of an LSP or PW are addressed by
   setting the appropriate TTL in the label for the OAM packet, as per
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw].  Note that this works when the location
   of MIPs along the LSP or PW path is known by the MEP.  There may be
   cases where this is not the case in general MPLS networks e.g.
   following restoration using a facility bypass LSP.

   MPLS-TP OAM packets share the same fate as their corresponding data
   packets, and are identified through the Generic Associated Channel
   mechanism [RFC5586].  This uses a combination of an Associated
   Channel Header (ACH) and a Generic Alert Label (GAL) to create a
   control channel associated to an LSP, Section or PW.

   The MPLS-TP OAM architecture support a wide range of OAM functions,
   including the following

   o  Continuity Check

   o  Connectivity Verification

   o  Performance monitoring (e.g. loss and delay)

   o  Alarm suppression

   o  Remote Integrity

   These are applicable to any layer defined within MPLS- TP, i.e.  MPLS
   Section, LSP and PW.

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset needs to be able to operate without relying
   on a dynamic control plane or IP functionality in the datapath.  In
   the case of MPLS-TP deployment with IP functionality, all existing
   IP-MPLS OAM functions, e.g.  LSP-Ping, BFD and VCCV, may be used.
   This does not preculde the use of other OAM tools in an IP
   addressable network.

   One use of OAM mechanisms is to detect link failures, node failures

   and performance outside the required specification which then may be
   used to trigger recovery actions, according to the requirements of
   the service.

3.7.  Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)

   For correct operation of the OAM it is important that the OAM packets
   fate share with the data packets.  In addition in MPSL-TP it is
   necessary to discriminate between user data payloads and other types
   of payload.  For example the packet may contain a Signaling
   Communication Channel (SCC), or a channel used for Automatic
   Protecton Switching (APS) data.  Such packetets are carried on a
   control channel associated to the LSP, Section or PW.  This is
   achieved by carrying such packets on a generic control channel
   associated to the LSP, PW or section.

   MPLS-TP makes use of such a generic associated channel (G-ACh) to
   support Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security
   (FCAPS) functions by carrying packets related to OAM, APS, SCC, MCC
   or other packet types in band over LSPs or PWs.  The G-ACH is defined
   in [RFC5586]and it is similar to the Pseudowire Associated Channel
   [RFC4385], which is used to carry OAM packets across pseudowires.
   The G-ACH is indicated by a generic associated channel header (ACH),
   similar to the Pseudowire VCCV control word, and this is present for
   all Sections, LSPs and PWs making use of FCAPS functions supported by
   the G-ACH.

   For pseudowires, the G-ACh use the first nibble of the pseudowire
   control word to provide the initial discrimination between data
   packets a packets belonging to the associated channel, as described
   in[RFC4385].  When the first nibble of a packet, immediately
   following the label at the bottom of stack, has a value of one, then
   this packet belongs to a G-ACh.  The first 32 bits following the
   bottom of stack label then have a defined format called an associated
   channel header (ACH), which further defines the content of the
   packet.  The ACH is therefore both a demultiplexer for G-ACh traffic
   on the PW, and a discriminator for the type of G-ACh traffic.

   When the OAM, or a similar message is carried over an LSP, rather
   than over a pseudowire, it is necessary to provide an indication in
   the packet that the payload is something other than a user data
   packet.  This is acheived by including a reserved label with a value
   of 13 in the label stack.  This reserved label is referred to as the
   'Generic Alert Label (GAL)', and is defined in [RFC5586].  When a GAL
   is found anywhere within the label stack it indicates that the
   payload begins with an ACH.  The GAL is thus a demultiplexer for
   G-ACh traffic on the LSP, and the ACH is a discriminator for the type
   of traffic carried on the G-ACh.  Note however that MPLS-TP



Bocci, et al.           Expires December 31, 2009              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework                  June 2009


   forwarding follows the normal MPLS model, and that a GAL is invisible
   to an LSR unless it is the top label iin the label stack.  The only
   other circumstance under which the label stack may be inspected for a
   GAL is when the TTL has expired.  Any MPLS-TP component that
   intentionally performs this inspection must assume that it is
   asynchronous with respect to the forwarding of other packets.  All
   operations on the label stack arein accordance with [RFC3031] and
   [RFC3032].

   In MPLS-TP, the 'Generic Alert Label (GAL)' always appears at the
   bottom of the label stack (i.e.  S bit set to 1), however this does
   not preclude its use elsewhere in the label stack in other
   applications.

   The G-ACH MUST only be used for channels that are an adjunct to the
   data service.  Examples of these are OAM, APS, MCC and SCC, but the
   use is not resticted to those names services.  The G-ACH MUST NOT be
   used to carry additional data for use in the forwarding path, i.e. it
   MUST NOT be used as an alternative to a PW control word, or to define
   a PW type.

   Since the G-ACh traffic is indistinguishable from the user data
   traffic at the server layer, bandwidth and QoS commitments apply to
   the gross traffic on the LSP, PW or section.  Protocols using the
   G-ACh must therefore take into consideration the impact they have on
   the user data that they are sharing resources with.  In addition,
   protocols using the G-ACh MUST conform to the security and congestion
   considerations described in [RFC5586]. .

   is associated with the pseudowire protocol stack.  This is based on
   the reference model for VCCV shown in Figure 2 of [RFC5085].

3.8.  Control Plane

   MPLS-TP should be capable of being operated with centralized Network
   Management Systems (NMS).  The NMS may be supported by a distributed
   control plane, but MPLS-TP can operated in the absense of such a
   control plane.  A distributed control plane may be used to enable
   dynamic service provisioning in multi-vendor and multi-domain
   environments using standardized protocols that guarantee
   interoperability.  Where the requirements specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements] can be met, the MPLS transport
   profile uses existing control plane protocols for LSPs and PWs.

   Figure 9 illustrates the relationshop between the MPLS-TP control
   plane, the forwarding plane, the management plane, and OAM for point-
   to-point MPLS-TP LSPs or PWs.

Note:
   1) NMS may be centralised or distributed. Control plane is distributed
   2) 'Edge' functions refers to those functions present at the edge of
      a PSN domain, e.g. NSP or classification.


           Figure 9: MPLS-TP Control Plane Architecture Context

   The MPLS-TP control plane is based on a combination of the LDP-based
   control plane for pseudowires [RFC4447] and the RSVP-TE based control
   plane for MPLS-TP LSPs [RFC3471].  Some of the RSVP-TE functions that
   are required for LSP signaling for MPLS-TP are based on GMPLS.

   The distributed MPLS-TP control plane provides the following
   functions:

   o  Signaling

   o  Routing

   o  Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation

   In a multi-domain environment, the MPLS-TP control plane supports
   different types of interfaces at domain boundaries or within the
   domains.  These include the User-Network Interface (UNI), Internal
   Network Node Interface (I-NNI), and External Network Node Interface
   (E-NNI).  Note that different policies may be defined that control
   the information exchanged across these interface types.

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework                  June 2009


   The MPLS-TP control plane is capable of activating MPLS-TP OAM
   functions as described in the OAM section of this document
   Section 3.6 e.g. for fault detection and localization in the event of
   a failure in order to efficiently restore failed transport paths.

   The MPLS-TP control plane supports all MPLS-TP data plane
   connectivity patterns that are needed for establishing transport
   paths including protected paths as described in the survivability
   section Section 3.10 of this document.  Examples of the MPLS-TP data
   plane connectivity patterns are LSPs utilizing the fast reroute
   backup methods as defined in [RFC4090] and ingress-to-egress 1+1 or
   1:1 protected LSPs.

   The MPLS-TP control plane provides functions to ensure its own
   survivability and to enable it to recover gracefully from failures
   and degredations.  These include graceful restart and hot redundant
   configurations.  Depending on how the control plane is transported,
   varying degrees of decoupling between the control plane and data
   plane may be achieved.

3.8.1.  PW Control Plane

   An MPLS-TP network provides many of its transport services using
   single-segment or multi-segment pseudowires, in compliance with the
   PWE3 architecture ([RFC3985] and [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch] ).  The
   setup and maintenance of single-segment or multi- segment pseudowires
   uses the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) as per [RFC4447] and
   extensions for MS-PWs [I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw] and
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw].

3.8.2.   LSP Control Plane

   MPLS-TP provider edge nodes aggregate multiple pseudowires and carry
   them across the MPLS-TP network through MPLS-TP tunnels (MPLS-TP
   LSPs).  Applicable functions from the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   protocol suite supporting packet-switched capable (PSC) technologies
   are used as the control plane for MPLS-TP transport paths (LSPs).

   The LSP control plane includes:

   o  RSVP-TE for signalling

   o  OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE for routing

   RSVP-TE signaling in support of GMPLS, as defined in [RFC4872], is
   used for the setup, modification, and release of MPLS-TP transport
   paths and protection paths.  It supports unidirectional, bi-
   directional and multicast types of LSPs.  The route of a transport

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework                  June 2009


   path is typically calculated in the ingress node of a domain and the
   RSVP explicit route object (ERO) is utilized for the setup of the
   transport path exactly following the given route.  GMPLS based
   MPLS-TP LSPs must be able to interoperate with RSVP-TE based MPLS-TE
   LSPs, as per [RFC5146]

   OSPF-TE routing in support of GMPLS as defined in [RFC4203] is used
   for carrying link state information in a MPLS-TP network.  ISIS-TE
   routing in support of GMPLS as defined in [RFC5307] is used for
   carrying link state information in a MPLS-TP network.

3.9.  Static Operation of LSPs and PWs

   A PW or LSP may be statically configured without the support of a
   dynamic control plane.  This may be either by direct configuration of
   the PEs/LSRs, or via a network management system.  The colateral
   damage that loops can cause during the time taken to detect the
   failure may be severe.  When static configuration mechanisms are
   used, care must be taken to ensure that loops to not form.

3.10.  Survivability

   Survivability requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk].

   A wide variety of resiliency schemes have been developed to meet the
   various network and service survivability objectives.  For example,
   as part of the MPLS/PW paradigms, MPLS provides methods for local
   repair using back-up LSP tunnels ([RFC4090]), while pseudowire
   redundancy [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy] supports scenarios where the
   protection for the PW can not be fully provided by the PSN layer
   (i.e. where the backup PW terminates on a different target PE node
   than the working PW).  Additionally, GMPLS provides a well known set
   of control plane driven protection and restoration mechanisms
   [RFC4872].  MPLS-TP provides additional protection mechansisms that
   are optimised for both linear topologies and ring topologies, and
   that operate in the absense of a dynamic control plane.  These are
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk].

   Different protection schemes apply to different deployment topologies
   and operational considerations.  Such protection schemes may provide
   different levels of resiliency.  For example, two concurrent traffic
   paths (1+1), one active and one standby path with guaranteed
   bandwidth on both paths (1:1) or one active path and a standby path
   that is shared by one or more other active paths (shared protection).
   The applicability of any given scheme to meet specific requirements
   is outside the current scope of this document.

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework                  June 2009


   The characteristics of MPLS-TP resiliency mechanisms are listed
   below.

   o  Optimised for linear, ring or meshed topologies.

   o  Use OAM mechanisms to detect and localize network faults or
      service degenerations.

   o  Include protection mechanisms to coordinate and trigger protection
      switching actions in the absense of a dynamic control plane.  This
      is known as an Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mechanism.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery schemes are applicable to all levels in the
      MPLS-TP domain (i.e.  MPLS section, LSP and PW), providing segment
      and end-to- end recovery.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms support the coordination of protection
      switching at multiple levels to prevent race conditions occuring
      between a client and its server layer.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms can be data plane, control plane or
      management plane based.

   o  MPLS-TP supports revertive and non-revertive behavior.

3.11.  Network Management

   The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req].  It derives from the generic
   specifications described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [G.7710] for
   transport technologies.  It also incorporates the OAM requirements
   for MPLS Networks [RFC4377] and MPLS-TP Networks
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements] and expands on those requirements
   to cover the modifications necessary for fault, configuration,
   performance, and security in a transport network.

   The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP Network Element
   (NE) (i.e.  LSR, LER, PE, S-PE or T-PE) provides the means through
   which a management system manages the NE.  The Management
   Communication Channel (MCC), realized by the G-ACh, provides a
   logical operations channel between NEs for transferring Management
   information.  For the management interface from a management system
   to a MPLS-TP NE, there is no restriction on which management protocol
   should be used.  It is used to provision and manage an end-to-end
   connection across a network where some segments are create/managed,
   for examples by Netconf or SNMP and other segments by XML or CORBA
   interfaces.  Maintenance operations are run on a connection (LSP or
   PW) in a manner that is independent of the provisioning mechanism.



Bocci, et al.           Expires December 31, 2009              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft              MPLS TP Framework                  June 2009


   An MPLS-TP NE is not required to offer more than one standard
   management interface.  In MPLS-TP, the EMF must be capable of
   statically provisioning LSPs for an LSR or LER, and PWs for a PE, as
   per Section 3.9.

   Fault Management (FM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-TP NE
   enable the supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction,
   and alarm handling of abnormal conditions in the MPLS-TP network and
   its environment.  FM must provide for the supervision of transmission
   (such as continuity, connectivity, etc.), software processing,
   hardware, and environment.  Alarm handling includes alarm severity
   assignment, alarm suppression/aggregation/correlation, alarm
   reporting control, and alarm reporting.

   Configuration Management (CM) provides functions to control,
   identify, collect data from, and provide data to MPLS-TP NEs.  In
   addition to general configuration for hardware, software protection
   switching, alarm reporting control, and date/time setting, the EMF of
   the MPLS-TP NE also supports the configuration of maintenance entity
   identifiers (such as MEP ID and MIP ID).  The EMF also supports the
   configuration of OAM parameters as a part of connectivity management
   to meet specific operational requirements.  These may specify whether
   the operational mode is one-time on-demand or is periodic at a
   specified frequency.

   The Performance Management (PM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-
   TP NE support the evaluation and reporting of the behaviour of the
   NEs and the network.  One particular requirement for PM is to provide
   coherent and consistent interpretation of the network behaviour in a
   hybrid network that uses multiple transport technologies.  Packet
   loss measurement and delay measurements may be collected and used to
   detect performance degradation.  This is reported via fault
   management to enable corrective actions to be taken (e.g. protection
   switching), and via performance monitoring for Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) verification and billing.  Collection mechanisms for
   performance data should be should be capable of operating on-demand
   or proactively.

4.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of MPLS-TP into transport networks means that the
   security considerations applicable to both MPLS and PWE3 apply to
   those transport networks.  Furthermore, when general MPLS networks
   that utilise functionality outside of the strict MPLS-TP profile are
   used to support packet transport services, the security
   considerations of that additional functionality also apply.

   The security considerations of [RFC3985] and

   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch] apply.

   Each MPLS-TP solution must specify the addtional security
   considerations that apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA considerations resulting from specific elements of MPLS-TP
   functionality will be detailed in the documents specifying that
   functionality.

   This document introduces no additional IANA considerations in itself.
