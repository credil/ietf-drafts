   IMIX Genome: Specification of variable packet sizes for additional
                                testing
                    draft-morton-bmwg-imix-genome-00

Abstract

   Benchmarking Methodologies have always relied on test conditions with
   constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network
   device capability has been tested.  Constant packets sizes differ
   significantly from the conditions encountered in operational
   deployment, and so additional tests are sometimes conducted with a
   mixture of packet sizes, or "IMIX".  The mixture of sizes a
   networking device will encounter is highly variable and depends on
   many factors.  An IMIX suited for one networking device and
   deployment will not be appropriate for another.  However, the mix of
   sizes may be known and the tester may be asked to augment the fixed
   size tests.  To address this need, and the additional goal of
   repeatable test conditions, this draft proposes a way to specify the
   exact repeating sequence of packet sizes from the usual set of fixed
   sizes.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a method to unambiguously specify the sequence of
   packet sizes used in a load test.

   Benchmarking Methodologies [RFC2544] have always relied on test
   conditions with constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding
   what network device capability has been tested.  Tests with the
   smallest size stress the header processing capacity, and tests with
   the largest size stress the overall bit processing capacity.  Tests
   with sizes in-between may determine the transition between these two
   capacities.

   Constant packets sizes differ significantly from the conditions
   encountered in operational deployment, and so additional tests are
   sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes.  The set of sizes
   used is often called an Internet Mix, or "IMIX" [Spirent], [IXIA],
   [Agilent].

   The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter is highly
   variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX suited for one
   networking device and deployment will not be appropriate for another.
   However, the mix of sizes may be known and the tester may be asked to
   augment the fixed size tests.

   To address this need, and the additional goal of repeatable test
   conditions, this draft proposes a way to specify the exact repeating
   sequence of packet sizes from the usual set of fixed sizes: the IMIX
   Genome.

1.1.  First Draft

   In this first draft, some section are very short or to-be-provided
   (TBP), and there are several questions identified for further
   discussion.


2.  Scope and Goals

   This memo defines a method to unambiguously specify the sequence of
   packet sizes that have been used in a load test, assuming that a
   relevant mix of sizes is known to the tester and the length of the
   repeating sequence is not very long (<30 packets).

   The IMIX Genome will allow an exact sequence of packet sizes to be
   communicated as a single-line name, resolving the current ambiguity
   with results that simply refer to "IMIX".

   While documentation of the exact sequence is ideal, the memo also
   covers the case where the sequence of sizes is very long or may be
   generated by a pseudo-random process.

   It is a colossal non-goal to standardize one or more versions of the
   IMIX.  This topic has been discussed on many occasions on the bmwg-
   list[IMIXonList].  The goal is to enable customization with minimal
   constraints while fostering repeatable testing once the fixed size
   testing is complete.


3.  Specification of the IMIX Genome

   The IMIX Genome is specified in the following format:

   IMIX - 123456...x

   where each number is replaced by the letter corresponding to the
   packet size of the packet at that position in the sequence.  The
   following table gives the letter encoding for the [RFC2544] standard
   sizes (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, and 1518 bytes).

                   +-------------+--------------------+
                   | Size, bytes | Genome Code Letter |
                   +-------------+--------------------+
                   | 64          | a                  |
                   | 128         | b                  |
                   | 256         | c                  |
                   | 512         | d                  |
                   | 1024        | e                  |
                   | 1280        | f                  |
                   | 1518        | g                  |
                   | MTU ??      | h                  |
                   +-------------+--------------------+

   For example: a five packet sequence with sizes 64,64,64,1280,1518
   would be designated:

   IMIX - aaafg

   While this approach allows some flexibility, there are also
   constraints.

   o  Non-RFC2544 packet sizes would need to be approximated by those
      available in the table.

   o  The Genome for very long sequences can become undecipherable by
      humans.

   o  Whether h=MTU is useful/desirable is TBD.

   o  Whether more tabulated packet sizes would be useful is TBD.

   Some open issues with this format are:

   1.  Multiple Source-Destination Address Pairs: is the IMIX sequence
       applicable to each pair, across multiple pairs in sets, or across
       all pairs?

   2.  Multiple Tester Ports:is the IMIX sequence applicable to each
       port, across multiple ports in sets, or across all ports?


4.  Reporting Long or Pseudo-Random Packet Sequences

   When the IMIX-Genome cannot be used (when the sheer length of the
   sequence would make the genome unmanageable) or when the sequence is
   designed to vary within some proportional constraints, a table is
   necessary.

           +-----------+---------------------+-----------------+
           | IP Length | Percentage of Total | Other Length(s) |
           +-----------+---------------------+-----------------+
           | 64        | 23                  | 82              |
           | 128       | 67                  | 146             |
           | 1000      | 10                  | 1018            |
           +-----------+---------------------+-----------------+

   Note that this approach also allows non-standard packet sizes, but
   trades the short genome specification and ability to specify the
   exact sequence for other flexibilities.

5.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the other constraints
   [RFC2544].

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests of IANA, and hopes that IANA will leave
   it alone as well.
