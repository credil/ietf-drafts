Abstract

   This document analyses the main issues related to IPv4 Internet
   access in the context of public IPv4 address exhaustion.  It would be
   valuable to assess each IPv4 address shortage solution with all these
   issues, to check to what degree they are concerned, how they handle
   each issue, and to what extent they resolve the pending problems.

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


1.  Introduction

   Taking into consideration the IPv4 public address pool currently
   available at the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), it is
   expected that the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) will have no
   more public IPv4 addresses to allocate in the short term.  At the
   time of writing, this anticipated date is mid-2012.  See the IPv4
   Address Report website www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html for a
   thorough analysis of this issue, and an updated prediction.

   At the exhaustion date, ISPs will wind up with public address pools
   that cannot grow.  They will have to make do with what they have
   currently got.  They will enter an IPv4 address shortage management
   phase.  It will not be possible to provide each customer with a
   unique public IPv4 address.  On the other hand, offering only an
   access to the IPv6 Internet won't be satisfactory for the customers
   because a lot of services will remain IPv4-only accessible, and this
   is for long period (a full IPv6 world requires universal agreement
   which is hard to achieve).

   This document analyses the main issues related to IPv4 Internet
   access in the context of public IPv4 address exhaustion.  The IPv4
   Internet access from an IPv6 stack, and the IPv6 Internet access
   whatever the means, are out of the scope of this memo.


2.  Shared IPv4 Addresses

   So far, the current practice has been to give a unique IPv4 public
   address to each customer.  A customer, then, can possibly share her
   address among several hosts behind her Customer Premises Equipment
   (CPE).  In this context, the addresses that can be seen in any IP
   packets always refer to a unique customer.  To cope with the IPv4
   address exhaustion, this kind of practices is no more affordable.
   Therefore ISPs are bound to allocate the same IPv4 public address to
   several customers at the same time.

   All solutions claiming to solve the IPv4 address exhaustion (simply
   referred to as solutions in the remaining part of this memo) are
   based on shared addresses.  In this new context, an IPv4 address seen
   in an IP packet can refer to several customers.  The port information
   must be considered as well, in order to be able to unambiguously
   identify the customer pointed by that shared address.  In particular,
   the port information along with the address information, must
   eventually be taken into account by the routing infrastructure in
   order to correctly reach the intended destination.

   All IPv4 address shortage mechanisms extend the address space in



Levis, et al.            Expires August 1, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


   adding port information.  They differ on the way they manage the port
   value.


3.  Address Space Multiplicative Factor

   The purpose of sharing IPv4 addresses is to potentially increase the
   addressing space.  A key parameter is the factor by which ISPs want
   or need to multiply their IPv4 public address space; and the
   consequence is the number of customers sharing the same public IPv4
   address.

   The intention is not to replace IPv6.  However, we should be very
   careful; whatever the network model deployed, applications and
   business will run on top of it.  The fact that the IPv4 shortage
   mechanisms will not postpone IPv6 deployment, heavily relies on
   voluntarism.

   It is expected that the IPv6 communications will take an increasing
   part during the next years to come, at the expense of the IPv4
   communications.  We should reach a safety point in the future, where
   the number of IPv4 public addresses, in use at the same time, begins
   decreasing.  From an ISP point of view, the multiplicative factor
   must be enough to survive until this occurs for its own customers.
   Most likely a one digit factor (less than 10) should be sufficient,
   and it should not be relevant to go beyond.  Whereas the potential is
   huge, -if we allow to each customer (one IP address, 1000 ports) we
   multiply by 64 the total IPv4 address space- trying to devise
   solutions that can increase the IPv4 space by a significantly bigger
   factor might be seen as an incentive to postpone again and again IPv6
   deployment.


4.  Service Management

   At the time of IPv4 address exhaustion in the RIRs, ISPs will have to
   manage public address pools that cannot grow (at least from the
   RIRs).  Concretely, they will have to decide to whom they allocate
   shared addresses and to whom they allocate unique addresses, to the
   extent of the availability of addresses.  Many policies can be
   envisaged, taking into account parameters such as: old vs. new
   customers, user profile, access type, geographic considerations,
   unique address as the privileged choice, shared address as the
   privileged choice, etc.

   An important issue is whether shared and unique addresses will
   differently be charged.




Levis, et al.            Expires August 1, 2009                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


   For the sake of safety and flexibility, ISPs should not drop their
   public pool size under a minimum (safety number).  They can adjust
   the volume of IPv4 public addresses available playing on the balance
   between shared and unique allocations.

   o  To increase the public IPv4 address pool: increase the number of
      customers with shared address; increase the ratio of customers per
      shared address.

   o  To decrease the public IPv4 address pool: decrease the number of
      customers with shared address; decrease the ratio of customers per
      shared address.


5.  IPv6 Migration and IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence

   Any IPv4 address shortage solution should make use, as much as
   possible, of the IPv6 transport capabilities available, in order to
   increase the IPv6 packets traffic and to move forward from an IPv4-
   enabled ISP network towards an almost only IPv6-enabled ISP network.
   If it is not the case, the risk is to delay IPv6 deployments, in
   staying on a pure dual-stack attitude for ever, similar to the ships
   in the night routing approach, where the protocols independently live
   their own lives.

   The IPv4 in IPv6 tunnels, and/or the translation NAT464 should be
   favored.  However, increasing the number of IPv6 packets does not
   automatically mean IPv6 is being generalized, if the main purpose of
   these packets is to carry IPv4 information.  This is very similar to
   what occurred with ATM, especially in European countries, where ATM
   cells have heavily been used to convey IPv4 packets in the backhaul
   networks, but have never been used for end-to-end communications.

   If the percentage of end-to-end IPv6 traffic significantly increases,
   so that the volume of IPv4 traffic begins decreasing, then the number
   of IPv4 sessions will be decreasing.  The smaller the number of
   current sessions per customer is, the higher the number of customers
   under the same IPv4 public address can be, and consequently, the
   lower the number of IPv4 public addresses is needed.  Hence, the
   pressure on IPv4 address shortage would be relaxed, because one IPv4
   public address would be able to serve more customers.  However, this
   effect will only occur for customers who have both an IPv6 access and
   a shared IPv4 access.  This would advocate the strategy to
   systematically bound a shared IPv4 access to any IPv6 access.
   Furthermore, a significant number of public IPv4 addresses will be
   needed in the interconnection between IPv4 and IPv6 realms, for the
   sake of global reachability.

6.  Solution-Level Issues

   All IPv4 address shortage solutions will be confronted to the
   hereafter listed issues.  It is valuable to assess each solution with
   all these issues, to check to what degree they are concerned, how
   they handle each issue, and to what extent they resolve the pending
   problems.

6.1.  Network Addressing Capability

   The network addressing capability is the level of flexibility the
   network has to configure customers' devices, either with a unique
   address, or with a shared IPv4 address.  It can be assessed through
   the following considerations:

   o  Is it possible to configure any customer's device with a shared
      address, regardless his location and his history?

   o  Is it possible to configure any customer's device with a unique
      public address, regardless his location and his history?

   o  Is it straightforward to switch, for any customer, from a shared
      address to a unique public address, and vice versa?

   What is considered here is not the policy decision to allocate a
   unique or a shared address, but indeed the network capability to
   enforce such address management schemes.

   Any addressing scheme should be backward compatible with the current
   practices.  Means to convey IP connectivity (e.g.  DHCP, PPP) should
   be the same as the ones implemented by service providers.  Additional
   facilities and tools to ease the shared IPv4 address management
   should be promoted.

6.2.  Number of Current Sessions per Customer

   In any kind of solutions, the number of current sessions per customer
   has, de facto, to be limited in some way.  Therefore, the number of
   current sessions per customer is a limit to take into account in any
   architectural dimensioning.  The degree of fairness -balanced
   distribution of sessions between customers-, should be assessed.
   Means to prevent against traffic loss (due to the limitation in
   number of sessions) should be evaluated and proposed.  The importance
   of this issue may be greatly reduced if the multiplicative factor is
   very small (e.g. 4).

   As for the current usage of ports, several hundreds per customer
   seems current practice, although several thousands may be not unusual



Levis, et al.            Expires August 1, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


   with some P2P applications (e.g.  BitTorrent).

   The impact of the dynamicity of the sessions should also be
   considered, especially as far as performance is concerned.

6.3.  Scarcity of Private Addressing

   According to [RFC1918], IPv4 private addresses must be chosen in the
   following ranges:

   o  10/8

   o  172.16/12

   o  192.168/16

   There is a potential of 2 at the power of (224 + 220 + 216)
   addresses, or 17,891,328 addresses.  Actually, private addresses are
   not that abundant when deployments are concerned.  Some ISPs already
   use private addresses within their networks for specific usage such
   as walled garden services, in a way they cannot reuse them for
   another usage.  As a consequence, the smallness of the IPv4 private
   address pool available for the Internet service could force some ISPs
   to use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) such as [RFC4364] to allow
   reusing the same private addresses several times with no routing
   overlaps.  This brings a lot of complexity in network configuration
   and management.

   It has been suggested to make the 240./4 block available for private
   addressing [I-D.wilson-class-e].  This address block, formerly
   designated as "Class E", is still noted as being reserved in the IANA
   IPv4 address registry.  If it were reassigned for private addressing
   that would yield around 268 millions extra private addresses.
   However, many current implementations of the TCP/IP protocol stack do
   not allow the use of the 240./4 block.  This is a severe blocking
   point for a lot of existing devices: CPE, NAT or routers.  This issue
   will only be solved when the vendors' implementations accept the
   (240./4) addresses.

   Another suggestion [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr] is to reserve some
   public blocks (typically three or four /8) only for internal usage.
   So far, there has been no consensus upon this proposal.

6.4.  Impact on Information System

   The IPv4 address shortage solutions could add port information in the
   Information System (IS) at different levels.  For instance, the
   possibility to give either a unique or a shared address, coupled or



Levis, et al.            Expires August 1, 2009                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


   not with an IPv6 address, could yield several types of customers to
   deal with in the IS: IPv4 unique only, IPv4 shared only, IPv4 unique
   + IPv6, IPv4 shared + IPv6, IPv6 only.  The impact on the IS
   platforms and IS applications should be evaluated and assessed.

6.5.  Port Related Entries in the ISP Equipment

   Additional data related to port information should be stored and
   maintained by the ISP equipment.  As an example, a set of entries
   (e.g. session states, binding entries) are to be instantiated and
   maintained.  The logic instantiation (behavior and not necessarily
   detailed algorithms) of these entries should be standardized to avoid
   interoperability problems, and ease management tasks.  Optimization
   means for instantiating new entries should be investigated and
   deployed if required.  In addition, the amount of entries to be
   maintained should not be too big.

6.6.  Legal Duties

   ISPs are legally required to give access to information related to
   their users' communications on request of the authorities.

6.6.1.  Traceability

   Legal obligations require an ISP to provide the identity of a
   customer upon request of the authorities.  Because one public IPv4
   address may be shared between several users, the knowledge of the
   port number, along with the IP address, is mandatory to have a chance
   to find the appropriate user.  The ISP must be able to provide the
   identity of a customer from the knowledge of the IPv4 public address
   and the port number.

6.6.2.  Interception

   This process is proactive, a given group of communications is
   replicated in real time towards a law enforcement agency.  Typically,
   the point of replication is the first IP hop in the ISP network.  The
   mechanism put in place must be completely transparent to the
   customers, so that the targeted customer cannot be aware of the
   interception.

6.7.  Flow Discrimination

   The ISP can offer walled garden services along with Internet
   services.  Typically, walled garden services packets are exchanged
   between the customers and a Service Platform or a Service Gateway.
   The ISP may want these flows not to traverse the IPv4 shortage
   facilities put in place (for instance TV flows should bypass a



Levis, et al.            Expires August 1, 2009                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


   Carrier Grade NAT).  However, the best practice seems to rapidly
   migrate these services from IPv4 to IPv6.

   The activation of solutions to solve the IPv4 shortage problem should
   not alter mechanisms to enforce QoS or traffic engineering within a
   given domain.  Examples of these mechanisms are: DiffServ, RSVP, etc.

6.8.  Introduction of Single Point of Failure (Robustness)

   The introduction of new nodes/functions, specifically where the port
   information is managed, can create single points of failure.  Any
   IPv4 shortage solution should consider the opportunity to add
   redundancy features in order to alleviate the impact on the
   robustness of the IP connectivity service.

   Additionally, load balancing and load sharing means should be
   evaluated.  The ability of the solution to allow hot swapping from a
   machine to another, in minimizing the perturbations, should be
   considered.

   End-to-end performances (e.g. delay) experienced in the context of a
   new addressing solution should be at least similar to the currently
   experienced one.  QoS should not be severely altered when new means
   are activated to solve IPv4 address exhaustion.

6.9.  Impact on Intra-Domain and Inter-Domain Routing

   The introduction of port consideration to route packets to their
   final destinations may have an impact on the current routing
   infrastructure: on the architecture, the IGP and EGP configuration,
   and the addressing configuration.  The introduction of new nodes that
   cannot be circumvent could also yield non optimized routes,
   especially for communications between customers attached to the same
   ISP realm.

6.10.  Fragmentation

   When a packet is fragmented, the port information (either UDP or TCP)
   will only be present in the first fragment.  The other fragments will
   not bear the port information which is necessary to a correct
   treatment up to the destination.  Appropriate solutions should be
   investigated if required by service providers.

6.11.  Impact on Services

   There is a potential danger for the following types of applications:





Levis, et al.            Expires August 1, 2009                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


   o  Applications that establish inbound communications

   o  Applications that carry address information in their payloads

   o  Applications that do not use any port (e.g.  ICMP)

   o  Applications that assume the uniqueness of customers' addresses

   o  Applications that explicitly prohibit twice the same address to
      access to a resource at the same time

   Current applications already implement some mechanisms in order to
   circumvent the presence of NATs (typically CPE NATs):

   o  ALGs

   o  Port Forwarding

   o  UPnP IGD

   o  NAT Traversal

   It should be considered to what extent these mechanisms can still be
   used with IPv4 shortage mechanisms put in place.

   Impact on existing services:

   o  Will this service work as usual?

   o  Will this service work but with a degradation?

   o  What level of degradation?

   o  Will this service not work at all?

   o  What modifications are needed if any?

   Impact on future services:

   o  What new constraints are to be taken into account to devise new
      services?

6.12.  Impact on CPE

   IPv4 shortage mechanisms may require specific features in the CPEs.
   Some CPEs are ISP branded.  CPEs are particularly sensible devices by
   their number and by the fact that they are often optimized for a well
   defined set of treatments closely related to the ISP's services.  The



Levis, et al.            Expires August 1, 2009                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           IPv4 Shortage Framework            January 2009


   impact on existing CPE devices should be carefully evaluated, taking
   into account: features needed, required modifications, availability.

   This requirement is not specific to ISP branded CPEs.  CPE behavior
   should be particularly specified by any solution claiming to solve
   the IPv4 address exhaustion problem.

6.13.  Support of Multicast

   It should be assessed if a customer with a shared address can receive
   multicast packets and source multicast packets.

   Particularly, impact on IGMP should be identified and solutions
   proposed.  Because of the presence of several end user devices with
   the same IP address, membership to multicast groups should be
   evaluated and enhancement should be proposed if required.  Besides
   the membership issues, building multicast trees may be impacted.
   This impact should be assessed and alternatives proposed.

6.14.  Scalability

   Any claimed solution to solve the IPv4 address shortage should be
   able to deliver the IP connectivity services to a large amount of
   customers, this limit should be evaluated.

6.15.  Security

6.15.1.  Port Randomization

   A kind of blind attacks that can be performed against TCP relies on
   the attacker's ability to guess the five-tuple (Protocol, Source
   Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that
   identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.  Document
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization] describes a number of methods for
   the random selection of the client port number, such that the
   possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  With
   shared IPv4 addresses, the port selection space is reduced.
   Intuitively, assuming the port range is known, the smaller the port
   range is, the more predictable the port choice is.

   Any solution to solve IPv4 address shortage should specify how port
   randomization is impacted and what alternative means to bypass the
   issue are.

6.15.2.  Duplicate Effects

   Some types of attacks that have an impact on a targeted IPv4 public
   address, could see their effects increased by the number of customers

   who share this address.  For example, if a given address that has,
   deliberately or not misbehaved, is consequently forbidden to access
   some resources, the whole set of customers who share this address
   will be impacted.

6.16.  Management Tools

   ISPs deploy a set of tools and applications for the management of
   their infrastructure, especially for supervision purposes.  Impact on
   these tools should be evaluated and solutions proposed when required.
   Particularly, means to assign IP connectivity information, means to
   monitor the overall network, to assess the reachability of devices
   should be specified.  In this context, impact on ICMP should be
   evaluated.

6.17.  Solution manageability

   The manageability of any new solution to be activated within service
   providers realms should be evaluated and complexity avoided.
   Particularly, required provisioning operations should be known and
   not complex to enforce.  The orchestration of required functions and
   nodes should be specified.

6.18.  End-Users Facilities

   In the current deployments, end-users are used to configure their
   CPEs in order to control the traffic entering/exiting to their home
   LAN.  Examples of these facilities are: port forwarding or firewall
   rules.  These facilities should be allowed in the context of IPv4
   address exhaustion solutions.  No major degradation compared to the
   current practice should be perceived by end users.  Functional
   richness and quality of experience should be at the same level.

6.19.  Service Access Discrimination

   End-users should not be discriminated based on the assigned IP
   address.  The IP connectivity services should be the same for all
   users.  Particularly, accessing the added value services should be at
   large extent not based on IP address.  Applications developers are
   encouraged to not embed "hard" IPv4 addresses in their software.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
