Abstract

   ADD-PATH is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertise
   multiple distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides a
   number of potential benefits, including reduced routing churn, faster
   convergence, better loadsharing and a mechanism for graceful
   maintenance. This document describes implementation and operational
   best practices for ADD-PATH in order to facilitate the introduction
   of ADD-PATH to existing networks and to ensure interoperability.

1. Introduction

   This best practices guide is intended to supplement [ADD-PATH] by
   providing operators and implementers of BGP ADD-PATH with best
   practice recommendations.  It also aims to ensure that while
   introducing ADD-PATH in existing networks, operators have the
   controls needed to manage the additional resources it imposes.

1.1. Add-Paths Overview

   The BGP ADD-PATH capability enhances current BGP implementations by
   allowing a BGP router to exchange with its BGP peers more than one
   path for the same destination/NLRI. The base BGP standard [RFC 4271]
   does not provide for such a capability. If a BGP router learns
   multiple paths for the same NLRI (from multiple peers), it selects
   only one as its best path and advertises the best path to its peers.
   The ADD-PATH extension [ADD-PATH] has a number of benefits, including
   reduced routing churn, faster convergence, better loadsharing and a
   mechanism for graceful maintenance.

   Consider a network such as the one depicted in Figure 1 and suppose
   that none of the routers support ADD-PATH. From AS1 there are 3 paths
   (A, B and C) to a particular destination XYZ: two of the paths are
   via AS3 and one of the paths is via AS2. In this example, Path A is
   preferred over Path B due to Path A having a lower MED (multi-exit
   discriminator) (MED for Path A is lower than MED for path B).

   AS1 uses a route reflector RR1 to reduce the scale of its IBGP mesh.
   During steady state, RR1 knows about (has in its RIB-IN) only 2 of
   the 3 paths. Router B suppresses the advertisement of its best
   external path (B) to RR, an IBGP peer, because its best overall path
   is A, learnt from router A (via the RR). RR1 chooses path A as the
   overall best since its IGP cost to router A is the lowest among path
   A and C. During normal conditions, router D has even less knowledge
   of the available paths to destination XYZ; it knows only about path
   (A), the best path from RR1's perspective.

   Consider now the steps required to restore traffic from router D to
   destination XYZ when the link between Router A and Router E fails.

   1. Router A sends a BGP UPDATE message withdrawing its advertisement
      of path (A).

   2. RR receives the withdrawal, and propagates it to its other client
      peers, routers B, C and D.

   3. When router B receives the withdrawal of path (A) it reruns its
      decision process and selects path (B) as its new best path. Router
      B advertises path (B) to RR.

   4. RR reruns its decision process and selects path (B) as its new
      best path. RR advertises path (B) to client peers A, C and D.

   5. Router D reruns its decisions process, determines path (B) to be
      the best path, and updates its forwarding table. After this step
      traffic from router D to destination XYZ is restored (the traffic
      path has changed from A to B).

   With the use of ADD-PATH, the convergence time for the above path
   failure example can be reduced considerably. The main reason for the
   improvement is that ADD-PATH allows router D to be aware of more than
   one path to destination XYZ prior to the failure of the best path
   (A). In steady-state (with no failures) router B decides, as before,
   that path (A) is its best path but it also advertises path (B) -
   which happens to be its next-best overall path and its best
   "external" path - to RR. With ADD-PATH RR1 now has knowledge of all 3
   paths to destination XYZ and it can advertise more than just the best
   path (A) to its peers. Suppose RR1 is allowed to advertise up to 3
   paths for destination XYZ. In this case it will advertise paths (A),
   (B) and (C) to router D because (A) is the best path, (B) is the
   second best path (if A is excluded from the decision process) and (C)
   is the third best path (if A and B are excluded from the decision
   process). Now consider again the scenario where the link between
   Router A and Router E fails. In this case, with ADD-PATH, fewer steps
   are required to achieve re-convergence:

   1. Router A sends a BGP UPDATE message withdrawing its advertisement
      of path (A).

   2. RR1 receives the withdrawal, and propagates it to its other client
      peers, routers B, C and D.

   3. Router D receives the withdrawal, reruns the decision process and
      updates the forwarding entry for destination XYZ.

   This one example illustrates the benefit of ADD-PATH in terms of
   faster convergence, and it also suggests how other benefits are
   realizable as well. As an example, router D can use the knowledge of
   multiple paths to perform [un]equal cost load balancing if required.

   As with any technology, there are costs to ADD-PATH that must be
   considered in relation to the benefits before introducing it into a
   network. Specifically -

   o  Computing multiple best paths per prefix (best, second best, etc.)
      is CPU-intensive and can potentially affect the convergence times.

   o  Advertising multiple paths per prefix requires more memory and
      state than an implementation that advertises only the best path
      per prefix. More specifically, with the current behavior of
      advertising best path only, each BGP speaker maintains send state
      information in its prefix data structure per neighbor as a way to
      determine that the prefix has been advertised to the neighbor.
      With ADD-PATH, this information has to be replicated on a per path
      basis that needs to be advertised. Mathematically, if "send state"
      size per prefix is 's' bytes, number of neighbors is 'n', and
      number of paths being advertised is 'p', then the current memory
      requirement for BGP "send state" = n * s bytes; with ADD-PATH, it
      becomes n * s * p bytes.

   o  Receiving multiple paths per prefix also requires more memory and
      state since the number of paths per prefix effectively increases.

   o  In any BGP deployment it is important that the BGP routers within
      an AS make a consistent routing decision about how to reach a
      particular destination, otherwise route oscillations may occur.
      When using ADD-PATH the opportunity for inconsistent routing
      decisions increases and therefore routing policies must be applied
      carefully.

2. Conventions used in this document

   In Figure 2, in order for a router A to receive multiple paths per
   NLRI from peer B, for a particular address family (AFI=x, SAFI=y),

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines          Feb 2010


   the BGP capabilities advertisements during session setup must
   indicate that peer B wants to send multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y
   and that router A is willing to receive multiple paths for AFI=x,
   SAFI=y. Similarly, in order for router A to send multiple paths per
   NLRI to peer B, for a particular address family (AFI=x, SAFI=y), the
   BGP capabilities advertisements must indicate that router A wants to
   send multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y and peer B is willing to
   receive multiple paths for AFI=x, SAFI=y. Refer to [ADD-PATH] for
   details of the ADD-PATH capabilities advertisement.

   The capabilities of the local router shall be configurable per peer
   and per address family, with the ability to configure send-only
   operation or receive-only operation. The default mode of operation
   shall be to both send and receive.

3.2. Receiving Multiple Paths

   Currently, per standard BGP behavior, if a BGP router receives an
   advertisement of an NLRI and path from a specific peer and that peer
   subsequently advertises the same NLRI with different path information
   (e.g. a different NEXT_HOP and/or different path attributes) the new
   path effectively overwrites the existing path.

   When ADD-PATH has been negotiated with the peer, the newly advertised
   path should be stored in the RIB-IN along with all of the paths
   previously advertised (and not withdrawn) by the peer.

   When the ADD-PATH receive capability for (AFIx, SAFIy) has been
   negotiated with a peer all advertisements and withdrawals of NLRI
   within that address family by that peer shall include a path
   identifier, as described in [ADD-PATH]. The path identifiers have no
   significance to the receiving peer. If the combination of NLRI and
   path identifier in an advertisement from a peer is unique (does not
   match an existing route in the RIB-IN from that peer) then the route
   is added to the RIB-IN. If the combination of NLRI and path
   identifier in a received advertisement is the same as an existing
   route in the RIB-IN from the peer then the new route replaces the
   existing one. If the combination of NLRI and path identifier in a
   received withdrawal matches an existing route in the RIB-IN from the
   peer then that route shall be removed from the RIB-IN.

   A BGP UPDATE message from a peer sending NLRI with the path
   identifier may advertise and withdraw more than one NLRI belonging to
   one or more address families. In this case ADD-PATH may be supported
   for some of the address families and not others. In this situation
   the receiving BGP router should not expect that all of the path
   identifiers in the UPDATE message will be the same.

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines          Feb 2010


3.3. BGP Decision Process

   In order to use multiple paths per NLRI for forwarding and to
   advertise multiple paths per NLRI to ADD-PATH peers, a router
   implementing ADD-PATH must run a modified version of the BGP decision
   process. The existing BGP decision algorithm selects the one best
   path (or set of paths tied for best if multipath is enabled) for any
   particular NLRI. Paths that are second-best or third-best remain in
   the RIB-IN but are not installed in the LOC-RIB and not advertised to
   peers.

   ADD-PATH modifies the BGP decision process to select up to n paths
   for an NLRI, where n should be configurable per BGP instance and per
   address family. n is the maximum number of paths per NLRI that can be
   installed in the LOC-RIB. If multipath is not enabled then the
   decision process finds the single best path, the single second-best
   path, the single third-best path, etc. up to n paths. At each
   iteration of the process only those paths not selected during a
   previous iteration and not having a NEXT_HOP or BGP Identifier (or
   Originator ID) in common with the previously-selected paths are
   eligible for consideration.

   If multipath is enabled (the number of multipaths is configured to be
   m, m>1) then the decision process finds up to m best paths, up to m
   second-best paths, etc. up to a total of n paths. For example, if n
   is configured to be 3 and m (the number of multipaths) is configured
   to be 2 then all of the following results are possible:

   o  1 best path, 1 second-best-path, 1 third-best path

   o  1 best path, 2 second-best paths

   o  2 best paths, 1 second-best path

   ADD-PATH shall not change the tie-breaking criteria used to determine
   whether two paths are equal multipaths.

3.4. Sending Multiple Paths

   By default, and unless changed through routing policies, all paths
   for a particular NLRI in the LOC-RIB shall be advertised to all ADD-
   PATH peers with which the send capability has been negotiated. To all
   other peers (non Add-Path peers and ADD-PATH peers that have
   indicated they do not want to receive multiple paths) only the single
   best path is advertised. A non-best path need not be used for
   forwarding in the local system in order for it to be advertised. All
   advertisements to ADD-PATH peers (and any subsequent withdrawals)


Uttaro, et al.         Expires August 26, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines          Feb 2010


   shall include a path identifier, as described in [ADD-PATH]. Each
   advertised path for a given NLRI must have a unique path identifier.
   When a path is reflected or propagated from one peer to another, the
   path identifier is expected to change, even if there has been no
   change in the NEXT_HOP. A BGP UPDATE message sent to an ADD-PATH peer
   may advertise and withdraw more than one NLRI belonging to one or
   more address families. In this case ADD-PATH may be supported for
   some of the address families and not others and the path identifiers
   associated with different NLRI in the UPDATE message SHOULD be the
   same.

3.5. Using Multiple Paths for Forwarding

   A path must be in the LOC-RIB in order to be used for local
   forwarding. ADD-PATH implementations should provide the flexibility
   to use all paths in the LOC-RIB for forwarding or a subset. If a
   subset is chosen, then the paths in the subset should be equal or
   better than the excluded paths as determined by the BGP decision
   process. Implementations should provide the flexibility to load-
   balance traffic across paths that are determined to be equally-
   preferred by the BGP decision process. It should also be possible to
   designate some paths as standby paths that are used only after
   failure of a more-preferred path.

4. Deployment Guidelines

4.1. Routing Consistency

   As stated earlier, inside an IBGP network, it is critical that all
   the routers have the correct routing view and there is no
   inconsistency in the decision process. It is envisioned that the ADD-
   PATH send capability will be enabled on the route reflectors in most
   of the networks and that the edge router clients will be enabled with
   the ADD-PATH receive capability. In this scenario the route
   reflectors will typically announce the exact same paths to each ADD-
   PATH capable IBGP peer but if not the following guideline must be
   adhered to: if the advertising router (the RR) advertises n paths to
   peer_n and m paths to peer_m, and n < m, then all the paths
   advertised to peer_n must be included in the paths advertised to
   peer_m.  If these rules are not followed routing inconsistencies
   could occur. Note that it is valid to have a mix of ADD-PATH capable
   and non ADD-PATH capable peers and in that case, the non ADD-PATH
   capable peers will receive only the best path.

Internet-Draft  draft-uttaro-idr-add-paths-guidelines          Feb 2010


4.2. ADD-PATH Applications

   There are multiple applications of ADD-PATH support in BGP, the main
   ones being fast connectivity restoration, load balancing, and
   eliminating route oscillation. Depending on the application type, the
   number of paths to advertise for a prefix will vary. For example, for
   fast connectivity restoration, only one additional path (in addition
   to the best path) will suffice to cater to all single point failures.
   For load balancing purposes, the number of paths will depend on the
   operator requirements and service level agreements (one to all). For
   route oscillation elimination, it is required to advertise all group-
   best paths for a prefix. Thus it is important to make a distinction
   on the application type per prefix or group of prefixes and apply the
   route policy on the ADD-PATH advertiser accordingly. This is to make
   sure it does not degenerate to advertising all paths for all prefixes
   that would create unnecessary burden on the routers.
