Abstract

   Some members of the implementation community have expressed confusion
   about the rules and algorithms for processing Internationalized
   Resource Identifiers (IRIs).  This document aims to clarify these
   matters and improve interoperability around IRI processing by
   summarizing the steps required to prepare and parse arbitrary Unicode
   strings as Internationalized Resource Identifiers.  Further goals of
   this document are to define limited scheme-specific rules around IRI
   processing and to define the steps required for producing the
   canonical form of an IRI.

Internet-Draft               IRI Guidelines                    July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) extend the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) specification [RFC3986] by opening up
   various components such as the authority, path, query, and fragment
   to the character space available in Unicode/ISO 10646.  Arbitrary
   Unicode strings may be prepared and parsed into IRI sub-components
   which map directly to the same URI sub-components.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology used in this document.

   reference-string
   The original and unprocessed input string being considered as an IRI
   reference.

   pre-processed-reference-string
   The reference-string that has been through the pre-processing steps.

4.  Pre-processing Arbitrary Unicode Strings

   This section describes the pre-processing steps required to prepare
   an arbitrary Unicode reference-string for later parsing into IRI sub-
   components.

   1.  Remove leading and trailing instances of whitespace (U+0020), CR
       (U+000A), LF (U+000D), and TAB (U+0009) characters from the
       string.
       Reference: Section 7.2 of [1] for details.
   2.  If more than one reference is allowed, split the string into
       substrings on blocks of contiguous whitespace.  Each of one of
       these substrings is an independent reference-string and will be
       processed individually.  If more than one reference is not
       allowed, either remove blocks of contiguous whitespace or replace
       them with a single percent-encoded U+0020 SPACE, written as
       "%20", depending on what is required for the current context.
       Reference: Mentioned in [4].
   3.  If the current string is not already in the UTF-8 encoding,
       transcode the string to the UTF-8 encoding.
       Reference: Section 3.1 of [1].
       TODO SHOULD transcode to UTF-8, MAY transcode to another Unicode
       encoding such as UTF-16?
   4.  Replace each entity references with its corresponding character.
   5.  Normalize the Unicode-encoded string using Unicode Normalization
       Form C [8].
       Reference: Section 3.1 of [1].

   This is the pre-processed-reference-string ready for parsing.


5.  Parsing Unicode Strings into IRI Components

   With an arbitrary IRI string that has been through pre-processing,
   referred to as the "pre-processed-reference-string", this section
   describes the subsequent process of parsing the string into its five
   major IRI sub-components using rules defined by 3896 (using an
   algorithm equivalent to RFC3986 Appendix B) but with updated ABNF of
   3987.  These rules are summarized here.
   Reference: Section 3.2 of [1].

Internet-Draft               IRI Guidelines                    July 2011


5.1.  Identify the scheme

   If the current string does not contain a ":" U+003A then the string
   does not contain a scheme and the pre-processed-reference-string may
   be handled as a relative reference.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   If the first character of the string is not an ALPHA then this is not
   a valid scheme and the pre-processed-reference-string may be handled
   as a relative reference.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   Consume all characters up to but not including the first occurrence
   of ":" U+003A. If the consumed substring contains any characters
   other than ( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." ) then it is not a valid
   scheme and the pre-processed-reference-string may be handled as a
   relative reference.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   The consumed substring at this point is the scheme.  Skip over the
   ":" U+003A character.  Continue parsing the remaining string as an
   authority part.

5.2.  Identify the authority

   The URI authority component may contain userinfo, a host, and a port.
   If the current string does not begin with the two characters "//"
   U+002F U+002F then the string is not an authority and may be handled
   as a path sub-component.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further authority processing

   Consume up to the first occurrence of any one of the authority's
   terminating characters "/" U+002F, "?"  U+003F, "#" U+0023, or the
   end of the string.  This is the authority, also known as the
   iauthority under IRI RFC3987.  Continue further parsing of the
   authority to identify the userinfo, host, and port parts.

Internet-Draft               IRI Guidelines                    July 2011


5.2.1.  Identify the userinfo

   The userinfo may come in the form of a username and password rendered
   as "user:password".  The userinfo part may be parsed according to the
   rules of RFC3986 Section 3.2.1 with the updated ABNF for iuserinfo in
   RFC3987.

   If the authority does not contain a "@" U+0040 then the string does
   not contain a userinfo part and the authority may be parsed for a
   host and port part.

   o  Continue to "Identify the host"
   o  Abort further userinfo processing

   From the beginning of the authority, consume each character up to but
   not including the first occurrence of "@" U+0040.  This is the
   userinfo.

   Split the userinfo on the first occurrence of ":" U+003A if it
   exists.  The part before the ":" is the username and the part after
   is the password.  The ":" being split on is not included in either
   result.

   If a ":" U+003A does not exist in the userinfo, then the userinfo may
   be treated as a username.

   Skip over the first occurrence of "@" U+0040 following the userinfo,
   and continue parsing the remaining authority to identify the host.

5.2.2.  Identify the host

   The host part of authority may contain an IP-literal, IPv4address, or
   a reg-name according to the ABNF rules of RFC3986 updated to support
   Unicode characters in the ireg-name as described in RFC3987.  Consume
   all characters up to but not including the last ":" U+003A character
   or the end of authority.

   If this substring is determined to be an IP-literal or IPv4address,
   then the consumed characters are the host.

   o  If the authority did contain a ":" then continue parsing the
      remaining authority including the ":" character according to the
      "Identify the port" section
   o  Abort further host processing

   Else the substring is determined to be an ireg-name according to the
   ABNF naming convention from RFC3987.  This is the host.

Internet-Draft               IRI Guidelines                    July 2011


   o  If the authority did contain a ":" then the remaining authority
      including the ":" character will be processed according to the
      "Identify the port".
   o  Continue processing the host

   The host SHOULD be processed according to the rules of IDNA2008, but
   MAY be processed according to UTS46 or IDNA2003.  If the host is in
   DNS Internet dot-notaion then it's labels SHOULD be converted to
   punycode.  This is the host.
   TODO: Error handling.  Mention leaving the host name in pure Unicode
   form for intranet/local name scenarios that don't use DNS, e.g.
   WINS?

5.2.3.  Identify the port

   Further processing SHOULD skip the first occurrence of ":" U+003A and
   consume the remaining characters.  If these characters are not *DIGIT
   then the port is invalid.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   Else this is the port.

5.3.  Identify the path

   Consume the remaining pre-processed-reference-string up to but not
   including the first occurrence of a terminating character "?"
   U+003F, "#" U+0023, or the end of the string.

   Percent-encode all characters present from the ucschar list.

   If the path contains any characters not allowed by the ABNF of
   RFC3987 Section 2.2 or Section 7.2 then replace those characters with
   their percent-encoding.

   This is the path.

   If the terminating character was "?" then process the remaining
   string including the leading "?" according to "Identify the query".

   If the terminating character was "#" then process the remaining
   string including the leading "#" according to "Identify the
   fragment".

   TODO: Handling of special characters "/" and "\".

5.4.  Identify the query

   Consume the remaining string starting with the leading "?" and up to
   but not including the first occurrence of "#" or the end of the
   string.

   Percent-encode all characters present from the ucschar list.

   If the path contains any characters not allowed by the ABNF of
   RFC3987 Section 2.2 or the lists in Section 7.2 then replace those
   characters with their percent-encoding.

   This is the query component.

   If the terminating character was "#" then process the remaining
   string including the leading "#" according to "Identify the
   fragment".

   TODO: Handling of special characters "&", "?", "=", and "/"

5.5.  Identify the fragment

   Consume the remaining string starting with the leading "#" and to the
   end of the string.

   Percent-encode all characters present from the ucschar list.

   This is the fragment.

   TODO: Handling of special characters "?" and "/"


6.  Scheme-Specific Processing

   TODO Apply limited scheme-specific rules.

6.1.  http

   (NOTE: Taken directly from RFC3987) For compatibility with existing
   deployed HTTP infrastructure, the following special case applies for
   schemes "http" and "https" and IRIs whose origin has a document
   charset other than one which is UCS-based (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).
   In such a case, the "query" component of an IRI is mapped into a URI
   by using the document charset rather than UTF-8 as the binary
   representation before pct-encoding.  This mapping is not applied for
   any other scheme or component.
   Reference: Section 3.5 of [1].

7.  IRI Canonicalization

   To follow.

   [NOTE: Call out Special Case here or earlier?  The U+005C should be
   either percent-encoded or converted to U+002F. Of course, folks who
   want to name such files will want to use the escaped form of \ in
   order for their site to work in other browsers.

7.1.  Producing a valid URI from an IRI

   Percent-encode IRI components (this is done for the sake of
   interoperability).  For each character which is not allowed anywhere
   in a valid URI, apply the following steps.
   Reference: Section 3.5 of [1].
   o  Action: Convert to UTF-8, i.e., convert the character to a
      sequence of one or more octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629].
      [TODO: Necessary after above?)
   o  Action: Percent-encode, i.e., convert each octet of this sequence
      to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal notation of the octet value.


8.  Security Considerations

   To follow.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.
