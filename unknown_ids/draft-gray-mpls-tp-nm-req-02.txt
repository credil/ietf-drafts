   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


   1. Introduction 

      This document describes the requirements necessary to manage the 
      elements and networks that support an MPLS Transport Profile 
      (MPLS-TP).  It leverages on the management requirements 
      specified in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [1] and RFC 4377 [2]. ITU-T 
      G.7710/Y.1701 [1] specifies generic management requirements for 
      transport (including packet-based and circuit-based) networks. 
      RFC 4377 specifies the OAM requirements, including OAM-related 
      network management requirements, for MPLS networks. This 
      document expands on the requirements in [1] and [2] to cover 
      fault, configuration, performance, and security management for 
      MPLS-TP networks. 

   1.1. Terminology 

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
      in RFC 2119 [6]. 

      Editor's Note: Do we need the bulk of this section, since it 
      will be in the NM-FRAME document?  Should we have the acronyms 
      spelled out in both documents?   

      MPLS-TP NE: a network element (NE) that supports MPLS-TP 
      functions  

      MPLS-TP network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed  

      Data Communication Network (DCN): a network that supports Layer 
      1 (physical layer), Layer 2 (data-link layer), and Layer 3 
      (network layer) functionality for distributed management 
      communications related to the management plane, for distributed 
      signaling communications related to the control plane, and other 
      operations communications (e.g., order-wire/voice 
      communications, software downloads, etc.).  

      Management Communication Network (MCN): A DCN supporting 
      management plane communication is referred to as a Management 
      Communication Network (MCN).  

      Signaling Communication Network (SCN): A DCN supporting control 
      plane communication is referred to as a Signaling Communication 
      Network (SCN).

   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


      Embedded Communication Channel (ECC): a logical channel between 
      network elements (NEs) that can be used - e.g. - for management 
      plane application or control plane applications. The physical 
      channel supporting the ECC is technology specific. An example of 
      physical channels supporting the ECC is a DCC channel within 
      SDH. 

      Management Communication Channel (MCC): an ECC dedicated for 
      management plane communications.  

      Signaling Communication Channel (SCC): an ECC dedicated for 
      control plane communications. The SCC MAY be used for GMPLS/ASON 
      signaling and/or other control plane messages like e.g., routing 
      messages.  

   2.Management Interface Requirements  

      This document does not specify which management interface 
      protocol should be the standard protocol for managing MPLS-TP 
      networks. Managing an end-to-end connection across multiple 
      operator domains where one domain is managed (for example) via 
      NETCONF/XML or SNMP/SMI, and another domain via CORBA/IDL, is 
      allowed.  

      For the management interface to the management system, an MPLS-
      TP NE is not expected to actively support more than one 
      management protocol in any given deployment. The protocol to be 
      supported is at the discretion of the operator.  

   3. Management Communication Channel (MCC) Requirements 

      The MPLS-TP management network SHOULD support seamless management 
      connectivity with remote MPLS-TP domains and NEs as specified 
      generically in ITU-T G.8601 [8] as well as with termination points 
      located in NEs under control by a third party network operator as 
      specified in G.8601. 

      For management purpose, every MPLS-TP NE MUST connect to an OS 
      either directly or indirectly via another MPLS-TP NE. When an 
      MPLS-TP NE is connected indirectly to an OS, an MCC MUST be 
      supported between the MPLS-TP NE and the other MPLS-TP NE.

   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


   4.Management Communication Network (MCN) Requirements 

      Entities of the MPLS-TP management plane communicate via the 
      DCN, or more specifically via the MCN. The MCN connects MPLS-TP 
      NEs with management systems, NEs with NEs, and management 
      systems with management systems. Transport DCN architecture and 
      requirements are specified in ITU-T G.7712/Y.1703 [7], including 
      network layer protocols and their interworking.  

      In order to have the MCN operate properly, a number of 
      management functions for the MCN are required: 

        . Retrieval of DCN network parameters to ensure compatible 
           functioning, e.g. packet size, timeouts, quality of 
           service, window size, etc.; 

        . Establishment of message routing between DCN nodes;  

        . Management of DCN network addresses; 

        . Retrieval of operational status of the DCN at a given node; 

        . Capability to enable/disable access to the DCN. 

   5.Fault Management Requirements 

      The Fault Management functions within an MPLS-TP NE enable the 
      supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction, and 
      reporting of abnormal operation of the MPLS-TP network and its 
      environment. 

   5.1. Supervision Function 

      The supervision function analyses the actual occurrence of a 
      disturbance or fault for the purpose of providing an appropriate 
      indication of performance and/or detected fault condition to 
      maintenance personnel and operations systems. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the following transmission 
      supervision functions:  

        . Supervision of continuity check functions used to detect a 
          broken connection;  

        . Supervision of connectivity check functions used to detect 
          misconnection;  



   Gray, et al               Expires July, 2009               [Page 5] 





   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


        . Supervision of looping check functions used to detect 
          unintended self-replication; 

        . Supervision of Alarms based on native OAM, e.g., AIS (Alarm 
          Indication Signal) and FDI (Forward Defect Indication)  

        . Supervision of Lock indication; 

        . Supervision of Packet loss measurement in both directions 
          of the bidirectional connection;  

        . Supervision of Misinsertion check function used to detect 
          misinserted packet in the connection  

        . Supervision of Diagnostic test; 

        . Supervision of Route tracing; 

        . Supervision of Remote defect indication; 

        . Supervision of the detection of failure in the sequence of 
          a protocol exchange (e.g. automatic protection switching 
          protocol); 

      The MPLS-TP NE transmission-related supervision mechanisms MUST 
      support the flexibility to be configured to perform on-demand or 
      proactively.  

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support supervision for software processing  
      e.g., processing fault, storage capacity problem, version 
      mismatch, Corrupted data, Out of memory, etc. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support hardware-related supervision for 
      interchangeable and non-interchangeable units, cable, and power 
      problem. 

      The MPLS-TP NE SHOULD support environment-related supervision 
      for temperature, humidity, etc. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support supervision of the OAM mechanisms 
      that are deployed for supporting the OAM requirements defined in 
      [3].  

   5.2. Validation Function 

      Validation is concerned with the integration of Fault Causes 
      into Failures. A Fault Cause indicates a limited interruption of 


   Gray, et al               Expires July, 2009               [Page 6] 





   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


      the required transport function. A Fault Cause is not reported 
      to maintenance personnel because it could exist only for a very 
      short time. Note that some of these events however are summed up 
      in the Performance Monitoring process, and when this sum exceeds 
      a certain value, a Threshold Report can be generated. 

      When the Fault Cause lasts long enough, an inability to perform 
      the required transport function arises. This Failure condition 
      is subject to reporting to maintenance personnel and/or OS 
      because corrective action might be required. Conversely, when 
      the Fault Cause ceases after a certain time, clearing of the 
      Failure condition also subject to reporting. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST perform persistency check on fault causes 
      before it declares a fault cause a failure. 

      A transmission failure SHALL be declared if the fault cause 
      persists continuously for a configurable time (Time-D). The 
      failure SHALL be cleared if the fault cause is absent 
      continuously for a configurable time (Time-C).  Typically the 
      default time values would be as follows: 

         Time-D = 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds 

         Time-C = 10 +/- 0.5 seconds 

      These time values are as defined in G.7710 [1]. 

      The failure declaration and clearing MUST be time stamped. The 
      time-stamp SHALL indicate the time at which the fault cause is 
      activated at the input of the fault cause persistency (i.e. 
      defect-to-failure integration) function, and the time at which 
      the fault cause is deactivated at the input of the fault cause 
      persistency function. 

   5.3. Alarm Handling Function 

   5.3.1. Alarm Severity Assignment 

      Failures might be categorized to indicate the severity or 
      urgency of the fault.  

      An MPLS-TP NE SHOULD support the flexibility of assignment of 
      severity (e.g., Critical, Major, Minor, Warning) by the 
      management system.

   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


      See G.7710 [1] for more description about alarm severity 
      assignment. 

   5.3.2. Alarm Suppression 

      An MPLS-TP NE MUST provide alarm suppression functionality that 
      prevents the generation of a superfluous generation of alarms.  

      Examples of alarm suppression mechanism include simply 
      discarding the alarms (or not generating them in the first 
      place), or aggregating the alarms together, thereby greatly 
      reducing the number of alarm notifications to be emitted. 

      An MPLS-TP NE supporting the inter-working of one or more 
      networking technologies (e.g., Ethernet, SDH/SONET, OTN, MPLS) 
      with MPLS-TP MUST be able to translate an MPLS-TP defect into 
      the native technology's error condition. 

      See RFC 4377 [2] for more description. 

   5.3.3. Alarm Reporting Control 

      Alarm Reporting Control (ARC) supports an automatic in-service 
      provisioning capability. Alarm reporting MAY be turned off on a 
      per-managed entity (e.g., LSP) basis to allow sufficient time 
      for customer service testing and other maintenance activities in 
      an "alarm free" state. Once a managed entity is ready, alarm 
      reporting is automatically turned on. 

      An MPLS-TP NE SHOULD support the Alarm Reporting Control 
      function for controlling the reporting of alarm conditions. 

      See G.7710 [1] and RFC 3878 [1] for more description of ARC.    

   5.3.4. Alarm Reporting 

      Alarm Reporting is concerned with the reporting of relevant 
      events and conditions, which occur in the network (including the 
      NE, incoming signal, and external environment). 

      Local reporting is concerned with automatic alarming by means of 
      audible and visual indicators near the failed equipment.  

      An MPLS-TP NE MUST support local reporting of alarms. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support reporting of alarms to an OS. These 
      reports are either autonomous reports (notifications) or reports 


   Gray, et al               Expires July, 2009               [Page 8] 





   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


      on request by maintenance personnel. The MPLS-TP ME SHOULD 
      report local (environmental) alarms to a network management 
      system. 

   6. Configuration Management Requirements 

      Configuration Management provides functions to identify, collect 
      data from, provide data to and control NEs.  Specific 
      configuration tasks requiring network management support include 
      hardware and software configuration, configuration of NEs to 
      support transport paths (including required working and 
      protection paths), and configuration of required path 
      integrity/connectivity and performance monitoring (i.e. - OAM). 

   6.1. Hardware/Software Configuration 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the configuration requirements 
      specified in G.7710 [1] for hardware, software, and date/time. 

   6.2. Path Configuration 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability of configuring 
      required working and/or protection paths. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability of configuring 
      required path performance characteristic thresholds (e.g. - Loss 
      Measurement [LM], Delay Measurement [DM] thresholds). 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability of configuring 
      required path protection as follows: 

          . configure some paths as working and others as protection; 
          . retrieve the status of these paths; 
          . configure the wait to restore time; 
          . operate/release manual protection switching; 
          . operate/release force protection switching; 
          . operate/release protection lockout; 
          . request/set automatic protection switching (APS) 
             parameters. 

   6.3. OAM Configuration 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST provide the capability of configuring the 
      OAM functions specified in [3]. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability to choose which OAM 
      functions to use and which maintenance entity to apply them.   


   Gray, et al               Expires July, 2009               [Page 9] 





   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability of configuring the 
      OAM functions as part of connectivity management, including 
      bidirectional point-to-point connection, uni-directional point-
      to-point connection, and uni-directional point-to-multipoint 
      connection.  

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the configuration of maintenance 
      entity identifiers (e.g. MEP ID and MIP ID) for the purpose of 
      connection connectivity checking.  

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST have the flexibility to configure OAM 
      parameters to meet their specific operational requirements, such 
      as whether (1) one-time on-demand immediately or (2) one-time 
      on-demand pre-scheduled or (3) on-demand periodically based on a 
      specified schedule or (4) proactive on-going.  

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the enabling/disabling of the 
      connectivity check processing. The connectivity check process of 
      the MPLS-TP NE MUST support provisioning of the identifiers to 
      be transmitted and the expected identifiers. 

   7. Performance Management Requirements 

      Performance Management provides functions to evaluate and report 
      upon the behavior of the equipment, NE, and network for the 
      purpose of Maintenance, Bring-into-service, Quality of service, 
      and Performance monitoring for signal degradation. ITU-T 
      Recommendation G.7710 [1] provides transport performance 
      monitoring requirements for packet-switched and circuit-switched 
      transport networks with the objective of providing coherent and 
      consistent interpretation of the network behavior, in particular 
      for hybrid network which consists of multiple transport 
      technologies. The performance management requirements specified 
      in this document are driven by such an objective. 

   7.1. Path Characterization Performance Metrics 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of loss measurement (LM) 
      so that they can be used to detect performance degradation. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of delay measurement (DM) 
      so that they can be used to detect performance degradation. 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support reporting of Performance degradation 
      via fault management for corrective actions (e.g. protection 
      switching).

   Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements        January, 2009 


      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of loss ratio measurement 
      so that they can be used to determine Severely Errored Second 
      (SES). 

      A SES is declared for a one second interval when the ratio of 
      lost packets to total transmitted packets in that one second 
      interval exceeds a predetermined threshold. 

      The packet lost threshold for declaring SES MUST be 
      configurable. 

      The number of SESs MUST be collected per configurable intervals 
      (e.g. 15-minute and 24-hour). 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of SES measurement so 
      that they can be used to determine service unavailable time. 

      A period of unavailable time (UAT) begins at the onset of 10 
      consecutive SES events. These 10 seconds are considered to be 
      part of unavailable time. A new period of available time begins 
      at the onset of 10 consecutive non-SES events. These 10 seconds 
      are considered to be part of available time.  

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of UAS so that they can 
      be used to determine service availability. 

      The number of unavailable time in seconds (UAS) MUST be 
      collected per configurable intervals (e.g. 15-minute and 24-
      hour). 

   7.2.Performance Collection Instrumentation 

   7.2.1. Collection Frequency 

      The performance collection mechanisms MUST support the 
      flexibility to be configured to operate on-demand or proactively 
      (i.e. continuously).  

   7.2.2. Collection Granularity 

      On Packet loss measurement: 

        - For bidirectional (P2P) connection, collection of on-demand 
           single-ended packet loss measurement is required. 

        - For bidirectional (P2P) connection, collection of proactive 
           packet loss measurements for both directions is required.

        - For unidirectional (P2P and P2MP) connection, collection of 
           proactive packet loss measurement is required. 

      On Delay measurement:  

        - For unidirectional (P2P and P2MP) connection, collection of 
           on-demand delay measurement is required. 

        - For bidirectional (P2P) connection, collection of on-demand 
           one-way and two-way delay measurement is required. 

   8. Security Management Requirements 

      The MPLS-TP NE MUST be able to secure the transport plane and 
      control plane. 

   8.1. Management Communication Channel Security 

      Secure channels MUST be provided for all network traffic and 
      protocols used to support management functions.  This MUST 
      include, at least, protocols used for configuration, monitoring, 
      configuration backup, logging, time synchronization, 
      authentication, and routing.  The MCC MUST support application 
      protocols that provide confidentiality and data integrity 
      protection.   

   8.1.1. In-Band management security 

      If in-band management is provided, the MCC MUST support the 
      following: 

        - Use of open cryptographic algorithms (See RFC 3871 [5] 
           section 4.5)  

        - Authentication  

        - Allow management connectivity only from authorized IP 
           addresses or MAC Addresses. 

   8.1.2. Out-of-Band management security 

      The MPLS TP NE MUST support an out-of-band management console 
      port.  The management traffic MUST remain separate from the data 
      and control plane traffic (no routing or forwarding between the 
      management plane and the data/control plane).

   8.2. Signaling Communication Channel Security 

      Secure control plane protocols MAY be used in place of their 
      insecure counterparts.  If an insecure protocol is used, the 
      transport layer protocol MAY be used to secure the SCC. 

   8.3. Distributed Denial of Service 

      Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attack which tries to 
      prevent a target from performing an assigned task, or providing 
      its intended service(s), through any means. A Distributed DoS 
      (DDoS) can multiply attack severity (possibly by an arbitrary 
      amount) by using multiple (potentially compromised) systems to 
      act as topologically (and potentially geographically) 
      distributed attack sources. It is possible to lessen the impact 
      and potential for DDOS by using secure protocols, turning off 
      unnecessary processes, logging and monitoring, and ingress 
      filtering.  RFC 4732 [4] provides background on DOS in the 
      context of the Internet. 

   9. Security Considerations 

      Section 8 lists a set of security requirements that apply to 
      MPLS-TP network management. 

      Provisions to any of the network mechanisms designed to satisfy 
      the requirements described herein are required to prevent their 
      unauthorized use.  Likewise, these network mechanisms MUST 
      provide a means by which an operator can prevent denial of 
      service attacks if those network mechanisms are used in such an 
      attack. 

      Solutions MUST provide mechanisms to prevent this private     
      information from being accessed by unauthorized eavesdropping,     
      or being directly obtained by an unauthenticated network     
      element, system or user. 

      Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization 
      involves extracting a significant amount of information about 
      network construction that the network operator MAY consider 
      private. 

   10. IANA Considerations 

      <insert IANA considerations, if any, here)
