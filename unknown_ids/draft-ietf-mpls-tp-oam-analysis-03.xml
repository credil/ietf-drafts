    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the outcome of the discussions on the 
	  necessary OAM functionality for the first release of MPLS based transport 
	  networks. The discussion is based on the set of requirements for Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) for MPLS based transport networks
	  as defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref>.  An important
	  aspect was to evaluate whether existing OAM tools from the current MPLS
      protocol suite can be used to fulfill these requirements. Eventually, the 
	  purpose of the document is to map the set of functions to a set of tools 
	  based on the existing OAM tool-set.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Scope">
        <t>OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) plays a
        significant role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault
        management and performance monitoring in both the transport and the
        service layers in order to improve their ability to support services
        with guaranteed and strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while
        reducing their operational costs.</t>

        <t><xref target="MPLS-TP Reqs"></xref> in general, and <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> in particular define a set of
        requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
        for MPLS-TP Segments, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) (network
        infrastructure) and Pseudowires (PWs) (services).</t>

		<t>The OAM solution developed by the joint IETF and ITU-T MPLS-TP project 
		has three objectives:</t>
		<t><list style="symbols">
		  <t>The OAM tool-set should be developed based on existing MPLS 
		  architecture, technology, and tool-sets.</t>
		  <t>It should be verified that the OAM tool-set for MPLS transport 
		  networks should be aligned with the comparable tool-set in legacy 
		  transport networks as much as possible.</t>
		  <t>The OAM tool-set developed for MPLS based transport networks needs
		  to be fully inter-operable with existing MPLS OAM tools as documented
		  in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />.</t>
		  </list></t>

		<t>The discussion on the needed OAM tool-set took place, mainly, in the MPLS 
		Interoperability Design Team (the MEAD). A tool-set was agreed upon and was 
		reported to the MPLS working group in Stockholm (July 2009) during the IETF 
		meetings.  This was also judged to be the working group consensus.</t>
		
        <t>This document outlines these recommendations for the tool-set that 
		should be defined to fulfill the OAM functionality requirements as 
		documented in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> and <xref target=
		"MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>.  Based on the objectives cited above, it 
		was determined to base the MPLS-TP OAM tool-set on the following 
		existing MPLS tools:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>LSP-Ping as defined in <xref target="LSP Ping"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) as defined in <xref
            target="BASE BFD"></xref> and refined in <xref
            target="MPLS BFD"></xref>.</t>

            <t>ITU-T OAM for Ethernet tool-set as defined in <xref
            target="Y.1731"></xref> this will be used for functionality
            guidelines for the performance measurement tools that are not
            currently supported in MPLS.</t>
          </list> It should be noted that certain extensions and adjustments
        may be made to the existing MPLS tools, in order to conform to the
        transport environment and the requirements of MPLS based transport 
		networks.</t>

    <section title="Basic OAM infrastructure functionality">
      <t></t>

      <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> defines a set of requirements
      on OAM architecture and general principles of operations which are
      evaluated below:</t>

      <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> requires that<list style="symbols">
          <t>OAM mechanisms in MPLS-TP are independent of the transmission media 
		  and of the client service being emulated by the PW.</t>

          <t>the MPLS-TP OAM must be able to support both an IP based and 
		  non-IP based environment. If the network is IP based, i.e. IP routing 
		  and forwarding are available, then the MPLS-TP OAM tool-set should rely
          on the IP routing and forwarding capabilities. On the other hand, in
          environments where IP functionality is not available, the OAM tools
          must still be able to operate without dependence on IP forwarding
          and routing.</t>

          <t>all OAM protocols support identification information, at least in 
		  the form of IP addressing structure and be extensible to support 
		  additional identification schemes.</t>

          <t>OAM packets and the user traffic are congruent (i.e. OAM packets 
		  are transmitted in-band) and there is a need to differentiate OAM 
		  packets from user-plane ones. Inherent in this requirement is the 
		  principle that MPLS-TP OAM be independent of any existing control-plane, 
		  although it should not preclude use of the control-plane functionality.</t>

          <t>a single OAM technology and consistent OAM capabilities for LSPs, 
		  PWs, and Sections.</t>

          <t>OAM packets may be directed to an intermediate point of a LSP/PW.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The following comprise the document-set that addresses the basic
      requirements listed above:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> document describes
          the architectural framework for conformance to the basic requirements
          listed above. It also defines the basic relationships between the
          MPLS structures, e.g. LSP, PW, and the structures necessary for OAM
          functionality, i.e. the Managed Entity Group, its End-points, and
          Intermediate Points.</t>

          <t>The <xref target="MPLS G-ACH"></xref> document specifies the use
          of the MPLS-TP in- band control channel. This is modeled after the
          VCCV channel described in <xref target="PW ACH"></xref> and allows
          transporting the OAM messages congruently with the data traffic
          while allowing the required identification of the packets. It is
          expected that all of the OAM protocols will be used in conjunction
          with this Generic Associated Channel.</t>

<!--          <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP ACH TLV"></xref> document specifies a
          basic set of TLV fields that could be used by different OAM
          messages, in conjunction with the Generic Associated Channel, to
          supply the additional parameter values necessary for the proper
          functionality.</t>
-->
          <t>The <xref target="MPLS TP Idents"></xref> document addresses the
          need of MPLS-TP to support different addressing spaces. This
          document describes different formats for addresses that could be
          used to identify the transport entities in the network and
          referenced by the different OAM protocols.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="MPLS-TP OAM Functions">
      <t>The following sections discuss the OAM functions that are required in 
	  <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> and expanded upon in <xref 
	  target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification">
        <t>Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) are OAM
        operations generally used in tandem, and compliment each other. These
        functions are generally run pro-actively, but may also be used
        on-demand, either due to bandwidth considerations or for diagnoses of
        a specific condition. Pro-actively <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> 
		states that the function should allow the MEPs to monitor the liveness 
		and connectivity of a transport path. In on-demand mode, this function 
		should support monitoring between the MEPs and, in addition, between 
		a MEP and MIP.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> highlights the need for
        the CC-V messages to include unique identification of the MEG that is
        being monitored and the MEP that originated the message. The function,
        both pro-actively and in on-demand mode, needs to be transmitted at
        regular transmission rates pre-configured by the operator.</t>

        <section title="Documents for CC-V tools">
          <t><xref target="Pro CC-V"></xref> defines the BFD extensions that
          will be used for proactive CC-V applications. While <xref
          target="Demand CV"></xref> provides the LSP-Ping extensions that
          will be used to implement on-demand Connectivity Verification. Both
          of these tools will be used together with the basic tools mentioned
          above in section 2.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Remote Defect Indication">
        <t>Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is used by a path end-point to
        report to its peer end-point that a defect is detected on a
        bi-directional connection between them. <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs">
		</xref> points out that this function may be applied to a unidirectional 
		LSP only if there a return path exists.  <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk">
		</xref> points out that this function is associated with the proactive 
		CC-V function.</t>

        <section title="Documents for RDI">
          <t>The <xref target="Pro CC-V"></xref> document includes an extension 
		  for BFD that would include the RDI indication in the BFD format, and 
		  a specification of how this indication is to be used.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Route Tracing">
        <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> defines that there is a
        need for functionality that would allow a path end-point to identify
        the intermediate and end-points of the path. This function would be
        used in on-demand mode. Normally, this path will be used for
        bidirectional PW, LSP, and sections, however, unidirectional paths may
        be supported only if a return path exists.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Route Tracing">
          <t>The <xref target="Demand CV"></xref> document that specifies the
          LSP-Ping enhancements for MPLS-TP on-demand Connectivity
          Verification includes information on the use of LSP-Ping for route
          tracing of a MPLS-TP transport path.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Alarm Reporting">
        <t>Alarm Reporting is a function used by an intermediate point of a
        path, that becomes aware of a fault on the path, to report to the
        end-points of the path. <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>
        states that this may occur as a result of a defect condition discovered 
		at a server sub-layer. This generates an Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) 
		that continues until the fault is cleared. The consequent action of this 
		function is detailed in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Alarm Reporting">
          <t>MPLS-TP defines a new protocol to address this functionality that
          is documented in <xref target="Fault Mng"></xref>. This protocol
          uses all of the basic mechanisms detailed in Section 2.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Lock Reporting">
        <t>Lock reporting, defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref>,
        is similar to the Alarm Reporting function described above. It is used
        by an intermediate point to notify the end points of a transport path
        that an administrative lock condition exists for this transport
        path.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Lock Reporting">
          <t>MPLS-TP defines a new protocol to address this functionality that

<!--       <section title="Diagnostic">
        <t>The <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> indicates that there is
        need to provide a OAM function that would enable conducting different
        diagnostic tests on a PW, LSP, or Section. The <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> provides two types of specific
        tests to be used through this functionality:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Throughput Estimation &ndash; allowing the provider to verify
            the bandwidth/throughput of a transport path. This is an
            out-of-service tool, that uses special packets of varying sizes to
            test the actual bandwidth and/or throughput of the path.</t>

            <t>Data-plane loopback &ndash; this out-of-service tool that
            causes all traffic that reaches the target node, either a MEP or
            MIP, to be looped back to the originating MEP. For targeting MIPs,
            a co-routed bi-directional path is required.</t>

		  also provides a platform for various flavors of testing functionality.</t>
        </section>  
      </section>  -->

      <section title="Lock Instruct">
        <t>The Lock Instruct function is an administrative control tool that
        allows a path end-point to instruct its peer end-point to lock the
        path. The tool is necessary to support single-side provisioning for
        administrative locking, according to <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk" />. 
		This function is used on-demand.</t>

        defect to a client, in the case that the client does not support alarm
        notification.</t>

      <section title="Packet Loss Measurement">
        <t>Packet Loss Measurement is required, by <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"></xref> to provide a quantification of the
        packet loss ratio on a transport path. This is the ratio of the number
        of user packets lost to the total number of user packets during a
        defined time interval. To employ this function, <xref
        target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"></xref> defines that the two end-points of
        the transport path should exchange counters of messages transmitted
        and received within a time period bounded by loss-measurement
        messages. The framework warns that there may be small errors in the
        computation that result from various issues.</t>

        <section title="Documents for Packet Loss Measurement">
          <t>The <xref target="Loss-Delay"></xref> document describes the protocol

      <section title="Packet Delay Measurement">
        <t>Packet Delay Measurement is a function that is used to measure
        one-way or two-way delay of a packet transmission between a pair of
        the end-points of a path (PW, LSP, or Section), as described in <xref

            node.</t>

            <t>Two-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of
            transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until
            the reception of the last bit of the loop-backed packet by the

          <abstract>
            <t>One desirable application of Bi-directional Forwarding
            Detection (BFD) is to detect a Multi Protocol Label Switched
            (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) data plane failure. LSP-Ping is
            an existing mechanism for detecting MPLS data plane failures and
            for verifying the MPLS LSP data plane against the control plane.
            BFD can be used for the former, but not for the latter. However
            the control plane processing required for BFD control packets is
            relatively smaller than the processing required for LSP-Ping
            messages. A combination of LSP-Ping and BFD can be used to provide
            faster data plane failure detection and/or make it possible to
            provide such detection on a greater number of LSPs. This document
            describes the applicability of BFD in relation to LSP-Ping for
            this application. It also describes procedures for using BFD in
            this environment.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>An essential Operations, Administration and Maintenance
            requirement of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability
            to monitor performance metrics for packet loss and one-way and
            two-way delay for MPLS-TP pseudowires, Label Switched Paths, and
            Sections. This document specifies protocol mechanisms to
            facilitate the efficient and accurate measurement of these
            performance metrics.</t>
