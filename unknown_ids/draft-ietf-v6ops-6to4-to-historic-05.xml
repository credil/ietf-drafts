<section title="Introduction">
  <t>There would appear to be no evidence of any substantial
  deployment of the variant of 6to4 described in <xref
  target="RFC3056"></xref>. Its extension specified in "An Anycast
  Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" <xref target="RFC3068"></xref> has
  been shown to have severe practical problems when used in the
  Internet. This document requests that RFC3056 and RFC3068 be moved
  to Historic status <xref target="RFC2026">as defined in section
  4.2.4</xref>.</t>

  <t>6to4 was designed to help transition the Internet from IPv4 to
  IPv6. It has been a good mechanism for experimenting with IPv6, but
  because of the high failure rates seen with 6to4 <xref
  target="HUSTON"></xref>, end users may end up disabling IPv6 on
  hosts, and content providers are reluctant to make content available
  over IPv6.</t>

  <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-6to4-advisory"></xref> analyses the
  known operational issues and describes a set of suggestions to
  improve 6to4 reliability, given the widespread presence of hosts and
  customer premises equipment that support it.</t>

  <t>The IETF sees no evolutionary future for the mechanism and it is
  not recommended to include this mechanism in new
  implementations.</t>

  <t>IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) <xref
  target="RFC5969"></xref> utilizes the same encapsulation and base
  mechanism as 6to4, and could be viewed as a superset of 6to4 (6to4
  could be achieved by setting the 6rd prefix to 2002::/16). However,
  the deployment model is such that 6rd can avoid the problems
  described here. In this sense, 6rd can be viewed as superseding 6to4
  as described in section 4.2.4 of <xref target="RFC2026"></xref></t>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<section anchor="sec:proc-rules" title="6to4 operational problems">
  <t>6to4 is a mechanism designed to allow isolated IPv6 islands to
  reach each other using IPv6 over IPv4 automatic tunneling. To reach
  the native IPv6 Internet the mechanism uses relay routers both in
  the forward and reverse direction. The mechanism is supported in
  many IPv6 implementations. With the increased deployment of IPv6,
  the mechanism has been shown to have a number of fundamental
  shortcomings.</t>

  <t>6to4 depends on relays both in the forward and reverse direction
  to enable connectivity with the native IPv6 Internet. A 6to4 node
  will send IPv4 encapsulated IPv6 traffic to a 6to4 relay, that is
  connected both to the 6to4 cloud and to native IPv6. In the reverse
  direction a 2002::/16 route is injected into the native IPv6 routing
  domain to attract traffic from native IPv6 nodes to a 6to4 relay
  router. It is expected that traffic will use different relays in the
  forward and reverse direction. RFC3068 adds an extension that allows
  the use of a well known IPv4 anycast address to reach the nearest
  6to4 relay in the forward direction.</t>

  <t>One model of 6to4 deployment as described in section 5.2,
  RFC3056, suggests that a 6to4 router should have a set of managed
  connections (via BGP connections) to a set of 6to4 relay
  routers. While this makes the forward path more controlled, it does
  not guarantee a functional reverse path. In any case this model has
  the same operational burden as manually configured tunnels and has
  seen no deployment in the public Internet.</t>

  <t>List of some of the known issues with 6to4:</t>
  <t><list style="symbols">
    <t>Use of relays. 6to4 depends on an unknown third- party to
    operate the relays between the 6to4 cloud and the native IPv6
    Internet.</t>

    <t>The placement of the relay can lead to increased latency, and
    in the case the relay is overloaded, packet loss.</t>

    <t>There is generally no customer relationship between the
    end-user and the relay operator, or even a way for the end-user to
    know who the relay operator is, so no support is possible.</t>

    <t>A 6to4 relay for the reverse path and an anycast 6to4 relay
    used for the forward path, are openly accessible, limited
    only by the scope of routing. 6to4 relays can be used to anonymize
    traffic and inject attacks into IPv6 that are very difficult to
    trace.</t>

    <t>6to4 may silently discard traffic in the case where protocol
    (41) is blocked in intermediate firewalls. Even if a firewall sent
    an ICMP message unreachable back, an IPv4 ICMP message rarely
    contains enough of the original IPv6 packet so that it can be
    relayed back to the IPv6 sender. That makes this problem hard to
    detect and react upon by the sender of the packet.</t>

    <t>As 6to4 tunnels across the Internet, the IPv4 addresses used
    must be globally reachable. RFC3056 states that a private address
    <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> MUST NOT be used. 6to4 will not
    work in networks that employ other addresses with limited
    topological span.</t>

  </list></t>

</section>

<section title="Deprecation">
  <t>This document formally deprecates the 6to4 transition mechanism
  and the IPv6 6to4 prefix defined in <xref target="RFC3056"></xref>,
  i.e., 2002::/16. The prefix MUST NOT be reassigned for other use
  except by a future IETF standards action.</t>

  <t>Disabling 6to4 in the IPv6 Internet will take some time. The
  initial approach is to make 6to4 a service of "last resort" in host
  implementations, ensure that the 6to4 service is disabled by default
  in 6to4 routers, and deploy native IPv6 services. In order to limit
  the impact of end-users, it is recommended that operators retain
  their existing 6to4 relay routers and follow the recommendations
  found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-6to4-advisory"></xref>. When
  traffic levels diminish, these routers can be decommissioned.</t>

  <t>IPv6 nodes SHOULD treat 6to4 as a service of "last resort" as
  recommended in <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise"></xref></t>

  <t>Implementations capable of acting as 6to4 routers SHOULD NOT
  enable 6to4 without explicit user configuration. In particular,
  enabling IPv6 forwarding on a device, SHOULD NOT automatically
  enable 6to4.</t>

  <t>Existing implementations and deployments MAY continue to use 6to4.</t>

  <t>The references to 6to4 should be removed as soon as practical
  from the revision of the Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <xref
  target="RFC5156"></xref>.</t>

  <t>The references to the 6to4 relay anycast addresses
  (192.88.99.0/24) should be removed as soon as practical from the
  revision of the Special Use IPv4 addresses <xref
  target="RFC5735"></xref>.</t>

  <t>Incidental references to 6to4 should be removed from other IETF
  documents if and when they are updated.  These documents include
  RFC3162, RFC3178, RFC3790, RFC4191, RFC4213, RFC4389, RFC4779,
  RFC4852, RFC4891, RFC4903, RFC5157, RFC5245, RFC5375, RFC5971, and
