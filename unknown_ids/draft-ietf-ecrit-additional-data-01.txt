              Additional Data related to an Emergency Call
                draft-ietf-ecrit-additional-data-00.txt

Abstract

   When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, the device that sends it,
   as well as any service provider in the path of the call, or access
   network may have information about the call which the PSAP may be
   able to use.  This document describes an XML data structure that
   contains this kind of information in a standardized form.  A URI that
   points to the structure can be included in the SIP signaling with the
   call, or the data may be included in the body of a SIP message.

Internet-Draft             Additional Data URI                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, there is a rich set of data
   in the headers with the call, but the device, as well as any other
   service provider in the path may have even more information that
   would be useful to a PSAP.  This information may include the identity
   and contact information of the service provider, subscriber identity
   and contact information, the type of service the service provider
   provides, what kind of device the user has, etc.  Some kinds of
   devices or services have device or service dependent data.  For
   example, a car telematics system or service may have crash
   information.  A medical monitoring device may have sensor data.
   While the details of the information may vary by device or service,
   there needs to be a common way to send such data to a PSAP.

   For the call takers this will enable more intelligent decision making
   and therefore better response in case of an emergency.  A pre-
   requisite is to offer the technical capabilities to let call takers
   to gain access to this information stored elsewhere (granted that
   they have authorization to access it).

   This document focuses on the data that can be obtained about a call
   and a mechanism for transporting it in an existing SIP header field,
   the Call-Info header.  For this purpose a new token, namely
   'emergencyCallData' is defined to be carried in the "purpose"
   parameter.  If the "purpose" parameter set to 'emergencyCallData'
   then the Call-Info contains a HTTPS URL that points to a data
   structure with information about the call or a CID that allows the
   data structure to be placed in the body of the message.  In addition,
   this document describes a "provided-by" namespace per [RFC4119] for
   passing information known to the access network

   The data is defined as a series of "blocks" that represent a class of
   information.  Each of the blocks is a MIME type, and an extensible
   set of these types constitute the data structure.  A registry is
   defined to list the block types that may be included.

   The data structure contains an element which itself is a URI that has
   device or service dependent data.  Thus the common Additional Data
   about a Call defined by this document contains a 'hook', in the form
   of a URI for a device or service dependent data structure.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Additional Data about a Call

   The Additional Data about a Call is information specific to a call
   known by the device that sends it or a service provider in the path
   of a call or in the access network the call originates in.  The
   Additional Data about a Call is a set of information blocks.  Each
   block is a MIME type, and any set of blocks may be included in the
   set.

   Three mechanisms are provided to transport the data set.  A URI to
   the data set may be inserted in a SIP INVITE or MESSAGE transaction
   with a Call-Info header containing a purpose of "emergenyCallData".
   If the data is provided by reference, it may be retrieved with an
   HTTPS Get from the URI.  The URI MUST specify an HTTPS scheme, and
   TLS protection for the data MUST be negotiated.

   The data may be supplied by value in a SIP INVITE or MESSAGE message.
   In this case, Content Indirection [RFC2392] is used, with the CID URL
   pointing to the body of the message.

   More than one Call-Info header with an emergencyCallData purpose can
   be expected.  The device may insert one, and any intermediary service
   provider may insert its own.  When there are multiple intermediaries
   each intermediary may each insert one.  For example, a device may
   provide one, a telematics service provider may provide one and the
   mobile carrier handling the call may provide one.

   The access network may supply Additional Data about a Call.  For this
   purpose, this document defines a namespace and adds the namespace to
   the "provided-by" registry defined by [RFC4119]

   Additional Data about a Call is defined as a series of blocks.  Each
   block is defined as a mime type, with an XML data structure.  MIME-
   multipart is used to enclose the set of blocks constituting the
   information provided by an entity (service provider or device).  The
   sections below define the blocks.

3.1.  Data Provider Information Block

   This block is intended to be provided by any service provider in the
   path of the call or the access network provider.  It includes
   identification and contact information.  This block SHOULD be
   provided for every service provider in the path of the call, and the
   access network provider.  Devices also use this block to provide
   identifying information.  The MIME type is "addDataProviderInfo".

   Data Element:  Device Classification


   Use:  Optional


   XML Element:  <DeviceClassification>


   Description:  If the device provides the data structure, the device
      information should be provided.  If the Service Provider provides
      the structure and it knows what the device is, the Service
      Provider should provide the device information.  Often the carrier
      does not know what the device is.  It is possible to receive 2
      data structures, one created by the device and one created by the
      Service Provider.  Information about the device, not how it is
      being used.  This data element defines the kind of device making
      the emergency call.  A registry will reflect the following valid
      entries:

   Reason for Need:  The device classification describes the capability
      of the calling device.  For example, does the device require human
      intervention to initiate a call or is this call the result of
      programmed instructions.  Does the calling device have the ability
      to rebid for location or condition changes?  Is this device
      interactive or a one-way reporting device?


   How Used by Call Taker:  May assist with location of caller.  For
      example, a cordless handset may be outside or next door.  May
      provide calltaker some context about the caller.

      a uniform naming convention.  A registry will reflect the valid
      entries.


   Reason for Need:  Used by PSAP management for post-mortem
      investigation/resolution.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by calltaker, but by PSAP
      management.

   Description:  Characters that identify the specific device making the
      call or creating an event.


   Reason for Need:  May be needed when trying to obtain a subpoena to
      obtain customer information in instances where location info did
      not display or someone is making false emergency calls.  May also
      be used when working with safe houses that are using non-
      initialized phones.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Probably not used by calltaker they would
      need to refer to management for investigation.

Internet-Draft             Additional Data URI                 July 2011


      *  Manufacturer Serial Number


   Reason for Need:  Calls from uninitiated devices would give an
      identifier that could be associated with erroneous calls --- use
      the number to identify what type of capabilities there are.  Could
      also use this information to block specific types of calls.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Additional information that may be used to
      assist with call handling.

3.3.6.  Device/service specific additional data structure

   Data Element:  Device/service specific additional data structure


   Use:  Optional


   XML Element:  <devicespecificSchema>


   Description:  A URI representing additional data whose schema is
      specific to the device or service which created it.  An example is
      the VEDs structure for a vehicle telematics device.  The structure
      can be referenced via URI and used in the policy routing function
      business rules/policies or for access by call takers or
      responders.  Non-NENA XML schemas must be registered.  Some
      possible sources are:

      *  NPAC

      *  Hazmat International Association of Fire Chiefs

      *  DHS/EPA E-Plan for HazMat

      *  NFPA - National Fire Protection Association

      *  National Alliance for Public Safety GIS (NA-PSG)

      *  US DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
         (PHMSA) examples of additional data.

      *  Fire Service Data Model

      *  IEEE 1512 - USDOT Model for traffic incidents

Internet-Draft             Additional Data URI                 July 2011


      *  Smart Building (NIST)

      *  VEDS

      Different data may be created by each classification; i.e.,
      telematics creates VEDS data set - can be different types of data
      depending on device.  May want to describe type of data for each
      device.


   Reason for Need:  This data element will allow for identification of
      externally defined schemas, which may have additional data that
      will assist in emergency response.


   How Used by Call Taker:  This data element will allow the end user
      (calltaker or first responder) to know what type of additional
      data may be available to aid in providing the needed emergency
      services.

3.4.  Regulatory Information

   In some jurisdictions, handling of emergency calls involves
   information known by a service provider that must, by regulation, be
   passed to the emergency system.  The mime type is "addCallReg".

3.4.1.  Telephone Number Privacy Indicator

   Data Element:  Telephone Number Privacy Indicator


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <TNPrivacyIndicator>


   Description:  Some State regulations require that Non-Published
      subscriber name remains private to all including 9-1-1.  Where
      this regulation is in place, the end user's name must be overlaid
      with blanks or the verbiage, "Non-Published Number."


   Reason for Need:  Some State regulations require that Non-Published
      subscriber name remains private to all including emergency calls.
      Where this regulation is in place, the end user's name must be
      overlaid with blanks or the verbiage, "Non-Published Number".

Internet-Draft             Additional Data URI                 July 2011


   How Used by Call Taker:  This is not beneficial to PSAPs; however,
      they must follow state regulations.  This indicator will allow for
      coding that overlays the non-published subscriber name with the
      verbiage "Non-Published Number."

3.5.  Owner/Subscriber Information

   This block describes the owner of the device (if provided by the
   device) or the subscriber information, if provided by a service
   provider.  The contact location is NOT necessarily the location of
   the caller or incident, but is rather the nominal contact address.
   The mime type is "addCallSub".

3.5.1.  vCARD for Subscriber's Data

   Data Element:  vCARD for Subscriber's Data


   Use:  Required


   XML Element:  <SubscriberData>


   Description:  Information known by the Service Provider about the
      subscriber; i.e., Name, Address, Calling Party Number, Main
      Telephone Number and any other data.  If the subscriber is an
      enterprise, this is the vCARD of the enterprise and the Company
      Name is used not the Name of the Caller.  The telephone number is
      the main telephone number at the location of the call.  The
      address should be where the call is originating from.


   Reason for Need:  Critical information required for proper call
      handling and dispatching.


   How Used by Call Taker:  Critical information required for proper
      call handling and dispatching.

5.  Security Considerations

   The information in this data structure will usually be considered
   private.  HTTPS is specified to require the provider of the
   information to validate the credentials of the requester.  While the
   creation of a PKI that has global scope may be difficult, the
   alternatives to creating devices and services that can provide
   critical information securely are more daunting.

   The Call-info header with purpose='emergencyCallData' MUST only be
   sent on an emergency call, which can be ascertained by the presence
   of an emergency service urn in a Route header of a SIP message.

   <how recipient validates credentials of sender>

   <how sender validates credentials of recipient>

   <how sender validates credentials of anyone requesting device
   dependent data>

   There is much private data in this information.  Local regulations
   may govern what data must be provided in emergency calls, but in
   general, the emergency call system is often aided by the kinds of
   information described in this document.  There is a tradeoff between
   the privacy considerations and the utility of the data.  Certainly,
   if the data cannot be protected, due to failure of the TLS mechanisms
   described here, data not required by regulation SHOULD not be sent.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  'emergencyCallData' Purpose Parameter Value

   This document defines the 'emergencyCallData' value for the "purpose"
   parameter of the Call-Info header field.  A reference to this RFC (in
   double brackets) has been added to the existing "purpose" Call-Info
   parameter entry in the SIP Parameters registry, which currently looks
   as follows:


                                       Predefined
      Header Field    Parameter Name     Values     Reference
      -------------   --------------   ---------   ---------
      Call-Info         purpose           Yes      [RFC3261][RFC5367]

6.2.  provided-by registry entry

   This section registers the namespace specified in ??? in the
   provided-by registry established by RFC4119.

   TBD

6.3.  MIME registrations

   TBD

6.4.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:additional-data

   This section registers a new XML namespace, as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:additional-data

   Registrant Contact:  IETF, ECRIT working group, <ecrit@ietf.org>, as
      delegated by the IESG <iesg@ietf.org>.
