                   RADIUS issues in IPv6 deployments
                  draft-hu-v6ops-radius-issues-ipv6-00

Abstract

   RADIUS is a protocol that provides centralized authentication,
   authorization and accounting management for users to connect network
   services.  In current practical broadband networks, RADIUS protocol
   is widely used by ISPs when provisioning subscribers the access
   services (e.g.  PPPoE).  The RADIUS protocol has currently been
   specified to support both IPv4 and IPv6, while there are some issues
   emerging from the deployments of IPv6.

   Notes: This initial version is just to get the work started, and will
   be updated soon.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS issues IPv6              February 2011


1.  Introduction

   For the IPv6 network access, IPv6 related Attributes are specified in
   [RFC3162], [RFC4818], [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access].  Still, there
   are some RADIUS operation issues that were missed or newly emerged.
   This document tries to discuss these issues learnt from the IPv6
   deployments and the possible solution spaces..

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Issue 1: Identification of users of different protocols

   Although Attributes are defined to convey configuration information
   for different users (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, and other protocols) over
   given access service, there is no Attribute specified for identifying
   or authorizing the categories of users of different protocols (e.g.,
   v4-only, v6-only, dual stack, or other protocols).  Particularly, in
   the case where configuration information assignment of different
   network protocols are managed by NAS but not along with the
   centralized authentication and authorization by RADIUS server, a
   means is needed to notify NAS the categories of users according to
   the result of authentication and authorization, either explicitly
   (define a new attribute) or implicitly (re-use existing attributes).

2.2.  Issue 2: Network or Host on Customer Premises?

   In the provisioning mode where user!_s network is connected through a
   RG for instance, a delegated prefix is needed to be assigned to the
   RG which behaves as the delegating router.  Or in other provisioning
   mode, only a framed IPv6 address/prefix is needed to be assigned to
   the accessing host.  If the assignment is centralized managed by the
   RADIUS server, the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute [RFC4818] or
   Frame-IPv6-Address/Prefix should be used accordingly to convey the
   information to authorized users.  While if the configuration
   information assignment is managed by NAS, there needs a means for
   RADIUS server to notify NAS whether the user is authorized to be
   assigned a delegated prefix or just a framed IPv6 address /prefix to
   its NAS facing interface.

   The possible approach can be either to define a dedicated Attribute
   for the explicit notification, or to specify the rule of

   implementation of Attributes related, for example Frame-IPv6-Address/
   Prefix Attribute and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute with special
   value on RADIUS server for the notification to NAS as an instruction.

2.3.  Issue 3: Protocol Specific Accounting

   Accounting operations and Attributes are specified in [RFC2866] to
   collect statistics for all traffic (including IPv4, IPv6, and other
   protocols).  In current practice, generally it is simply treated as
   the statistics for IPv4 traffic.  That works well since in most
   cases, only IPv4 connectivity is provided over given access service
   (e.g., PPPoE).  While if IPv6 connectivity is provided as well, for
   instance, there is no means by which the statistics for traffic of
   respective protocols can be collected.

   When to START/STOP the accounting in the context of multiple
   protocols?  And based on different accounting policies of operators?
   (More elaborations needed)


3.  Solution Space

   The current practice or tentative solutions to the issues above will
   be listed in this section.
