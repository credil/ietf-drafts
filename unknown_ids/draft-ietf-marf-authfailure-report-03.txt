1.  Introduction

   [ARF] defines a message format for sending reports of abuse in the
   messaging infrastructure, with an eye towards automating both the
   generation and consumption of those reports.  There is now also a
   desire to use extend the ARF format to include reporting of messages
   that fail to authenticate using known authentication methods, as
   these are sometimes evidence of abuse that can be detected and
   reported through automated means.  The same mechanism can be used to
   convey forensic information about the specific reason the
   authentication method failed.  Thus, this memo presents such
   extensions to the Abuse Reporting Format to allow for detailed
   reporting of message authentication failures.

3.  Extension ARF Fields for Authentication Failure Reporting

   The current report format defined in [ARF] lacks some specific
   features required to do effective sender authentication reporting.
   This section defines extensions to ARF to accommodate this
   requirement.

3.1.  New ARF Feedback Type

   A new feedback type of "auth-failure" is defined as an extension to
   Section 8.2 of [ARF].  See Section 3.3 for details.

   A message that uses this feedback type has the following modified
   header field requirements for the second (machine-parseable) MIME
   part of the report:

   Authentication-Results:  MUST appear at least once, and SHOULD report
      all methods that were tested by the entity generating the report.
      It MUST be formatted according to [AUTH-RESULTS].

   Original-Envelope-Id:  As specified in [ARF].  This field SHOULD be
      included exactly once if it available to the entity generating the
      report.

   Original-Mail-From:  As specified in [ARF].  This field SHOULD be
      included exactly once for SPF, or for other methods that evaluate
      authentication during the SMTP phase.

   Source-IP:  As specified in [ARF].  This field SHOULD be included
      exactly once for SPF, or for other methods that evaluate
      authentication during the SMTP phase.

   Reported-Domain:  As specified in [ARF].  This field MUST appear at
      least once.

   Delivery-Result:  As specified in Section 3.2.1 is OPTIONAL, MUST NOT
      appear more than once.  If present, it SHOULD indicate the outcome
      of the message in some meaningful way, but might be redacted to
      'other' for local policy reasons.

   The third MIME part of the message is either of type "message/rfc822"
   (as defined in [MIME-TYPES]) or "text/rfc822-headers" (as defined in
   [REPORT]) and contains a copy of the entire header block from the
   original message.  This part MUST be included (contrary to [REPORT]).

   For privacy reasons, report generators might need to redact portions
   of a reported message such as the end user whose complaint action
   resulted in the report.  See Section 5 for a discussion of this.

3.2.  New ARF Header Field Names

   The following new ARF field names are defined as extensions to
   Section 3.1 of [ARF].

   The values that are base64 encodings may contain FWS for formatting
   purposes as per the usual header field wrapping defined in [MAIL].
   During decoding, any characters not in the base64 alphabet are
   ignored so that such line wrapping does not harm the value.  The ABNF
   token "FWS" is defined in [DKIM].

3.2.1.  Required For All Reports

   Auth-Failure:  Indicates the type of authentication failure that is
      being reported.  The list of valid values is enumerated below.

   Delivery-Result:  The final message disposition that was enacted by
      the ADMD generating the report.  Possible values are:

      delivered:  The message was delivered (not specific as to where).

      spam:  The message was delivered to the recipient's spam folder
         (or equivalent).

      policy:  The message was not delivered to the intended inbox due
         to authentication failure.  The specific action taken is not
         specified.

      reject:  The message was rejected.

      other:  The message had a final disposition not covered by one of
         the above values.

3.2.2.  Required For DKIM Reports

   DKIM-Domain:  The domain that signed the message, taken from the "d="
      tag of the signature.

   DKIM-Identity:  The identity of the signature that failed
      verification, taken from the "i=" tag of the signature.

   DKIM-Selector:  The selector of the signature that failed
      verification, taken from the "s=" tag of the signature.

Internet-Draft           Auth Failure Reporting             October 2011


3.2.3.  Optional For DKIM Reports

   DKIM-Canonicalized-Header and DKIM-Canonicalized-Body MUST NOT
   include redacted data.  The data presented there have to be exactly
   the canonicalized header and body as defined by [DKIM] and computed
   at the verifier.  This is because these fields are intended to aid in
   identifying message alterations that invalidate DKIM signatures in
   transit.  Including redacted data in them renders the data unusable.
   (See also Section 5 and Section 7.6 for further discussion.)

   DKIM-Canonicalized-Header:  A base64 encoding of the canonicalized
      header of the message as generated by the verifier.

   DKIM-Canonicalized-Body:  A base64 encoding of the canonicalized body
      of the message as generated by the verifier.

3.2.4.  Required For ADSP Reports

   DKIM-ADSP-DNS: Includes the ADSP record discovered and applied by the
   entity generating this report.

3.2.5.  Required For SPF Reports

   SPF-DNS MUST appear once for every query to an SPF record that was
   done, to enable the reporting of included fields and where they came
   from.  The ABNF in Section 4 changes; see below.

3.3.  Authentication Failure Types

   The list of defined authentication failure types, used in the "Auth-
   Failure:" header field (defined above), is as follows:

   adsp:  The message did not conform to the sender's published [ADSP]
      signing practises.  The DKIM-ADSP-DNS field MUST be included in
      the report.

   bodyhash:  The body hash in the signature and the body hash computed
      by the verifier did not match.  The DKIM-Canonicalized-Body field
      SHOULD be included in the report.

   revoked:  The DKIM key referenced by the signature on the message has
      been revoked.  The DKIM-Domain and DKIM-Selector fields MUST be
      included in the report.

   signature:  The DKIM signature on the message did not successfully
      verify against the header hash and public key.  The DKIM-Domain,
      DKIM-Selector and DKIM-Canonicalized-Header fields MUST be
      included in the report.

Internet-Draft           Auth Failure Reporting             October 2011


   spf:  The evaluation of the sending domain's SPF record produced a
      "fail", "softfail", "temperror" or "permerror" result.

   Supplementary data MAY be included in the form of [MAIL]-compliant
   comments.  For example, "Auth-Failure: adsp" could be augmented by a
   comment to indicate that the failed message was rejected because it
   was not signed when it should have been.  See Appendix B for
   examples.

4.  Syntax For Added ARF Header Fields

   The ABNF definitions for the new fields are as follows:

       auth-failure = "Auth-Failure:" [CFWS] token [CFWS] CRLF
         ; "token" must be a registered authentication failure type
         ; as specified elsewhere in this memo

       delivery-result = "Delivery-Result:" [CFWS]
                         ( "delivered" / "spam" /"policy" /
                           "reject" / "other" ) [CFWS] CRLF

       dkim-header = "DKIM-Canonicalized-Header:" [CFWS]
                     base64string CRLF
         ; "base64string" is imported from [DKIM]

       dkim-domain = "DKIM-Domain:" [CFWS] domain [CFWS] CRLF

       dkim-identity = "DKIM-Identity:" [CFWS] [ local-part ] "@"
                       domain-name [CFWS] CRLF
         ; "local-part" is imported from [MAIL]

       dkim-selector = "DKIM-Selector:" [CFWS] token [CFWS] CRLF

       dkim-adsp-dns = "DKIM-ADSP-DNS:" [CFWS]
                       quoted-string [CFWS] CRLF
         ; "quoted-string" is imported from [MAIL]

       dkim-body = "DKIM-Canonicalized-Body:" [CFWS]
                   base64string CRLF

       dkim-selector-dns = "DKIM-Selector-DNS:" [CFWS]

5.  Redacting Data

   For privacy considerations it might be the policy of a report
   generator to redact, or obscure, portions of the report that might
   identify an end user that caused the report to be generated.
   Precisely how this is done is unspecified in [ARF] as it will
   generally be a matter of local policy.  That specification does
   admonish generators against being overly zealous with this practice,
   as obscuring too much data makes the report inactionable.

   Generally, it is assumed that the recipient fields of a message (i.e.
   those containing recipient addresses), when copied into a report, are
   to be obscured to protect the identify of an end user that submitted
   a complaint about a message.  However, it is also presumed that other
   data will be left intact, data that could be correlated against logs
   to determine the source of the message that drew a complaint.

   See [I-D.IETF-MARF-REDACTION] for further details.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues with respect to these reports are similar to those
   found in [DSN].

7.1.  Inherited Considerations

   Implementers are advised to consider the Security Considerations
   sections of [DKIM], [ADSP] [SPF] and [ARF].

7.2.  Forgeries

   These reports may be forged as easily as ordinary Internet electronic
   mail.  User agents and automatic mail handling facilities (such as
   mail distribution list exploders) that wish to make automatic use of
   DSNs of any kind should take appropriate precautions to minimize the
   potential damage from denial-of-service attacks.

   Security threats related to forged DSNs include the sending of:

   a.  A falsified authentication failure notification when the message
       was in fact delivered to the indicated recipient;

   b.  Falsified signature information, such as selector, domain, etc.

   Perhaps the simplest means of mitigating this threat is to assert
   that these reports should themselves be signed with something like
   DKIM.  On the other hand, if there's a problem with the DKIM
   infrastructure at the verifier, signing DKIM failure reports may
   produce reports that aren't trusted or even accepted by their
   intended recipients.

7.3.  Automatic Generation

   Automatic generation of these reports by verifying agents can cause a
   denial-of-service attack when a large volume of e-mail is sent that
   causes sender authentication failures for whatever reason.

   Limiting the rate of generation of these messages may be appropriate
   but threatens to inhibit the distribution of important and possibly
   time-sensitive information.

   In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is suggested that report
   generators only create these (or any) ARF reports after an out-of-
   band arrangement has been made between two parties.  This mechanism
   then becomes a way to adjust parameters of an authorized abuse report
   feedback loop that is configured and activated by private agreement
   rather than starting to send them automatically based solely on

   discovered data in the DNS.

7.4.  Envelope Sender Selection

   In the case of transmitted reports in the form of a new message, it
   is necessary to consider the construction and transmission of the
   message so as to avoid amplification attacks, deliberate or
   otherwise.  See Section 5 of [ARF] for further information.

7.5.  Reporting Multiple Incidents

   If it is known that a particular host generates abuse reports upon
   certain incidents, an attacker could forge a high volume of messages
   that will trigger such a report.  The recipient of the report could
   then be innundated with reports.  This could easily be extended to a
   distributed denial-of-service attack by finding a number of report-
   generating servers.

   The incident count referenced in [ARF] provides a limited form of
   mitigation.  The host generating reports may elect to send reports
   only periodically, with each report representing a number of
   identical or near-identical incidents.  One might even do something
   inverse-exponentially, sending reports for each of the first ten
   incidents, then every tenth incident up to 100, then every 100th
   incident up to 1000, etc. until some period of relative quiet after
   which the limitation resets.

   The use of this for "near-identical" incidents in particular causes a
   degradation in reporting quality, however.  If for example a large
   number of pieces of spam arrive from one attacker, a reporting agent
   may decide only to send a report about a fraction of those messages.
   While this averts a flood of reports to a system administrator, the
   precise details of each incident are similarly not sent.

7.6.  Redaction of Data in DKIM Reports

   This memo requires that the canonicalized header and body be returned
   without being subject to redaction when a DKIM failure is being
   reported.  This is necessary to ensure that the returned
   canonicalized forms are useful for debugging as they must be compared
   to the equivalent form at the signer.  If a message is altered in
   transit, and the returned data are also redacted, the redacted
   portion and the altered portion may overlap, rendering the comparison
   results meaningless.  However, unredacted data can leak information
   the reporting entity considers to be private.  It is for this reason
   the return of the canonicalized forms is rendered optional.

   Example 3: Example ARF report using these extensions

   This example ARF message is making the following assertion:

   o  DKIM verification of the signature added within "example.com"
      failed

   o  The cause for the verification failure was a mismatch between the
      body contents observed at the verifier and the body hash contained
      in the signature.
