       This memo provides guidelines for authors and reviewers
       of standards track specifications containing YANG
       data model modules.   Applicable
       portions may be used as a basis for reviews of other 
       YANG data model documents.  Recommendations and
       procedures are defined, which are intended to
       increase interoperability and usability
       of NETCONF implementations which utilize
       YANG data model modules.

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
       The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use 
       with the <xref target="RFC4741">NETCONF</xref> protocol 
       requires a modular set of data models, which can be reused
       and extended over time.
     </t>
     <t>
       This document defines a set of usage guidelines for
       standards track documents containing 
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang">
       YANG</xref> data models.  It is similar to
       the MIB usage guidelines specification
       <xref target="RFC4181"/> in intent and structure.
     </t>
     <t>
       Many YANG constructs are defined as optional to use, such as
       the description clause.  However, in order to
       maximize interoperability of NETCONF implementations
       utilizing YANG data models, it is desirable to
       define a set of usage guidelines which may require
       a higher level of compliance than the minimum level
       defined in the YANG specification.
     </t>
     <t>
       This document defines usage guidelines related to
       the NETCONF operations layer, and NETCONF
       content layer, as defined in <xref target="RFC4741" />.
     </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Terminology">
     <section title="Requirements Notation">
       <t>
	 The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	 "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	 and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	 described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         RFC 2119 language is used here to express the views of the NETMOD
         working group regarding YANG module content.  Yang modules complying
         with this document will treat the RFC 2119 terminology as if it were
         describing best current practices.

   <section title="General Documentation Guidelines" anchor="GenGuidelines">
     <t>
       YANG data model modules under review are likely to be 
       contained in Internet Drafts.   All guidelines for
       Internet Draft authors MUST be followed.  These
       guidelines are available online at:
       <vspace blankLines="1"/>
       http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-editor/instructions2authors.txt
     </t>
     <t>
       The following sections MUST be present in an Internet Draft
       containing a module:
       <list style="symbols">
	 <t>YANG data model boilerplate section</t>
	 <t>Narrative sections</t>
	 <t>Definitions section</t>
	 <t>Security Considerations section</t>
	 <t>IANA Considerations section</t>
	 <t>References section</t>
       </list>
     </t>

     <section anchor="IETFCOPY" title="Module Copyright">
       <t>
	 The module description statement MUST contain the latest approved IETF
	 Trust Copyright statement, which is available on-line, in section 4 
         of the Trust Legal Provisions (TLP) document, at: 
	 <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/
       </t>
       <t>
         Each YANG module or submodule contained within an Internet Draft or RFC MUST be
         identified as a 'Code Component'.  The strings '&lt;CODE BEGINS&gt;' and 
         '&lt;CODE ENDS&gt;' SHOULD be used to identify each Code Component.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Narrative Sections">
       <t>
	 The narrative part MUST include an overview section that describes
	 the scope and field of application of the module(s) defined by the
	 specification and that specifies the relationship (if any) of these
	 modules to other standards, particularly to standards containing
	 other module modules.  The narrative part SHOULD include one or more
	 sections to briefly describe the structure of the modules defined
	 in the specification.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If the module(s) defined by the specification import definitions
	 from other modules (except for those defined in the 
	 <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang">YANG</xref> or
	 <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-types">YANG Types</xref>
	 documents) or are always implemented in
	 conjunction with other modules, then those facts MUST be noted in
	 the overview section, as MUST any special interpretations of objects
	 in other modules.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Definitions Section">
       <t>
	 This section contains the module(s) defined by the specification.
	 These modules MUST be written in YANG
	 <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
	 See <xref target="YangGuidelines"/> for guidelines on YANG usage.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Security Considerations Section">
       <t>
	 Each specification that defines one or more modules MUST contain
	 a section that discusses security considerations relevant to those
	 modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
	 template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/yang-security.html).
       </t>
       <t>
	 In particular, writable module objects that could be especially
	 disruptive if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the
	 associated security risks MUST be spelled out; similarly, readable
	 module objects that contain especially sensitive information or that
	 raise significant privacy concerns MUST be explicitly listed by name
	 and the reasons for the sensitivity/privacy concerns MUST be
	 explained. 
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="IANA Considerations Section">
       <t>
	 In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
	 http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
	 submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
	 Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
	 depending what actions are required of the IANA.
       </t>

       <section title="Documents that Create a New Name Space">
	 <t>
	   If an Internet-Draft defines a new name space that is to be
	   administered by the IANA, then the document MUST include an IANA
	   Considerations section, that specifies how the name space is to be
	   administered.
	 </t>
	 <t>
	   Specifically, if any YANG module namespace statement value contained
	   in the document is not already registered with IANA, then a
	   new YANG Namespace registry entry must be requested from the
	   IANA.  The YANG specification includes the procedure
           for this purpose in its IANA Considerations section.
	 </t>
       </section>

       <section title="Documents that Extend an Existing Name Space">
         <t>
           It is possible to extend an existing namespace using
           a YANG submodule which belongs to an existing module
           already administered by IANA.
           In this case, the document containing the main module MUST be updated
           to use the latest revision of the submodule.
	 </t>
       </section>
     </section>

     <section title="Reference Sections">
       <t>
	 For every import or include statement which appears in a 
         module contained
	 in the specification, which identifies a module in a separate document,
	 a corresponding normative reference to that document MUST
	 appear in the Normative References section.  The reference MUST
	 correspond to the specific module version actually used within
	 the specification.
       </t>
       <t>
	 For every reference statement which appears in a module contained
	 in the specification, which identifies a separate document,
	 a corresponding normative reference to that document SHOULD
	 appear in the Normative References section.  The reference SHOULD
	 correspond to the specific document version actually used within
	 the specification.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Copyright Notices">
       <t>
	 The proper copyright notices MUST be present in the module
	 description statement. Refer to the IETF Trust Legal
         Provision for the exact legal text that needs to be included.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Intellectual Property Section">
       <t>
	 The proper IPR statements MUST be present in the document,
	 according to the most current Internet Draft boilerplate.
         Refer to the IETF Trust Legal Provision for the 
         exact legal text that needs to be included.
       </t>
     </section>
   </section>

   <section title="YANG Usage Guidelines" anchor="YangGuidelines">
     <t>
       In general, modules in IETF standards-track specifications MUST
       comply with all syntactic and semantic requirements of YANG.
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang"/>.
       The guidelines in this section are intended
       to supplement the YANG specification, which is
       intended to define a minimum set of conformance
       requirements.
     </t>
     <t>
       In order to promote interoperability and establish
       a set of practices based on previous experience,
       the following sections establish usage guidelines
       for specific YANG constructs.
     </t>
     <t>
       Only guidelines which clarify or restrict the
       minimum conformance requirements are included here.
     </t>

     <section title="Module Naming Conventions">
       <t>
	 Modules contained in standards track documents
	 SHOULD be named according to the guidelines in
         the IANA considerations section of <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
	 A distinctive word or acronym (e.g., protocol name
	 or working group acronym) SHOULD be used in the
	 module name.  If new definitions are being defined
	 to extend one or more existing modules, then the same
	 word or acronym should be reused, instead of
	 creating a new one.
       </t>
       <t>
	 All published module names MUST be unique.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Once a module name is published, it MUST not be reused,
	 even if the RFC containing the module is reclassified
	 to 'Historic' status.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Identifiers">
       <t>
	 Identifiers for all published modules, submodules, typedefs,
	 groupings, data objects, operations, and notifications
	 MUST be between 1 and 64 characters in length.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Defaults">
       <t>
	 In general, it is suggested that sub-statements
	 containing default values SHOULD NOT be present.
	 For example, 'status current;', 
	 'config true;', 'mandatory false;',
	 and 'max-elements unbounded;'
	 are common defaults which would make the module difficult
	 to read if used everywhere they are allowed.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Instead, it is suggested that common 
	 statements SHOULD only be used when being set to a
	 value other than the default value.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Conditional Statements">
       <t>
	 A module may be conceptually partitioned in several
	 ways, using the 'if-feature' and/or 'when' statements.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Data model designers need to carefully consider all
	 modularity aspects, including the use of YANG conditional
	 statements.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Objects SHOULD NOT directly reference NETCONF capabilities,
	 in order to specify optional behavior.  Instead, a 'feature'
	 statement
	 SHOULD be defined instead of a NETCONF capability,
	 and the 'if-feature' statement SHOULD be used within
	 the optional object definition.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If the condition associated with the desired semantics
	 is not dependent on any particular instance value
	 within the database, then an 'if-feature' statement
	 SHOULD be used instead of a 'when' statement.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The 'attribute' and 'namespace' axis SHOULD NOT be used
	 because the associated XML node types are not supported in YANG,
	 and may not be supported consistently across NETCONF
         server implementations.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The 'position' and 'last' functions MAY be used with caution,
         within a single server implementation.
         These functions may be useful in some cases when processing
         user-ordered lists.  A server is only required to maintain the
         XML order of a user-ordered list or leaf-list.
       </t>         
       <t>
	 The 'preceding', and 'following' axes SHOULD NOT be used.
	 These constructs rely on XML document order within a NETCONF server
	 configuration database, which may not be supported
	 consistently or produce reliable results across implementations.
	 Predicate expressions based on static node
	 properties (e.g., name, value, ancestors,
	 descendants) SHOULD be used instead.
       </t>
       <t>
         The 'preceding-sibling' and 'following-sibling' axes
         MAY be used, with caution.  A server is not required to
         maintain a persistent or deterministic XML document
         order, which will affect use of these axes.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Implicit 'position' function calls within predicates
	 SHOULD NOT be used. (e.g., //chapter[42]).
       </t>
       <t>
	 Data nodes which use the 'int64' and 'uint64' built-in
	 type MAY be used with caution, within relational expressions.
	 There are boundary conditions in which the translation
	 from the YANG 64-bit type to an XPath number can cause
	 incorrect results.  Specifically, an XPath double precision
         floating point number cannot represent very large positive
         or negative 64-bit numbers because it only provides a total precision
         of 53 bits.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Data modelers need to be careful not to
	 confuse the YANG value space and the XPath
	 value space.  The data types are not the same in both,
	 and conversion between YANG and XPath data types
	 SHOULD be considered carefully.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Explicit XPath data type conversions MAY be used
	 (e.g., 'string', 'boolean', or 'number' functions),
	 instead of implicit XPath data type conversions.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Lifecycle Management">
       <t>
	 The status statement SHOULD NOT be present if its value
	 is 'current'.  It MUST be present if its value
	 is 'deprecated' or 'obsolete'.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The module or submodule name MUST NOT be changed, once
	 the document containing the module or submodule is published.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The module namespace URI value MUST NOT be changed,
	 once the document containing the module is published.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The revision-date sub-statement (within the imports
	 statement) SHOULD be present if any
	 groupings are used from the external module.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The revision-date sub-statement (within the include
	 statement) SHOULD be present if any
	 groupings are used from the external sub-module.
       </t>
       <t>
         If submodules are used, then the document containing the
         main module MUST be updated so that the main module
         revision date is equal or more recent than the revision date
         of any submodule  which is (directly or indirectly) included by the main module.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Header Contents">
       <t>
	 For published modules, the namespace MUST 
         be a globally unique
	 URI, as defined in <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
	 This value is usually assigned by the IANA.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The organization statement MUST be present.
         If the module is contained in a documented
         intended for standards-track status, then
         the organization SHOULD be the IETF working group
         chartered to write the document.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The contact statement MUST be present.
         If the module is contained in a document
         intended for standards-track status, then
         the working group WEB and mailing information
         MUST be present, and the document author
         contact information SHOULD be present.
         In addition, the Area Director and other contact
         information MAY be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The description statement MUST be present.
         The appropriate IETF Trust Copyright text MUST be present,

       </t>
       <t>
         Modules are often extracted from their original
         documents and it is useful for developers
         and operators to know how to find the
         original source document in a consistent manner.
       </t>
       <t>
         If the module relies on information contained
         in other documents, which are not the same
         documents implied by the import statements
         present in the module, then these documents
         MUST be identified in the reference
         statement.
       </t>
       <t>
	 A revision statement MUST be present for each published
	 version of the module. The revision statement MUST
         have a reference substatement.
         It MUST identify the published document which
         contains the module.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Each new revision MUST include a revision date which
	 is higher than any other revision date in the module.
       </t>
       <t>
	 It is acceptable to reuse the
	 same revision statement within unpublished versions
	 (i.e., Internet Drafts), but the revision date

     <section anchor="TEMPNS" title="Temporary Namespace Assignments">
       <t>
         It is desirable to include only valid YANG modules
         in documents, whether they are published yet or not.
         This allows:
         <list style="symbols">
           <t>

         <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:
       </t>
       <t>
         The following example URNs would be valid temporary namespace

       <t>
         Note that a different URN prefix string SHOULD be used for non-standards track

           </t>
         </list>
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Top Level Database Objects">
       <t>
         There SHOULD only be one top-level data node defined
         in each YANG module.  However, there MAY be more than one
         if needed.
       </t>
       <t>
         The top-level data organization SHOULD be considered carefully,
         in advance.  Data model designers need to consider how
         the functionality for a given protocol or protocol family
         will grow over time.
       </t>
       <t>
         The names and data organization SHOULD reflect persistent
         information, such as the name of a protocol.  The name
         of the working group SHOULD NOT be used because this
         may change over time.
       </t>
       <t>
         A mandatory database object is defined as 
         a node that a client must provide for the database
         to be valid.  The server will not provide a value
         under any conditions.
       </t>
       <t>
         Top-level database objects MUST NOT be mandatory.
         If a mandatory node appears at the top-level, it will 
         immediately cause the database to be invalid.
         This can occur when the server boots or when a module
         is loaded dynamically at runtime.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Data Types">
       <t>
	 Selection of an appropriate data type (i.e., built-in
	 type, existing derived type, or new derived type)
	 is very subjective and therefore few requirements
	 can be specified on that subject.  
       </t>
       <t>
	 Data model designers SHOULD use the most appropriate
	 built-in data type for the particular application.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If extensibility of enumerated values is required,
	 then the identityref data type SHOULD be used
	 instead of an enumeration or other built-in type.
       </t>
       <t>
	 For string data types, if a machine-readable pattern
	 can be defined for the desired semantics, then
	 one or more pattern statements SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 For string data types, if the length of the string
	 is required to bounded in all implementations,
	 then a length statement SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
         For string data types, object semantics SHOULD NOT rely on
         preservation of leading and trailing whitespace
         characters.
       </t>
       <t>
	 For numeric data types, if the values allowed
	 by the intended semantics are different than
	 those allowed by the unbounded intrinsic data 
	 type (e.g., int32), then a range statement SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The signed numeric data types (i.e., 'int8',
	 'int16', 'int32', and 'int64') SHOULD NOT be used unless
	 negative values are allowed for the desired semantics.
       </t>
       <t>
	 For enumeration or bits data types, the semantics for
	 each enum or bit SHOULD be documented.  A separate
	 description statement (within each enum or bit
	 statement) SHOULD be present.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Reusable Type Definitions">
       <t>
	 If an appropriate derived type exists in any
	 standard module, such as 
         <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-types"/>,
	 then it SHOULD be used instead of defining a new derived type.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If an appropriate units identifier can be associated
	 with the desired semantics, then a units statement
	 SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If an appropriate default value can be associated
	 with the desired semantics, then a default statement
	 SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If a significant number of derived types are defined,
	 and it is anticipated that these data types will be reused
	 by multiple modules, then these derived types SHOULD be
	 contained in a separate module or submodule, to allow
	 easier reuse without unnecessary coupling.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The description statement MUST be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If the type definition semantics are defined
	 in an external document, then the reference
	 statement SHOULD be present.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Object Definitions">
       <t>
	 The description statement MUST be present in the following
	 body statements:
	 <list style="symbols">
	   <t>extension</t>
	   <t>feature</t>	     
	   <t>identity</t>
	   <t>typedef</t>

	   <t>rpc</t>
	   <t>notification</t>
	 </list>
       </t>
       <t>
	 The description statement MUST be present in the following
	 data definition constructs:
	 <list style="symbols">
	   <t>container</t>
	   <t>leaf</t>
	   <t>leaf-list</t>
	   <t>list</t>
	   <t>choice</t>
	   <t>anyxml</t>
	 </list>
       </t>
       <t>
	 If the object semantics are defined in an external document,
	 then a reference statement SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 The 'anyxml' construct MAY be used with caution within
	 configuration data.  This may be useful to represent
         an HTML banner for example.  However, this construct SHOULD NOT
         be used if other YANG data node types can be used instead to
         represent the desired syntax and semantics.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If there are referential integrity constraints associated
	 with the desired semantics that
	 can be represented with XPath, then one or more
	 must statements SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 For list and leaf-list objects, if the number of possible instances
	 is required to be bounded for all implementations, 
	 then the max-elements statements SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If any must or when statements are used within the
	 object definition, then the object description statement
	 SHOULD describe the purpose of each one.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Operation Definitions">
       <t>
	 The description statement MUST be present in 'rpc' statements
         defining new operations.

	 If the operation semantics are defined in an external document,
	 then a reference statement SHOULD be present.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If the operation impacts system behavior in some way,
	 it SHOULD be mentioned in the description statement.
       </t>
       <t>
	 If the operation is potentially harmful to system 
	 behavior in some way,
	 it MUST be mentioned in the Security Considerations

     <t>
       The purpose of a YANG module review is to review 
       the YANG module both for technical correctness and
       for adherence to IETF documentation requirements.
       The following checklist may be helpful when reviewing
       a draft document:
     </t>
     <t><list style="numbers">
       <t>
	 I-D Boilerplate -- 
	 verify that the draft contains the required
	 Internet-Draft boilerplate 
	 (see http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt), 
	 including the appropriate statement to permit
	 publication as an RFC, and that I-D boilerplate does 
	 not contain references or section numbers.
       </t>
       <t>Abstract --
       verify that the abstract does not contain references,
       that it does not have a section number, and that its content follows
       the guidelines in http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt.
       </t>
       <t>
	 IETF Trust Copyright --
	 verify that the draft contains the latest
	 approved TLP boilerplate as described in <xref target="IETFCOPY" />.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Security Considerations Section --
	 verify that the draft uses the
	 latest approved template from the OPS area web site
	 (http://www.ops.ietf.org/yang-security.html) and that the guidelines
	 therein have been followed.
       </t>
       <t>
	 IANA Considerations Section --
	 this section must always be
	 present.  For each module within the document, ensure that the 
         IANA Considerations section contains entries
	 for the following IANA registries:
         <list style="hanging">
           <t hangText="XML Namespace Registry:">
             Register the YANG module namespace.
           </t>
           <t hangText="YANG Module Registry:">
             Register the YANG module name, prefix, namespace, and RFC number,
             according to the rules specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang"/>.
           </t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>
	 References --
	 verify that the references are properly divided
	 between normative and informative references, that RFC 2119 is
	 included as a normative reference if the terminology defined therein
	 is used in the document, that all references required by the
	 boilerplate are present, that all YANG modules containing imported
	 items are cited as normative references, and that all citations point
	 to the most current RFCs unless there is a valid reason to do
	 otherwise (for example, it is OK to include an informative reference
	 to a previous version of a specification to help explain a feature
	 included for backward compatibility).
       </t>
       <t>
	 Copyright Notices --
	 verify that the draft contains an
	 abbreviated IETF Trust copyright notice in the description statement of each
	 YANG module or sub-module, and that it contains the full IETF Trust copyright
	 notice at the end of the document.  Make sure that the correct year is used
	 in all copyright dates.  Use the approved text from the latest 
         Trust Legal Provisions (TLP) document, which can be found at:
         <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/  
       </t>
       <t>
	 Other Issues --
	 check for any issues mentioned in
	 http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html that are not covered elsewhere.
       </t>
       <t>
	 Technical Content --
	 review the actual technical content for
	 compliance with the guidelines in this document.  The use of a YANG
	 module compiler is recommended when checking for syntax errors; see
	 [YANG tool URL TBD] for more information.
	 Checking for correct syntax, however, is only part of the job.  It is
	 just as important to actually read the YANG module document 
	 from the point of view of a potential implementor. 
	 It is particularly important to
	 check that description statements are sufficiently
	 clear and unambiguous to allow interoperable 
	 implementations to be created.
