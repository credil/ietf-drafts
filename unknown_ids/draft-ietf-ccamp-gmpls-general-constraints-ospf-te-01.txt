   wide variety of technologies including packet switching (e.g., MPLS), 
   time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, OTN), wavelength (lambdas), and

   spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or 
   fiber). In some of these technologies network elements and links may 
   impose additional routing constraints such as asymmetric switch 
   connectivity, non-local label assignment, and label range limitations 
   on links. This document describes OSPF routing protocol extensions to 
   support these kinds of constraints under the control of Generalized 
   MPLS (GMPLS).

1. Introduction 

   Some data plane technologies that wish to make use of a GMPLS control 
   plane contain additional constraints on switching capability and 
   label assignment. In addition, some of these technologies should be 
   capable of performing non-local label assignment based on the nature 
   of the technology, e.g., wavelength continuity constraint in WSON 
   [RFC6163]. Such constraints can lead to the requirement for link by 
   link label availability in path computation and label assignment.

   [GEN-Encode] provides efficient encodings of information needed by 
   the routing and label assignment process in technologies such as WSON 
   and are potentially applicable to a wider range of technologies. 

   This document defines extensions to the OSPF routing protocol based 
   on [GEN-Encode] to enhance the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of 
   GMPLS TE which are defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4202], and [RFC4203]. 
   The enhancements to the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS 
   TE links can be announced in OSPF TE LSAs. The TE LSA, which is an 
   opaque LSA with area flooding scope [RFC3630], has only one top-level 
   Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplet and has one or more nested sub-TLVs 
   for extensibility. The top-level TLV can take one of three values (1) 
   Router Address [RFC3630], (2) Link [RFC3630], (3) Node Attribute 
   [RFC5786]. In this document, we enhance the sub-TLVs for the Link TLV 
   and Node Attribute TLV in support of the general network element 
   constraints under the control of GMPLS.  

   The detailed encoding of OSPF extensions are not defined in this 
   document. [GEN-Encode] provides encoding detail.  

2. Node Information 

   According to [GEN-Encode], the additional node information 
   representing node switching asymmetry constraints includes Node ID, 
   connectivity matrix. Except for the Node ID which should comply with 
   Routing Address described in [RFC3630], the other pieces of 
   information are defined in this document. 

   [RFC5786] defines a new top TLV named the Node Attribute TLV which 
   carries attributes related to a router/node. This Node Attribute TLV 
   contains one or more sub-TLVs.  

   Per [GEN-Encode], we have identified the following new Sub-TLVs to 
   the Node Attribute TLV. Detail description for each newly defined 
   Sub-TLV is provided in subsequent sections:  

      Sub-TLV Type    Length         Name 

         TBD          variable    Connectivity Matrix 

   In some specific technologies, e.g., WSON networks, Connectivity 
   Matrix sub-TLV may be optional, which depends on the control plane 
   implementations. Usually, for example, in WSON networks, Connectivity 
   Matrix sub-TLV may appear in the LSAs because WSON switches are 
   asymmetric at present. It is assumed that the switches are symmetric 
   switching, if there is no Connectivity Matrix sub-TLV in the LSAs.

2.1. Connectivity Matrix 

   It is necessary to identify which ingress ports and labels can be 
   switched to some specific labels on a specific egress port, if the 
   switching devices in some technology are highly asymmetric. 

   The Connectivity Matrix is used to identify these restrictions, which 
   can represent either the potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric 
   switches (e.g. ROADMs and such) or fixed connectivity for an 
   asymmetric device such as a multiplexer as defined in [WSON-Info]. 

   The Connectivity Matrix is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of the 
   Node Attribute TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. 
   The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in Section 5.3 of 
   [GEN-Encode]. One sub-TLV contains one matrix. The Connectivity 
   Matrix sub-TLV may occur more than once to contain multi-matrices 
   within the Node Attribute TLV.  

3. Link Information 

   The most common link sub-TLVs nested to link top-level TLV are 
   already defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4203]. For example, Link ID, 
   Administrative Group, Interface Switching Capability Descriptor 
   (ISCD), Link Protection Type, Shared Risk Link Group Information 
   (SRLG), and Traffic Engineering Metric are among the typical link 
   sub-TLVs.  

   Per [GEN-Encode], we add the following additional link sub-TLVs to 
   the link-TLV in this document. 

    

      Sub-TLV Type    Length         Name 

         TBD          variable    Port Label Restrictions 

         TBD          variable    Available Labels 

         TBD          variable    Shared Backup Labels 

   Generally all the sub-TLVs above are optional, which depends on the 
   control plane implementations. If it is default no restrictions on 
   labels, Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV may not appear in the LSAs. 
   In order to be able to compute label assignment, Available Labels 
   sub-TLV may appear in the LSAs. For example, in WSON networks, 
   without available wavelength information, path computation need guess

   what lambdas may be available (high blocking probability or 
   distributed wavelength assignment may be used).  

3.1. Port Label Restrictions 

   Port label restrictions describe the label restrictions that the 
   network element (node) and link may impose on a port. These 
   restrictions represent what labels may or may not be used on a link 
   and are intended to be relatively static. More dynamic information is 
   contained in the information on available labels. Port label 
   restrictions are specified relative to the port in general or to a 
   specific connectivity matrix for increased modeling flexibility.  

   For example, Port Label Restrictions describes the wavelength 
   restrictions that the link and various optical devices such as OXCs, 
   ROADMs, and waveband multiplexers may impose on a port in WSON. These 
   restrictions represent what wavelength may or may not be used on a 
   link and are relatively static. The detailed information about Port 
   label restrictions is described in [WSON-Info]. 

   The Port Label Restrictions is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of 
   the Link TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. The 
   meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in Section 5.4 of 
   [GEN-Encode]. The Port Label Restrictions sub-TLV may occur more than 
   once to specify a complex port constraint within the link TLV. 

3.2. Available Labels 

   Available Labels indicates the labels available for use on a link as 
   described in [GEN-Encode]. The Available Labels is a sub-TLV (the 
   type is TBD by IANA) of the Link TLV. The length is the length of 
   value field in octets. The meaning and format of this sub-TLV are 
   defined in Section 5.1 of [GEN-Encode]. The Available Labels sub-TLV 
   may occur at most once within the link TLV. 

   Note that there are five approaches for Label Set which is used to 
   represent the Available Labels described in [GEN-Encode]. Usually, it 
   depends on the implementation to one of the approaches. In WSON 
   networks, considering that the continuity of the available or 
   unavailable wavelength set can be scattered for the dynamic 
   wavelength availability, so it may burden the routing to reorganize 
   the wavelength set information when the Inclusive (/Exclusive) List 
   (/Range) approaches are used to represent Available Wavelengths 
   information. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that only the Bitmap Set be 
   used for representation Available Wavelengths information.

   The "Base Label" and "Last Label" in label set defined in [GEN-Encode] 
   corresponds to base wavelength label and last wavelength label in 
   WSON, the format of which is described as follows: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |Grid |  C.S. |      Reserved   |    n                          | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The detailed information related to wavelength label can be referred 
   to [RFC6205]. 

3.3. Shared Backup Labels 

   Shared Backup Labels indicates the labels available for shared backup 
   use on a link as described in [GEN-Encode]. 

   The Shared Backup Labels is a sub-TLV (the type is TBD by IANA) of 
   the Link TLV. The length is the length of value field in octets. The 
   meaning and format of this sub-TLV are defined in Section 5.2 of 
   [GEN-Encode]. The Shared Backup Labels sub-TLV may occur at most once 
   within the link TLV. 

4. Routing Procedures  

   All the sub-TLVs are nested to top-level TLV(s) and contained in 
   Opaque LSAs. The flooding of Opaque LSAs must follow the rules 
   specified in [RFC2328], [RFC2370], [RFC3630], [RFC4203] and [RFC5786]. 

   Considering the routing scalability issues in some cases, the routing 
   protocol should be capable of supporting the separation of dynamic 
   information from relatively static information to avoid unnecessary 
   updates of static information when dynamic information is changed. A 
   standard-compliant approach is to separate the dynamic information 
   sub-TLVs from the static information sub-TLVs, each nested to top-
   level TLV ([RFC3630 and RFC5876]), and advertise them in the separate 
   OSPF TE LSAs. 

   For node information, since the Connectivity Matrix information is 
   static, the LSA containing the Node Attribute TLV can be updated with 
   a lower frequency to avoid unnecessary updates. 

   For link information, a mechanism MAY be applied such that static 
   information and dynamic information of one TE link are contained in 
   separate Opaque LSAs. For example, the Port Label Restrictions

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te-01.txt     Sep. 2011 
    

   information sub-TLV and Available Labels information sub-TLV can be 
   nested to the top level link TLVs and advertised in the separate LSAs. 

   Note that as with other TE information, an implementation SHOULD take 
   measures to avoid rapid and frequent updates of routing information 
   that could cause the routing network to become swamped. A threshold 
   mechanism MAY be applied such that updates are only flooded when a 
   number of changes have been made to the label availability  
   information (e.g., wavelength availability) within a specific time. 
   Such mechanisms MUST be configurable if they are implemented. 

    

5. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other 
   than those discussed in [RFC 3630], [RFC 4203]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   [RFC3630] says that the top level Types in a TE LSA and Types for 
   sub-TLVs for each top level Types must be assigned by Expert Review, 
   and must be registered with IANA. 

   IANA is requested to allocate new Types for the sub-TLVs as defined 
   in Sections 2.1, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 as follows: 

6.1. Node Information 

   This document introduces the following sub-TLVs of Node Attribute TLV 
   (Value TBD, see [RFC5786]): 

      Type     sub-TLV 

      TBD      Connectivity Matrix 

6.2. Link Information 

   This document introduces the following sub-TLVs of TE Link TLV (Value 
   2): 

    

      Type     sub-TLV 

      TBD      Port Label Restrictions

Intellectual Property 
    

   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of   
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be   
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology   
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license   
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it   
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any   
   such rights. 

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF   
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or   
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or   
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or   
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR   
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement   
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please   
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.
