Abstract

   Providing civic address considerations for individual countries is
   proposed in RFC4119.  This documents provides such considerations for
   Austria, and proposes a mapping of Austrian address elements to the
   PIDF Location Object (PIDF-LO).

Internet-Draft          Austrian Civic Addresses                Nov 2007


1.  Introduction

   The "Presence Information Data Format Location Object" (PIDF-LO) [2]
   is an an object format for carrying geographical information on the
   Internet.  PIDF-LO can be used to carry civic address information,
   and supports a range of "civic address types" (CATypes) to describe
   individual attributes of an civic address (see Section 2.2.1 of RFC
   4119).  The list of CATypes is currently under revision (see Secion
   3.1 of draft-ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo [8].  This document is
   based on the revised set of CATypes.

   The Austrian "Gebaeude- und Wohnungsregistergesetz" (building and
   habitation registry law) is the legal basis for the obligation to
   provide a registry of civic addresses, buildings and their usable
   units (subdivisions of buildings).  The registry is operated by
   "Statistik Austria GmbH", a fully governmental owned company.
   Responsibility for keeping records in the registry up to date is an
   obligation to the local administration of the individual townships.

   The data format definition for the individual records is publicly
   available (data access itself is however restricted).  Hence, an
   uniform address data base for whole Austria is available.
   Unfortunately, Austrian civic addresses use a much more complex
   format compared to civic addresses in PIDF-LO.  A detailed
   description of the Austrian civic address data format is contained in
   section Section 3.

   A guideline of how to use PIDF-LO for Austrian addresses is necessary
   in order to avoid misinterpretations.  This is especially important
   if the PIDF-LO is conveyed during an emergency call to a Public
   Safety Answering Point (PSAP).  A precise location information is
   needed in case of emergency to send out responders without any delay
   to the correct location of the caller.  If every data-provider uses
   its own address mapping to PIDF-LO, confusion and misunderstandings
   are bound to happen.  However, ideally any PSAP should have full
   access to the data by Statistik Austria.  PSAPs must be able to rely
   that location information is always provided the same way by all
   data-providers.  To address the idiosyncrasies in Austria, the civic
   address elements are discussed subsequently.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3.  Civic Addresses in Austria

   Statistik Austria data describes estates, buildings and usable units
   [4].  On a single estate there may be any number of buildings.
   Apartment houses that have more than one staircase, are split up in
   separate buildings at every staircase.  In every building, there may
   be several usable units.  For example, an apartment house may have
   several apartments, counting as separate usable units.  Moreover, one
   building may have more than one address, but at least one address.
   Below, the address elements for estates (Table 1), buildings
   (Table 2) and usable units (Table 3) are shown.

        Table 3: Additional Civic Address Elements for usable units

   Note: "Floors" in Austria (as in most parts of Europe) are counted
   differently compared to the US.  The "1st floor" in Austria is
   actually the floor above the floor at street level (2nd floor in US),
   not considering the fact that in old buildings there might be even
   more floors between street level and 1st floor, like "mezzanine",
   "2nd mezzanine".  So, an Austrian "1st floor" could well be the "4th
   floor" according to US nomenclature.

   According to Statistik Austria [3], 81.5% of Austrian addresses are
   of the simple type Musterstrasse 1 (Musterstrasse is an example
   street name). 5% of all addresses have an additional character, like
   Musterstrasse 1b. 1% of Austrian addresses look like Musterstrasse
   21a-23a.  For 8% of addresses, an additional separator is necessary,
   like Musterstrasse 10 Haus 1 Stiege 2 or Musterstrasse 20 Gruppe A
   Reihe 1 Parzelle 13 or Musterstrasse 30 Weg 1 Parzelle 10.  Very
   seldom, there are so called special addresses (0.03%), for example
   Musterstrasse gegenueber 3a, meaning this address is actually vis-a-
   vis of house number 3a.  Rather surprisingly, 4.47% of Austrian
   addresses contain the identifier of the estate since no house number
   is assigned at all, for example: Musterstrasse GNR 1234, or
   Musterstrasse GNR .12/4 Kirche (this type of addresses is common for
   churches) or a real example in Stockerau: Kolomaniwoerth GNR 1583.
   This identifier is stored by Statistik Austria as Hausnummerntext.
   Otherwise one could misinterpret this number as a house number, what
   would be definitely wrong.

5.  Address Codes in Austria

   Statistik Austria registers 4 codes: Adresscode, Adresssubcode,
   Objektnummer and the Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer.  The Adresscode (7
   digits) is a unique code for an address in Austria.  The
   Adressregister maps the Adresscode to the civic address.  If there is
   a building located at an address, there is also an Adresssubcode (3
   digits) assigned.  Every building at an address has its own
   Adresssubcode (assigned sequentially starting with 001, 002, 003 and
   so on) in order to distinguish between buildings at the same address.
   Furthermore, every building located in Austria has its own unique
   code, the Objektnummer (7 digits).  This code identifies the building
   independent of the Adresscode.  That's because addresses are subject
   to change while the building may persist.  To differ multiple usable
   units inside a building, the Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer (4 digits)
   is used.  This code is also assigned in sequential order for each
   building.

   Besides, every address and building is geocoded by Statistik Austria.
   Hence, if every PIDF-LO location object would carry data in the
   format of Statistik Austria and every PSAP would use the database of
   Statistik Austria for mapping, a time saving, definite mapping
   without irregularities could be achieved.

   Besides these codes, Statistik Austria maintains reference numbers
   for communes, localities or streets, to mention just a few.


6.  Austrian Addresses in PIDF-LO

   A good number of Austrian addresses do not fit into the PIDF-LO
   format, as described in the previous section.  There are several
   options to map Austrian addresses to PIDF-LO.  First, one could merge
   all the Austrian address fields to the existing PIDF-LO elements (by
   violating the intended purpose of the element and loss of precision).
   Another way is to define other civic address elements for use by
   Austrian addresses.  An unacceptable option would be to just omit all
   the address data that does not fit into PIDF-LO.  However, that
   certainly causes wrong addresses (instead of Hauptstrasse 1a - 5a
   Block 1b Haus 2c Stiege 1 just Hauptstrasse 1a).

6.1.  Mapping Austrian Addresses to existing PIDF-LO elements

   First, there are some common data elements, that can be mapped
   directly without any problems.  The following elements are:






Wolf & Mayrhofer          Expires May 12, 2008                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Austrian Civic Addresses                Nov 2007


   country see Section 6.4
   A1 see Section 6.5
   A2 political district (politscher Bezirk), see Section 6.6
   A3 city (Stadt, Gemeinde)
   A4 Ortschaft (see exception for Vienna below)
   A6 Strasse
   LMK Hofname
   LOC
   FLR
   NAM Vulgoname
   PC
   BLD
   UNIT
   ROOM
   PLC
   PCN
   POBOX
   SEAT

   Unfortunately, there are elements, that can not unambiguously be
   entered.  PIDF-LO only defines a single house number element (HNO,
   numeric part only) and a house number suffix element (HNS).  This is
   unsuitable for the situation in Austria and far too less fields.
   Statistik Austria knows 14 data fields related to the house number of
   a building plus another 6 fields for distinction of different usable
   units inside a building (including the floor, which has a separate
   field in PIDF-LO).  By violating the rules of PIDF-LO, one could
   simply concatenate all the house number information into the HNO
   element, even though it is expected to hold numeric part only.
   Consequently this may cause troubles at the side of the receiver of
   the location object.  Moreover, the price is a loss in precision
   since the different house number parts cannot be easily separated
   again.  It is recommended, not to use the HNS element for Austrian
   addresses, since there are addresses that do not have just one
   suffix.  For example, the address Lazarettgasse 13A could be mapped
   by:

   <HNO>13</HNO> <HNS>A</HNS>

   However, the building at Lazarettgasse has the house number 13A-13C.
   Consequently, just the HNO element should be used:

   <HNO>13A-13C</HNO>

   And even for addresses with a house number consisting of a single
   number and a single prefix, just HNO should be use because of
   uniformity:

Internet-Draft          Austrian Civic Addresses                Nov 2007


   <HNO>13A</HNO>

   Addresses with a house number text would look like:

   <HNO>vor 1-1A</HNO>

   with no HNS element.  Last, there is another exception to mention
   concerning the Austrian capital Vienna (Wien).  The city of Vienna is
   equal to its political district and even the state is called Vienna.
   Nevertheless, Vienna is separated in 23 districts within the same
   political district.  Consequently, an address in Vienna would look
   like:

   <country>AT</country>
   <a1>Wien</a1>
   <a2>Wien</a2>
   <a3>Wien</a3>
   <a4>Innere Stadt</a4> or <a4>1<a4>

   The element A4, holding the city division, must hold the name or the
   number of the district.

6.2.  Additional PIDF-LO elements for Austria

   In order to create a PIDF-LO document holding all available data from
   Statistik Austria separately, new elements are necessary.  Table 4
   lists the additional elements needed for Austrian addresses.

6.3.  PIDF-LO elements not to be used in Austria

   The street suffix STS is not used in the data format of Statistik
   Austria.  Consequently, this element can be omitted, since it is
   always included in the A6 element.  This is a common practice in
   Austria.  The following listing shows all PIDF-LO elements that
   should not be used for representing Austrian addresses:

6.4.  Country Element

   The country element for Austria must be set to AT, since this is the
   ISO 3166-1 [5] alpha-2 code for Austria.

   <country>AT</country>

   The usage of the ISO 3166 code is demanded by RFC 4119 [2] and
   I-D.ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo [8] proposes to use upper case
   characters only.

6.5.  A1 Element

   As proposed in I-D.ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo [8], for the PIDF-LO
   element A1, the second part of ISO 3166-2 [6] can be used.  However,
   in Austria it is also common to write out the names of the states.
   Table 5 shows the possible values of the A1 element for Austrian
   states.

6.6.  A2 Element

   Names of the Austrian political districts are available at Statistik
   Austria [7].  These names can be used for the A2 element.  Statistik
   Austria also has a unique code for each political district, which



Wolf & Mayrhofer          Expires May 12, 2008                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          Austrian Civic Addresses                Nov 2007


   could be used to identify the political district in the A2 element.

   The district Bruck an der Leitha could be represented by:

   <A2>Bruck an der Leitha<A2> or <A2>307</A2>

6.7.  Additional Code Element

   The element additional code could be used to hold the codes provided
   by Statistik Austria.  There is an Adresscode, Adressubcode,
   Objektnummer and a Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer.  These unique codes
   identify the location.  Actually, these codes alone would be enough,
   which leads to location by reference with address codes, for Austria
   described in Section 7.

   If the additional code in a PIDF-LO document is going to hold the
   codes from Statistik Austria, the following format should be used:

 <addcode>AdrCD=1234567;AdrsubCD=123;ObjNr=2333211;NtzLnr=0001</addcode>

   By setting the country element to AT (see Section 6.4), indicating an
   Austrian address, the Additional Code element is expected to hold
   codes from Statistik Austria only.  When creating PIDF-LO documents
   using address codes by Statistik Austria, the country and addcode
   elements are mandatory.


7.  Location by Reference with the Austrian Address Code

   As explained in the previous section, the codes of Statistik Austria
   alone are enough to describe a location.  A PIDF-LO document could
   therefore just contain the country and the appropriate codes.
   Consequently it would be possible to just convey an identifier as key
   to the location information.  Therefore, it would be necessary that
   all potential location recipients have access to the database to
   resolve the identifier to the location.  One way to put this idea to
   an international and consistent way is to request an URN space for
   that purpose.  Each country may register its own URN for their codes
   with different meaning.

   An proposed URN space for the addresscodes provided by Statistik
   Austria could look like:

   urn:addresscode:at:statistikaustria.AdrCD.AdrsubCD.ObjNr.NtzLnr
   For example:
   urn:addresscode:at:statistikaustria.1234567.004.2333211.0017

8.  Example

   This section shows an example mapping of an Austrian address mapping
   to the existing PIDF-LO elements.  This example is of a simple type,
   so that no additional elements are used for this case.  However, if
   the civic address elements are needed separately at the side of the
   receiver, a distinct mapping to separate field would be desirable.

9.  Security & Privacy Considerations

   RFC 4119 contains general security considerations for handling PIDF-
   LOs.  In addition to that, it has to be considered that data from the
   Austrian building and habitation unit registry are generally not
   public, so restrictions as imposed on the original data set MUST also
   be imposed on the resulting PIDF-LO document.

10.  IANA Considerations

   At this stage, this document contains no considerations for IANA.
   However, if a definition of an "civic address URN" as sketeched out
   in section Section 7 is to be used, the respective URN namespaces
   need to be registered with IANA.
