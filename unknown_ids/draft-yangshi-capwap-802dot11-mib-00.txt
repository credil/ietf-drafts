1.  Introduction

   Current work is under way in the IETF to specify the CAPWAP Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-specification], which enables an Access
   Controller (AC) to manage a collection of Wireless Termination Points
   (WTPs).  CAPWAP supports the use of various wireless technologies by
   the WTPs, with one being specified in the 802.11 binding document [I-
   D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].

   This document defines a MIB module that can be used to manage CAPWAP
   implementations for 802.11 wireless binding.  This MIB module covers
   both configuration for WLAN and a way to reuse 802.11 MIB standard in
   series defined by IEEE 802.11 WG.

   The CAPWAP MIB document [I-D.yangshi-capwap-base-mib] defines a MIB
   module that can be used to manage the base CAPWAP protocol.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

Internet-Draft CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB for IEEE 802.11  31 July 2007


   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   CAPWAP Protocol specification for 802.11 binding [I-D.ietf-capwap-
   protocol-binding-ieee80211].  Besides terminology defined in the IEEE
   802.11 standard and CAPWAP specification, a important conception is
   WLAN.  In the document, WLAN refers to a logical component
   instantiated on a WTP device.  A single physical WTP may operate a
   number of WLANs.  Each Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) and its
   constituent wireless terminal radios is denoted as a distinct WLAN on
   a physical WTP. To support physical WTP with multiple WLANs is an
   important feature for 802.11 binding, and it is also for MIB design.

4.  Feature Checklist

   The CAPWAP Protocol MIB module (CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB) is designed to
   satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

   -  From AC to centrally manage and monitor WTPs;

   -  The MIB module could easily reuse current and future 802.11 MIB
      standard in series defined by IEEE 802.11 WG. The MIB module
      provides a way to access MIB objects defined these MIBs, and not
      require to redefine them.

   -  The MIB module supports to configure WLAN;

   -  The MIB module supports to keep PHY WTP and virtual AP mapping
      relationship;

   -  The MIB module could be used for agent at either AC or WTP sides;

5.  Outline

   According to [I-D.yangshi-capwap-base-mib], it will use easily reuse
   802.11 MIB object for radio configuration and statistic.  The CAPWAP-
   DOT11-MIB will provide a way to configure WLAN, also could easily
   reuse current and future 802.11 MIB standards.

   The main steps are as follow: -  Create interface of 'WTP radio

   template' iftype, as specified
      in [IANAifType-MIB], then configure
      beacon interval these kinds parameter through 802.11 MIB and
      other 802.11 MIB (for example, 802.11e).

   -  Create interface of 'WLAN Template interface' iftype, then
      configure AuthType these kinds parameter for a WLAN through 802.11
      MIB and other 802.11 MIB (for example, 802.11i).

   -  Add/Delete WLAN will create/delete the interface of
      'WLAN BSS interface' iftype.  Each of them will corresponding to
      a WLAN service on a PHY radio.

6.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   Sections 6.1 - 6.2 describe objects pertaining to CAPWAP.  The MIB
   objects were derived from the CAPWAP protocol 802.11 binding document
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].

6.1.  capwapDot11WLANConfigTable

   The WTPs table is used for providing configuration such as MAC type
   and so on for WLANs.  The MIB object capwapDot11WLANTemplateIfIndex
   as a ifIndex, which as a iftype of 'WLAN Template interface' provides
   a way to reuse current 802.11 MIB.  For example, according to CAPWAP
   Binding for IEEE 802.11 Auth Type for a WLAN. In 802.11 MIB, it has
   MIB object dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm in the
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable which use ifIndex as index.  As
   CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB use capwapDot11WLANTemplateIfIndex, it could easily
   reuse dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm object. It is same for other
   802.11 MIBs reuse.

6.2.  capwapDot11WLANBSSTable

   The table provides a way to create or delete the interface of CAPWAP
   add WLAN or delete WLAN message.  Each interface corresponding to a
   WLAN service on a PHY radio.  The first index is the ifIndex from
   [RFC2863].

         Before WTPs connect to AC and get configuration, administrator

         configuration, administrator could create a logical interface
         of 'WLAN Template interface' interface type, and
         configure WLAN parameter under it.
         For example, according to CAPWAP Binding for IEEE 802.11
         '6.1.  IEEE 802.11 Add WLAN', administrator could configure
         specify Auth Type for a WLAN.
         The 'WLAN Template interface' provides a way to
         uniquely identify each WLAN by logical at AC side.
         As most MIBs use ifindex to identify a interface for

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   -   Unauthorized changes to the capwapDot11WLANConfigTable and
       capwapDot11WLANBSSTable may disrupt allocation of
       resources in the network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to

   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  IANA Considerations for CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------

   capwapDot11MIB         { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

9.2.  IANA Considerations for iftype

   Require IANA to assign a iftype for 'WLAN Template interface' type.
   Require IANA to assign a iftype for 'WLAN BSS interface' type.
