Abstract

   IETF procedure requires country-specific cryptographic transforms to
   be Informational RFCs.  This document allows such Informational RFCs
   to be used by SRTP and SRTP Security Descriptions.

Internet-Draft   Policy for Registering SRTP Transforms       March 2010


1.  Introduction

   It is desirable to extend SRTP and its keying mechanisms to support
   country-specific cryptographic transforms.  This document resolves a
   clash between IETF procedure and existing RFCs.  IETF procedure
   requires that country-specific cryptographic transforms be published
   as Informational RFCs [RFC2026], but existing documents require
   extensions to SRTP and extensions to SRTP keying to be published as
   Standards-Track RFCs.

   The IANA Considerations section of this document resolves this clash
   by allowing Informational RFCs to register new cryptographic
   transforms.


2.  Update to RFC3711

   This document updates Section 6 and Section 12 of [RFC3711], which
   currently require a standards track RFC to define a new SRTP
   transform.  After publication of this document, new SRTP transforms
   can be defined using either an informational or standards track RFC.


3.  Update to RFC4568

   The update to RFC4568 is described in Section 5.


4.  Security Considerations

   This specification makes it easier for new cryptographic transforms
   to be used with SRTP.  However, this specifications does not lift the
   requirement that cryptographic transforms is subject to IETF Review
   to ensure their appropriateness and level of security.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates Section 10.3.2.1 of [RFC4568] to change the
   requirements to add a new crypto suite to the IANA registry "SRTP
   Crypto Suite Registrations" [SDESC] which currently requires
   Standards Action.  After publication of this document, new SRTP
   crypto suite registrations are allocated using the "IETF Review"
   policy of [RFC5226], which permits either Informational or standards
   track RFCs, and the "SRTP Crypto Suite Registrations" table in
   [SDESC] should also reference [RFCXXXX].
