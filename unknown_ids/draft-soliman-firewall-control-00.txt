2.  Introduction

   The need for network protection has led operators to deploy firewalls
   with typical configurations that limit the traffic coming into or out
   of a network to the administrators configuration.  An administrators
   configuration is typically static and affects all users within the
   network.  While such security measure is regarded as successful and
   is widely deployed, it has several drawbacks from a user and network
   operator's points of view.  The assumption in such deployments is
   that there is a common configuration that satisfies all users.  That
   is, the same type of applications are used by all network users and
   that all users do not need to be reachable unless they initiate a
   connection.  Alternatively, in some deployment scenarios, e.g.  IP
   Multimedia System (IMS) in 3GPP, the assumption is that externally
   initiated connection will use a signaling protocol, through local
   proxies, and therefore a local firewall can be manipulated by such
   proxies to allow such connections.  Another assumption in deploying
   firewalls is that there is a Trusted side (the administrator's
   network) and an Untrusted side (The Internet).  This is reasonable in
   a network where you assume no one on the inside of the network would
   intentionally try to attack the network infrastructure.

   The assumptions above are clearly workable in a network where there
   is a defined behaviour for the users.  For instance enterprise
   network users can easily be told what applications and protocols are
   acceptable for the users according to company policy.  However, in a
   public network, such restrictions cannot be made without introducing
   serious limitations on users.  Furthermore, in a public network, one
   can no longer assume that users on the inside are trusted.  This is
   especially true in networks with anonymous users as well as users who
   may not be competent in protecting their own infrastructure.

   The need for firewalling traffic still exists in public networks.
   Operators may wish to provide general protection for their
   infrastructure and users.  At the same time, there is a clear need
   for flexibility in order to allow users a high degree of freedom in
   choosing the applications and protocols that they want to run.  The
   firewall function may also be located closer to the user than the
   traditional deployment of firewalls on the core edge of the network.
   This allows for greater scalability by allowing the firewall function
   to serve a smaller number of users, which reduces bottlenecks in the
   core.  This is particularly useful for IPv6 networks where there
   should be no need for Network Address Translators.

   To allow for a more flexible firewall deployment, both in the
   location and configuration of the firewall, this document proposes a
   new mechanism that allows end nodes to signal its preferences for
   traffic filters to a firewall function in the network or to another

   node that controls the firewall function in the network.  The
   mechanism introduced in this document allows for a high degree of
   fexibility and security.  A generic mechanism for firewall control
   has the following advantage:

   o  Removes the reliance on specific application proxies for
      signalling to allow incoming connections.

   o  Allows easy deployment of new services without requiring specific
      application gateways.

   o  Allows easy deployment of new protocols that may not be known to
      the firewall and would otherwise be blocked.

   o  Allows maximum user control, which provides the finest granularity
      for firewall configuration.

   One of the approaches for firewall control can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw].  However, this approach assumes a form of
   pre-established trust.  With mobility becoming the norm on the
   Internet, it is difficult to assume trust without the use of global
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which is not available today.  Other
   approaches to firewall control include the presence of application
   proxies that are either colocated or physically separate from the
   firewall.  The mechanism introduced in this document allows end nodes
   to signal their preferences directly to the firewall, or to another
   entity that controls the firewall.  Hence, this mechanism allows
   network operators to continue the use of application proxies that
   control the firewall, while adding this new mechanism as a generic
   option.

3.  Protocol operation

   The FCON protocol allows nodes to send its preferences to a Policy
   Decision Point (PDP) in order to configure a firewall with those
   preferences.  The PDP may be located anywhere in the network,
   including the access router sharing the node's link.  Furthermore, it
   may be colocated with the firewall.  FCON allows the node to create
   new entries, add entries, as well as, modify or delete existing
   entries.  FCON uses ICMP for transporting its messages between the
   node in question and the PDP.  FCON can also be used to request the
   allocation of a unique IPv4 address and one or more port numbers by a
   Network Address Translator (NAT).

                   Figure 1: Communication architecture

   Nodes that implement FCON first need to discover the IP address of
   the PDP in order to send future messages.  The PDP's address is
   either included in a router advertisement option or a new DHCPv6
   option.  Alternative discovery mechanisms are described in Appendix
   A.  Following the discovery phase, a node may start sending messages
   to the PDP requesting that certain protocols or port numbers be
   opened for its traffic on a firewall or Policy Enforcement Point
   (PEP).  A node may also request a unique IPv4 address and one or more
   port numbers for NAT traversal.  All entries created by a node have a
   lifetime associated with them and MUST be refreshed in order to avoid
   losing them.  The lifetime is set by the PDP and cached by the node
   using FCON.

   Depending on the network configuration, from the end host's point of
   view, the PDP may be colocated with a firewall or separated.



Soliman, et al.           Expires May 12, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Firewall Control Protocol          November 2007


   Moreover, both functions could be colocated with an access router or
   located within the core network.  The protocol between the PDP and
   the firewall is outside the scope of this document.  Authentication
   and authorisation of FCON messages takes place by the PDP.  The PDP
   is assumed to be authenticated with the firewalls through one of
   several methods, including manual configuration of security
   associations, public key-based authentication, or any other method
   deemed appropriate by the network administrator.

   Message authentication and authorisation is a critical component of
   the FCON protocol.  Different deployment models may have different
   requirements for authentication and authorisation.  In some
   deployments the use of public keys and trusted certificates can be
   sufficient to authorise an end node for FCON messages.  Examples of
   such deployments may include enterprise or home networks.  Other
   deployments may require proof that the sender is authorised to
   perform the action requested.  Given the information exchanged in the
   FCON messages, it is sufficient for a node to prove the ownership of
   the address included in a message to be authorised to perform the
   requested action provided that such action does not violate the
   network administrator's policies.  Hence, the PDP first needs to know
   that a sending node owns the address included in the message, then
   ensure that the request does not violate any known policies.
   Following such verification the PDP would configure the firewall/NAT
   with the necessary information requested by the end node.

   This specification allows FCON security to be based on self-generated
   public keys and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs).  This
   allows nodes to provide the necessary address ownership credentials
   in those deployments that require it.  Alternatively, public keys
   associated with PKI can be used for deployments that do not require
   proof of address ownership.

4.  Firewall Scenarios

   This section describes limitations in current firewall deployment,
   and illustrates challenges in attempting to control firewalls
   dynamically using FCON.  Scenarios are described which motivate
   features described in this document.

   Manual policy firewalls describe the state of the art, with respect
   to deployed networks.  A management platform acts as a static policy
   decision point, propagating policy out to one or more policy
   enforcement points.  Such an environment is displayed in Figure 2.
   Connection state creation occurs when data plane packets compliant
   with policy are received.

   Static firewalls such as these may exist where the PDP and PEP are
   collapsed into the same entity, and long term configuration occurs on
   the same device where connection state is created.

                               PEP

                         Figure 2: Static Firewall

   As shown in Figure 2, where connection state is required for inbound
   packet flows, the PEP's preconfigured policy is used to create
   inbound connection state.  Such connections are available at all
   times, and depend upon the specificity of the PDP's inbound policy in
   order to maintain internal network security.  These inbound
   communications remain available regardless of the lifetime of the
   individual server applications.

              Figure 3: Inbound Connection on Static Firewall

   Problems emerged when people attempted to support peer-to-peer
   applications with dynamic source and destination addresses.  This is
   illustrated in Figure 4.  Transport layer connection state is unable
   to identify the upper layer inbound connection associated with the
   peer-to-peer application.  Inbound packets are dropped on the
   secondary session unless the Firewall snoops and understands the
   specific protocol, and the inbound policy is loosened to permit such
   inbound sessions.

           Figure 4: Peer-to-Peer Connection on Static Firewall

   By enabling dynamic signalling, a host can inform the network
   elements of its intention to send packets with a particular source
   and destination address, and transport profile.  This means that the
   policy decision and enforcement can occur at the time that the
   session is established, and adapt specifically to the needs of the
   network's current transmission profile.

   In Figure 5, the host informs the PDP which protocols are expected
   through the network gateways using a Request message to create a flow
   decriptor entry in the firewall.  The PDP indicates whether the
   session will be allowed, and state created on the PEP.  In this case,
   a Response message is sent, indicating that the PDP believes the
   communications are allowed.

               Figure 5: Outbound Session with PDP Signaling

   In many environments, multiple Firewalls exist on the path to the
   Internet.  This is shown in Figure 6.

   Signalling is either performed to a single PDP which passes
   information to both PEPs, or to a separate PDP for each PEP.  By
   using separate PDPs, different trust policy and vendor independence
   may be readily achieved.  This may particularly be applicable where
   the internal firewall is operated by an enterprise, and the exterior
   firewall by a service provider.

5.  PDP Discovery

5.1.  DHCP extensions

   In order to configure PDPs on hosts using the existing access
   infrastructure, a DHCP option is provided.

   The option format includes PDPs with destination coverage information
   on a per-PDP basis in a suboption format.  This would allow for
   specific PDPs to have jurisdiction over different network ranges (for

6.  Protocol Messages

   FCON uses ICMPv6 for transporting its messages.  The protocol is
   based on a request respose message exchange.  Hence, two ICMP message
   types are needed.  The ICMP Code field is used to distinguish
   different types of FCON messages.  Each message can contain one or
   more options.  This sections lists all protocol messages and options.

6.1.  The Request Message Format

   The Request message is sent from the end node to the PDP.  The
   purpose of the message depends on the options included.  For each
   operation described in this specification a specific set of options
   must be included.  The format of the request message is shown below.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Session Id

      An unsigned 16-bit integer that includes a session identifier.
      The session identifier is initially picked by the end node when a
      security association is created with the PDP.  The Session Id MUST
      be unique for a particular end node, which is identified by its
      public key.

   Reserved

      This field MUST be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the
      receiver.

   Message Id

      This field include a message identifier.  The message identifier
      is a simple counter incremented by 1 for every new message.  This
      field is used to match responses with their correcponding
      requests.

Internet-Draft          Firewall Control Protocol          November 2007


6.2.  The Response Message Format

   The Response message is sent from the PDP to the end node in response
   to a request message sent from the end node.  The response message
   includes the same Session Id and Message Id that were included in the
   sender's Request message.  The Response message may contain several
   options.  The options contained in a given message depend on the type
   of operation requested in the Request message.  The format for the
   Response message is shown below.

      This field MUST be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the
      receiver.

   Message Id

      This field include a message identifier.  The message identifier
      is a simple counter incremented by 1 for every new message.  A
      Response message's identifier is set to the message identifier of
      the corresponding request message.

6.3.  The Init Message

   The Init message is sent from the end node to the PDP in order to
   establish a secure association before sending further requests.  This
   message MUST NOT include information about flows that need to be
   installed in the firewall.  Instead, the message contains the end
   node's security credentials and a challenge for the PDP.

      This field indicates the format used for the flow descriptior.
      Values TBA

   PRI

      This field indicates the priority of a particular flow.  A lower
      value indicates a higher priority.  A value of 1 indicates the
      highest priority.  A value of zero is not allowed by this
      specification.  The rpiority field is needed in cases where two
      flow descriptions overlap while having conflicting Action fileds.
      The Action field included in the option with higher priority takes
      precedence.

   Reserved

      This field MUST be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the
      receiver.

6.5.3.  The Nonce Option

   The Nonce Option is illustrated in Figure 15 and is used to ensure
   freshness in acknowledgements from the PDP to the requesting FCON
   node.  It works by making sure that the PDP copies the Nonce Option
   from the request into the response.  The Nonce is checked along with
   other freshness and authentication information before

   As such, a new Nonce MUST be selected for each transmission of a
   request message.  PDPs receiving a valid request message MUST copy
   the Nonce option into the response, regardless of the status of any
   individual flow.

   The Nonce MUST be unpredictable, and SHOULD contain hardware
   generated randomness, where possible.

      A value assigned to this option.

   Length

      The length of this option in 8-octet units.

   Nonce

      The Nonce is a block of data selected by the requester to be sent
      to the PDP. the entire length of the Nonce block MUST NOT exceed
      384 bits.  It MUST contain at least 64 bits of unpredictable
      random data.  It SHOULD contain significantly more randomness.

      PDPs receiving the Nonce SHOULD cache it to ensure that duplicate
      request packets are not processed from the same source.

6.5.4.  The Timestamp Option

   The Timestamp option format is used to ensure attackers are unable
   create state in the future by replaying signed FCON messages.  It
   relies on congruence between clock information within nodes and PDPs,
   and therefore has some limitations where secured time synchronization
   is not available

   The following option format follows the principles and message
   formats as described in the [RFC3971], except that its protections
   may be weaker when operating in a multi-hop domain.

      The length of this option in 8-octet units.

   Timestamp

      A 64-bit unsigned integer field containing a timestamp.  The value
      indicates the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC,
      by using a fixed point format.  In this format, the integer number
      of seconds is contained in the first 48 bits of the field, and the
      remaining 16 bits indicate the number of 1/64K fractions of a
      second.

   Each FCON message MUST contain the Timestamp option, and recipients
   SHOULD ensure that Timestamps are valid to prove freshnes of the
   message.

   Processing of this option follows that for SEND, except that that the
   corresponding figures for clock drift and fuzz are more lenient.
   This allows for longer attack windows of attack against FCON
   infrastructures, but also allows for deviations in packet transfer
   delays on multi-hop networks and the extended duration of the state
   created in Firewalls, as opposed to Neighbour Discovery:

      TIMESTAMP_DELTA 600 seconds (10 minutes)

      TIMESTAMP_FUZZ 6 seconds

      TIMESTAMP_DRIFT 1 % (0.01)

6.5.5.  The IP Address Option

   The IP address option is used by a node to request a unique IPv4
   address and one or more port numbers.

      The Flag indicating Certificate Path Discovery is ok (Flag Set).

      This flag being set allows the response to use [RFC3971]
      Certifcation Path Advertisement Messages to convey the list of
      certificates for the respondent.  If this flag is not set, the
      sender MUST use Init messages instead.

      This Cookie is required to appear in all such messages (IANA
      Note).

   Length

      A string of bytes chosen by the PDP to ensure liveness of
      responses.  The entire option, carrying this field needs to be
      copied into an INIT for transmission to the PDP, along with
      credential information.

6.5.7.  The Public Key Option

   The Public Key option is used to provide information to the PDP about
   the identity being used to sign the message.  By using the key
   information in this option, or a cached copy, the PDP can use
   information in the Digital Signature Option, to verify the message's
   integrity.

   This Option MUST be present in the message sent from a particular
   host to a PDP, and from a PDP to a host with which it has not
   communicated, unless the same information is provided within the
   message using a Certificate Option.  If a host or PDP communicate
   with each other during a period where security state is still in
   existence, then the sender MAY leave this option out.

   Where a receiving endpoint does not support a Key Type, it may
   indicate this to the far end in an acknowledgement but otherwise
   SHOULD NOT create any state in PEPs.

6.5.9.  The Certificate Option

   The Certificate option contains a digital certificate issued by one
   of the Certificate Authorities in the sender's trust chain.  It
   provides information about trust delegated to the sender or its
   authorizing authorities.  This option follows the same format as in
   [RFC3971], and the certificates can be sent in Certification Path
   Advertisement messages, between hosts and PDPs.

   The Certificate Option MAY be included in an FCON request or response
   message instead of including the Public Key option.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that only one of the Public Key Option or Certificate
   Option is included in any FCON request or response message.

6.5.10.  The Digital Signature Option

   The Digital Signature Option MUST be included in every FCON message,
   and authenticates the preceding message contents.  It does this by
   performing a signature over the message contents by the key
   identifies in the Key Hash field.  It is always placed last in any
   sequence of options, before presentation for transmission.

   If multiple identities are signing the message, the most specific
   user signs the message with the first digital signature option, over



Soliman, et al.           Expires May 12, 2008                 [Page 28]

   all options preceding that one.  Subsequent signers include all
   required option information to ensure validation of their message
   after this signature, and then include their own digital signature at
   the end, signing over all included options, including the previous
   digital signature.  This allows user level and host level
   authentication within the same message, and provides distinction
   between administrative and non-power users on a multi-user server.

   If a device receives a digital signature and is unable to identify
   the Public Key to which the signature is tied, it may challenge the
   sender, or silently discard the received FCON message.  Therefore, it
   is important to include the Public Key Option in a message unless it
   is known that the peer device is known to have recently received it.

7.  Establishing a Secure Connection

   A host wishing to request that state be created on a PEP signals a
   PDP with either an Init message containing credential information, or
   a Request message containing the filter information describing the
   host's intended protocol behaviour.

   Either of these messages MUST contain the Public Key Option (or a
   Substituted Certificate Option containing the relevant Public Key)
   and a Digital Signature Option, along with Timestamp and Nonce
   information.  In addition, the Init message contains a unique session
   identifier field selected by the requesting node.  This session
   identifier field will be used for subsequent signaling of other
   messages upon successful establishment of a secure session.

   If the PDP can determine from the contents of the message that it
   believes the host is an acceptable requester, it can respond to the
   request with the appropriate success acknowledgement in the Init
   Acknowledgement message.

   If the PDP is not able to authemticate or authorise the credentials
   for the host, it replies with an Init-Ack or Response containing a
   non success response code, and a Cookie Option.  Where the host
   wishes to establish a secure connection, the host must return this
   same cookie in the subsequent message (or messages for trust chains
   which exceed a single packet).

   The host may then send additional information in the form of either a
   sequence of Certificate Path Advertisements, if allowed in the Cookie
   option.  Finally, when all credentials are transmitted, the host
   again sends an Init message containing the last received cookie.

   For the case where the Init-Ack contained the failure code "Liveness
   Test Needed", no further credentials are required, although an Init
   MUST be resent containing the received Cookie Option.

8.  Creating New entries

   Entries consist of one or more flow identification options that are
   sent from an end node to the PDP.  In order to create entries the end
   node must send a Request message to the PDP.  The Request message
   MUST contain and appropriate session identifier value, and a Message
   identifier.  The message identifier can be implemented as a
   monotonously increasing counter.  The Request message contains the
   following options:

   o  One or more Flow Identification options.  Each option contains a
      unique Index field, an appropriate Action field, a format field
      indicating the format of the flow descriptor and an appropriate
      priority in the PRI field.

   o  The Nonce option

   o  The Digital Signature option.

   Upon receiving the Request message, the PDP verifies the signature in
   the message.  If the verification fails, the message is silently
   discarded.

   Upon successful verification of the Request message, the PDP checks
   the message header.  If the session identifier is not known, the PDP
   sends a Response message with the same session and message
   identifiers and includes and Acknowledgement option with the status
   field set to 130.

   If the message is correctly formed, the PDP inspects each flow
   identification option.  If an error is found in any of the flow
   options, the PDP sends a Response message with the Acknowledgement
   indicating failure with the appropriate error code.  The failed
   options MUST be included in the Response message. successful options
   are processed by the PDP.

   The process of updating existing flows is described in Section 9.

   If all options are processed successfully, the PDP sends a Response
   message.  The session and message identifier fields are set to the
   same value in the Request message.  The Response message includes the
   following options:

   o  The Acknowledgement option.  This option's status field indicates
      success

   o  The Lifetime option.  This option includes the lifietime
      associated with the new entries.  The end node needs to refresh

      those entries before the lifetime expires.

   o  The nonce option.

   o  The Digital Signature option.

   Note that the process of adding new entries does not require the end
   nodes to send all existing entries.  Only new flows need to be
   included in the Request message.

9.  Updating Entries

   Updating existing entries may take place due to the need for changing
   the flow description, deleting an existing entry, or simply
   refreshing an entry before its timer expires.  When refreshing
   entries there is no need for the requesting node to send the entire
   Flow identifier option in a Request message.  It is sufficient to
   send the option without the flow descriptor.

   Updating entries is done using the same Request message as described
   in Section 8 Upon receiving the Request message, the PDP verifies the
   Digital signature option.  If the verification failed, the message is
   silently discarded.

   After successfully verifying the message, the PDP processes each flow
   identifier option for formatting, flow descriptor (if the FID field
   indicates a new flow) and the Action field.  If all of the flow
   identifier options are rejected, the PDP responds with a Response
   message, including the acknowledgement option, which indicates
   failure with an appropriate error code.

   If some of the filter identifier options are rejected and others are
   accepted, the PDP responds with the Response message, including the
   acknowledgement option, which indicates partial success.  The
   Response message also includes the lifetime option with an
   appropriate lifetime for the accepted options.  In addition, the
   Response message includes all of the failed options.  Each of the
   failed options includes a Status field, which indicates the reason
   for failure.

   After receiving the Response message, the requesting node updates its
   list of accepted entries and the corresponding lifetimes for those
   entries.

10.  Requesting an IPv4 Address

   A requesting node may wish to know the public IPv4 address and port
   numbers allocated to it by a NAT for one or more of its applications.
   To do that, it can request one or more IP addresses and port numbers
   while specifying the protocol that it wants to use.  This is done by
   sending a Request message that includes the following options:

   o  The IP address option.

   o  The nonce option.

   o  The digital signature option.

   Upon receiving the Request message, the PDP verifies the digital
   signature included.  If the verification failed, the PDP silently
   discards the message.

   If the PDP allows nodes to request an IPv4 address, it can proceed
   with the processing of the IP address option.  Otherwise, the PDP
   rejects the request by sending a Response message with an
   acknowledgement option contaiing the appropriate error code.

   If the IP address option is valid, the PDP proceeds to allocate the
   requested address(es) and port numbers.  The method used by the PDP
   to communicate with the NAT/firewall is outside the scope of this
   document.

   If the After allocating the IP address to the requesting node, the
   PDP sends a Response message including the IP address option, which
   includes the allocated addresses and ports, the nonce option, the
   lifetime option and the digital signature option.

   Upon receiving the Response message and verifying the digital
   signature option, the requesting node can use the IP address(es) and
   ports allocated in the message for the duration of the lifitime
   option.  Should the requesting node wish to refresh the allocated
   addresses and ports, it MUST send the Request message with the IP
   address option including all the previously allocated IP addresses
   and ports.

11.  Timeouts and Retransmissions

   Where a host receives no response to a packet sent directly to a PDP,
   it may need to retransmit its initial packet.  Each request MAY be
   transmitted up to four (4) times, each with a different Nonce and
   updated TimeStamp.  Separation between one transmission and its next
   should be performed such that timeouts are exponential.  RECOMMENDED
   timeouts are 1,2 and 4 seconds.  A host SHOULD delay an initial
   retransmission by between 0 and 100ms, to ensure any retransmissions
   are serialized.

   The PDP never sends packets to the host, except in response to an
   FCON message.  In order to respond in sufficient time, it is
   recommended that the PDP respond without induced delay to any packet
   sent directly to its IP address.

11.1.  Session Start Delays

   When a new session is established, if a data plane transmission
   delays until FCON acknowledgements are received, there is likely to
   be significant added delay for every TCP or UDP session creation.  It
   is therefore recommended that FCON immediately precedes packet
   transmission on the data plane, where it is not harmful to lose one
   or two of the initial packets.  This may for example, be the case
   with unreliable protocols such as VoIP.

   Also, when a host has one or more existing communications open in
   negotiation with a PDP, it is possible to send the packets
   immediately after sending the FCON request.  This optimizes for the
   case where new state is able to be created immediately, and reduces
   latency at the risk of causing packet loss and retransmission on
   initial packets.

   Where a host has not communicated to a PDP previously, it MAY induce
   additional delay before sending the data plane packets, in order to
   limit additional delays due to retransmission and timeout at the
   Transport Layer of the data session.

   Significantly, when FCON packet loss or delay occurs on the
   signalling path, this means that packet loss or delay will ensue,
   with the timings described in the prior section.

13.  Security Considerations

   Certain assumptions underly the initial version of this draft, which
   need to be considered appropriately.  Firstly, the role of CGAs in
   providing proof of address ownership in this protocol is primarily an
   enabler, and may be insufficient in some environments to authorize
   communications for a particular destination.

   This may particularly be the case for devices with multiple users,
   where individuals have permission to access specific data services,
   but others are excluded.  CGAs at host level granularity are
   insufficient to distinguish which of the users is attempting a
   communication.

   Mechanisms which could be used to provide such distinction are user-
   level digital signatures over the filter message contents and
   freshness information, in addition to CGA information.  Additionally,
   to ensure that the PDP only has to process a single digital
   signature, subsets users on multi-host systems could be allocated
   CGAs tied to their own public key information while using that host.

   Therefore FCON messages from different users on a system would have
   different security credentials, and still allow CGA authorization.
   The internal processes on the host to allow for signing such messages
   is beyond the scope of this document, but it is easy to envisage an
   ICMP message signing service which a user subscribes to, that uses
   the subscribed private-key credentials to sign FCON and SEND
   messages.

   Regardless of the identity of the message signer, FCON request
   messages require authentication of the node, and the response
   messages require proof of the PDP's identity in order to prevent
   denial-of-service through spoofing attacks.  Denial of service can
   occur due to the requirement to process digital signatures on
   response messages.  Hosts which detect many excessive responses from
   PDPs, such as would indicate a denial-of-service attempt MAY defer
   processing digital signatures on responses, and rely on freshness and
   Nonce information in the message itself to determine if a digital
   signature needs to be processed.  This limits denial . of service
   attacks to those who are able to guess nonces, or are on the path to
   the PDP.

Appendix A.  Dynamic PDP Discovery (Informative)

   In some of the described scenarios, it may not be feasible to
   prepopulate the endpoints with information for all of the relevant
   PDPs responsible for firewall policy along a particular data path.
   For these scenarios, sending data to an existing configured PDP may
   be insufficient to create state in all firewalls on the path.  This
   may lead to packets being dropped, even though signalling has been
   performed, and all known signaling accomplished.

   One mechanism to ensure that all PDPs for a data path are informed of
   changes is to send CREATE packets along the path at the time
   establishing a data connection.  Such packets would be sent to the
   same IP source and destination as the packets in the data stream, but
   the IP packet would contain the Router-Alert Hop-By-Hop option
   [RFC2460].

   Enforcement or Decision Point devices which receive such probes,
   would refer the packet for processing, and identify that the ICMP
   message contained a CREATE operation.  The message filter contents
   would then define which sessions are requested to be allowed through
   the firewall.

   Depending upon policy, the PDP or PEP would either DENY the data
   flow, sending a CREATE-NACK message, refer the sender to an
   appropriate PDP using the PDP-REDIRECT message, or create the state
   for the session according to the filter, and send a CREATE-ACK.  In
   the case that the session state creation is refused or redirected,
   the CREATE packet packet itself is dropped.  In the alternative case
   where state is created, the CREATE packet should be forwarded onward
   toward its destination.  At this stage, the potential to create
   multiple responses to a single message is the primary danger of this
   method.

   An alternative which increases setup latency is to drop the CREATE
   packet when new state is created, and send a CREATE-ACK.  On each
   successive CREATE packet which does not alter session state, the
   CREATE packet is passed onward towards the destination.  This removes
   any multiplication attacks, but causes delay of up to N x RTT for N
   policy devices along the path.

   Similar operations for UPDATE would also occur, with state being
   created if it didn't exist, or replaced in the case it already was in
   place.

   Once a host discovers that a Policy Decision Point exists on a
   particular path, it can then signal directly to it.  Devices can add
   these to the PDPs discovered using DHCP or other mechanisms.

Internet-Draft          Firewall Control Protocol          November 2007


   Even though the packets are sent between the same source and
   destination addresses as those of the data session, they may travel a
   different path to the actual data stream, for example due to load
   balancing.  In such a case, a PDP or PEP which receives the CREATE or
   UPDATE method can send a PDP-REDIRECT, to refer the origin to the
   appropriate policy decision point for the data flows.

   Where a host application accepts inbound packets passively, it may be
   useful to ensure that Policy enforcement and decision points beyond
   the DHCP configured range are included in signaling.  Such can be
   achieved by configuring a filter describing the allowed inbound
   source and destination addresses of packets and addressing a hop-by-
   hop CREATE packet to a set of potential inbound source addresses.

   Such probing can be limited in terms of the number of addresses to
   probe, as well as the time-to-live of the packet itself, in order to
   prevent impacts upon the network.
