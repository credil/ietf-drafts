Internet-Draft              PPSP Requirements                  July 2009


1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


2.  Introduction

   Peer to Peer (P2P) computing has been successfully used in many
   fields, from one to one communication like Voice over IP (VoIP) and
   Instance Messaging (IM), to one to many communication like streaming,
   file sharing and gaming.  In the streaming area, the popularity of
   P2P real-time and video on demand (VoD) streaming technology has been
   demonstrated by PPlive [WWW.PPLive], PPStream [WWW.PPStream], UUSee
   [WWW.UUSee], Pando [WWW.Pando] etc.  Take PPLive for example, it has
   over 5 million online users at the same time for real-time streaming.
   Also some web2.0 streaming applications such as Youtube
   [WWW.YouTube], Tudou [WWW.Tudou] are reported to use or are preparing
   to use P2P engine to accelerate its downloading rate and cut down the
   transmission cost, especially in the winter of the financal crisis
   which is being felt all over the world.  P2P streaming applications
   account for more and more Internet traffic.  According to statistics
   in a major Chinese Internet Service Provider (ISP), PPlive accounts
   10% of the total Internet backbone traffic.  In contrast,
   Bittorrent's traffic share is about 8% in the ISP's backbone.

   Internet streaming is a blooming technology.  To accomodate resource
   consumption, several architectures based on P2P principles exist.  An
   important drawback is their incompatibility with standards.
   Therefore, it is impossible for various applications (e.g. web
   services, IPTV, content distribution, etc) to reuse all or parts of
   their components to implement decentralized streaming.  Therefore,
   it's time to draw up an open and standard P2P Streaming Protocol
   (PPSP) in the IETF to achieve broader adoption of P2P streaming and
   regulate its behavior from the broader Internet point of view.

   Note that the PPSP is in fact at its early stage and there is still a
   lot of work to be done in the near future.  This version of PPSP
   requirements is just a start point and people are kindly invited to
   enhance and expand it.

Internet-Draft              PPSP Requirements                  July 2009


3.1.  Motivation for P2P Streaming Protocol

   P2P streaming applications attract more and more users to consume
   video content online [WWW.PPLive][WWW.PPStream].  In the case of VoD,
   different users watch different parts of the video content so that a
   peer normally maintains a buffer to share video content with other
   peers.  In the case of live content, because all peers are mostly
   interested in what is actually happens "now", one possible role of a
   peer is to request video content from a live source and then forward
   the content to more peers, hence reducing the work load of the live
   source [WWW.PPLive].

   P2P streaming applications adopt a decentralized streaming
   architecture where the media content is shared among peers who not
   only download but also upload media content to each other.  The
   advantages of this decentralized streaming architecture include less
   workload (hence reduced cost) on streaming servers, and better
   streaming scalability for a large number of users.  However, most
   current P2P streaming applications make use of proprietary protocols,
   making it impossible for various applications (e.g. web services,
   IPTV, content distribution, etc) to reuse all or part of their
   components to implement decentralized streaming.  Therefore, an open
   and standard protocol for P2P Streaming Protocol (PPSP) defined in
   the IETF would greatly benefit many applications through a
   decentralized streaming architecture which enables reduced
   infrastructure cost on infrastructure (e.g. media servers) and better
   scalability for an increased number of users.

3.2.  Definition and Scope of P2P Streaming Protocol

   Based on the overview of P2P streaming systems [Survey][ProbSta], the
   basic role of PPSP is to define a protocol of locating and
   transmitting real-time/VoD data efficiently from multiple sources
   with different pieces in peer to peer environment.  Therefore PPSP
   can be divided into PPSP signaling protocol and transmission protocol
   where PPSP signaling protocol will address the issue of distributed
   data location.  The common process of P2P streaming applications
   includes:

   a) Peer sends content request/or registration to some centralized
   directory server (a.k.a.  Tracker) and the server return with a peer
   list in which the peer are sharing the requested content.  This step
   is currently implemented by different P2P applications as private
   protocols.  It may either be done by P2PSIP RELOAD
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] because Dynamic Hash Table (DHT) can manage
   the peer list and return the peer list to the requestor.

   b) Peer communicate with the peers in the obtained peer list to

   exchange the chunk description, i.e. which chunks are located in
   which peers, as well as additional peer list having been learned by
   other peers.  This step should be done by PPSP signaling protocol.

   c) Chunk is scheduled, i.e. which chunks are to be transmitted from
   which peers.  This step is based on internal algorithm (e.g. rarest
   first) which should be performed by P2P applications themselves and
   thus outof the scope of PPSP signaling protocol.

   d) Chunk is transmitted among peers.  This step should be done by
   PPSP transmission protocol.

   Therefore, the core part of PPSP signaling protocol is a set of
   messages between peers for:

   o  the chunk description of each peer (e.g. buffer map);

   o  list of additional peers to aggregate more peers;

   o  additional peer status information related to content delivery.

3.3.  Related Work in IETF

3.3.1.  P2PSIP

   P2PSIP is an IETF WG focusing on the protocols for distributed
   resource location [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base].  However, in P2P streaming,
   the chunk description of each peer (e.g. buffer map) is highly
   dynamic and real-time, which means that simply maintaining this
   highly dynamic information in the P2PSIP overlay network may cause
   overload of the peers.  Therefore, in P2P streaming, it is better to
   keep the chunk description locally in distributed peers and use PPSP
   signaling to discover which peer has which content.


4.  P2P Streaming Protocol Requirements

4.1.  PPSP General Requirements

   REQ 1: PPSP MUST be able to support streaming services when the
   number of users keeps growing, i.e. scale to very large audiences.

   Internet video streaming, if it is to compete with classical TV
   broadcasting, has to scale to very large audiences (large scale:
   hundreds of thousands of users) [LiveStream].  PPSP adopts a
   decentralized streaming architecture where the media content is
   shared among peers who not only download but also upload media
   content to each other.

   REQ 2: PPSP MUST be self-adaptive to a large numbers of dynamically
   joining and leaving users, i.e. robust to peer churn.

   The robustness of a streaming system is required when a large number
   of customers dynamically join and leave the system, specially if some
   form of video relaying or forwarding for bandwidth saving is
   employed.  In PPSP, a peer simultaneously contacts with more than one
   peer to share media content, thus reducing the impact of peer churn.

4.2.  PPSP Signaling Requirements

   REQ.1: PPSP signaling MUST be able to carry chunk description (e.g.
   buffer map) of the peers.

   In order to share content among peers, peers must be able to tell
   each other which chunks reside in which peers.  That is, PPSP
   signaling must carry chunk description of the peers.

         |                                                |

                 Figure 2: Exchange Chunk Description

   One common type of chunk description is called a buffer map,
   indicating which chunks a peer currently has buffered and can share
   with other peers.  The buffer map can include the offset (the ID of
   the first chunk stored by the peer), the length of the buffer map,
   and a string of zeroes and ones indicating which chunks are available
   (starting with the chunk designated by the offset).

              <------- Buffer Map Length ------------->
              +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  <---------->| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
     offset   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------->
                                                          Content Length

                      Figure 3: Buffer Map

   After a peer receives a buffer map from other peers, the peer can
   request one or more chunks that other peers have advertised in the
   buffer map.

   REQ.2: PPSP signaling MUST be able to negotiate the semantics of
   chunk description.

   In order for every peer to know the exact meaning of each part of the
   chunk description, it is necessary for peers to negotiate the
   semantics of chunk description.  For instance, the size of each chunk
   represented by the buffer map.  Note that although the semantics of
   chunk description can be specified in a standard manner, it is useful
   to apply such negotiation to allow for more flexible interaction
   between different applications.  For example, some P2P streaming
   application schedulers are based on chunks corresponding to size of
   mili-seconds while other schedulers are based on the size of seconds.

     Local Peer                                         Peers

         |<---------------------------------------------->|
         |                                                |

   Only when these semantic of chunk description are negotiated and
   decided among all the peers will every peer be able to share chunk
   information with each other, i.e., which chunks are stored in which
   peers.

   REQ.3: PPSP signaling May carry additional peer list.

   Note that the tracker/DHT only return an initial list of peers to new
   peer.  Some peers may need more peers to connect with and share
   content.  In order for each peer to know more peers sharing the same
   content, it is possible that the peer communicates with the peers in
   the current peer list to obtain additional lists which it aggregates
   with the current peer list.  In this manner, each peer maintains a
   list of other peers sharing the same content.

     Local Peer                                         Peers

                    Figure 5: Exchange Peer List

   REQ.4: PPSP signaling May carry peer status for content delivery
   (e.g. bandwidth, work load of the peers).

   In addition to the chunk description, peers may want to know other
   status information for content delivery.  Such status information
   should be related to the content delivery, including the peers'
   access type, bandwidth, storage, work load, etc.  With this
   information, a peer can select more appropriate peers for content
   sharing based on some content sharing strategies and/or application
   requirements.

   For some peers deployed by ISP such as those comprising Content
   Distribution Network (CDN), PPSP signaling MUST be able to carry peer
   information.  In this way, CDN will announce its capabilities for
   providing streaming content to the peers.

4.3.  PPSP Transmission Requirements

   REQ 1: PPSP transmission MUST be able to support limited start-up
   delay and limited latency between the broadcasting time and the
   audience view time [LiveStream].

   REQ 2: PPSP transmission MAY support efficient one-to-many data
   transport with some extent of fairness assurance and balance between
   self-constraint and aggression for network bandwidth.

4.4.  PPSP Error Handling Requirements

   REQ.1: A peer MUST be able to respond with error information to peers
   sending chunk description messages when some information (e.g. chunk
   ID) cannot be understood in the message.

   In this case, the sending peer may start a negotiation flow to

4.5.  PPSP Security Requirements

   REQ 1: PPSP MUST be able to provide mechanisms to prevent peers from
   distributing wrong information, such as claiming they have the chunks
   that they don't, or sending out false peer status information.

6.  Security Considerations

    The scope of this section is to analyze the security threats and 
    provide the requirements for the PPSP architecture  While peer-to-
    peer (P2P) live  streaming prevails in recent years, an important 
    but less studied problem is security. 


6.1.	PPSP access control Requirement

   SEC REQ 1:  PPSP must ensure that only authorized users can access  
   the original media in the P2P live streaming system.  This can be 
   achieved by defining or adopting such mechanisms as user 
   authentication and/or key management scheme. 
 
   Such access control must be secure, scalable, reliable, and 
   efficient for PPSP live streaming systems.


6.2  PPSP confidentiality Requirement

   SEC REQ 2: Confidentiality of the streaming data should be 
   supported and the corresponding key management scheme must scale 
   well without degrading the system performance.

6.3 PPSP stream pollution prevention requirement

   SEC REQ 3:  P2PSP must prevent stream pollution attacks.  In the 
   stream pollution attack, the attacker mixes into the stream bogus 
   chunks.  Such an attack will degrade the quality of the rendered 
   media at the receiver.  In a P2P live video streaming system a 
   polluter can introduce corrupted chunks.  Each receiver integrates 
   into its playback stream the polluted chunks it receives from its 
   other neighbors.  Since the peers forwards chunks to other peers, 
   the polluted content can potentially spread through much of the 
   PPSP streaming network.  

 6.4 PPSP must prevent various DOS attacks

   Given the prevalence of DoS attacks in the Internet, it is 
   important to realize that a similar threat could exist in a large-
   scale PPSP media streaming system where attackers are capable of 
   consuming a lot of resources with just a small amount of effort.  
   Below are some PPSP DOS related requirements.

   SEC REQ 4: The PPSP system must prevent selfish and malicious peers 
   to exhaust the system's available upload bandwidth.

   SEC REQ 5: The PPSP system must be fault tolerant.  Here the PPSP 
   architecture should make sure that data stored in the network is 

   persistent in that if other peers fail, data is not lost to those 
   peers.  The attacker should not be able to obtain unlimited 
   resources in the PPSP streaming network. 

   SEC REQ 6: The PPSP system should have a mechanism to limit 
   potential damage caused by malfunctioning and badly behaving nodes 
   in a PPSP system.   It should be possible limit the impact of the 
   badly behaving nodes on the overall system security.  In addition 
   there should be a way to identify badly  behaving nodes, and 
   exclude or reject them from the PPSP system.

  6.5 PPSP must provide privacy of its participants
  
   SEC REQ 7: PPSP security must be able to participate in the PPSP 
   streaming network without in private manner without any aspect of 
   the peers privacy violated.

   6.6 PPSP should use existing security mechanisms when possible

   SEC REQ 8: Existing security mechanisms should be used as much as 
   possible to protect PPSP functions and components, and avoid the 
   need for standardizing new mechanisms.

   6.7  PPSP Security must not limit scalability or performance 

   SEC REQ 9:  Security should not limit PPSP scalability, 
   performance and reliability.

   6.9 PPSP must provide option for encryption

   SEC REQ 10:  The PPSP network entities must be provided with an 
   option to encrypt data exchange with other PPSP network entities.

   6.10 PPSP should minimize the dependence on central server

   SEC REQ 11: Dependence of reachability of a centralized server 
   should be minimized.
