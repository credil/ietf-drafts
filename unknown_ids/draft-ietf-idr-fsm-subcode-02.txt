              Subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine Error
                     draft-ietf-idr-fsm-subcode-02

Abstract

   This document defines several subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine
   (FSM) Error that could provide more information to help network
   operators in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating network
   events.

Internet-Draft            BGP FSM Error Subcode              August 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines several subcodes for BGP [RFC4271] Finite State
   Machine Error that could provide more information to help network
   operators in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating network
   events.  This information is also helpful to developers in lab
   situations.


2.  Definition of Finite State Machine Error Subcodes

   This document defines following subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine
   Error:

   0 - Unspecific Error

   1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State

   2 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State

   3 - Receive Unexpected Message in Established State


3.  Usage of FSM Error Subcodes

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g.  KEEPALIVE/
   UPDATE/ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenSent state, it MUST
   send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected
   Message in OpenSent State".  The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned
   integer which indicates type of the unexpected message.

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g.  OPEN/UPDATE/
   ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenConfirm state, it MUST
   send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected
   Message in OpenConfirm State".  The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned
   integer which indicates type of the unexpected message.

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g.  OPEN message)
   on a session in Established state, it MUST send to the neighbor a
   NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Finite State Machine Error
   and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in Established
   State".  The Data field is a 1-octet unsigned integer which indicates
   type of the unexpected message.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the security properties of BGP.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create the registry "BGP Finite State Machine
   Error Subcodes", within the "BGP Error Subcodes" registry, with
   Registration Procedures "Standards Action process or the Early IANA
   Allocation process".

   The registry should be populated with the following values:

   Value      Name
     0        Unspecified Error
     1        Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State
     2        Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State
     3        Receive Unexpected Message in Established State
