1.  Overview

   The CMC (Certificate Management over CMS) protocol is designed in
   terms of a client/server relationship.  In the simplest case the
   client is the requestor of the certificate (i.e. the End Entity or
   EE) and the server is the issuer of the certificate (i.e. the
   Certificate Authority(CA)).  The introduction of an RA (registration
   authority) into the set of agents complicates the picture only
   slightly.  The RA becomes the server with respect to the certificate
   requestor, and it becomes the client with respect to the certificate
   issuer.  Any number of RAs can be inserted into the picture in this
   manner.

   The RAs may serve specialized purposes that are not currently covered
   by this document.  One such purpose would be a Key Escrow agent.  As
   such all certificate requests for encryption keys would be directed
   through this RA and it would take appropriate action to do the key
   archival.  Key recovery requests could be defined in the CMC
   methodology allowing for the Key Escrow agent to perform that
   operation acting as the final server in the chain of agents.

   If there are multiple RAs in the system, it is considered normal that
   not all RAs will see all certificate requests.  The routing between
   the RAs may be dependent on the content of the certificate requests
   involved.

   This document is divided into six sections, each section specifying
   the requirements that are specific to a class of agents in the CMC
   model.  These are 1) All agents, 2) all servers, 3) all clients, 4)
   all End Entities, 5) all Registration Entities, 6) all Certificate
   Authorities.

2.  Terminology

   There are several different terms, abbreviations and acronyms used in
   this document that we define here for convenience and consistency of
   usage:

   End-Entity  (EE) refers to the entity that owns a key pair and for
      whom a certificate is issued.

   Registration Authority (RA)  or Local RA (LRA) refers to an entity
      that acts as an intermediary between the EE and the CA.  Multiple
      RAs can exist between the End-Entity and the Certification
      Authority.  RAs may perform additional services such as key
      generation or key archival.  This document uses the term RA for
      both RA and LRA.

   Certification Authority  (CA) refers to the entity that issues
      certificates.

   Client  refers to an entity that creates a PKI Request.  In this
      document both RAs and EEs can be clients.

   Server  refers to the entities that process PKI Requests and create
      PKI Responses.  In this document both CAs and RAs can be servers.

   PKCS #10  refers to the Public Key Cryptography Standard #10
      [PKCS10], which defines a certification request syntax.

   CRMF  refers to the Certificate Request Message Format RFC [CRMF].
      CMC uses this certification request syntax defined in this
      document as part of the protocol.

   CMS  refers to the Cryptographic Message Syntax RFC [CMS].  This
      document provides for basic cryptographic services including
      encryption and signing with and without key management.

   PKI Request/Response  refers to the requests/responses described in
      this document.  PKI Requests include certification requests,
      revocation requests, etc.  PKI Responses include certs-only
      messages, failure messages, etc.

   Proof-Of-Identity  refers to the client proving they are who they say
      that are to the server.

   Proof-Of-Possession (POP)  refers to a value that can be used to
      prove that the private key corresponding to a public key is in the
      possession and can be used by an end-entity.

   Transport wrapper  refers to the outermost CMS wrapping layer.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements for All Entities

   All [CMC-STRUCT] and [CMC-TRANS] compliance statements MUST be
   adhered to unless specifically stated otherwise in this document.

   All entities MUST support Full PKI Requests, Simple PKI Responses and
   Full PKI Responses.  Severs SHOULD support Simple PKI Requests.

   All entities MUST support the use of the CRMF syntax for
   certification requests.  Support for the PKCS#10 syntax for
   certification requests SHOULD be implemented by servers.

   The extendedFailInfo field SHOULD NOT be populated in the
   CMCStatusInfoExt object; the failInfo field SHOULD be used to relay
   this information.  If the extendedFailInfo field is used, it is
   suggested that an additional CMCStatusInfoExt item exist for the same
   body part with a failInfo field.

   All entities MUST implement the HTTP transport mechanism as defined
   in [CMC-TRANS].  Other transport mechanisms MAY be implemented.

3.1.  Cryptographic Algorithm Requirements

   All entities MUST verify DSA-SHA1 and RSA-SHA1 signatures in
   SignedData (see [CMS-ALG]).  Entities MAY be verify other signature
   algorithms.  It is strongly suggested that RSA-PSS with SHA-1 be
   verified (see [CMS-RSA-PSS]).  It is strongly suggested that SHA-256
   using RSA and RSA-PSS be verified (see [RSA-256]).

   All entities MUST generate either DSA-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signatures for
   SignedData (see [CMS-ALG]).  Other signatures algorithms MAY be used
   for generation.

   All entities MUST support AES as the content encryption algorithm for
   EnvelopedData (see [CMS-AES]).  Other content encryption algorithms
   MAY be implemented.

   All entities MUST support RSA as a key transport algorithm for
   EnvelopedData (see [CMS-ALG]).  All entities SHOULD support RSA-OAEP
   (see [CMS-RSA-OAEP]) as a key transport algorithm.  Other key
   transport algorithms MAY be implemented.

   If an entity supports key agreement for EnvelopedData, they MUST
   support Diffie-Hellman (see [CMS-DH]).

   If an entity supports PasswordRecipientInfo for EnvelopedData or
   AuthenticatedData, they MUST support PBKDF2 for key derivation
   algorithms.  They MUST support AES key wrap (see [RFC3394] as the key

   encryption algorithm.

   If AuthenticatedData is supported, PasswordRecipientInfo MUST be
   supported.

   Algorithm requirements for the Identity Proof Version 2 control
   (Section 6.2.1 of [CMC-STRUCT]) are: SHA-1 MUST be implemented for
   hashAlgId.  SHA-256 SHOULD be implemented for hashAlgId.  HMAC-SHA1
   MUST be implemented for macAlgId.  HMAC-SHA256 SHOULD be implemented
   for macAlgId.

   Algorithm requirements for the Pop Link Witness Version 2 control
   (Section 5.3.1 of [CMC-STRUCT]) are: SHA-1 MUST be implemented for
   keyGenAlgorithm.  SHA-256 SHOUL be implemented for keyGenAlgorithm.
   PBKDF2 MAY be implemented for keyGenAlgorithm.  HMAC-SHA1 MUST be
   implemented for macAlgorithm.  HMAC-SHA256 SHOULD be implemented for
   macAlgorithm.

   Algorithm requirements for the Encrypted POP and Decrypted POP
   controls (Section 6.7 of [CMC-STRUCT]) are: SHA-1 MUST be implemented
   for witnessAlgID.  SHA-256 SHULD be implemented for witnessAlgID.
   HMAC-SHA1 MUST be implemented for thePOPAlgID.  HMAC-SHA256 SHOULD be
   implemented for thePOPAlgID.

   Algorithm requirements for Publish Trust Anchors control (Section
   6.15 of [CMC-STRUCT]) are: SHA-1 MUST be implemented for
   hashAlgorithm.  SHA-256 SHOULD be implemented for hashAlgorithm.

   If an EE generates DH keys for certification, it MUST support section
   4 of [DH-POP].  EEs MAY support section 3 of [DH-POP].  CAs and RAs
   that do POP verification MUST support section 4 of [DH-POP] and
   SHOULD support section 3 of [DH-POP].

   EEs that need to use a signature algorithm for keys that cannot
   produce a signature MUST support Appendix C of [CMC-STRUCT] and MUST
   support the Encrypted/Decrypted POP controls.  CAs and RAs that do
   POP verification MUST support this signature algorithm and MUST
   support the Encrypted/Decrypted POP controls.

3.2.  Controls

   The following table lists the name and level of support required for
                               each control.

                      Table 1: CMC Control Attributes

   Notes:

   1.  CAs SHOULD implement this control if designed to work with RAs.

   2.  CAs MUST implement this control if designed to work with RAs.

   3.  Implementation is optional for these controls.  We strongly
       suggest that they be implemented in order to populate client
       trust anchors.

   4.  EEs only need to implement this if (a) they support key agreement
       algorithms or (b) they need to operate in environments where the
       hardware keys cannot provide POP.

   5.  RAs SHOULD implement this if they implement RA POP Witness.

   Strong consideration should be given to implementing the Authenticate
   Data and Publish Trust Anchors controls as this gives a simple method
   for distributing trust anchors into clients without user
   intervention.

3.3.  CRMF Feature Requirements

   The following additional restrictions are placed on CRMF features:

   The registration control tokens id-regCtrl-regToken and id-regCtrl-
   authToken MUST NOT be used.  No specific CMC feature is used to
   replace these items, but generally the CMC controls identification
   and identityProof will perform the same service and are more
   specifically defined.

   The control token id-regCtrl-pkiArchiveOptions SHOULD NOT be
   supported.  An alternative method is under development to provide
   this functionality.

   The behavior of id-regCtrl-oldCertID is not presently used.  It is
   replaced by issuing the new certificate and using the id-cmc-
   publishCert to remove the old certificate from publication.  This
   operation would not normally be accompanied by an immediate
   revocation of the old certificate, however that can be accomplished
   by the id-cmc-revokeRequest control.

   The id-regCtrl-protocolEncrKey is not used.

3.4.  Requirements for Clients

5.  Requirements for EEs

   If an entity implements Diffie-Hellman, it MUST implement either the
   DH-POP Proof-of-Possession as defined in [DH-POP] Section 4 or the
   challenge-response POP controls id-cmc-encryptedPOP and id-cmc-
   decryptedPOP.

6.  Requirements for RAs

   RAs SHOULD be able to do delegated POP.  RAs implementing this
   feature MUST implement the id-cmc-lraPOPWitness control.

   All RAs MUST implement the promotion of the id-aa-cmc-unsignedData as
   covered in section 3.8 of [CMC-STRUCT]

7.  Requirements for CAs

   Providing for CAs to work in an environment with RAs is strongly
   suggested.  Implementation of such support is strongly suggested as
   this permits the delegation of substantial administrative interaction
   onto an RA rather than at the CA.

   CAs MUST perform at least minimal checks on all public keys before
   issuing a certificate.  At a minimum a check for syntax would occur
   with the POP operation.  Additionally CAs SHOULD perform simple
   checks for known bad keys such as small subgroups for DSA-SHA1 and DH
   keys [SMALL-SUB-GROUP] or known bad exponents for RSA keys.

   CAs MUST enforce POP checking before issuing any certificate.  CAs
   MAY delegate the POP operation to an RA for those cases where 1) a
   challenge/response message pair must be used, 2) an RA performs
   escrow of a key and checks for POP in that manner or 3) an unusual
   algorithm is used and that validation is done at the RA.

   CAs SHOULD implement both the DH-POP Proof-of-Possession as defined
   in [DH-POP] Section 4 and the challenge-response POP controls id-cmc-
   encryptedPOP and id-cmc-decryptedPOP.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document uses [CMC-STRUCT] and [CMC-TRANS] as building blocks to
   this document.  The security sections of those two documents are
   included by reference.

   Knowledge of how an entity is expected to operate is vital in
   determining which sections of requirements are applicable to that
   entity.  Care needs to be taken in determining which sections apply
   and fullly implementing the necessary code.

   Cryptographic algorithms have and will be broken or weakened.
   Implementers and users need to check that the cryptographic
   algorithms listed in this document make sense from a security level.
   The IETF from time to time may issue documents dealing with the
   current state of the art.  Two examples of such documents are
   [SMALL-SUB-GROUP] and [HASH-ATTACKS].
