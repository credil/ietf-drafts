Internet Draft       VCCV - Inband CC using offset      October 18, 2010


Abstract          

   Pseudowires need an inband control channel (CC) to do VCCV such that
   OAM and data packets follow the same path. However most PW
   deployments are without a Control Word (CW) and hence are unable to
   use the inband CC as defined in RFC5085. This document defines a
   simple extension to the TTL expiry CC (Type 3) to do inband VCCV.
   This can be used even without a CW.

Internet Draft       VCCV - Inband CC using offset      October 18, 2010


1.  Introduction

   OAM functions such as connectivity verification (CV) need an inband
   channel to do their operations. Only an inband control channel
   ensures that packets carrying OAM messages follow the same path as
   the data packets that they are doing OAM operations for. Most PW
   deployments today do not have CW enabled. However the control
   channels defined in [VCCV] provide an inband CC only when CW is
   enabled. Moreover enabling CW prevents from looking beyond the label
   stack to do multipath decisions. At an intermediate LSR, looking at
   an IP header beyond the label stack to do multipath is desirable
   since it is a commonly available capability in current
   implementations and also helps to do multipath load sharing based on
   a true end to end flow (e.g. [ID.PPW-EIM]), rather than rely on
   additional mechanisms such as [FAT-PW]. This document briefly
   describes the problem with the TTL Expiry CC (Type 3) in section 3. 
   A simple extension to this CC to solve this problem is described in
   section 4.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   A VCCV control channel (CC) that uses TTL expiry is not inband when
   the intermediate nodes along a LSP look beyond the label stack to do
   multipath forwarding decisions. However it is mandatory ([ID.VCCV-
   MF]) and is widely used especially in the commonly deployed scenario
   of PWs that do not use a CW (Control Word). A PW that uses CW is also
   unable to take advantage of the presences of multipath in the server
   layer. Multipath is considered useful for both redundancy as well as
   load sharing.

4.  Solution

   This document defines a new VCCV CC. It is an extension of the TTL
   Expiry VCCV (Type 3) defined in [VCCV]. In this CC the associated
   channel starts at a fixed offset after the PW label. This CC is
   henceforth referred to as Inband-offset VCCV (Type TBA). A fixed
   number of bytes between the PW label and the start of the associated
   channel can be used to emulate flow header information and are
   henceforth referred to as a "pseudo flow header". A VCCV message with
   a pseudo flow header will follow the same path as that taken by a
   data packet of the flow, as long as any multipath forwarding decision
   taken by the intermediate LSRs do not look beyond the pseudo flow

   header. A pseudo flow header length of 64 bytes is expected to meet
   the requirements of all current implementations and also meet the
   requirements of deployments (both current and in the foreseeable
   future). If a size other than 64 is needed then it can be configured
   or signaled as an attribute of the PW. The content of the pseudo flow
   header is set according to the flow that needs an OAM function such
   as connectivity verification (CV). E.g. if the encapsulation consists
   of an IP packet following the PW label, then the pseudo flow header
   would be the IP header of a flow.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond those already listed in [VCCV].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to allocate a value for Inband-offset VCCV in the registry
   "MPLS VCCV Control Channel Type". Recommend next available bitfield
   0x8.

7.  Future work

      1. Define signaling extensions to convey the size of the offset.
      2. Authenticate VCCV messages.
