Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is network based mobility management protocol which
   allows IP session continuity for a mobile node without its
   involvement in mobility management.  A mobile access gateway (MAG) is
   authorized to send Mobile IPv6 signaling messages on behalf of mobile
   nodes.  The MAG requires a local mobility anchor address(LMAA),
   mobile node's identifier (MN-Identifier),and IPsec security
   association (SA) with it's LMA before it sends signaling messages.
   Interworking with existing authentication, authorization and
   accounting (AAA) infrastructure, MAG acquires the LMAA (directly or
   indirectly) and MN-Identifier.  LMA also uses AAA infrastructure to
   authenticate MAG and build SA between MAG when EAP is used with
   IKEv2.  This document defines new RADIUS attributes and reasonably
   reuses existing attributes to serve the purpose.  This information
   exchange takes place as part of the initial network access
   authentication procedure.  Address configuration modes and others can
   also be obtained from AAA infrastructure to emulate MN's home link on
   access links.

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIP6                     July 2007


1.  Introduction

   It is possible to support mobility for IPv6 nodes by extending Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC3775] signaling and reusing the home agent via a proxy
   mobility agent in the network.  [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6] describes
   the approach to supporting mobility without requiring the mobile node
   to be involved in mobility management signaling.  The proxy mobility
   agent in the network performs the signaling and does the mobility
   management on behalf of the mobile node.  From AAA perspective, the
   operation of Proxy Mobile IPv6 includes the following parts:

   Access Authentication.  When MN attaches to an access link connected
      to the MAG, the MN presents its identity, MN-Identifier, as part
      of the access authentication procedure.  Upon a successful access
      authentication, MAG acting as an RADIUS client obtains the MN's
      profile from AAA servers through RADIUS protocol.  The profile
      probably contains the following information: LMAA, FQDN of LMA,
      address configuration mode, MN-HoA, Home link Prefix and it's
      length , IPv4 LMAA when transport network is IPv4, IPv4 MN-HoA
      when MN is IPv4 enabled, and so on.

   Security Association Establishment.  After a successful access
      authentication and authorization, the MAG MUST send a Proxy
      Binding Update(PBU) message to the MN's LMA.  The signaling
      messages, Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
      are protected using IPsec.  In PMIP6 scenario, a pair of security
      associations between LMA and MAG are shared by multiple MNs.
      Before sending Proxy Binding Update message, MAG checks if there
      is a SA ready between the MAG and the LMA.  MAG initiates SA
      establishment procedure if there is no existing SA.  IKEv2 is used
      to setup security associations between the MAG and the LMA.  The
      MAG and the LMA can use any of the authentication mechanisms
      (shared secret/certificate/EAP), as described in [RFC4877], for
      mutual authentication.  When EAP is used, the three parties of the
      authentication are MAG as a supplicant, LMA as an authenticator,
      and RADIUS server as an authentication server.  If the
      authentication succeeds, the RADIUS server sends a RADIUS Access-
      Accept packet containing the EAP-Success and the AAA-Key derived
      from the EAP authentication method.  The AAA-Key is used for
      further SA establishment between MAG and LMA.

   MN home address configuration  .  An important function of PMIPv6 is
      emulation of the mobile node's home link on the access link.  Home
      address configuration is an important characteristics of links.
      The MN can be operating in an IPv4-only mode, IPv6-only mode or in
      dual IPv4/IPv6 mode.  MN can obtain IPv6 address through DHCPv6.
      In this case, MAG can relay DHCP message between MN and DHCP
      server, or act as a DHCP proxy.  In the latter, MAG can obtain IP

      address from AAA server, or from LMA through PBU/PBA exchange.  MN
      can also use the prefix in RA advertised by MAG to statelessly
      configure an IPv6 address.  The prefix can be obtained from AAA
      server or LMA.  Once MN-HoA address configuration is finished, MAG
      sends Access-Request for triggering a MN's DNS update by the
      RADIUS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6], in addition to the ones specified in
   this section.

   Simple IP Service.  Access to the Internet without any mobility
      protocol.



3.  Solution Overview

3.1.  MIP6 Bootstrapping Overview

   [RFC4640] is problem statement for bootstrapping Mobile IPv6.  In
   MIP6 scenario, a MN needs at least the following information: a home
   address, a home agent address, and a security association with home
   agent to register.  The process of obtaining this information is
   called bootstrapping.  [RFC4640] discusses issues involved with how
   MN can be bootstrapped and various potential deployment scenarios for
   MN's bootstrapping.

   Two deployments scenarios are defined in [RFC4640]: split scenario
   and integrated one.  The essential difference between the two
   scenarios is that in split scenario, the mobility service and the
   network access service are authorized by different entities while in
   integrated scenario, the two services are authorized by the same
   entities.  [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-split] details bootstrapping
   solution in split scenario, while
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-bootstrapping-integrated-dhc] describes the solution
   for integrated one.  Furthermore, [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] defines new
   DHCP options used for dynamic home information discovery in
   integrated scenario.

   To facilitate the solutions, the AAA functionality for the integrated

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIP6                     July 2007


   and the split scenario needs to be defined.  [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius]
   defines new RADIUS attributes to facilitate Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping
   in both integrated and split scenarios.
   [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-integrated] describes Diameter interface between
   a network access server and home AAA server in integrated scenario.
   [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-split] specifies Diameter interface between a
   home agent and an AAA server in split scenario.

3.2.  PMIP6 Bootstrapping Procedure

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 offloads mobility management to networks.  As a
   proxy, MAG at least needs the following information: a home agent
   address, a home address or MN-Identifier, a security association with
   LMA to register the MN with LMA.  The process of obtaining this
   information will be called PMIPv6 bootstrapping in this document.

   Both split and integrated scenarios in Section 3.1 are applicable to
   Proxy Mobile IPv6.  However, the integrated scenario seems more
   suitable to PMIPv6 because the access authentication is a part of the
   bootstrapping.  Because of this, we will not present all the details
   of PMIPv6 bootstrapping but instead we will only highlight special
   considerations that apply.

3.2.1.  Security Association Setup

   IKEv2 is used to setup security associations between the MAG and the
   LMA to protect the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgment messages.  These security associations can be shared
   by multiple MNs.  The MAG and LMA can use any of the authentication
   mechanisms (shared secret/certificate/EAP) described in [RFC4877] for
   mutual authentication.  When EAP is used, LMA acting as an
   authenticator gets AAA-key from RADIUS server through RADIUS Access-
   Accept message.  The AAA-Key is used for further SA establishment
   between MAG and LMA.

3.2.2.  Service Negotiation

   Based on the quality of the networks, accounting policy, application
   distribution and so on, the user can choose one of the following
   services: Simple IP access, PMIPv6 with or without IPv4 support,
   Hybrid access (such as, for dual stack, IPv4 is used for local access
   while IPv6 is supported as PMIPv6), and so on.  There are two
   alternatives for service choice: static configuration and dynamic
   negotiation.  In the former, MN's services are statically configured
   in it's profile stored in AAA server.  In the latter, MN dynamically
   negotiates services with AAA server, as elaborated in
   [I-D.xia-netlmm-service-negotiation].  Based on the result of service
   negotiation or a static profile, the AAA server configures the

   service through RADIUS Framed-Protocol attribute described in
   Section 4.2.6.  Different service needs different forwarding and
   accounting policy.  The MAG is the policy enforcement point (PEP).

3.2.3.  Dynamic LMA

   [I-D.ietf-mip6-hiopt] defines a DHCP-based scheme to enable dynamic
   discovery of Mobile IPv6 home agent address, home agent FQDN and home
   subnet.  Similarly, MAG can act as DHCP client to dynamically request
   LMAA, or LMA FQDN.

                     Figure 1: Dynamic LMA Using DHCP

   As illustrated in Figure 1, LMAA or LMA's FQDN can be included in
   RADIUS Access-Accept message.  LMAA MUST be used if it is present.
   LMA's FQDN can be used to retrieve LMAA from either DHCP server or
   DNS server if LMAA is not present in RADIUS Access-Accept message.
   If there isn't any LMA's information in Access-Accept, MAG can
   dynamically find a LMA from it's local DHCP server.

3.2.4.  DNS Update

   In order that the MN is reachable through its dynamically assigned
   Home Address, the DNS needs to be updated with the new Home Address.
   Since the DNS update must be performed securely in order to prevent
   attacks or modifications from malicious nodes, the node performing
   this update must share a security association with the DNS server.
   In this case the MAG may not share a security association with the
   DNS server and the DNS entry update can be performed by the AAA
   server.  In order to accomplish this, the MAG sends to the AAA server
   the FQDN-HoA pair using the RADIUS protocol

                     Figure 2: DNS Update through AAA

   Figure 2 illustrates a typical MN-HoA DNS Update procedure
   1.  After successful access authentication and authorization, the MAG
       MUST send a Proxy Binding Update message to the LMA.  The Proxy
       Binding Update message MUST have the Home Network Prefix option.
       MAG can learn the prefix from AAA server or from other means, and
       include the prefix in the Home Network Prefix option for
       requesting it from the local mobility anchor.  If the specified
       value is 0::/0, then the LMA will allocate a prefix to the mobile
       node.
   2.  Successful PBA includes confirmed prefix which is advertised in
       Router Advertisement message by MAG to MN for stateless address
       auto-configuration.

Internet-Draft                RADIUS-PMIP6                     July 2007


   3.  Once address configuration finishes, the MAG sends Access-Request
       with MIP6-DNS-MO Attribute defined in [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].
   4.  The AAA server performs the DNS update based on [RFC2136].
   5.  MIP6-DNS-MO attribute SHOULD be included in Access-Accept to
       confirm DNS update.

3.2.5.  Home Link Emulation

   In PMIP6, MAG is also responsible for emulating the MN's home link on
   the access link.  The characteristics of links are prefix, address
   configuration mode, MTU, link layer address of the default address
   and so on.  To keep the consistency of link characteristics, MN's
   prefix is allocated from LMA or AAA server.  MN's address
   configuration mode SHOULD be conveyed in Access-Accept in PMIP6-HL-
   Feature attribute defined in Section 4.1 .  The other parameters have
   limited impact on MN's behavior, so we offer no further discussion.


4.  RADIUS Attributes

   We define a new attribute and then describe the existing attributes
   in [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius] that are reused in PMIPv6.

4.1.  PMIPv6 MN-HoA configuration mode

   The new defined attribute is included in Access-Accept message for
   MAG to emulate MN's home link.

      Type:

         to be defined by IANA.

      Length:

         The length of the attribute.

      M bit:
         1-bit "Managed address configuration" flag.  When set, MN uses
         stateful protocol (that is, DHCP) for address auto-configuration,
         and DHCP server's address is included in the attribute. When M
         bit is not set, MN uses stateless address configuration.

      Reserved:

         Reserved for future use.

      DHCP server address:

         When M bit is set, the field holds DHCP server's address.


4.2.   Use of existing RADIUS Attributes

   [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius] defines the following new RADIUS attributes
   for MIPv6 bootstrapping.  In this document, these attributes are
   properly reused in PMIPv6 scenario.

4.2.1.  MIP6-HA Attribute

   The RADIUS server may dynamically assign a LMA to the MN based on LMA
   location and current load.

4.2.2.  MIP6-HA-FQDN Attribute

   The RADIUS server may assign an FQDN of the LMA to the MN.  MAG can
   perform DNS query or DHCP request with the FQDN to derive the LMA
   address.

4.2.3.  MIP6-HL-Prefix Attribute

   The RADIUS server may assign a Home Link that is in close proximity
   to the MAG.  The MN can use the prefix to formulate MN-HoA.

4.2.4.  MIP6-DNS-MO Attribute

   By using this payload the MAG as a RADIUS client instructs the RADIUS
   server to perform a dynamic DNS update.

   The following attributes defined in [RFC2865] are extended.

4.2.5.  Service-Type

   Service-Type (6) SHALL set its value to "Framed" (2).

4.2.6.  Framed-Protocol

   It MAY be used in both Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.  The
   values of the attribute are extended as following: IPv4 (7), IPv6
   (8), IPv6/IPv4 dual stack (9), PMIPv6 IPv4 support (10), PMIPv6 IPv6
   support (11).

4.2.7.  Use of MS-MPPE-Recv-Key and MS-MPPE-Send-Key

   To transport the MSK from the RADIUS server to LMA, RADIUS SHALL
   utilize the MS-MPPE-Recv-Key and the MS-MPPE-Send-Key as defined in
   [RFC2548] .


5.  Diameter Considerations

   When used in Diameter, the attributes defined in this specification
   can be used as Diameter AVPs from the Code space 1-255 (RADIUS
   attribute compatibility space).  No additional Diameter Code values
   need be therefore allocated.


6.  Security Considerations

   The MAG and the LMA to the RADIUS server transactions must be
   adequately secured.  Otherwise there is a possibility that fraudulent

   values are received from a rogue RADIUS server.  The new attributes
   defined in this document do not introduce additional security
   considerations.


7.  IANA consideration

   The type of attribute PMIPv6 MN-HoA configuration mode MUST be
   assigned by IANA.  The value of the attribute Framed-Protocol MUST
   also be assigned by IANA.
