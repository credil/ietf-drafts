Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291] allows multiple unicast
   addresses to be assigned to interfaces.  Because of this IPv6
   implementations need to handle multiple possible source and
   destination addresses when initiating communication RFC 3484
   [RFC3484]. specifies the default algorithms, common across all
   implementations, for selecting source and destination addresses so
   that it is easier to predict the address selection behavior.

   After RFC 3484 was specified, some issues have been identified with
   the algorithm specified there.  The issues are related to the longest
   match algorithm used in Rule 9 of Destination address selection
   breaking DNS round-robin techniques, and prioritization of poor IPv6
   connectivity using transition mechanisms over native IPv4
   connectivity.

   There have also been some significant changes to the IPv6 addressing
   architecture that require changes in the RFC 3484 policy table.  Such
   changes include the deprecation of site-local unicast addresses
   [RFC3879] and the IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses, the introduction of
   Unique Local Addresses [RFC4193] etc.

   This document specifies a set of updates that modify the algorithms
   and fix the known defects.


2.  Specification

2.1.  Changes related to the default policy table

   The default policy table is defined in RFC 3484 Section 2.1 as
   follows:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               50     0
         ::/0                  40     1
         2002::/16             30     2
         ::/96                 20     3
         ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4

   The changes that should be included into the default policy table are
   those rules that are universally useful and do no harm in every
   reasonable network envionment.  The changes we should consider for
   the default policy table are listed in this sub-section.

   The policy table is defined to be configurable.  The changes that are
   useful not universally but locally can be put into the policy table

   manually or by using the auto-configuration mechanism proposed as a
   DHCP option [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-opt].

2.1.1.  ULA in the policy table

   RFC 5220 [RFC5220] Section 2.1.4, 2.2.2, and 2.2.3 describes address
   selection problems related to ULA [RFC4193].  These problems can be
   solved by either changing the scope of ULA to site-local, or by
   adding an entry for default policy table entry that has its own label
   for ULA.

   Centrally assigned ULA [I-D.ietf-ipv6-ula-central] is proposed, and
   is assigned fc00::/8.  Using the different labels for fc00::/8 and
   fd00::/8 makes sense if we assume the same kind of address block is
   assigned in the same or adjacent network.  However, we cannot expect
   that the type of ULA address block and network adjancency commonly
   have any relationships.

   Regarding the scope of ULA, ULA has been specified with a global
   scope because the reachability of the ULA was intended to be
   restricted by the routing system.  Since the ULAs will not be exposed
   outside of its reachability domain, if an ULA is available as a
   candidate destination address, it can be expected to be reachable.

   if we change the scope of ULA smaller than global, we can prioritize
   ULA to ULA communication over GUA to GUA communication.  At the same
   time, however, finer-grained configuration of ULA address selection
   will be impossible.  For example, even if you want to priorize
   communication related to the only /48 ULA prefix used in your site,
   and do not want to prioritize communication to any other ULA prefix,
   such a policy cannot be implemented in the policy table.  So, this
   draft proposes the use of the policy table to differentiate ULA from
   GUA.

2.1.2.  Teredo in the policy table

   Teredo [RFC4380] is defined and has been assigned 2001::/32.  This
   address block should be assigned its own label in the policy table.
   Teredo's priority should be less or equal to 6to4, considering its
   characteristic of transitional tunnel mechanism.  About Windows, this
   is already in the implementation.

2.1.3.  6to4, Teredo, and IPv4 prioritization

   Regarding the prioritization between IPv4 and these transitional
   mechanisms, the connectivity of them are known to be worse than IPv4.
   These mechiansms are said to be the last resort access to IPv6
   resources.  While 6to4 should have higher precedence over Teredo, in



Matsumoto, et al.       Expires December 12, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     June 2011


   that 6to4 host to 6to4 host communication can be over IPv4, which can
   result in more optimal path, and 6to4 does not need NAT traversal.

2.1.4.  Deprecated addresses in the policy table

   IPv4-compatible IPv6 address (::/96) is deprecated [RFC4291].  IPv6
   site-local unicast address (fec0::/10) is deprecated [RFC3879]. 6bone
   testing address [RFC3701] was returned.

   These addresses were removed from the current specification.  So, it
   should not be treated differently, especially if we plan future re-
   use of these address blocks.  Hense, 6bone testing address block
   should not be treated specially.

   Considering the inappropriate use of these address blocks especially
   in outdated implementations and bad effects brought by them, it
   should be labeled differently from the legitimate address blocks as
   far as the address block is reserved by IANA.

2.1.5.  Renewed default policy table

   After applying these updates, the default policy table will be:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               60     0
         fc00::/7              50     1
         ::/0                  40     2
         ::ffff:0:0/96         30     3
         2002::/16             20     4
         2001::/32             10     5
         ::/96                  1    10
         fec0::/10              1    11

2.2.  The longest matching rule

   This issue is related to the longest matching rule, which was found
   by Dave Thaler.  It is malfunction of DNS round robin technique.  It
   is common for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   When a destination address DA, DB, and the source address of DA
   Source(DA) are on the same subnet and Source(DA) == Source(DB), DNS
   round robin load-balancing cannot function.  By considering prefix
   lengths that are longer than the subnet prefix, this rule establishes
   preference between addresses that have no substantive differences
   between them.  The rule functions as an arbitrary tie-breaker between
   the hosts in a round robin, causing a given host to always prefer a
   given member of the round robin.

Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     June 2011


   By limiting the calculation of common prefixes to a maximum length
   equal to the length of the subnet prefix of the source address, rule
   9 can continue to favor hosts that are nearby in the network
   hierarchy without arbitrarily sorting addresses within a given
   network.  This modification could be written as follows:

   Rule 9: Use longest matching prefix.

   When DA and DB belong to the same address family (both are IPv6 or
   both are IPv4): If CommonPrefixLen(DA & Netmask(Source(DA)),
   Source(DA)) > CommonPrefixLen(DB & Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)),
   then prefer DA.  Similarly, if CommonPrefixLen(DA &
   Netmask(Source(DA)), Source(DA)) < CommonPrefixLen(DB &
   Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)), then prefer DB.

2.3.  Utilize next-hop for source address selection

   The RFC 3484 source address selection rule 5 defines the address that
   is attached to the outgoing interface should be preferred as the
   source address.  This rule is reasonable considering the prevalence
   of Ingress Filtering described in BCP 38 [RFC2827].  This is because
   an upstream network provider usually assumes it receives those
   packets from their customer that have the delegated addresses as the
   source addresses.

   This rule, however, is not effective in such a environment described
   in RFC 5220 Section 2.1.1, where a host has multiple upstream routers
   on the same link and has addresses delegated from each upstream
   routers on single interface.

   So, a new rule 5.1 that utilizes next-hop information for source
   address selection is inserted just after the rule 5.

   Rule 5.1: Use an address assigned by the selected next-hop.

   If SA is assigned by the selected next-hop that will be used to send
   to D and SB is assigned by a different next-hop, then prefer SA.
   Similarly, if SB is assigned by the next-hop that will be used to
   send to D and SA is assigned by a different next-hop, then prefer SB.

2.4.  Private IPv4 address scope

   When a packet goes through a NAT, its source or destination address
   can get replaced with another address with a different scope.  It
   follows that the result of the source address selection algorithm may
   be different when the original address is replaced with the NATed
   address.

Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     June 2011


   The algorithm currently specified in RFC 3484 is based on the
   assumption that a source address with a small scope cannot reach a
   destination address with a larger scope.  This assumption does not
   hold if private IPv4 addresses and a NAT are used to reach public
   IPv4 addresses.

   Due to this assumption, in the presence of both NATed private IPv4
   address and transitional addresses (like 6to4 and Teredo), the host
   will choose the transitional IPv6 address to access dual-stack peers
   [I-D.denis-v6ops-nat-addrsel].  Choosing transitional IPv6
   connectivity over native IPv4 connectivity is not considered to be a
   very wise result.

   This issue can be fixed by changing the address scope of private IPv4
   addresses to global.  Such change has already been implemented in
   some OSes.

2.5.  Deprecation of site-local unicast address

   RFC 3484 contains a few "site-local unicast" and "fec0::"
   description.  It's better to remove examples related to site-local
   unicast address, or change examples to use ULA.  Possible points to
   be re-written are below.

      - 2nd paragraph in RFC 3484 Section 3.1 describes scope comparison
      mechanism.
      - RFC 3484 Section 10 contains examples for site-local address.


3.  Security Considerations

   No security risk is found that degrades RFC 3484.


4.  IANA Considerations

   Address type number for the policy table may have to be assigned by
   IANA.

Appendix B.  Past Discussion

   This section summarizes discussions we had before related to address
   selection mechanisms.

B.1.  The longest match rule

   RFC 3484 defines that the destination address selection rule 9 should
   be applied to both IPv4 and IPv6, which spoils the DNS based load
   balancing technique that is widely used in the IPv4 Internet today.

   When two or more destination addresses are acquired from one FQDN,
   the rule 9 defines that the longest matching destination and source
   address pair should be chosen.  As in RFC 1794, the DNS based load
   balancing technique is achived by not re-ordering the destination
   addresses returned from the DNS server.  The Rule 9 defines
   deterministic rule for re-ordering at hosts, hence the technique of
   RFC 1794 is not available anymore.

   Regarding this problem, there was discussion in IETF and other places
   like below.

   Discussion: The possible changes to RFC 3484 are as follows:

   1.  To delete Rule 9 completely.
   2.  To apply Rule 9 only for IPv6 and not for IPv4.  In IPv6,
       hiearchical address assignment is general principle, hence the
       longest matchin rule is beneficial in many cases.  In IPv4, as
       stated above, the DNS based load balancing technique is widely
       used.

Internet-Draft                 RFC3484 Bis                     June 2011


   3.  To apply Rule 9 for IPv6 conditionally and not for IPv4.  When
       the length of matching bits of the destination address and the
       source address is longer than N, the rule 9 is applied.
       Otherwise, the order of the destination addresses do not change.
       The N should be configurable and it should be 32 by default.
       This is simply because the two sites whose matching bit length is
       longer than 32 are probably adjacent.

   Now that IPv6 PI address is admitted in some RIRs, hierachical
   address assignment is not maintained anymore.  It seems that the
   longest matching algorithm may not worth the adverse effect of
   disalbing the DNS based load balance technique.

   After long discussion, however we could not reach any consensus here.
   That means, we cannot change the current rules for this issue.

B.2.  NAT64 prefix issue

   NAT64 WKP was newly defined[RFC6052].  It depends site by site
   whether NAT64 should be preferred over IPv4, in other words NAT44, or
   NAT44 over NAT64.  So, this issue of site local policy should be
   solved by policy distribution mechanism.
