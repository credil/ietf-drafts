                         draft-liao-p2psip-dcmp-00


Abstract

   This document defines a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference media
   processing. It describes a new distributed conference architecture
   which utilizing clients ability to handling media data. Different
   clients' ability information is stored in the RELOAD overlay with a
   new Kind data structure. An optimal media transmission path can be
   calculated with this information.

1. Introduction

   In traditional video conferencing systems architecture, performance
   and capacity of single server is limited. It can only support a
   certain number of online users simultaneously, and the system
   stability and performance cannot be effectively guaranteed. Large-
   scale conference systems require multiple servers to work together.
   Each server provides services for different user groups, and there is
   audio and video transmission between the different user groups. So
   the server will have a large number of audio and video data
   transmissions, this point would be the bottleneck to improve the
   quality of the audio and video easily.

   As the network environment improves, more and more people use video
   conferencing to discuss, exchange and chat. Particular, conference
   between family members become more popular. The current mode of the
   video conference would have the following characteristics:

   o In a single meeting, the number of participants is relatively
   small, usually about 10 people;

   o There are a lot of conferences throughout the video conference
   system.

   Considering the above scenario, the scheme of traditional video
   conferencing (Server is responsible for all media processing)
   requires a very high cost.

   Therefore, we introduced the Distributed Conference Media Processing.
   On the basis of traditional software video conferencing, our project
   makes full use of the user node to assume the task of audio and
   video processing and transmission to reduce the server bandwidth and
   hardware resources. At the same time, conference information is
   stored on the distributed servers group in Reload overlay.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   base], the peer-to-peer SIP concepts draft[I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts].

   MCS: Media Control Server is responsible for media processing and
   improvement of transmission efficiency according to the information
   stored in the overlay which is consist of MCS as the basic element.

   UE: User Equipment can execute the conference operation as a client.

   CCS: Conference Control Server assigns MCS to the new client joining
   in the conference.

   CDB: Conference Database stores and maintains UE, MCS and conference
   information.

3. System overview

3.1. Architecture

   This section defines the overall architecture and the main functions
   of each entity. Figure 1 depicts the network architecture based on
   Reload overlay which consists of a set of cooperating peers. The main
   functions of the core network are provided by the overlay in which
   the peers can efficiently route messages to other peers and
   efficiently store and retrieve conference information.

   CCS and CDB is the system manager. CCS is responsible for user login,
   and PMS is a centralized user database.

   MCS is a media processing server. Each MCS is a peer in the Reload
   overlay, and conference information is the resources. Each UE is a
   client in the reload overlay.

   In addition, UE in different network may be assigned to different MCS
   to access. Users may be in different places. In the corresponding our
   servers will be deployed in different networks too, So that it will
   choose a proximal MCS for the user to be responsible for conference
   access.

3.2. Entities

   The following content includes a description of each major functional
   entity in distributed video conference system, and a brief
   introduction of each entity's behaviors and interactions with other
   entities.

3.2.1. CCS (Conference Control Server)

   According to the scale of UE, there may be many CCS in system. The
   main functions may include:

   o Responsibility for authorization and maintaining online
      information of UE;

   o Management of participating in a conference.

3.2.2. CDB (Conference Database)

   There is only one CDB in system. The main functions may include:

   o Store and maintain conference, MCS, UE information;

   o Accept request from CCS and return the relative data to MCS;

3.2.3. MCS (Media Control Server)

   According to the scale of user, there may be many MCS in system. The
   main functions may include:

   o Receive audio and video data from user, and transmit it to other
      UE who send a request.

   o Based on requirement, mix the audio and video streaming or convert
      BitRate;

   o Maintain and manage capability and state information of different
      UE in a conference, and execute distributed algorithm;

   o Every MCS have only one identity and adopt Reload protocol to look
      up each other.

3.2.4. UE (User Equipment)

   UE include computer, mobile telephone, IPTV Set-Top Box, MID, etc.
   The main functions may include:

   o Send initialize, join, exit and other operation about a conference
      to server;

5. Media Process Mechanism

   This section describes the audio and video stream handling mechanism
   in the distributed conference. Process of audio stream is separated
   from the video stream and gained a higher priority than video stream.
   Therefore, when the video stream handling has a problem, the audio

5.2. Video Stream Process

   Video stream processing is different from the audio stream processing
   primarily in two aspects. First, the video stream handling requires
   much more resources than the audio transmission, such as CPU and
   bandwidth. Second, the client can choose to see any others' video
   freely, which is more complex than audio stream process. This section
   will introduce the procedures of video stream processing.

   need to be studied.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify IANA considerations.

9. Conclusions

   This document describes a method to utilize client ability in
   distributed conference application, which reduce servers load.

   Through storing client information in RELOAD overlay, it's easy to
   find an optimal transmission path. However, the transmission model
   and method still need to be further studied.
