  <abstract>
    <t>This document reserves IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses for use
      in documentation, RFCs etc. Some multicast addresses are derived from
      AS numbers or unicast addresses. This document also explains how
      these can be used for documentation purposes by deriving them from
      AS numbers and unicast addresses that are reserved for such
      purposes.</t>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>It is often useful in documentation to give examples
containing IP multicast addresses. To prevent conflicts or confusion, 
one should avoid using multicast addresses that may
be in actual use. For unicast there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
reserved for this purpose,
see <xref target="RFC5737"/> and <xref target="RFC3849"/>
respectively. There are however no multicast addresses available
for such purposes. This document reserves such addresses.
</t>
<t>There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
numbers or unicast addresses. For examples where such addresses are
desired, one should derive them from the AS numbers and unicast
addresses reserved for documentation purposes. This document also
discusses the use of these.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Documentation IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses">
<t>
For documentation where examples of general purpose multicast addresses
are needed, one should use multicast addresses that never will be
assigned or in actual use. There is a risk that addresses used in
examples may accidentally be used. It is then important that the
same addresses are not used by other multicast applications or
services. It may also be beneficial to filter out such addresses
from multicast signalling and multicast data sent to such addresses.
</t>
<t>
The IPv4 multicast address allocated for documentation purposes is TBD.
The IPv6 multicast address allocated for documentation purposes is TBD.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="GLOP multicast addresses">
    <t>GLOP <xref target="RFC3180"/> is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast group addresses from
     16 bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP addresses are desired, the addresses should be
     derived from the AS numbers reserved for documentation use. See
     <xref target="RFC5398"/>.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Unicast prefix based multicast addresses">
  <t>IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes.
The two ways currently defined are unicast-prefix based addresses
<xref target="RFC3306"/> and Embedded-RP addresses <xref target="RFC3956"/>.
There is also a proposal for doing this with IPv4
<xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-ipv4-uni-based-mcast"/>.
For examples where these types of addresses are desired, the addresses should
be derived from the unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes. For
IPv4, see <xref target="RFC5737"/>. For IPv6, see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
</t> 
  </section>
  <section title="Other multicast addresses">
  <t>For both IPv4 and IPv6, multicast address ranges have been defined for
link-local, SSM, admin scoped etc. It may be considered to reserve a
multicast address from these ranges for the purpose of documentation.
For IPv6 this can be done by assigning a Group ID,
see <xref target="RFC3307"/>. The question here is how common it is
that examples require a multicast address of a particular non-global
scope.
</t> 
  </section>
  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes has no
impact on security.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>IANA is requested to assign both an IPv4 multicast address and an
IPv6 multicast address for documentation purposes.</t>
