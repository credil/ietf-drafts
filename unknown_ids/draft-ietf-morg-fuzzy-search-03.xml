      to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.</t>
      
	  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document

    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
		<t>When humans perform searches in IMAP clients, they typically want to
		see the most relevant search results first. IMAP servers are able to
		do this in the most efficient way when they're free to internally
		decide how searches should match messages. This document describes a
		new SEARCH=FUZZY extension that provides such functionality.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The FUZZY Search Key">
		
		<t>FUZZY search key takes another search key as its argument. Server
		is allowed to perform all matching in an implementation-defined manner
		for this search key, including ignoring the active comparator as
		defined by <xref target="RFC5255"/>. Typically this would be used to
		search for strings, for example:</t>

		<t>
		C: A1 SEARCH FUZZY (SUBJECT "IMAP break")<vspace/>
		S: * SEARCH 1 5 10<vspace/>
		S: A1 OK Search completed.
		</t>

		<t>Besides matching messages with subject "IMAP break", the above
		search may also match messages with subjects "broken IMAP", "IMAP is
		broken", or anything else the server decides that might be a good
		match.</t>
		
		<t>This example does a fuzzy SUBJECT search, but a non-fuzzy FROM
		search:</t>

		<t>
		C: A2 SEARCH FUZZY SUBJECT work FROM user@example.com<vspace/>
		S: * SEARCH 1 4<vspace/>
		S: A2 OK Search completed.
		</t>

		<t>It is implementation-defined how server handles multiple separate
		FUZZY search keys.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Relevancy Scores for Search Results">
		
		<t>Servers SHOULD assign a search relevancy score for each matched
		message when the FUZZY search key is given. Relevancy scores are
		given in range 1-100, where 100 is the highest relevancy. The relevancy
		scores SHOULD use the full 1-100 range, so that clients can show them
		to users in a meaningful way, such as a percentage value.</t>
		
		<t>As the name already tells, relevancy scores specify how relevant to
		the search the matched message is. It's not necessarily the same as
		how precisely the message matched. For example a message whose subject
		matches fuzzily the search string might get a higher relevancy score
		than a message whose body had the exact string in the middle of a
		sentence. When multiple search keys are matched fuzzily, it's
		server-dependent on how the relevancy score is calculated.</t>
		
		<t>If server also advertises the ESEARCH capability as defined by
		<xref target="ESEARCH"/>, the relevancy scores can be retrieved using
		the new RELEVANCY return option for SEARCH:</t>

		<t>
		C: B1 SEARCH RETURN (RELEVANCY ALL) FUZZY TEXT "Helo"<vspace/>
		S: * ESEARCH (TAG "B2") ALL 1,5,10 RELEVANCY (4 99 42)<vspace/>
		S: B1 OK Search completed.
		</t>

		<t>The RELEVANCY return option MUST NOT be used unless FUZZY search key
		is also given. Note that SEARCH results aren't sorted by relevancy,
		SORT is needed for that.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Fuzzy matching with non-string search keys">

		<t>Fuzzy matching is not limited to just string matching.  All search
		keys SHOULD be matched fuzzily, although what exactly that means for
		different search keys is left up to server implementations to decide
		-- including deciding that fuzzy matching is meaningless for a
		particular key, and falling back to exact matching.  Some suggestions
		are given below.</t>

		<t>Dates: A typical example could be when a user wants to find a
		message "from Dave about a week ago". A client could perform this
		search using SEARCH FUZZY (FROM "Dave" SINCE 21-Jan-2009 BEFORE
		24-Jan-2009). Server could return messages outside the specified
		date range, but the further away the message is, the lower the
		relevancy score.</t>

		<t>Sizes: These should be handled similar to dates. If a user wants
		to search for "about 1 MB attachments", the client could do this by
		sending SEARCH FUZZY (LARGER 900000 SMALLER 1100000). Again the further
		away the message size is from the specified range, the lower the
		relevancy score.</t>

		<t>Flags: Server could return messages that don't have the specified
		flags, but with a lower relevancy score.</t>

		<t>UIDs, sequences, modification sequences: These are examples of keys
		for which exact matching is probably what makes sense.  Alternatively,
		a server might choose, for instance, to expand a UID range by 5% on
		each side.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Extensions to SORT">

		<t>If server also advertises the SORT capability as defined by
		<xref target="SORT"/>, the results can be sorted by the new RELEVANCY
		sort criteria:</t>

		<t>
		C: C1 SORT (RELEVANCY) UTF-8 FUZZY SUBJECT "Helo"<vspace/>
		S: * SORT 5 10 1<vspace/>
		S: C1 OK Sort completed.
		</t>

		<t>The message with the highest score is returned first. As with
		RELEVANCY return option, RELEVANCY sort criteria MUST NOT be used
		unless FUZZY search key is also given.</t>

		<t>If server also advertises the ESORT capability as defined by
		<xref target="CONTEXT"/>, the relevancy scores can be retrieved using
		the new RELEVANCY return option for SORT:</t>

		<t>
		C: C2 SORT RETURN (RELEVANCY ALL) (RELEVANCY) UTF-8 FUZZY TEXT "Helo"<vspace/>
		S: * ESEARCH (TAG "C2") ALL 5,10,1 RELEVANCY (99 42 4)<vspace/>
		S: C2 OK Sort completed.
		</t>

		<t>To limit the number of returned messages, use the PARTIAL return
		option. For example this returns the 10 most relevant messages:</t>

		<t>
		C: C3 SORT RETURN (PARTIAL 1:10) (RELEVANCY) UTF-8 FUZZY TEXT "World"<vspace/>
		S: * ESEARCH (TAG "C3") PARTIAL (1:10 42,9,34,13,15,4,2,7,23,82)<vspace/>
		S: C3 OK Sort completed.
		</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

	<t>Implementation of this extension might enable a denial-of-service attack
	if the implementation isn't careful to prevent them. Fuzzy search
	engines are often complex with non-obvious disk space, memory and/or CPU
	usage patterns. Implementors should test at least the behavior of large
	messages that contain very long words and/or unique random strings. Also
	very long search keys might cause excessive memory or CPU usage.</t>
	
	<t>Invalid input may also be problematic. For example if the search engine
	takes UTF-8 stream as input, it might fail more or less badly when
	illegal UTF-8 sequences are fed to it from a message whose character set
	was claimed to be UTF-8. This could be avoided by validating all the
	input and, for example, replacing illegal UTF-8 sequences with the Unicode
	replacement character (U+FFFD).</t>
	
	<t>Search relevancy rankings might be susceptible to "poisoning" by smart
	attackers using certain keywords or hidden markup (e.g. HTML) in their
	messages to boost the rankings. This can't be fully prevented by
	servers, so clients should prepare for it by at least allowing user to
	see all the  search results, rather than hide results below a certain
	score.</t>
