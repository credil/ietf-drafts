    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines link relations for a number of common
      styles of resource addressing (for example, linking to the latest vs a
      specific version of a resource).</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification defines a number of link relations that may be
      used to indicate different types of links to resources. Each defined
      relation makes guarantees about the URL and/or the resource it refers
      to, such as the version which is to be retrieved or some characteristic
      of the URL itself.</t>

      <t>[[ Feedback is welcome on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list,
      although this is NOT a work item of the HTTPBIS WG. ]]</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The following term definitions clarify the concise link relation
      descriptions in <xref target="linkrelations"></xref>.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="canonical">Designates the preferred or standard way of
          writing the URL, or the "canonical form" (also known as "standard
          form" or "normal form"). While there can be an infinite number of
          references to identical or vastly similar resources (for example
          with different sort orders, highlighting or category information),
          specifying which one is "canonical" allows automated agents to avoid
          treating every such URL as unique. Search engines may use this to
          consolidate properties such as link popularity and display the
          preferred URL in search results, while other clients may identify,
          save and share the preferred version rather than the one they
          originally retrieved.</t>

          <t hangText="current">Identifies resource(s) which are occuring in
          or belonging to the present time, but may not necessarily be the
          single most recent or "latest" version specifically. For example an
          entry or page of a feed may identify the most recent entries in that
          feed using the "current" relation.</t>

          <t hangText="immutable">Refers to an immutable version of the link's
          context that is not subject or susceptible to change or variation.
          This may refer to a read-only resource, an archived copy of an
          otherwise dynamic resource, a specific version in a version control
          system, etc. This is in contrast to links which return the latest
          version of the resource at any given time.</t>

          <t hangText="latest">Refers to the single most recent version of the
          link's context, which may be updated at any time. As most URLs
          return the most recent version of the resource this relation is most
          useful with version control systems. For example, older versions of
          the resource may refer to the latest version.</t>

          <t hangText="mirror">Provides a rudimentary facility to specify one
          or more identical mirrors from which clients can obtain a resource.
          For example a large enclosure may be available for download from a
          number of different servers in different geographical locations in
          order to distribute server load, reduce network load and improve
          availability and performance. Link extensions for indicating
          geographical location, slots, bandwidth, preference, etc. may be
          defined in a future Internet-Draft.</t>

          <t hangText="permalink">Designates an immutable URL which is not
          subject or susceptible to change or variation even if the resource
          itself is updated. A portmanteau of "permanent" and "link", the
          relation allows clients to save and share a URL with the guarantee
          that it will resolve to that resource so long as it still exists.
          Typically the more information that is included in a link the more
          volatile it is likely to be. For example a link to a blog post that
          includes the title may change whenever the title is updated. Where
          "permalink" is specified such changes must not cause the designated
          URL to stop resolving or to resolve to another resource.</t>

          <t>Note: It is inappropriate to use the "bookmark" relation for this
          as it is "used to provide direct links to key entry points into an
          extended document" rather than as a reference to the resource
          itself.</t>

          <t hangText="shortlink">Designates one or more short link(s) which
          may be used in artificially (e.g. microblogging) or technically
          (e.g. short message service) constrained channels, or anywhere
          humans are required to transcribe a link (e.g. print, television and
          radio). This obviates the need to resort to third-party URL
          shortening services by allowing webmasters to centrally specify
          preferred short link(s) for use by all clients. For performance and
          security reasons the domain should match that of the canonical URL,
          unless a shorter domain is required/desired. Where more than one is
          specified the client may select one at random, offer the choice to
          the user, select the first, last or shortest one at random, or
          intelligently determine which is the most suitable for the purpose
          (for example, one with an alphabetical rather than numerical
          path).</t>

    <section anchor="linkrelations" title="Link Relations">
      <t>The following link relations are defined:</t>

          <t hangText="current">Identifies resource(s) which are occurring in
          or belonging to the present time.</t>

          <t hangText="">Note: Previously defined by RFC 5005 as "A URI that,
          when dereferenced, returns a feed document containing the most
          recent entries in the feed."</t>

          <t hangText="immutable">Identifies an immutable version of the
          link's context.</t>

          <t hangText="latest">Identifies the most recent version of the
          link's context.</t>

          <t hangText="mirror">Identifies one or more exact replicas of the
          link's context.</t>

          <t hangText="permalink">Designates an immutable "permanent link" for
          the link's context.</t>

          <t hangText="shortlink">Designates a "short link" for the link's
          context.</t>

    <section title="Examples">
      <t>The following example illustrates:<list style="symbols">
          <t>A typical online store URL with category and session information
          in the query string</t>

          <t>A canonical or "preferred version" of the URL which may be common
          to any number of pages</t>

          <t>A permalink which relies on a database identifier that is
          guaranteed never to change</t>

          <t>A shortlink which is useful for space-constrained
          applications</t>

        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Link: <http://example.com/product/swedish-fish?category=fish&sid=5678>;
      rel="self",

      <t>With the exception of canonical (which must only be specified once)
      there can be multiple links having the same relation:</t>

        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Link: <http://example.com/product/swedish-fish>; rel="canonical",
      <http://au.example.com/product/swedish-fish>; rel="mirror",

      <http://ie.example.com/product/swedish-fish>; rel="mirror"]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>It is also possible to combine relations where the same URL serves
      multiple roles:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Link: <http://example.com/product/swedish-fish>; rel="canonical permalink",

      </figure>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Automated agents should take care when these relation crosses
      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority than the
      current document). In particular, third-party URL shortening services
      may be unreliable.</t>

      <t>Depending on the application it may not be appropriate to rely on the
      "immutable" relation. For example, a malicious user may declare a
      resource immutable and then modify it anyway.</t>
