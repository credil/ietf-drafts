          Hybrid home network prefix for multihoming in PMIPv6
                    draft-hong-netext-hybrid-hnp-00

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming where a mobile node
   can connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces for
   simultaneous access.  However, for an inter-technology handoff,
   PMIPv6 does not allow simultaneous access since all the home network
   prefixes associated with one interface are associated with another
   interface of a mobile node.  In this document, we propose a hybrid
   home network prefix assignment (HHNPA) scheme where both the static
   prefix model and the dynamic prefix model are used for simultaneous
   access.  The static prefix model is used within the general PMIPv6
   domain.  On the other hand, the dynamic prefix model is employed for
   inter-technology handoff.  That is, for IP session continuity during
   inter-technology handoff, a dynamic prefix model is used on both
   interfaces.

Internet-Draft         Hybrid Home Network Prefix          February 2010


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775][1] and Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344][2] are host based
   IP mobility support protocols.  On the other hand, Proxy Mobile IPv6
   (PMIPv6) [RFC5213][3] is a network based IP mobility support
   protocol, which does not require any modifications to mobile
   nodes(MNs).  PMIPv6 makes it possible to support mobility for IPv6
   nodes without an involvement of a MN.  That is, on behalf of MNs, a
   mobile access gateway (MAG) in the network performs the signaling for
   mobility management with a local mobility anchor (LMA).

   PMIPv6 defines basic operations for registration, deregistration, and
   tunnel management.  However, it does not define protocol operations
   for supporting seamless handover for a MN with multiple network
   interfaces (i.e., inter-technology handoff) [5].  While PMIPv6 itself
   supports handover across different interfaces and access types, there
   are several issues for efficient inter-technology handoff, e.g., how
   to set interface identifier, how to use the same address on multiple
   interfaces, how to select an access technology, and how to detect a
   handover event [6].

   PMIPv6 basically support multihoming where a MN can connect to a
   PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces for simultaneous access and
   inter-technology handoff between different multiple interfaces.  If a
   MN with multiple interfaces connects to a PMIPv6 domain over multiple
   access networks, the LMA will allocate a unique set of home network
   prefixes (HNPs) for each of the connected interfaces.  However, when
   the MN performs an inter-technology handoff, the LMA will newly
   assign all the home network prefixes, which are associated with the
   first interface, to the second interface.  Consequently, the existing
   mobility sessions with the second interface will be disrupted.
   Fundamentally, this problem has been caused due to the fact that each
   of the attached interfaces must be assigned one or more unique
   prefixes in PMIPv6.  Therefore, to address this problem, we propose a
   hybrid home network prefix assignment (HHNPA) scheme where both the
   static prefix model and the dynamic prefix model are employed and
   dynamically selected.  That is, for IP session continuity, a dynamic
   home network prefix is used on both interfaces.


2.  Problem statement of multihoming support in PMIPv6

   To support multiple mobility sessions for a single MN with multiple
   interfaces, PMIPv6 creates mobility sessions per interface and each
   mobility session should be managed as a separate binding cache (BC)
   entry.  Note that although the LMA can allocate more than one home
   network prefix to an interface, all these prefixes are managed by one
   mobility session.  The LMA allows a handoff between two different

   interfaces of a MN.  In such a scenario, all the home network
   prefixes associated with one interface will be associated with
   another interface of the MN.  The decisions on when to create a new
   mobility session and when to update an existing mobility session are
   based on the handover hint included in the Proxy Binding Update
   message.

   Basic operations for multiple interfaces in PMIPv6 are as follows.
   First of all, the MAG decides whether to inform the LMA of the
   attachment of the second interface (or an inter-technology handoff),
   and then the MAG sends a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message.  When
   the LMA receives the PBU message, it verifies the request message.
   If the PBU message includes a handoff indicator flag of 1 (i.e.,
   initial attachment), the LMA allocates a new mobility session for
   second interface and thus the LMA has multiple Binding Cache entries.
   On the other hand, if the PBU message has a handoff indicator flag of
   2 (i.e., inter-technology handoff), all the home network prefixes
   associated with the first interface will be associated with the
   second interface.  Figures 1 and 2 describe the operations of two
   cases: initial attachment and inter-technology handoff.  In
   particular, as shown in Figure 2, for inter-technology handoff, HNP_2
   is overwritten with HNP_1 and then the existing mobility session 1 is
   removed from the binding cache entry at the LMA.

        Figure 2: Multihoming in PMIPv6 : Inter-technology handoff

   These multihoming operations in PMIPv6 have the following problems.

   Fist, since the LMA assigns the same home network prefix to the
   second interface after inter-technology handoff and updates the
   existing Binding Cache entry, the previous binding information of the
   second interface can be removed.  Therefore, the existing flows
   through the second interface may be disrupted [5].

   In addition, since there is no way to enable flow-specific handoffs,
   compelled handoff of unwanted IP flows can be performed due to inter-
   technology handoff.  The existing multihoming operations have
   drawbacks in terms of implementation.

   As mentioned before, the MAG should set the handoff indicator flag
   (e.g., 1 for initial attachment or 2 for inter-technology handoff).
   However, the MAG does not have sufficient information on multihoming
   support and thus it is not an easy task to distinguish initial
   attachment and interface handoff [6].

   Moreover, all home network prefixes are determined when the first
   mobility session is generated for a corresponding interface.
   Therefore, there is no way to add or delete a new home network prefix
   [7].  To address these issues, we propose a hybrid home network
   prefix assignment scheme in the next section.

3.  Hybrid home network prefix assignment

   In terms of home network prefix allocation in PMIPv6, the per-MN
   prefix model is mandatory whereas the shared prefix model is not
   supported.  In the per-MN prefix model, home network prefixes are
   assigned to a MN and these prefixes are exclusively used by the MN;
   no other MNs share the home network prefix.  Note that all assigned
   prefixes are unique and they are parts of one mobility session.  If
   the MN simultaneously attaches to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple
   interfaces, each of the attached interfaces must be assigned one or
   more unique prefixes.  Therefore, when performing an inter-technology
   handoff based on the per-MN prefix model, simultaneous access to the
   PMIPv6 domain is not allowed.  If it is able to separate prefixes
   into the purpose of inter-technology handoff and the purpose of
   simultaneous access, PMIPv6 may support both interface handoff and
   simultaneous access at the same time.  Based on this idea, we propose
   a hybrid home network prefix assignment (HHNPA) scheme to use both
   the static and dynamic home network prefix models.

   Figure 3 introduces the concept of the HHNPA scheme where the LMA
   divides home network prefixes into a static home network prefix and a
   dynamic home network prefix.  The static home network prefix (based
   on the per-MN prefix model) is used within the PMIPv6 domain.  On the
   other hand, the dynamic home network prefix is employed for inter-
   technology handoffs.

                      Figure 3: Prefix model in HHNPA

   In the dynamic prefix model, dynamic prefixes are assigned into only
   one interface and they are switchable between interfaces.  Dynamic
   prefixes are not used multiple interfaces simultaneously.  In
   contrast to dynamic prefixes, static prefixes cannot be switchable
   between interfaces.  As shown in Figure 4, HNP_1 is static prefix and

   it is used at only if_1.  HNP_3 is static prefix and it is used at
   only if_2.  HNP_2 is dynamic prefix and it can be used both if_1 and
   if_2.  In this figure, HNP_1 and HNP_3 are used for simultaneous
   access and HNP_2 is used for inter-technology handoff.

   Figure 5 describes the message flow in the HHNPA scheme.  At the
   starting time, a MN is attached the PMIPv6 domain through MAG_1 using
   interface 1.  After that, the MN is attached the PMIPv6 domain
   through MAG_2 using interface 2.  When second interface of the MN is
   attached to the LMA, the LMA acknowledges that the MN is a multiple
   interfaces node and prepares to allocate a dynamic prefix.  The LMA
   sends two PBA messages to MAG_1 and MAG_2.  The two PBA messages
   destined to MAG_1 and MAG_2 includes a home network prefix option
   (HNP_2: dynamic prefix).

   After the completion of attachment of the MN through two interfaces,
   the operations of interface handoff of the MN are as depicted in
   Figure 6 and Figure 7.  As shown in Figure 6, the dynamic prefix
   HNP_2 is assigned into interface 1.  If the MN wants inter-technology
   handoff, the MN gives some hint of inter-technology handoff to the
   MAG_2.  The MAG_2 which receives hint of inter-technology handoff
   sends a PBU message with a handoff indicator value of 2 to the LMA.
   The LMA which receives this PBU message updates the Binding Cache

   entry filed which is related to dynamic prefix HNP_2.  The updated
   fields of Binding Cache entry are interface and tunnel information.
   After the completion of updating of Binding Cache entry, the LMA
   sends data which is relation to HNP_2 to the MAG_2.

        Figure 6: Usage scenario of dynamic prefix in HHNPA scheme

   The HHNPA scheme has advantages of deciding a handoff indication
   flag.  After the LMA assigns static and dynamic home network prefixes
   to MAGs, if MAG_2 receives handoff hint, MAG_2 checks the existence
   of the MN_identifier.  If the MN_identifier related to the dynamic
   prefix HNP_2 is exist, the MAG_2 acknowledges that there is a
   mobility session of inter-technology handoff.  So, the MAG_2 can
   easily determine the value of handoff indication.  This operation is
   depicted in Figure 7.
