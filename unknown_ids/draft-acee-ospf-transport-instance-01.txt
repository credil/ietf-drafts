Abstract

   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 include a reliable flooding mechanism to
   disseminate routing topology and Traffic Engineering (TE) information
   within a routing domain.  Given the effectiveness of these
   mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using the same mechanism for
   dissemination of other types of information within the domain.
   However, burdening OSPF with this additional information will impact
   intra-domain routing convergence and possibly jeopardize the
   stability of the OSPF routing domain.  This document presents
   mechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate OSPF
   instance and minimize the impact.

Internet-Draft     OSPF Transport Instance Extensions     September 2008


1.  Introduction

   OSPFv2 [OSPFV2] and OSPFv3 [OSPFV3] include a reliable flooding
   mechanism to disseminate routing topology and Traffic Engineering
   (TE) information within a routing domain.  Given the effectiveness of
   these mechanisms, it is convenient to envision using the same
   mechanism for dissemination of other types of information within the
   domain.  However, burdening OSPF with this additional information
   will impact intra-domain routing convergence and possibly jeopardize
   the stability of the OSPF routing domain.  This document presents
   mechanism to relegate this ancillary information to a separate OSPF
   instance and minimize the impact.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  OSPF Transport Instance

   In order to isolate the overhead of flooding non-routing information,
   its flooding will be relegated to a separate protocol instance.  This
   instance should be given lower priority when contending for router
   resources including processing, backplane bandwidth, and line card
   bandwidth.  How that is realized is an implementation issue and is
   beyond the scope of this document.

2.1.  OSPFv2 Transport Instance Packets Differentiation

   OSPFv2 currently doesn't offer a mechanism to differentiate Transport
   instance packets from normal instance packets sent and received on
   the same interface.  However, the [MULTI-INST] provides the necessary
   packet encoding to support multiple OSPF protocol instances.

2.2.  OSPFv3 Transport Instance Packets Differentiation

   Fortunately, OSPFv3 already supports separate instances within the
   packet encodings.  The existing OSPFv3 packet header instance ID
   field will be used to differentiate packets received on the same link
   (refer to section 2.4 in [OSPFV3]).

2.3.  Instance Relationship to Normal OSPF Instances

   There are basically two alternatives for the relationship between a
   normal OSPF instance and a Transport Instance.  In both cases, we
   must guarantee that any information we've received is treated as
   valid if and only if the router sending it is reachable.  We'll refer
   to this as the "condition of reachability" in this document.

   1.  Ships in the Night - The Transport Instance has no relationship
       or dependency on any other OSPF instance.

   2.  Child Instance - The Transport Instance has a child-parent
       relationship with a normal OSPF instance and is dependent on this
       for topology information and assuring the "condition of
       reachability".

2.3.1.  Ships in the Night Relationship to Normal OSPF Instances

   In this mode, the Transport Instance is not dependent on any other
   OSPF instance.  It does, however, have much of the overhead as
   topology information must be advertised to satisfy the condition of
   reachability.

   Prefix information does this need to be advertised.  This implies
   that for OSPFv2, only router-LSAs, network-LSAs, and type 4 summary-

Internet-Draft     OSPF Transport Instance Extensions     September 2008


   LSAs need to be advertised.  In the router-LSAs, the stub (type 3)
   links may be suppressed.  For OSPFv3, this implies that router-LSAs,
   Network-LSAs, and inter-area-router-LSAs must be advertised.

2.3.2.  Tigher Coupling with Normal OSPF Instances

   Further optimization and coupling between the transport instance and
   a normal OSPF instance are beyond the scope of this document.  This
   is an area for future study.

2.4.  Network Prioritization

   While OSPFv2 (section 4.3 in [OSPFV2]) are normally sent with IP
   precedence Internetwork Control, any packets sent by a transport
   instance will be sent with IP precedence Flash (B'011').  This is
   only appropriate given that this is a pretty flashy mechanism.

   OSPFv3 packet prioritization is under discussion although it is not
   in the current specification ([OSPFV3]).  It is expected that this
   will be in the next revision of the OSPFv3 specification.

3.  OSPF Transport Instance Information Encoding

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an LSA containing non-
   routing information is the same as the format used by the Traffic
   Engineering Extensions to OSPF [TE].  The LSA payload consists of one
   or more nested Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplets.  The format of each
   TLV is:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                            Value...                           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                TLV Format

   However, each unique application using the mechanisms defined in this
   document will have it's own unique ID.  Whether to encode this ID as
   the top-level TLV or make it part of the OSPF LSA ID is open for
   debate.

   The specific TLVs and sub-TLVs relating to a given application and
   the corresponding IANA considerations MUST for standard applications
   MUST be specified in the document corresponding to that application.

3.1.  OSPFv2 Transport Instance Information Encoding

   Application specific information will be flooded in opaque LSAs as
   specified in [OPAQUE].

3.2.  OSPFv3 Transport Instance Information Encoding

   Application specific information will be flooded in separate LSAs
   with separate function codes.  Refer to section A.4.2.1 of [OSPFV3]
   for information on the LS Type encoding in OSPFv3.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Transport Instance will not be
   different for those for OSPFv2 [OSPFV2] and OSPFv3 [OSPFV3].
