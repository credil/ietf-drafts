1. Introduction 

   The purpose of the following information model for WSONs is to 
   facilitate constrained lightpath computation and as such is not a 
   general purpose network management information model. In particular 
   this model has particular value in the cases where there are no or a 
   limited number of wavelength converters available in the WSON. This 
   constraint is frequently referred to as the "wavelength continuity" 
   constraint, and the corresponding constrained lightpath computation 
   is known as the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. 
   Hence the information model must provide sufficient topology and 
   wavelength restriction and availability information to support this 
   computation. More details on the RWA process and WSON subsystems and 
   their properties can be found in [WSON-Frame]. The model defined here 
   does not currently include impairments however optical impairments 
   can be accommodated by the general framework presented here.

3. Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model 

   We group the following WSON RWA information model into four 
   categories regardless of whether they stem from a switching subsystem 
   or from a line subsystem: 

   o  Node Information 

   o  Link Information 

   o  Dynamic Node Information 

   o  Dynamic Link Information 

   Note that this is roughly the categorization used in [G.7715] section 
   7.  

   In the following we use where applicable the reduced Backus-Naur form 
   (RBNF) syntax of [RBNF] to aid in defining the RWA information model.  

3.1. Dynamic and Relatively Static Information 

   All the RWA information of concern in a WSON network is subject to 
   change over time.  Equipment can be upgraded; links may be placed in 
   or out of service and the like.  However, from the point of view of 
   RWA computations there is a difference between information that can 
   change with each successive connection establishment in the network 
   and that information that is relatively static on the time scales of 
   connection establishment. A key example of the former is link 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires September 3, 2009  [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks        March 2009 
    

   wavelength usage since this can change with connection setup/teardown 
   and this information is a key input to the RWA process.  Examples of 
   relatively static information are the potential port connectivity of 
   a WDM ROADM, and the channel spacing on a WDM link. 

   In this document we will separate, where possible, dynamic and static 
   information so that these can be kept separate in possible encodings 
   and hence allowing for separate updates of these two types of 
   information thereby reducing processing and traffic load caused by 
   the timely distribution of the more dynamic RWA WSON information. 

3.2. Node Information 

   The node information described here contains the relatively static 
   information related to a WSON node. This includes connectivity 
   constraints amongst ports and wavelengths since WSON switches can 
   exhibit asymmetric switching properties. Additional information could 
   include properties of wavelength converters in the node if any are 
   present. In [Switch] it was shown that the wavelength connectivity 
   constraints for a large class of practical WSON devices can be 
   modeled via switched and fixed connectivity matrices along with 
   corresponding switched and fixed port constraints. We include these 
   connectivity matrices with our node information the switched and 
   fixed port wavelength constraints with the link information. 

   Formally, 

   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID> [<SwitchedConnectivityMatrix>] 
   [<FixedConnectivityMatrix>], [<SRNG>] [<WavelengthConverterPool>] 

   Where the Node_ID would be an appropriate identifier for the node 
   within the WSON RWA context.  

   It is TBD whether multiple switched and fixed connectivity matrices 
   should optionally be allowed to fully support the most general cases 
   enumerated in [Switch]. To support multiple matrices each of the 
   matrices below would need an identifier so that its particular 
   port/wavelength constraints can be associated. 

   3.2.1. Switched Connectivity Matrix 

   The switched connectivity matrix (SwitchConnectivityMatrix) 
   represents the potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric switches 
   (e.g. ROADMs and such). Note that this matrix does not represent any 
   particular internal blocking behavior but indicates which ingress 
   ports and wavelengths could possibly be connected to a particular 
   output port. Representing internal state dependent blocking for a 
   switch or ROADM is beyond the scope of this document and due to its 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires September 3, 2009  [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks        March 2009 
    

   highly implementation dependent nature would not be subject to 
   standardization. This is a conceptual M by N matrix representing the 
   potential switched connectivity, where M represents the number of 
   ingress ports and N the number of egress ports. We say this is a 
   "conceptual" since this matrix tends to exhibit structure that allows 
   for very compact representations that are useful for both 
   transmission and path computation [Encode]. 

   SwitchedConnectivityMatrix(i, j) = 0 or 1 depending on whether 
   ingress port i can connect to egress port j for one or more 
   wavelengths. 

   3.2.2. Fixed Connectivity Matrix 

   The fixed connectivity matrix (FixedConnectivityMatrix) represents 
   the connectivity for asymmetric fixed devices or the fixed part of a 
   "hybrid" device [Switch]. This is a conceptual M by N matrix, where M 
   represents the number of ingress ports and N the number of egress 
   ports. We say this is a "conceptual" since this matrix tends to 
   exhibit structure that allows for very compact representations. 

   FixedConnectivityMatrix(i, j) = 0 or 1 depending on whether ingress 
   port i is connected to egress port j for one or more wavelengths. 

   3.2.3. Shared Risk Node Group 

   SRNG: Shared risk group for nodes. The concept of a shared risk link 
   group was defined in [RFC4202]. This can be used to achieve a desired 
   "amount" of link diversity. It is also desirable to have a similar 
   capability to achieve various degrees of node diversity. This is 
   explained in [G.7715]. Typical risk groupings for nodes can include 
   those nodes in the same building, within the same city, or geographic 
   region. 

   Since the failure of a node implies the failure of all links 
   associated with that node a sufficiently general shared risk link 
   group (SRLG) encoding, such as that used in GMPLS routing extensions 
   can explicitly incorporate SRNG information. 

   3.2.4. Wavelength Converter Pool 

   A WSON node may include wavelength converters. These are usually 
   arranged into some type of pool to promote resource sharing. There 
   are a number of different approaches used in the design of switches 
   with converter pools. However, from the point of view of path 
   computation we need to know the following: 

   1. The nodes that support wavelength conversion. 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires September 3, 2009  [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks        March 2009 
    

   2. The accessibility and availability of a wavelength converter to 
      convert from a given ingress wavelength on a particular ingress 
      port to a desired egress wavelength on a particular egress port. 

   3. Limitations on the types of signals that can be converted and the 
      conversions that can be performed. 

   To model point 2 above we can use a similar technique as used to 
   model ROADMs and optical switches this technique was generally 
   discussed in [WSON-Frame] and consisted of a matrix to indicate 
   possible connectivity along with wavelength constraints for 
   links/ports. Since wavelength converters are considered a scarce 
   resource we will also want to our model to include as a minimum the 
   usage state of individual wavelength converters in the pool. Models 
   that incorporate more state to further reveal blocking conditions on 
   ingress or egress to particular converters are for further study. 

   We utilize a three stage model as shown schematically in Figure 1. In 
   this model we assume N ingress ports (fibers), P wavelength 
   converters, and M egress ports (fibers). Since not all ingress ports 
   can necessarily reach the converter pool, the model starts with a 
   wavelength pool ingress matrix WI(i,p) = {0,1} whether ingress port i 
   can reach potentially reach wavelength converter p.  

   Since not all wavelength can necessarily reach all the converters or 
   the converters may have limited input wavelength range we have a set 
   of ingress port constraints for each wavelength converter. Currently 
   we assume that a wavelength converter can only take a single 
   wavelength on input. We can model each wavelength converter ingress 
   port constraint via a wavelength set mechanism.  

   Next we have a state vector WC(j) = {0,1} dependent upon whether 
   wavelength converter j in the pool is in use. This is the only state 
   kept in the converter pool model. This state is not necessary for 
   modeling "fixed" transponder system, i.e., systems where there is no 
   sharing.  In addition, this state information may be encoded in a 
   much more compact form depending on the overall connectivity 
   structure [WC-Pool]. 

   After that, we have a set of wavelength converter egress wavelength 
   constraints. These constraints indicate what wavelengths a particular 
   wavelength converter can generate or are restricted to generating due 
   to internal switch structure. 

   Finally, we have a wavelength pool egress matrix WE(p,k) = {0,1} 
   depending on whether the output from wavelength converter p can reach 
   egress port k. Examples of this method being used to model wavelength

   Formally we can specify the model as:

   Note that except for <WCPoolState> all the other components of 
   <WavelengthConverterPool> are relatively static. In addition 
   <WCPoolState> is a relatively small structure compared potentially to 
   the others and hence in a future revision of this document maybe 
   moved to a new section on dynamic node information. 
    
    
    
3.2.4.1. OEO Wavelength Converter Info 

   An OEO based wavelength converter can be characterized by an input 
   wavelength set and an output wavelength set.  In addition any 
   constraints on the signal formats and rates accommodated by the 
   converter must be described. Such a wavelength converter can be 
   modeled by: 

   <OEOWavelengthConverterInfo> ::= <RegeneratorType>  [<BitRateRange>] 
   [<AcceptableSignals>]  

   Where the RegeneratorType is used to model an OEO regenerator. 
   Regenerators are usually classified into three types [G.sup39]. Level 
   1 provides signal amplification, level 2 amplification and pulse 
   shaping, and level 3 amplification, pulse shaping and timing 
   regeneration. Level 2 regenerators can have a restricted bit rate 
   range, while level 3 regenerators can also be specialized to a 
   particular signal type.   

    

   BitRateRange: indicates the range of bit rates that can be 
   accommodated by the wavelength converter. 

   AcceptableSignals: is a list of signals that the wavelength converter 
   can handle. This could be fairly general for Level 1 and Level 2 
   regenerators, e.g., characterized by general signal properties such 
   as modulation type and related parameters, or fairly specific signal 
   types for Level 3 based regenerators. 

    

3.3. Link Information 

   MPLS-TE routing protocol extensions for OSPF and IS-IS [RFC3630], 
   [RFC5305] along with GMPLS routing protocol extensions for OSPF and 
   IS-IS [RFC4203, RFC5307] provide the bulk of the relatively static 
   link information needed by the RWA process. WSON networks bring in 
   additional link related constraints. These stem from WDM line system 
   characterization, laser transmitter tuning restrictions, and 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires September 3, 2009  [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks        March 2009 
    

   switching subsystem port wavelength constraints, e.g., colored ROADM 
   drop ports. 

   In the following summarize both information from existing route 
   protocols and new information that maybe needed by the RWA process. 

   <LinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID> [<AdministrativeGroup>] [<InterfaceCapDesc>] 
   [<Protection>] [<SRLG>]... [<TrafficEngineeringMetric>] 
   [<MaximumBandwidthPerChannel>] <[SwitchedPortWavelengthRestriction>] 
   [<FixedPortWavelengthRestriction>] 

   3.3.1. Link ID 

   <LinkID> ::=  <LocalLinkID> <LocalNodeID> <RemoteLinkID> 
   <RemoteNodeID> 

   Here we can generally identify a link via a combination of local and 
   remote node identifiers along with the corresponding local and remote 
   link identifiers per [RFC4202, RFC4203, RFC5307]. Note that reference 
   [RFC3630] provides other ways to identify local and remote link ends 
   in the case of numbered links.  

   3.3.2. Administrative Group 

   AdministrativeGroup: Defined in [RFC3630]. Each set bit corresponds 
   to one administrative group assigned to the interface.  A link may 
   belong to multiple groups. This is a configured quantity and can be 
   used to influence routing decisions. 

   3.3.3. Interface Switching Capability Descriptor 

   InterfaceSwCapDesc: Defined in [RFC4202], lets us know the different 
   switching capabilities on this GMPLS interface. In both [RFC4203] and 
   [RFC5307] this information gets combined with the maximum LSP 
   bandwidth that can be used on this link at eight different priority 
   levels. 

   3.3.4. Link Protection Type (for this link) 

   Protection: Defined in [RFC4202] and implemented in [RFC4203, 
   RFC5307]. Used to indicate what protection, if any, is guarding this 
   link. 

   3.3.5. Shared Risk Link Group Information 

   SRLG: Defined in [RFC4202] and implemented in [RFC4203, RFC5307]. 
   This allows for the grouping of links into shared risk groups, i.e.,

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks        March 2009 
    

   those links that are likely, for some reason, to fail at the same 
   time. 

   3.3.6. Traffic Engineering Metric 

   TrafficEngineeringMetric: Defined in [RFC3630].  This allows for the 
   definition of one additional link metric value for traffic 
   engineering separate from the IP link state routing protocols link 
   metric. Note that multiple "link metric values" could find use in 
   optical networks, however it would be more useful to the RWA process 
   to assign these specific meanings such as link mile metric, or 
   probability of failure metric, etc... 

   3.3.7.  Maximum Bandwidth Per Channel 

   TBD: Need to check if we still want this. 

   3.3.8. Switched and Fixed Port Wavelength Restrictions 

   Switch and fixed port wavelength restrictions 
   (SwitchedPortWavelengthRestriction, FixedPortWavelengthRestriction) 
   model the wavelength restrictions that various optical devices such 
   as OXCs, ROADMs, and waveband multiplexers may impose on a port. 
   These restrictions tell us what wavelength may or may not be used on 
   a link and are relatively static. This plays an important role in 
   fully characterizing a WSON switching device [Switch]. The 
   SwitchedPortWavelengthRestriction is used with ports specified in the 
   SwitchedConnectivityMatrix while the FixedPortWavelengthRestriction 
   is used with ports specified in the FixedConnectivityMatrix. 
   Reference [Switch] gives an example where both switch and fixed 
   connectivity matrices are used and both types of constraints occur on 
   the same port.  

   <SwitchedPortWavelengthRestriction> ::= <port wavelength restriction> 

   <FixedPortWavelengthRestriction> ::= <port wavelength restriction> 

   <port wavelength restriction> ::= <RestrictionKind> 
   <RestrictionParameters> <WavelengthSet> 

   <RestrictionParameters> ::= <MaxNumChannels> [<OthersTBD>]... 

   Where WavelengthSet is a conceptual set of wavelengths, 
   MaxNumChannels is the number of channels permitted on the port, and 
   RestrictionKind can take the following values and meanings: 



     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires September 3, 2009  [Page 11] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks        March 2009 
    

   SIMPLE:   Simple wavelength selective restriction. Max number of 
   channels indicates the number of wavelengths permitted on the port 
   and the accompanying wavelength set indicates the permitted values. 

   WAVEBAND1:   Waveband device with a tunable center frequency and 
   passband. In this case the maximum number of channels indicates the 
   maximum width of the waveband in terms of the channels spacing given 
   in the wavelength set. The corresponding wavelength set is used to 
   indicate the overall tuning range. Specific center frequency tuning 
   information can be obtained from dynamic channel in use information. 
   It is assumed that both center frequency and bandwidth (Q) tuning can 
   be done without causing faults in existing signals. 

   For example, if the port is a "colored" drop port of a ROADM then the 
   value of RestrictionKind = SIMPLE for a simple wavelength selective 
   restriction, the MaxNumberOfChannels = 1, and the wavelength 
   restriction is just a wavelength set consisting of a single member 
   corresponding to the frequency of the permitted wavelength. See 
   [Switch] for a complete waveband example. 

3.4. Dynamic Link Information 

   By dynamic information we mean information that is subject to change 
   on a link with subsequent connection establishment or teardown. 
   Currently for WSON the only information we currently envision is 
   wavelength availability and wavelength in use for shared backup 
   purposes. 

   <DynamicLinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID> <AvailableWavelengths> 
   [<SharedBackupWavelengths>] 

   Where 

   <LinkID> ::= <LocalLinkID> <LocalNodeID> <RemoteLinkID> 
   <RemoteNodeID> 

   AvailableWavelengths is a set of wavelengths currently available on 
   the link. Given this information and the port wavelength restrictions 
   we can also determine which wavelengths are currently in use. 

   SharedBackupWavelengths is a set of wavelengths currently used for 
   shared backup protection on the link. An example usage of this 
   information in a WSON setting is given in [Shared]. 

3.5. Dynamic Node Information 

   Dynamic node information is used to hold information for a node that 
   can change frequently.  Currently only wavelength converter pool 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires September 3, 2009  [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks        March 2009 
    

   information is included as a possible (but not required) information 
   sub-element. 

   <DynamicNodeInfo> ::=  <NodeID> [<WavelengthConverterPoolStatus>] 

   Where NodeID is a node identifier and the exact form of the 
   wavelength converter pool status information is TBD. 

    

4. Security Considerations 

   This document discussed an information model for RWA computation in 
   WSONs. Such a model is very similar from a security standpoint of the 
   information that can be currently conveyed via GMPLS routing 
   protocols.  Such information includes network topology, link state 
   and current utilization, and well as the capabilities of switches and 
   routers within the network.  As such this information should be 
   protected from disclosure to unintended recipients.  In addition, the 
   intentional modification of this information can significantly affect 
   network operations, particularly due to the large capacity of the 
   optical infrastructure to be controlled. 

    

5. IANA Considerations 

   This informational document does not make any requests for IANA 
   action.
