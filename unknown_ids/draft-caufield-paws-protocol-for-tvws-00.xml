<t>
  Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously
used by television stations available for secondary use as a result of
the switch from analog to digital. The spectrum in such cases is still
owned by the primary user to whom it is licensed. However parts of the
spectrum may be unused at a given location or time and hence can be
made available for secondary use. In order to use such spectrum a
device has to query a database in order to obtain a list of available
channels or spectrum at a given location and time. This document
specifies a protocol that can be used to query a white space database
by a device.
