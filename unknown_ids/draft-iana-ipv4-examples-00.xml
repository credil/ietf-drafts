<abstract>

<t>Three IPv4 unicast address blocks are reserved for use in examples
   in specifications and other documents.  This document describes the
   use of these blocks.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

   <t>This document describes the IPv4 address blocks that are
   provided for use in documentation. The use of designated address
   ranges for documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of
   conflicts and confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned
   for some other purpose.</t>

   <t><xref target="RFC1166"/> reserves the first of the three address
   blocks, 192.0.2.0/24. The other two address blocks have recently
   been allocated for this purpose, to ease the writing of examples
   involving addresses from multiple networks.</t>
   
   <t>These addresses are complementary to other documentation ranges defined
   in the IETF, including the IPv6 documentation prefixes <xref target="RFC3849"/>
   and example domain names <xref target="RFC2606"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">
         
	<t>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

	</t>

</section>

<section title="Documentation Address Blocks">

   <t>The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24
   (TEST-NET-2), and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use
   in documentation.
   </t>

</section>

<section title="Operational Implications">

   <t>Addresses within the TEST-NET-1, TEST-NET-2, and TEST-NET-3
   blocks SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and are used
   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry
   <xref target="RFC2050"/>.  Network operators SHOULD add these
   address blocks to the list of non-routeable address space, and if
   packet filters are deployed, then this address block SHOULD be
   added to packet filters.</t>

   <t>These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used
   in both local and public contexts.</t>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations'>

   <t>This document has no security implications.</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

   <t>IANA should record the allocation of the three address blocks in
   the IPv4 address registry. No end party is to be assigned these
   addresses.</t>
