    <abstract>
      <t>The use of right-to-left scripts in internationalized domain names
      has presented several challenges. This memo discusses some problems with
      these scripts, and some shortcomings in the 2003 IDNA BIDI criterion.
      Based on this discussion, it proposes a new BIDI criterion for IDNA
      labels.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Purpose and applicability">
        <t>This document's purpose is to establish a test that can be applied
        to Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) labels in Unicode form
        (U-labels) containing right-to-left characters.</t>

        <t>When labels pass the test, they can be used with a minimal chance
        of these labels being displayed in a confusing way by a bidirectional
        display algorithm. In order to achieve this stability, it is also
        necessary that the test be applied to labels occurring before or after
        the label containing right-to-left characters, which prohibits some
        LDH-labels that are permitted in other contexts.</t>

        <t>[[NOTE IN DRAFT: Verify whether it is enough to place requirements
        on the following label, if the label with RTL characters doesn't start
        with a digit.]]</t>

        <t>This specification does not place any requirements on domain names
        that do not contain right-to-left characters.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Background and history">
        <t>The IDNA specification "Stringprep", <xref target="RFC3454"></xref>
        makes the following statement in its section 6 on the BIDI algorithm,
        :<list style="empty">
            <t>3) If a string contains any RandALCat character, a RandALCat
            character MUST be the first character of the string, and a
            RandALCat character MUST be the last character of the string.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>(A RandALCat character is a character with unambiguously
        right-to-left directionality.)</t>

        <t>The reasoning behind this prohibition was to ensure that every
        component of a displayed domain name has an unambiguously preferred
        direction. However, this makes certain words in languages written with
        right-to-left scripts invalid as IDN labels, and in at least one case
        means that all the words of an entire language are forbidden as IDN
        labels.</t>

        <t>This will be illustrated below with examples taken from the Dhivehi
        and Yiddish languages, as written with the Thaana and Hebrew scripts,
        respectively.</t>

        <t>In investigating this problem, it was realized that the RFC 3454
        specification did not exactly specify what the requirement to be
        fulfilled was, and therefore, it was impossible to tell whether a
        simple relaxation of the rule would continue to fulfil the
        requirement. A further investigation led to the conclusion that for
        one reasonable set of requirements, IDNA2003's BIDI restriction did
        not fulfil the requirements. This document therefore proposes
        replacing the RFC 3454 BIDI requirement in its entirety.</t>

        <t>While the document proposes completely new text, most reasonable
        labels that were allowed under the old criterion will also be allowed
        under the new criterion, so the operational impact of the rule change
        is limited.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>In this memo, we use "network order" to describe the sequence of
        characters as transmitted on the wire or stored in a file; the terms
        "first", "next", "previous", "before" and "after" are used to refer to
        the relationship of characters and labels in network order.</t>

        <t>We use "display order" to talk about the sequence of characters as
        imaged on a display medium; the terms "left" and "right" are used to
        refer to the relationship of characters and labels in display
        order.</t>

        <t>Most of the time, the examples use the abbreviations for the
        Unicode BIDI classes to denote the directionality of the characters;
        in some examples, the convention that uppercase characters are of
        class R or AL, and lowercase characters are of class L is used - thus,
        the example string ABC.abc would consist of 3 right-to-left characters
        and 3 left-to-right characters.</t>

        <t>The other terminology used to describe IDNA concepts is defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-rationale"></xref></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Detailed examples">
      <section title="Dhivehi">
        <t>Dhivehi, the official language of the Maldives, is written with the
        Thaana script. This displays some of the characteristics of Arabic
        script, including its directional properties, and the indication of
        vowels by the diacritical marking of consonantal base characters. This
        marking is obligatory, and both double vowels and syllable-final
        consonants are indicated by the marking of special unvoiced
        characters. Every Dhivehi word therefore ends with a combining
        mark.</t>

        <t>The word for "computer", which is romanized as "konpeetaru", is
        written with the following sequence of Unicode code points:</t>

        <t><list>
            <t>U+0786 THAANA LETTER KAAFU (AL)</t>

            <t>U+07AE THAANA OBOFILI (NSM)</t>

            <t>U+0782 THAANA LETTER NOONU (AL)</t>

            <t>U+07B0 THAANA SUKUN (NSM)</t>

            <t>U+0795 THAANA LETTER PAVIYANI (AL)</t>

            <t>U+07A9 THAANA LETTER EEBEEFILI (AL)</t>

            <t>U+0793 THAANA LETTER TAVIYANI (AL)</t>

            <t>U+07A6 THAANA ABAFILI (NSM)</t>

            <t>U+0783 THAANA LETTER RAA (AL)</t>

            <t>U+07AA THAANA UBIUFILI (NSM)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The directionality class of U+07AA in the Unicode database is NSM
        (non-spacing mark), which is not R or AL; a conformant implementation
        of the IDNA2003 algorithm will say that "this is not in RandALCat",
        and refuse to encode the string.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Yiddish">
        <t>Yiddish is one of several languages written with the Hebrew script
        (others include Hebrew and Ladino). This is basically a consonantal
        alphabet (also termed an "abjad") but Yiddish is written using an
        extended form that is fully vocalic. The vowels are indicated in
        several ways, of which one is by repurposing letters that are
        consonants in Hebrew. Other letters are used both as vowels and
        consonants, with combining marks, called "points", used to
        differentiate between them. Finally, some base characters can indicate
        several different vowels, which are also disambiguated by combining
        marks. Pointed characters can appear in word-final position and may
        therefore also be needed at the end of labels. This is not an
        invariable attribute of a Yiddish string and there is thus greater
        latitude here than there is with Dhivehi.</t>

        <t>The organization now known as the "YIVO Institute for Jewish
        Research" developed orthographic rules for modern Standard Yiddish
        during the 1930s on the basis of work conducted in several venues
        since earlier in that century. These are given in, "The Standardized
        Yiddish Orthography: Rules of Yiddish Spelling, 6th ed., YIVO
        Institute for Jewish Research, New York, 1999, ISBN 0-914512-25-0",
        ("SYO") and are taken as normatively descriptive of modern Standard
        Yiddish in any context where that notion is deemed relevant. They have
        been applied exclusively in all Yiddish dictionaries published since
        their establishment, and are similarly dominant in academic and
        bibliographic regards.</t>

        <t>It therefore appears appropriate for this repertoire also to be
        supported fully by IDNA. This presents no difficulty with characters
        in initial and medial positions, but pointed characters are regularly
        used in final position as well. All of the characters in the SYO
        repertoire appear in both marked and unmarked form with one exception:
        the HEBREW LETTER PE (U+05E4). The SYO only permits this with a HEBREW
        POINT DAGESH (U+05BC), providing the Yiddish equivalent to the Latin
        letter "p", or a HEBREW POINT RAFE (U+05BF), equivalent to the Latin
        letter "f". There is, however, a separate unpointed allograph, the
        HEBREW LETTER FINAL PE (U+05E3), for the latter character when it
        appears in final position. The constraint on the use of the SYO
        repertoire resulting from the proscription of combining marks at the
        end of RTL strings thus reduces to nothing more, or less, than the
        equivalent of saying that a string of Latin characters cannot end with
        the letter "p". It must also be noted that the HEBREW LETTER PE with
        HEBREW POINT DAGESH is characteristic of almost all traditional
        Yiddish orthographies that predate (or remain in use in parallel to)
        the SYO, being the first pointed character to appear in any of
        them.</t>

        <t>A more general instantiation of the basic problem can be seen in
        the representation of the YIVO acronym. This is written with the
        Hebrew letters YOD YOD HIRIQ VAV VAV ALEF QAMATS, where HIRIQ and
        QAMATS are combining points: <list>
            <t>U+05D9 HEBREW LETTER YOD (R)</t>

            <t>U+05B4 HEBREW POINT HIRIQ (NSM)</t>

            <t>U+05D5 HEBREW LETTER VAV (R)</t>

            <t>U+05D0 HEBREW LETTER ALEF (R)</t>

            <t>U+05B8 HEBREW POINT QAMATS (NSM)</t>
          </list> The directionality class of U+05B8 HEBREW POINT QAMATS in
        the Unicode database is NSM, which again causes the IDNA2003 algorithm
        to reject the string.</t>

        <t>It may also be noted that all of the combined characters mentioned
        above exist in precomposed form at separate positions in the Unicode
        chart. However, by invoking Stringprep, the IDNA2003 algorithm also
        rejects those codepoints, for reasons not discussed here.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Strings with numbers">
        <t>RFC 3454, in its insistence that the first or last character of a
        string be category R or AL, prohibited strings that contained
        right-to-left characters and numbers at the end.</t>

        <t>Consider the strings ALEF 5 (HEBREW LETTER ALEF + DIGIT FIVE) and 5
        ALEF. Displayed in a LTR context, the first one will be displayed from
        left to right as 5 ALEF (with the 5 being considered right-to-left
        because of the leading ALEF), while 5 ALEF will be displayed in
        exactly the same order (5 taking the direction from context). Clearly,
        only one of those should be permitted as a registered label.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="An expanded justification for the BIDI rule">
      <t>One issue with RFC 3454 was that it did not give an explicit
      justification for the BIDI rule, thus it was hard to tell if a modified
      rule would continue to fulfil the purpose for which the RFC 3454 rule
      was written.</t>

      <t>This document proposes an explicit justification, by stating a set of
      requirements for which it is possible to test whether or not the
      modified rule fulfils the requirement.</t>

      <t>All the text in this document assumes that text containing the labels
      under consideration will be displayed using the Unicode bidirectional
      algorithm <xref target="UAX9"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The requirements proposed are these:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Label Uniqueness: No two labels, when presented in display order
          in the same paragraph, should have the same sequence of characters
          without also having the same sequence of characters in network
          order. (This is the criterion that is explicit in RFC 3454).</t>

          <t>Character Grouping: In a display of a string of labels, the
          characters of each label should remain grouped between the
          characters delimiting the labels.</t>

          <t>These requirements should be satisfied both when the string is
          embedded in a paragraph with LTR direction and when it's embedded in
          a paragraph with RTL direction. [[NOTE IN DRAFT: The need for this
          requirement has been challenged. Should be decided by WG.]]</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Several stronger statements were considered and rejected, because
      they seem to be impossible to fulfil within the constraints of the
      Unicode bidirectional algorithm. These include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The appearance of a label should be unaffected by its embedding
          context. This proved impossible even for ASCII labels; the label
          "123-456" will have a different display order in an RTL context than
          in a LTR context.</t>

          <t>The sequence of labels should be consistent with network order.
          This proved impossible - a domain name consisting of the labels (in
          network order) L1.R1.R2.L2 will be displayed as L1.R2.R1.L2 in an
          LTR context.</t>

          <t>The Label Uniqueness property should hold true between LTR
          paragraphs and RTL paragraphs. This was shown to be unsound.</t>

          <t>No two domain names should be displayed the same, even under
          differing directionality. This was shown to be unsound, since the
          domain name (network) ABC.abc will have display order CBA.abc in an
          LTR context and abc.CBA in an RTL context, while the domain name
          (network) abc.ABC will have display order abc.CBA in an LTR context
          and CBA.abc in an RTL context.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>One specific requirement was thought to be problematic, but turned
      out to be satisfied by a string that obeys the proposed rules:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The Character Grouping requirement should be satisfied when
          directional controls (LRE, RLE, RLO, LRO, PDF) are used in the same
          paragraph (outside of the labels). Because these controls affect
          presentation order in non-obvious ways, by affecting the "sor" and
          "eor" properties of the Unicode BIDI algorithm, the conditions above
          would be very hard to satisfy for an useful set of strings if this
          was true. As long as these controls have no influence over the
          display of the domain name, no problem will be caused, but the exact
          criterion for "will not influence" is hard to codify.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For reference, here are the values that the Unicode BIDI property can
      have: <list style="symbols">
          <t>L - Left-to-right - most letters in LTR scripts</t>

          <t>R - Right-to-left - most letters in non-Arabic RTL scripts</t>

          <t>AL - Arabic letters - most letters in the Arabic script</t>

          <t>EN - European Number (0-9, and Extended Arabic-Indic numbers)</t>

          <t>ES - European Number Separator (+ and -)</t>

          <t>ET - European Number Terminator (currency symbols, the hash sign,
          the percent sign and so on)</t>

          <t>AN - Arabic Number</t>

          <t>CS - Common Number Separator (. , / : et al)</t>

          <t>NSM - Non spacing Mark - most combining accents</t>

          <t>BN - Boundary Neutral - control characters</t>

          <t>B - Paragraph Separator</t>

          <t>S - Segment Separator</t>

          <t>WS - Whitespace, including the SPACE character</t>

          <t>ON - Other Neutrals, including @, &amp;, parentheses, MIDDLE
          DOT</t>

          <t>LRE, LRO, RLE, RLO, PDF - these are "directional control
          characters", and are not used in IDNA labels.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In the following descriptions, first-level bullets are used to
      indicate rules or normative statements; second-level bullets are
      commentary.</t>

      <t>The Character Grouping requirement can be more formally stated
      as:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Let "Delimiterchars" be a set of characters with the Unicode BIDI
          properties CS, WS, ON. (These are commonly used to delimit labels -
          both the FULL STOP and the space are included.) <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>ET, though it commonly occurs next to domain names in
              practice, is problematic: the context R CS L EN ET (for instance
              A.a1%) makes the label L EN not satisfy the character grouping
              requirement.</t>

              <t>ES commonly occurs in labels as HYPHEN-MINUS, but could also
              be used as a delimiter (for instance, the plus sign). It is left
              out here.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A label L satisfies the Character Grouping requirement when, for any
      Delimiter Character D1 and D2, and for any legal label S1 and S2 (which
      may have length zero):</t>

      <t>If the string formed by concatenating S1, D1, L, D2 and S2 is
      reordered according to the BIDI algorithm, then all the characters of L
      in the reordered string are between D1 and D2, and no other characters
      are between D1 and D2, both if the overall paragraph direction is LTR
      and if the overall paragraph direction is RTL.</t>

      <t>Note that the definition is self-referential, since S1 and S2 are
      constrained to be "legal" by this definition; this makes testing changes
      to proposed rules a little complex, but does not create problems for
      testing whether or not a given proposed rule satisfies the
      criterion.</t>

      <t>In a paragraph with an embedded string formed from the substrings A B
      L C D, where A and D are (possibly zero-length) legal labels, and B and
      C are single "Delimiter chars", the label L satisfies the requirement
      if, for all A, B, C and D, the BIDI position of all characters in L is
      within the range of positions for the characters of L in the string, and
      the BIDI position of B and C is on opposite sides of the string, for
      both the LTR and RTL paragraph direction.</t>

      <t>(The "zero-length" case represents the case where a domain name is
      next to something that isn't a domain name, separated by a delimiter
      character).</t>

      <t>The Label Uniqueness requirement can be formally stated as:</t>

      <t>If two labels L and L', embedded as for the test above, displayed in
      paragraphs with the same directionality, are reordered by the BIDI
      algorithm into the same sequence of codepoints, at most one of the
      labels L and L' is a legal label.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="A replacement for the RFC 3454 rule">
      <t>Based on the above discussion, and on testing, the following rule has
      been developed for BIDI domain names:</t>

      <t>A label containing a character of type R, AL or AN MUST satisfy the
      criterion below. In addition, any label in a domain name immediately
      after a label containing a character of type R, AL or AN MUST satisfy
      the same criterion.</t>

      <t>The main bullets give the rule, subordinate bullets (if any) give
      justifications or examples of things that break if this rule is not
      present.</t>

      <t>Exhaustive testing has verified that all strings that satisfy this
      criterion satisfy both the requirements above at least for all strings
      up to 6 characters.</t>

    <section title="Other issues in need of resolution">
      <t>This document concerns itself only with the rules that are needed
      when dealing with domain names with characters that have differing BIDI
      properties, and considers characters only in terms of their BIDI
      properties. All other issues with these scripts have to be considered in
      other contexts.</t>

      <t>One such issue is the need to keep numbers separate; several scripts,
      such as Arabic, have multiple sets of numbers. The algorithm in this
      document disallows occurrences of AN-class characters ("Arabic-Indic
      digits", U+0660 to U+0669) together with EN-class characters (which
      includes "European" digits, U+0030 to U+0039 and "extended Arabic-Indic
      digits", U+06F0 to U+06F9), but does not help in preventing the mixing
      of, for instance, Bengali digits (U+09E6 to U+09EF) and Gujarati digits
      (U+0AE6 to U+0AEF), both of which have BIDI class L. Any registry or
      script community that wishes to create rules for the mixing of digits in
      a label will have to specify these restrictions at the registry
      level.</t>

      <t>Another set of issues concerns the proper display of IDNs with a
      mixture of LTR and RTL labels, or only RTL labels.</t>

      <t>It is unrealistic to expect that applications will display domain
      names using embedded formatting codes between their labels (for one
      thing, no reliable algorithm for identifying domain names in running
      text exist); thus, the display order will be determined by the
      bidirectional algorithm. Thus, a sequence (in network order) of
      R1.R2.ltr will be displayed in the order 2R.1R.ltr in a LTR context,
      which might surprise someone expecting to see labels displayed in
      hierarchical order. Again, this memo does not attempt to suggest a
      solution to this problem.</t>

    <section title="Compatibility considerations">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Backwards compatibility considerations">
        <t>As with any change to an existing standard, it is important to
        consider what happens with existing implementations when the change is
        introduced. The following troublesome cases have been noted:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Old program used to input the newly allowed string. If the old
            program checks the input against RFC 3454, the string will not be
            allowed, and that domain name will remain inaccessible.</t>

            <t>Old program is asked to display the newly allowed string, and
            checks it against RFC 3454 before displaying. The program will
            perform some kind of fallback, most likely displaying the Punycode
            form of the string.</t>

            <t>Old program tries to display the newly allowed string. If the
            old program has code for displaying the last character of a string
            that is different from the code used to display the characters in
            the middle of the string, display may be inconsistent and cause
            confusion.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>One particular example of the last case is if a program chooses to
        examine the last character (in network order) of a string in order to
        determine its directionality, rather than its first; if it finds an
        NSM character and tries to display the string as if it was a
        left-to-right string, the resulting display may be interesting, but
        not useful.</t>

        <t>The editors believe that these cases will have less harmful impact
        in practice than continuing to deny the use of words from the
        languages for which these strings are necessary as IDN labels.</t>

        <t>This specification forbids using leading European numbers in
        ASCII-only labels; this is in conflict with a large installed base of
        such labels. The harm resulting from violating this rule is seen when
        a label at the next level down in the hierarchy ends with a number
        (Arabic or European). Zone managers, both registries and private zone
        managers, can check for this particular condition before they allow
        registration of any string with right-to-left characters in it;
        generally it is best to not allow registration of any right-to-left
        strings in a zone where the label at the level above begins with a
        digit.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Forward compatibiltiy considerations">
        <t>This text is, intentionally, specified strictly in terms of the
        Unicode BIDI properties. The determination that the condition is
        sufficient to fulfil the criteria depends on the Unicode BIDI
        algorithm; it is unlikely that drastic changes will be made to this
        algorithm.</t>

        <t>However, the determination of validity for any string depends on
        the Unicode BIDI property values, which are not declared immutable by
        the Unicode Consortium. Furthermore, the behaviour of the algorithm
        for any given character is likely to be linguistically and culturally
        sensitive, so that it's not unlikely that later versions of the
        Unicode standard may change the BIDI properties assigned to certain
        Unicode characters.</t>

        <t>This memo does not propose a solution for this problem.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This modification will allow some strings to be used in Stringprep
      contexts that are not allowed today. It is possible that differences in
      the interpretation of the specification between old and new
      implementations could pose a security risk, but it is difficult to
      envision any specific instantiation of this.</t>

      <t>Any rational attempt to compute, for instance, a hash over an
      identifier processed by Stringprep would use network order for its
      computation, and thus be unaffected by the changes proposed here.</t>

      <t>While it is not believed to pose a problem, if display routines had
      been written with specific knowledge of the RFC 3454 Stringprep
      prohibitions, it is possible that the potential problems noted under
      "backwards compatibility" could cause new kinds of confusion.</t>

      <t>The rule about leading numbers, which is more restrictive than
      current practice for domain names, has a peculiar interaction with the
      DNAME record; a DNAME record can point to a zone where right-to-left
      labels are registered without the knowledge or consent of the zone
      owner; if the name of the DNAME begins with a number, this can cause
      display of the right-to-left labels in the zone to be confusing. It is
      recommended that DNAMEs pointing to zones allowing right-to-left labels
      should not start with a digit, but a pointed-to zone owner has no way of
      enforcing this.</t>
