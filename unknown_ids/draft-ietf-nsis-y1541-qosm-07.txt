Internet-Draft                 Y.1541 QOSM                  October 2008


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes a QoS model (QOSM) for NSIS QoS signaling layer
   protocol (QoS-NSLP) application based on ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541
   Network QoS Classes and related signaling requirements.  [Y.1541]
   currently specifies 8 classes of Network Performance objectives, and
   the Y.1541-QOSM extensions include additional QSPEC parameters and
   QOSM processing guidelines.  The extensions are based on
   standardization work in the ITU-T on QoS signaling requirements
   [Y.1541] [TRQ-QoS-SIG] [E.361].

   [QoS-SIG] [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] defines message types and control
   information for the QoS-NSLP generic to all QOSMs.  A QOSM is a
   defined mechanism for achieving QoS as a whole.  The specification of
   a QOSM includes a description of its QSPEC parameter information, as
   well as how that information should be treated or interpreted in the
   network.  The QSPEC [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec] contains a set of
   parameters and values describing the requested resources.  It is
   opaque to the QoS-NSLP and similar in purpose to the TSpec, RSpec and
   AdSpec specified in [RFC2205] [RFC2210] .  The QSPEC object contains
   the QoS parameters defined by the QOSM.  A QOSM provides a specific
   set of parameters to be carried in the QSPEC.  At each QoS NSIS
   element (QNE), the QSPEC contents are interpreted by the resource
   management function (RMF) for purposes of policy control and traffic
   control, including admission control and configuration of the
   scheduler.


2.  Summary of ITU-T Recommendations Y.1541 & Signaling Requirements

   As stated above, [Y.1541] is a specification of standardized QoS
   classes for IP networks (a summary of these classes is given below).
   [TRQ-QoS-SIG] specifies the requirements for achieving end-to-end QoS
   in IP networks, with Y.1541 QoS classes as a basis.  [Y.1541]
   recommends a flexible allocation of the end-to-end performance
   objectives (e.g., delay) across networks, rather than a fixed per-
   network allocation.  NSIS protocols already address most of the
   requirements, this document identifies additional QSPEC parameters
   and processing requirements needed to support the Y.1541 QOSM.

2.1.  Y.1541 Classes

   [Y.1541] proposes grouping services into QoS classes defined
   according to the desired QoS performance objectives.  These QoS
   classes support a wide range of user applications.  The classes group
   objectives for one-way IP packet delay, IP packet delay variation, IP
   packet loss ratio, etc., where the parameters themselves are defined
   in [Y.1540].  Classes 0 and 1 might be implemented using the DiffServ

Internet-Draft                 Y.1541 QOSM                  October 2008


   EF PHB, and support interactive real-time applications.  Classes 2,
   3, and 4 might be implemented using the DiffServ AFxy PHB Group, and
   support data transfer applications with various degrees of
   interactivity.  Class 5 generally corresponds to the DiffServ Default
   PHB, has all the QoS parameters unspecified consistent with a best-
   effort service.  Classes 6 and 7 provide support for extremely loss-
   sensitive user applications, such as high quality digital television,
   TDM circuit emulation, and high capacity file transfers using TCP.
   These classes are intended to serve as a basis for agreements between
   end-users and service providers, and between service providers.  They
   support a wide range of user applications including point-to-point
   telephony, data transfer, multimedia conferencing, and others.  The
   limited number of classes supports the requirement for feasible
   implementation, particularly with respect to scale in global
   networks.

   The QoS classes apply to a packet flow, where [Y.1541] defines a
   packet flow as the traffic associated with a given connection or
   connectionless stream having the same source host, destination host,
   class of service, and session identification.  The characteristics of
   each Y.1451 QoS class are summarized here:

   Class 0: Real-time, highly interactive applications, sensitive to
   jitter.  Mean delay upper bound is 100 ms, delay variation is less
   than 50 ms, and loss ratio is less than 10^-3.  Application examples
   include VoIP, Video Teleconference.

   Class 1: Real-time, interactive applications, sensitive to jitter.
   Mean delay upper bound is 400 ms, delay variation is less than 50 ms,
   and loss ratio is less than 10^-3.  Application examples include
   VoIP, video teleconference.

   Class 2: Highly interactive transaction data.  Mean delay upper bound
   is 100 ms, delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less
   than 10^-3.  Application examples include signaling.

   Class 3: Interactive transaction data.  Mean delay upper bound is 400
   ms, delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than
   10^-3.  Application examples include signaling.

   Class 4: Low Loss Only applications.  Mean delay upper bound is 1s,
   delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than 10^-3.
   Application examples include short transactions, bulk data, video
   streaming

   Class 5: Unspecified applications with unspecified mean delay, delay
   variation, and loss ratio.  Application examples include traditional
   applications of Default IP Networks

Internet-Draft                 Y.1541 QOSM                  October 2008


   Class 6: Mean delay <= 100 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio
   <= 10^-5.  Applications that are highly sensitive to loss, such as
   television transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM circuit
   emulation.

   Class 7: Mean delay <= 400 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio
   <= 10^-5.  Applications that are highly sensitive to loss, such as
   television transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM circuit
   emulation.

   These classes enable SLAs to be defined between customers and network
   service providers with respect to QoS requirements.  The service
   provider then needs to ensure that the requirements are recognized
   and receive appropriate treatment across network layers.

   Work is in progress to specify methods for combining local values of
   performance metrics to estimate the performance of the complete path.
   See section 8 of [Y.1541], [I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg], and
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-spatial-composition].

2.2.  Y.1541-QOSM Processing Requirements

   [TRQ-QoS-SIG] provides the requirements for signaling information
   regarding IP-based QoS at the interface between the user and the
   network (UNI) and across interfaces between different networks (NNI).
   To meet specific network performance requirements specified for the
   Y.1541 QoS classes [Y.1541] , a network needs to provide specific
   user plane functionality at UNI and NNI interfaces.  Dynamic network
   provisioning at a UNI and/or NNI node allows the ability to
   dynamically request a traffic contract for an IP flow from a specific
   source node to one or more destination nodes.  In response to the
   request, the network determines if resources are available to satisfy
   the request and provision the network.

   It MUST be possible to derive the following service level parameters
   as part of the process of requesting service:

   a.  Y.1541 QoS class

   b. rate (r)

   c. peak rate (p)

   d. bucket size (b)

   e. peak bucket size (Bp)*, octets

   f. maximum packet size (M)*, octets

   g.  DiffServ PHB class [RFC2475]

   h. admission priority

   i. restoration priority*

   All parameters except Bp, M, and restoration priority have already
   been specified in [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec].  These additional parameters
   are specified in Section 3.

   It MUST be possible to perform the following QoS-NSLP signaling
   functions to meet Y.1541-QOSM requirements:

   a. accumulate delay, delay variation and loss ratio across the end-
   to-end connection, which may span multiple domains

   b. enable negotiation of Y.1541 QoS class across domains.

   c. enable negotiation of delay, delay variation, and loss ratio
   across domains.

   These signaling requirements are already supported by
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] and the functions are illustrated in Section
   4.


3.  Additional QSPEC Parameters for Y.1541 QOSM

3.1.  Traffic Model (TMOD) Extension Parameter

   The traffic model (TMOD) extension parameter is represented by one
   floating point number in single-precision IEEE floating point format
   and one 32-bit unsigned integer.

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |M|E|N|r|           15          |r|r|r|r|          2            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Peak Bucket Size [Bp] (32-bit IEEE floating point number)    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |      Maximum Packet Size [M] (32-bit unsigned integer)        |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 1: TMOD Extension

   When the Bp term is represented as an IEEE floating point value, the
   sign bit MUST be zero (all values MUST be non-negative).  Exponents
   less than 127 (i.e., 0) are prohibited.  Exponents greater than 162
   (i.e., positive 35) are discouraged, except for specifying a peak
   rate of infinity.  Infinity is represented with an exponent of all
   ones (255) and a sign bit and mantissa of all zeros.  The maximum
   packet size (M) is an unsigned integer.

   The QSPEC parameter behavior for (Bp) and (M) is similar to that
   defined in [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec], section 6.2.1 and 6.2.2.  The new
   parameters (and all traffic-related parameters) are specified
   independently from the Y.1541 class parameter.

3.2.  Restoration Priority Parameter

   Restoration priority is the urgency with which a service requires
   successful restoration under failure conditions.  Restoration
   priority is achieved by provisioning sufficient backup capacity, as
   necessary, and allowing relative priority for access to available
   bandwidth when there is contention for restoration bandwidth.
   Restoration priority is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |M|E|N|r|           16          |r|r|r|r|          1            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | Rest. Priority|                  (Reserved)                   |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                      Figure 2: Restoration Priority

   Restoration Priority: 3 priority values are listed here in the order
   of lowest priority to highest priority:

   0 - best effort

Internet-Draft                 Y.1541 QOSM                  October 2008


   1 - normal

   2 - high

   These priority values are described in [Y.2172], where best effort
   priority is the same as Priority level 3, normal priority is Priority
   level 2, and high priority is the same as Priority level 1.

   Reserved: These 3 octets are reserved for future use.  There are
   several ways to elaborate on restoration priority, and two
   possibilities are described below:

   a.  Time-to-Restore: Total amount of time to restore traffic streams
   belonging to a given restoration class impacted by the failure.  This
   time period depends on the technology deployed for restoration.  A
   fast recovery period of < 200 ms is based on current experience with
   SONET rings and a slower recovery period of 2 seconds is suggested in
   order to enable a voice call to recover without being dropped.
   Accordingly, candidate restoration objectives are:

   Best Time-to-Restore: <= 200 ms

   Normal Time-to-Restore <= 2 s

   Unspecified Time-to-Restore = 0 (Unspecified)

   b.  Extent of Restoration: Percentage of traffic belonging to the
   restoration class that can be restored.  This percentage depends on
   the amount of spare capacity engineered.  All high priority
   restoration priority traffic, for example, may be "guaranteed" at
   100% by the service provider.  Other classes may offer lesser chances
   for successful restoration.  The restoration extent for these lower
   priority classes depend on SLA agreements developed between the
   service provider and the customer.

   The Reserved octets MAY be designated for these or other uses in the
   future.


4.  Y.1541-QOSM Considerations and Processing Example

   In this Section we illustrate the operation of the Y.1541 QOSM, and
   show how current QoS-NSLP and QSPEC functionality is used.  No new
   processing capabilities or parameters (except those described in
   section 3) are required to enable the Y.1541 QOSM.

Internet-Draft                 Y.1541 QOSM                  October 2008


4.1.  Deployment Considerations

   [TRQ-QoS-SIG] emphasizes the deployment of Y.1541 QNEs at the borders
   of supporting domains.  There may be domain configurations where
   interior QNEs are desirable, and the example below addresses this
   possibility.

   QNEs may be Stateful in some limited aspects, but obviously it is
   preferable to deploy stateless QNEs.

4.2.  Applicable QSPEC Procedures

   All procedures defined in section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec] are
   applicable to this QOSM.

4.3.  QNE Processing Rules

   [TRQ-QoS-SIG] describes the information processing in Y.1541 QNEs.

   [Y.1541] section 8 defines the accumulation rules for individual
   performance parameters (e.g., delay, jitter).

   When a QNI specifies the Y.1541 QoS Class number, <Y.1541 QoS Class>,
   it is a sufficient specification of objectives for the <Path
   Latency>, <Path Jitter>, and <Path BER> parameters.  As described
   above in section 2, some Y.1541 Classes do not set objectives for all
   the performance parameters above.  For example, Classes 2, 3, and 4,
   do not specify an objective for <Path Jitter> (referred to as IP
   Packet Delay Variation).  In the case that the QoS Class leaves a
   parameter Unspecified, then that parameter need not be included in
   the accumulation processing.

4.4.  Processing Example

   As described in the example given in [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec] (Section
   4.4) and as illustrated in Figure 3, the QoS NSIS initiator (QNI)
   initiates an end-to-end, inter-domain QoS NSLP RESERVE message
   containing the Initiator QSPEC.  In the case of the Y.1541 QOSM, the
   Initiator QSPEC specifies the <Y.1541 QOS Class>, <TMOD>, <TMOD
   Extension>, <Admission Priority>, <Restoration Priority>, and perhaps
   other QSPEC parameters for the flow.  As described in Section 3, the
   TMOD extension parameter contains the optional, Y.1541-QOSM-specific
   parameters Bp and M; restoration priority is also an optional,
   Y.1541-QOSM-specific parameter.

   As illustrated in Figure 3, the RESERVE message may cross multiple
   domains supporting different QOSMs.  In this illustration, the
   initiator QSPEC arrives in an QoS NSLP RESERVE message at the ingress

Internet-Draft                 Y.1541 QOSM                  October 2008


   node of the local-QOSM domain.  As described in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] and [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec], at the ingress
   edge node of the local-QOSM domain, the end-to-end, inter-domain QoS-
   NSLP message may trigger the generation of a local QSPEC, and the
   initiator QSPEC encapsulated within the messages signaled through the
   local domain.  The local QSPEC is used for QoS processing in the
   local-QOSM domain, and the Initiator QSPEC is used for QoS processing
   outside the local domain.  As specified in [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec], if
   any QNE cannot meet the requirements designated by the initiator
   QSPEC to support an optional QSPEC parameter, with the M bit set to
   zero for the parameter, for example, it cannot support the
   accumulation of end-to-end delay with the <Path Latency> parameter,
   the QNE sets the N flag (not supported flag) for the path latency
   parameter to one.

   Also, the Y.1541-QOSM requires negotiation of the <Y.1541 QoS Class>
   across domains.  This negotiation can be done with the use of the
   existing procedures already defined in [QoS-SIG]
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].  For example, the QNI sets <Desired QoS>,
   <Minimum QoS>, <Available QoS> objects to include <Y.1541 QoS Class>,
   which specifies objectives for the <Path Latency>, <Path Jitter>,
   <Path BER> parameters.  In the case that the QoS Class leaves a
   parameter Unspecified, then that parameter need not be included in
   the accumulation processing.  The QNE/domain SHOULD set the Y.1541
   class and cumulative parameters, e.g., <Path Latency>, that can be
   achieved in the <QoS Available> object (but not less than specified
   in <Minimum QoS>).  This could include, for example, setting the
   <Y.1541 QoS Class> to a lower class than specified in <QoS Desired>
   (but not lower than specified in <Minimum QoS>).  If the <Available
   QoS> fails to satisfy one or more of the <Minimum QoS> objectives,
   the QNE/domain notifies the QNI and the reservation is aborted.
   Otherwise, the QNR notifies the QNI of the <QoS Available> for the
   reservation.

   When the available <Y.1541 QoS Class> must be reduced from the
   desired <Y.1541 QoS Class>, say because the delay objective has been
   exceeded, then there is an incentive to respond with an available
   value for delay in the <Path Latency> parameter.  If the available
   <Path Latency> is 150 ms (still useful for many applications) and the
   desired QoS is Class 0 (with its 100 ms objective), then the response
   would be that Class 0 cannot be achieved and Class 1 is available
   (with its 400 ms objective).  In addition, this QOSM allows the
   response to include an available <Path Latency> = 150 ms, making
   acceptance of the available <Y.1541 QoS Class> more likely.  There
   are many long paths where the propagation delay alone exceeds the
   Y.1541 Class 0 objective, so this feature adds flexibility to commit
   to exceed the Class 1 objective when possible.

   This example illustrates Y.1541-QOSM negotiation of <Y.1541 QoS
   Class> and cumulative parameter values that can be achieve end-to-
   end.  The example illustrates how the QNI can use the cumulative
   values collected in <QoS Available> to decide if a lower <Y.1541 QoS
   Class> than specified in <QoS Desired> is acceptable.

4.5.  Bit-Level QSPEC Example

   This is an example where the QOS Desired specification contains the
   TMOD-1 parameters and TMOD extended parameters defined in this
   specification, as well as the Y.1541 Class parameter.  The QOS
   Available specification utilizes the Latency, Jitter, and Loss
   parameters to enable accumulation of these parameters for easy
   comparison with the objectives desired fir the Y.1541 Class.

   This example assumes that all the parameters MUST be supported by the
   QNEs, so all M flags have been set to "1".

4.6.  Preemption Behaviour

   The default QNI behaviour of tearing down a preempted reservation is
   followed in the Y.1541 QOSM.  The restoration priority parameter
   described above does not rely on preemption.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section defines the registries and initial codepoint assignments
   for the QSPEC template, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].  It also
   defines the procedural requirements to be followed by IANA in
   allocating new codepoints.

   This document specifies the following QSPEC parameters to be assigned
   within the QSPEC Parameter ID registry created in
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec]:

   <TMOD Extension> parameter (Section 3.1, suggested ID=15)

   <Restoration Priority> parameter (Section 3.2, suggested ID=16)

   This specification creates the following registry with the structure
   as defined below:

   Restoration Priority Parameter (8 bits):

   The following values are allocated by this specification:

   0-2: assigned as specified in Section 3.2:

   0: best-effort priority

   1: normal priority

   2: high priority

   The allocation policies for further values are as follows:

   3-63: Standards Action

   64-255: Reserved


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp] and
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec] apply to this Document.  There are no new
   security considerations based on this document.
