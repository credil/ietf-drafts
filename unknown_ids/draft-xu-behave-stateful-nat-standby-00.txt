Internet-Draft        Redundancy and Load Balancing          June 2009 
                        Mechanism for Stateful NAT 

    
1. Introduction 

   Network Address Translation (NAT) has been used as an efficient way 
   to delay IPv4 address exhaustion and been deemed as a major 
   mechanism for IPv4/IPv6 transition and coexistence. In the Large 
   Scale NAT (LSN) scenarios as described in some proposals, e.g., 
   [NAT444], [DS-Lite] and [NAT64], the LSN routers are deployed in 
   large-scale networks (e.g., ISP networks, campus networks or 
   enterprise networks) and serve a huge amount of users. Hence 
   redundancy and/or load-balancing capabilities are strongly desired 
   for these LSN routers in order to provide high availability services 
   to users. However, a failure of stateful NAT, which maintains states 
   per session, would cause interruption of those sessions. 

   In this document, we describe some redundancy and/or load balancing 
   mechanisms for stateful NAT, including IPv4->IPv4 NAT, IPv4->IPv6 
   NAT and IPv6->IPv4 NAT. Note that stateless NAT is out of the scope 
   of this document. Unless mentioned otherwise, NAT and LSN throughout 
   this document will pertain to stateful NAT and stateful LSN 
   separately. 

2. Terminology 

   The majority of terms used in this document are borrowed almost as 
   is from [RFC2633], the following are some terms specific to this 
   document. 

   LSN (Large-Scale NAT): a NAT device placed at the border between 
   large-scale user networks (e.g., ISP network, enterprise network, or 
   campus network) and the Internet. 

   LSN internal address realm (internal realm for short): a realm where 
   the communication initiators (e.g., a client in the client/server 
   application) are located. For IPv4->IPv4 NAT, the internal realm 
   refers to the private networks, as opposed to the IPv4 Internet. For 
   IPv6->IPv4 NAT, the internal realm means IPv6 network or IPv6 
   Internet. For IPv4->IPv6 NAT, the internal realm refers to IPv4 
   network or IPv4 Internet. Accordingly, the hosts located in the 
   internal realm are called internal hosts, and the addresses used in 
   the internal realm are called internal addresses. 

   LSN external address realm (external realm for short): a realm where 
   the communication responders (e.g., a server in the client/server 
   application) are located. For IPv4->IPv4 NAT, the external realm 
   refers to the IPv4 Internet. For IPv6->IPv4 NAT, the external realm

Internet-Draft        Redundancy and Load Balancing          June 2009 
                        Mechanism for Stateful NAT 

   means the IPv4 Internet or IPv4 network. For IPv4->IPv6 NAT, the 
   external realm refers to the IPv6 Internet or IPv6 network. 
   Accordingly, the hosts located in the external realm are called 
   external hosts, and the addresses used in the external realm are 
   called external addresses. 

   Internal address pool: an address pool used for assigning internal 
   addresses for the external hosts. Note that this address pool is 
   specific to IPv4->IPv6 NAT and IPv6->IPv4 NAT. For IPv4->IPv6 NAT, 
   the IPv4 address pool used for assigning internal IPv4 addresses for 
   external IPv6 hosts is the internal address pool. For IPv6->IPv4 NAT, 
   the prefix64 used for synthesizing internal IPv6 addresses for 
   external IPv4 hosts could be looked as a special internal address 
   pool. 

   External address pool: an address pool used for assigning external 
   addresses for the internal hosts. For IPv4->IPv4 NAT and IPv6->IPv4 
   NAT, the IPv4 address pool is the external address pool. For IPv4-
   >IPv6 NAT, the prefix64 could be looked as a special external IPv6 
   address pool from which synthesized IPv6 addresses are assigned to 
   internal IPv4 hosts. 

   CPE (Customer Premises Equipment): a router in front of internal 
   hosts.  

   Prefix64: an IPv6 prefix used for synthesizing IPv6 addresses for 
   the IPv4 hosts. See [Prefix64] for more details.

Internet-Draft        Redundancy and Load Balancing          June 2009 
                        Mechanism for Stateful NAT 

   In a typical operational scenario as illustrated in Figure 1, two 
   NAT routers are usually deployed for redundancy and/or load 
   balancing purposes. Hence we will describe the corresponding 
   mechanisms based on this scenario. Note that these mechanisms are 
   also suitable in the scenarios in which more than two NAT routers 
   are used.  

   Due to the fact that the redundancy and load-balancing mechanisms 
   for IPv4->IPv4 NAT, IPv4->IPv6 NAT and IPv6->IPv4 NAT are almost the 
   same except for the routes towards the external realm advertised 
   into the internal realm by the NAT routers, e.g., a route to the 
   prefix64 in the case of IPv6->IPv4 NAT, a route to the IPv4 Internet 
   (in [NAT444]) or the tunnel concentrator (in [DS-Lite]) in the case 
   of IPv4->IPv4 NAT, and a route to the IPv4 address pool in IPv4-
   >IPv6 NAT, we will try to describe these mechanisms in general. 

4. Redundancy Mechanisms 

   The basic idea of NAT redundancy is to make two NAT routers function 
   as a redundancy group, and select one as the Master and the other as 
   the Backup through some election protocol (see section 6) or 
   manually configuration. In normal case, the packets between the 
   internal realm and the external realm traverse via the Master. Once 
   the Master fails, the Backup takes over the translation role.  

   There are two redundancy mechanisms: a cold standby mechanism and a 
   hot standby mechanism. The goal of the cold standby mechanism is to 
   keep the NAT failover transparent to the communicating internal 
   hosts. In contrast, the purpose of the hot standby mechanism is to 
   remain the established sessions continuous during the NAT failover. 
   The following sections will describe them separately. 

4.1. Cold Standby Mechanism 

   To achieve cold standby, the internal addresses for external hosts 
   (as communication responders) should be remained despite the NAT 
   failover. In IPv4->IPv4 NAT, the external hosts' internal addresses 
   are the same as their external addresses, so the above requirement 
   can be met naturally. In IPv6->IPv4 NAT, NAT routers belonging to a 
   redundancy group should be configured with an identical prefix64. In 
   IPv4->IPv6 NAT, NAT routers in a redundancy group should be 
   configured with an identical IPv4 address pool, besides, the state 
   information should be synchronized among these NAT routers through 
   some state synchronization protocol (see section 7) so as to ensure 
   the Backup, once selected as the current Master, could assign the

Internet-Draft        Redundancy and Load Balancing          June 2009 
                        Mechanism for Stateful NAT 

   communicating IPv6 hosts the same IPv4 addresses as those assigned 
   by the previous Master. 

   Of the NAT routers in a redundancy group each is configured with a 
   different external address pool and announces into the external 
   realm a route to that external address pool. In the cases of IPv4-
   >IPv4 NAT and IPv6->IPv4 NAT, NAT routers each are configured with 
   different external IPv4 address pools without any overlap. Otherwise, 
   the same address or address/port pair, which was assigned to some 
   internal host by the previous Master, may be occasionally assigned 
   to a different internal host by the current Master, this occasion 
   will cause some confusions. For example, the return packets towards 
   host A will be misunderstood by the current Master as those towards 
   host B. In the case of IPv4->IPv6 NAT, each NAT router is configured 
   with a different prefix64. 

   In order to make packets towards the external realm always traverse 
   via the Master, the Master should announce into the internal realm a 
   route towards the external realm. In case the Master and the Backup 
   are specified manually, the Backup should also announce into the 
   internal realm a route towards the external realm to prepare for the 
   takeover. However, in order to ensure the route advertised by the 
   Master, rather than that advertised by the Backup, is selected as 
   the best by the routers in the internal realm despite topology 
   changes, the route advertised by the Backup should be set at higher 
   enough cost or larger granularity (For example, the Backup announces 
   a route to 10.0.0.0/8, while the Master announces two specific 
   routes to 10.0.0.0/9 and 10.128.0.0/9 respectively). Once the 
   connections to the external realm lost, the Master should withdraw 
   the route towards the external realm previously announced. When the 
   Master fails, packets towards the external realm will pass through 
   the Backup. If the Master and the Backup are automatically elected 
   through some election protocol, the Backup would be elected as a new 
   Master when the old Master fails, so it's not necessary for the 
   Backup to make the above route announcement. 

4.2. Hot Standby Mechanism 

   To preserve the established sessions during the failover, in 
   addition to remain the internal addresses for the external hosts 
   unchanged, the external addresses for the internal hosts should also 
   keep unchanged. How to meet the first requirement will not be 
   reiterated since it is the same as that for the cold standby 
   mechanism. To meet the second requirement, NAT routers in a 
   redundancy group should be configured with an identical external 
   address pool and they should assign the same external address for

                        Mechanism for Stateful NAT 

   identical internal hosts. In the case of IPv4->IPv6 NAT, NAT routers 
   should simply be configured with an identical prefix64. For IPv4-
   >IPv4 NAT and IPv6->IPv4 NAT, in addition that the NAT routers are 
   configured with identical IPv4 address pools, the state on the 
   Master should be synchronized to the Backup in a timely fashion. 

   The Master announces into the internal realm a route towards the 
   external realm and announces into the external realm a route towards 
   the external address pool. If the Master and the Backup are 
   specified manually, the Backup should also announce those routes, 
   but with higher enough cost or larger granularity. Once the 
   connections to either the external realm or the internal realm lost, 
   the Master should withdraw the above routes. When the Master fails, 
   the packets towards the external realm will pass through the Backup. 
   If the Master and the Backup are automatically elected through some 
   election protocol, the Backup would be elected as a new Master when 
   the old Master fails, so it's not necessary for the Backup to make 
   the above route announcement. 

5. Load Balancing Mechanisms 

   Based on the above redundancy mechanisms, one can further realize 
   load balancing among a group of NAT routers. The basic idea is to 
   create two redundancy groups (e.g. group A and group B) on these NAT 
   routers, make one router as the Master for group A and the Backup 
   for group B, while make the other as the Master for group B and the 
   Backup for group A. Taking IPv6->IPv4 NAT as an example, NAT routers 
   are configured with two prefix64s (e.g., prefix64-A and prefix64-B) 
   corresponding to two different redundancy group (e.g., group A and 
   group B)separately, and one router is designated as the Master for 
   group A and the Backup for group B, while the other as the Backup 
   for group A and the Master for group B. In this way, the IPv6 
   packets towards the IPv4 external realm are balanced among these NAT 
   routers according to their destination addresses with different 
   prefix64s. 

   For load balancing together with the cold standby, each NAT router 
   could either use the same external address pool or different 
   external address pools corresponding to these redundancy groups. 
   However, the external address pools on different NAT routers 
   shouldn't have any overlap. Otherwise, the same address or 
   address/port pair could be assigned occasionally to different 
   internal hosts. In contrast, for load balancing together with the 
   hot standby, different external address pools should be configured 
   for these redundancy groups. Otherwise, the return packets towards 
   the internal realm may be forwarded to a wrong NAT router.

                        Mechanism for Stateful NAT 

6. Election Protocol Consideration 

   Election protocol is used to automatically elect one from a 
   redundancy group as the Master NAT router and the other as the 
   Backup NAT routers. Once the Master fails, the Backup with the 
   highest priority will take over the Master role after a short delay. 
   The election protocol will also be used to track the connectivity to 
   the external realm and the internal realm. Once connections to the 
   external realm or the internal realm lost, the NAT router is not 
   qualified to the Master and it will withdraw the route towards the 
   external realm announced previously, in the case of hot standby, it 
   should also withdraw the route towards the internal address pool. 

   In fact, one can use the VRRP [RFC2338] directly as the automatic 
   election protocol. In addition, the interface track mechanism can 
   also be used to adjust the priority to influence the election 
   results.  

   If two NAT routers are directly connected via an Ethernet network, 
   the VRRP can run directly on the Ethernet interfaces. Otherwise, 
   some extra configuration or protocol changes need to be implemented. 
   One option is to create conditions for VRRP to run among these 
   routers. For example, we create a VPLS [RFC4761, RFC4762] instance 
   and enable IP functions and run VRRP on those VLAN interfaces which 
   are bound to that VPLS instance. If enabling IP function on those 
   interfaces is not supported, one can use the following trick to 
   realize the same goal, but at a cost of consuming two physical 
   interfaces on each NAT router. The approach is: create a VPLS 
   instance among a set of NAT routers, and on each of them one 
   Ethernet interface is bound to that VPLS instance, and another IP 
   enabled Ethernet interface is locally connected with that interface. 
   Then VRRP can run on those IP enabled Ethernet interfaces which are 
   all connected to that VPLS instance. Another option is to do some 
   change to VRRP so that VRRP neighbors can be configured manually and 
   VRRP messages can be exchanged directly between two neighbors in a 
   unicast fashion. 

7. State Synchronization Protocol Consideration 

   The Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) defined in [RFC2334] 
   could be used as a candidate for state synchronization protocol. 
   Details about the usage and possible modifications will be explored 
   in the next version of this document.
