INTERNET-DRAFT                                        TRILL Use of IS-IS


1. Introduction

   The IETF has standardized the TRILL protocol [RFCtrill], which
   provides transparent Layer 2 forwarding using encapsulation with a
   hop count and link state routing. TRILL provides optimal pair-wise
   forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods
   of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and
   multicast traffic as well as supporting VLANs. Intermediate Systems
   (ISs) implementing TRILL are compatible with IEEE 802.1 customer
   bridges and can incrementally replace such bridges.

   This document, in conjunction with [RFCisisLayer2], specifies the
   data formats and code points for the IS-IS [IS-IS] [RFC1195]
   extensions to support TRILL.



1.1 Conventions used in this document

   The terminology and acronyms defined in [RFCtrill] are used herein
   with the same meaning.

   Additional acronyms used in this document:

      IIH - IS-IS Hello

      IS - Intermediate System (for this document, all relevant
      intermediate systems are RBridges)

      NLPID - Network Layer Protocol Identifier

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. TLV and sub-TLV Extensions to IS-IS for TRILL

   This section, in conjunction with [RFCisisLayer2], specifies the data
   formats and code points for the TLVs and sub-TLVs added to IS-IS to
   support the TRILL standard. Information as to the number of
   occurrences allowed, such as for a TLV in a PDU or set of PDUs or for
   a sub-TLV in a TLV, is provided in Section 6.



2.1 The Group Address TLV

   The Group Address (GADDR) TLV, IS-IS TLV type 142 [TBD], is carried
   only in an LSP PDU and carries sub-TLVs that in turn advertise
   multicast group listeners. Section 2.1.1 below specifies a sub-TLV
   advertising listeners by MAC address. It is anticipated that
   additional sub-TLVS for additional address types such as IP addresses
   will be specified in other documents. The sub-TLVs under GADDR
   constitute a new series of sub-TLV types (see Section 6.2).

   GADDR has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=GADDR-TLV |                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length      |                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       sub-TLVs...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: TLV Type, set to GADDR-TLV 142 [TBD].

   o  Length: variable depending on the sub-TLVs carried.

   o  sub-TLVs: The Group Address TLV value consists of sub-TLVs
      formatted as described in [RFC5305].



2.1.1 The Group MAC Address sub-TLV

   The Group MAC Address (GMAC-ADDR) sub-TLV is sub-TLV type number 1
   within the GADDR TLV. In TRILL, it is used to advertise multicast
   listeners as specified in Section 4.5.5 of [RFCtrill]. It has the
   following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where each group record is of the form:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Num of Sources|                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                   Group Address         (6 bytes)             |

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: GADDR sub-TLV Type, set to 1 (GMAC-ADDR).

   o  Length: Variable, minimum 5.

   o  RESV: Reserved. 4-bit fields that MUST be sent as zero and ignored
      on receipt.

   o  Topology-ID: This field is not used in TRILL, where it is sent as
      zero and ignored on receipt, but is included for use by other
      technologies.

   o  VLAN-ID: This carries the 12-bit VLAN identifier for all
      subsequent MAC addresses in this sub-TLV, or the value zero if no
      VLAN is specified.

   o  Number of Group Records: A 1-byte integer that is the number of
      group records in this sub-TLV.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                        TRILL Use of IS-IS


   o  Group Record: Each group record carries the number of sources.  It
      then has a 48-bit multicast address followed by 48-bit source MAC
      addresses.  If the sources do not fit in a single sub-TLV, the
      same group address may be repeated with different source addresses
      in another sub-TLV of another instance of the Group Address TLV.



2.2 Multi-Topology Aware Port Capability sub-TLVs

   TRILL makes use of the Multi-Topology aware Port Capability (MT-PORT-
   CAP) TLV as specified in [RFCisisLayer2]. The remainder of this
   section specifies the sub-TLVs that TRILL uses the MT-PORT-CAP TLV to
   transport.



2.2.1 The Special VLANs and Flags sub-TLV

   In TRILL, a Special VLANs and Flags (VLAN-Flags) sub-TLV is carried
   in every IIH PDU.  It has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=VLAN Flags|                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length      |                  (1 byte)
   +---------------+---------------+
   |    Port ID                    |  (2 bytes)
   +-------------------------------+
   |     Sender Nickname           |  (2 bytes)
   +--+--+--+--+-------------------+
   |AF|AC|VM|BY|    Outer.VLAN     |  (2 bytes)
   +--+--+--+--+-------------------+
   |TR|R |R |R |    Desig.VLAN     |  (2 bytes)
   +--+--+--+--+-------------------+

   o  Type: sub-TLV Type, set to MT-PORT-CAP VLAN-Flags sub-TLV 1 [TBD].

   o  Length: 8.

   o  Port ID: An ID for the port on which the enclosing TRILL IIH PDU
      is being sent as specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.4.2.

   o  Sender nickname: If the sending IS is holding any nicknames as
      discussed in [RFCtrill] Section 3.7, one MUST be included here.
      Otherwise, the field is set to zero. This field is to support
      intelligent end stations that determine the egress IS (RBridge)
      for unicast data through a directory service or the like and need
      a nickname for their first hop to insert as the ingress nickname
      to correctly format a TRILL encapsulated data frame. See

      [RFCtrill] Section 4.6.2 point #8.

   o  Outer.VLAN: A copy of the 12-bit outer VLAN ID of the TRILL IIH
      frame containing this sub-TLV when that frame was sent, as
      specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.4.5.

   o  Desig.VLAN: The 12-bit ID of the designated VLAN for the link as
      specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.2.4.2.

   o  AF, AC, VM, BY, and TR: These flag bits have the following meaning
      each, if set to one, as specified in the listed section of
      [RFCtrill]:

      AF   4.4.2      Originating IS believes it is Appointed Forwarder
                      for the VLAN and port on which the containing IIH
                      PDU was sent.

      AC   4.9.1      Originating port configured as an access port
                      (TRILL traffic disabled).

      VM   4.4.5      VLAN Mapping detected on this link.

      BY   4.4.2      Bypass pseudonode.

      TR   4.9.1      Originating port configured as a trunk port (end
                      station service disabled).

   o  R: Reserved bit. MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.



2.2.2 Enabled-VLANs sub-TLV

   The optional Enabled-VLANs sub-TLV specifies the VLANs enabled for
   end station service at the port of the originating IS on which the
   Hello was sent as specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.4.2.  It has the
   following format:

   o  Type: sub-TLV Type, set to MT-PORT-CAP Enabled-VLANs sub-TLV 2
      [TBD].

   o  Length: Variable, minimum 3.

   o  RESV: 4 reserved bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on
      receipt.

   o  Start VLAN ID, VLAN bit-map: The third and subsequent bytes of the
      value provide a bit map of enabled VLANs starting at the VLAN ID
      indicated in the lower 12 bits of the first two bytes. The highest
      order bit of the third byte indicates the VLAN equal to the
      starting ID while the lowest order bit of the third byte indicates
      that ID plus 7. Etc.

   If this sub-TLV is present more than once in a Hello PDU, a VLAN is
   enabled for end station service on the port where the Hello was sent
   if this is indicated in any occurrence of this sub-TLV in the Hello.



2.2.3 Appointed Forwarders sub-TLV

   The DRB on a link uses the Appointed Forwarders sub-TLV to inform
   other ISs on the link that they are the designated VLAN-x forwarder
   for one or more ranges of VLAN IDs as specified in Section 4.2.4 of
   [RFCtrill].  It has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=ApptFwrdrs|                          (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length      |                          (1 byte)

   where each appointment is of the form:

   +----------------------------+
   |   Appointee Nickname       |  (2 bytes)
   +----------------------------+
   | RESV |     Start.VLAN      |  (2 bytes)
   +----------------------------+
   | RESV |     End.VLAN        |  (2 bytes)
   +----------------------------+

   o  Type: sub-TLV Type, set to MT-PORT-CAP Appointed Forwarders sub-
      TLV 3 [TBD].

   o  Length: 6*n bytes where there are n appointments.

   o  Appointee Nickname: The nickname of the IS being appointed a
      forwarder.

   o  RESV: 4 bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  Start.VLAN, End.VLAN: These fields are the VLAN IDs of the
      appointment range, inclusive. A VLAN's ID appears as both the
      start and end VLAN to specify that single VLAN. As specified in
      Section 4.4 of [RFCtrill], appointing an IS forwarder on a port
      for a VLAN not enabled on that port has no effect.

   An IS's nickname may occur as appointed forwarder for multiple VLAN
   ranges by occurrences of this sub-TLV within the same or different MT
   Port Capability TLVs within an IIH PDU.



2.3 Sub-TLVs for the Router Capability TLV

   The Router Capability TLV is specified in [RFC4971]. All of the sub-
   sections of this Section 2.3 below specify sub-TLVs that can be
   carried in the Router Capability TLV for TRILL.



2.3.1 The TRILL Version sub-TLV

   The TRILL Version (TRILL-VER) sub-TLV indicates the maximum version
   of the TRILL standard supported. By implication, lower versions are
   also supported. If this sub-TLV is missing, the originating IS only
   supports the base version of the protocol [RFCtrill].

   o  Type: Router Capability sub-TLV Type, set to 5 (TRILL-VER).

   o  Length: 1.

   o  Max-version: Set to maximum version supported.



2.3.2 The Nickname sub-TLV

   The Nickname (NICKNAME) Router Capability sub-TLV carries information
   about the nicknames of the originating IS, along with information
   about its priority to hold those nicknames as specified in [RFCtrill]
   Section 3.7.3. Multiple instances of this sub-TLV may be carried.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

nickname as specified in Section 3.7.3 of [RFCtrill].

   o  Tree Root Priority: This is an unsigned 16-bit integer priority to
be a tree root as specified in Section 4.5 of [RFCtrill].

   o  Nickname: This is an unsigned 16-bit integer as specified in
Section 3.7 of [RFCtrill].



2.3.3 The Trees sub-TLV

   Each IS providing TRILL service uses the TREES sub-TLV to announce
   three numbers related to the computation of distribution trees as
   specified in Section 4.5 of [RFCtrill]. Its format is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type =  TREES  |                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Length       |                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Number of trees to compute    |  (2 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Maximum trees able to compute |  (2 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Number of trees to use        |  (2 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Router Capability sub-TLV Type, set to 7 (TREES).

   o  Length: 6.

   o  Number of trees to compute: An unsigned 16-bit integer as
      specified in Section 4.5 of [RFCtrill].

   o  Maximum trees able to compute: An unsigned 16-bit integer as
      specified in Section 4.5 of [RFCtrill].

   o  Number of trees to use: An unsigned 16-bit integer as specified in
      Section 4.5 of [RFCtrill].



2.3.4 The Tree Identifiers Sub-TLV

   The tree identifiers (TREE-RT-IDs) sub-TLV is an ordered list of
   nicknames.  When originated by the IS that has the highest priority
   tree root, it lists the distribution trees that the other ISs are
   required to compute as specified in Section 4.5 of [RFCtrill].  If
   this information is spread across multiple sub-TLVs, the starting

INTERNET-DRAFT                                        TRILL Use of IS-IS


   tree number is used to allow the ordered lists to be correctly
   concatenated. The sub-TLV format is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=TREE-RT-IDs|                (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length      |                (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Starting Tree Number         |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Nickname (K-th root)      |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Nickname (K+1 - th root)  |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Nickname (...)            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Router Capability sub-TLV Type, set to 8 (TREE-RT-IDs).

   o  Length: 2 + 2*n where n is the number of nicknames listed.

   o  Starting Tree Number: This identifies the starting tree number of
      the nicknames that are trees for the domain.  This is set to 1 for
      the first sub-TLV.  Subsequent sub-TLVs will have the starting
      number of the ordered list.  In the event a tree identifier can be
      computed from two such sub-TLVs and they are different, then it is
      assumed that this is a transient condition that will get cleared.
      During this transient time, such a tree SHOULD NOT be computed
      unless such computation is indicated by all relevant sub-TLVs
      present.

   o  Nickname: The nickname at which a distribution tree is rooted.



2.3.5 The Trees Used Identifiers Sub-TLV

   This Router Capability sub-TLV has the same structure as the Tree
   Identifiers sub-TLV specified in Section 2.3.4.  The only difference
   is that its sub-TLV type is set to 9 [TBD] (TREE-USE-IDs) and the
   trees listed are those that the originating IS wishes to use as
   specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.5.



2.3.6 Interested VLANs and Spanning Tree Roots sub-TLV

   The value of this Router Capability sub-TLV consists of a VLAN range
   and information in common to all of the VLANs in the range for the
   originating IS.  This information consists of flags, a variable


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                        TRILL Use of IS-IS


   length list of spanning tree root bridge IDs, and an appointed
   forwarder status lost counter, all as specified in the sections of
   [RFCtrill] listed with the respective information items below.

   In the set of LSPs originated by an IS, the union of the VLAN ranges
   in all occurrences of this sub-TLV MUST be precisely the set of VLANs
   for which the originating IS is appointed forwarder on at least one
   port and the VLAN ranges in multiple VLANs sub-TLVs for an IS MUST
   NOT overlap unless the information provided about a VLAN is the same
   in every instance. However, as a transient state these conditions may
   be violated. If a VLAN is not listed in any INT-VLAN sub-TLV for an
   IS, that IS is assumed to be uninterested in receiving traffic for
   that VLAN. If a VLAN appears in more than one INT-VLAN sub-TLV for an
   IS with different information in the different instances, the
   following apply:
      If those sub-TLVs provide different nicknames it is unspecified
         which nickname takes precedence,
      The largest appointed forwarder status lost counter is used,
      The originating IS is assumed to be attached to a multicast IPv4
         router for that VLAN if any of the INT-VLAN sub-TLVs assert
         that it is so connected and similarly for IPv6 multicast router
         attachment, and
      The root bridge lists from all of the instances of the VLAN for
         the originating IS are merged.

   To minimize such occurrences, wherever possible, an implementation
   SHOULD advertise the update to a interested VLAN and spanning tree
   roots sub-TLV in the same LSP fragment as the advertisement that it
   replaces.  Where this is not possible, the two affected LSP fragments
   should be flooded as an atomic action. An IS that receives an update
   to an existing interested VLAN and spanning tree roots sub-TLV can
   minimize the potential disruption associated with the update by
   employing a hold-down timer prior to processing the update so as to
   allow for the receipt of multiple LSP fragments associated with the
   same update prior to beginning processing.

   The sub-TLV layout is as follows:

   o  Type: Router Capability sub-TLV Type, set to 10 (INT-VLAN).

   o  Length: 10 + 6*n where n is the number of root bridge IDs.

   o  Nickname: As specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.2.4.4, this field
      may be used to associate a nickname held by the originating IS
      with the VLAN range indicated. When not so used, it is set to
      zero.

   o  Interested VLANS: The Interested VLANs field is formatted as shown
      below.

        0    1    2    3     4 - 15      16 - 19     20 - 31

      | M4 | M6 |  R |  R | VLAN.start |   RESV   |  VLAN.end  |
      +----+----+----+----+------------+----------+------------+

      -  M4, M6: These bits indicate, respectively, that there is an
         IPv4 or IPv6 multicast router on a link for which the
         originating IS is appointed forwarder for every VLAN in the
         indicated range as specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.2.4.4 item
         5.1.

      -  R, RESV: These reserved bits MUST be sent as zero and are
         ignored on receipt.

      -  VLAN.start and VLAN.end: This VLAN ID range is inclusive.  A
         range of one VLAN ID is indicated by setting them both to that
         VLAN ID value.

   o  Appointed Forwarder Status Lost Counter: This is a count of how
      many times a port that was appointed forwarder for the VLANs in
      the range given has lost the status of being an appointed
      forwarder as discussed in Section 4.8.3 of [RFCtrill]. It is
      initialized to zero at an IS when the LSP sequence number is
      initialized. No special action need be taken at rollover, the

      counter just wraps around.

   o  Root Bridges: The list of zero or more spanning tree root bridge
      IDs is the set of root bridge IDs seen for all ports for which the
      IS is appointed forwarder for the VLANs in the specified range as
      discussed in [RFCtrill] Section 4.9.3.2. While, of course, only
      one spanning tree root could be seen on any particular port, there
      may be multiple ports in the same VLAN connected to differed
      bridged LANs with different spanning tree roots.

   An INT-VLAN sub-TLV asserts that the information provided (multicast
   router attachment, appointed forwarder status lost counter, and root
   bridges), is the same for all VLANs in the range give. If this is not
   the case, the range MUST be split into subranges meeting this
   criteria.  It is always safe to use sub-TLVs with a "range" of one
   VLAN ID but this may be too verbose.



2.3.7 The VLAN Group sub-TLV

   The VLAN Group Router Capability sub-TLV consists of two or more VLAN
   IDs as specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.8.4. This sub-TLV indicates
   that shared VLAN learning is occurring at the announcing IS between
   the listed VLANs. It is structured as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=VLAN-GROUP|                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length      |                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | RESV  |  Primary VLAN ID      |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | RESV  |  Secondary VLAN ID    |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  more Secondary VLAN IDs ...     (2 bytes each)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Router Capability sub-TLV Type, set to 11 (VLAN-GROUP).

   o  Length: 4 + 2*n, where n may be 0.

   o  RESV: a 4-bit field that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on
      receipt.

   o  Primary VLAN-ID: This identifies the primary VLAN-ID.

   o  Secondary VLAN-ID: This identifies a secondary VLAN in the VLAN
      Group.

2.4 MTU sub-TLV of the Extended Reachability TLV

   The MTU sub-TLV is used to optionally announce the MTU of a link as
   specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.2.4.4. It occurs within the
   Extended Reachability TLV (type #22).

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type = MTU    |                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Length      |                  (1 byte)

   |F|  Reserved   |                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |               MTU             |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Extended Reachability sub-TLV Type, set to MTU sub-TLV 6
      [TBD].

   o  Length: 3.

   o  F: Failed. This bit is a one if MTU testing failed on this link at
      the required campus-wide MTU.

   o  Reserved: 7 bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  MTU: This field is set to the largest successfully tested MTU size
      for this link, or zero if it has not been tested, as specified in
      Section 4.3.2 of [RFCtrill].



2.5 TRILL Neighbor TLV

   The TRILL Neighbor TLV is used in TRILL IIH PDUs (see Section 4.1
   below) in place of the IS Neighbor TLV, as specified in Section
   4.4.2.1 of [RFCtrill] and [RFCadj]. The structure of the TRILL
   Neighbor TLV is as follows:

   The information present for each neighbor is as follows:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |F|  RESV       |                (1 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       MTU                   |  (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   MAC Address                                       | (6 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: TLV Type, set to TRILL Neighbor TLV 145 [TBD].

   o  Length: 1 + 9*n, where n is the number of neighbor records.

   o  S: Smallest flag.  If this bit is a one, then the list of
      neighbors includes the neighbor with the smallest MAC address.

   o  L: Largest flag.  If this bit is a one, then the list of neighbors
      includes the neighbor with the largest MAC address.

   o  RESV: These seven bits are reserved for future use and MUST be set
      to zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

   o  F: failed.  This bit is a one if MTU testing to this neighbor
      failed at the required campus-wide MTU (see [RFCtrill] Section
      4.3.1).

   o  MTU: This field is set to the largest successfully tested MTU size
      for this neighbor or zero if it has not been tested.

   o  MAC Address: The MAC address of the neighbor as in the IS Neighbor
      TLV (#6).

   As specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.4.2.1 and [RFCadj], all MAC
   address may fit into one TLV, in which case both the S and L flags
   would be set to one in that TLV. Otherwise, the highest MAC address

   in a TRILL Neighbor TLV with the L flag zero will also appear as a
   MAC address in some other TRILL Neighbor TLV (possibly in a different
   TRILL IIH PDU). And the lowest MAC address in a TRILL Neighbor TLV
   with the S flag zero will also appear in some other TRILL Neighbor
   TLV (possibly in a different TRILL IIH PDU). If an RBridge believes
   it has no neighbors, its MUST send an empty TRILL Neighbor TLV, which
   will have both the S and L bits on.

3. The MTU PDUs

   Two PDUs are added to IS-IS, the MTU-probe and MTU-ack PDUs.  They
   are used to optionally determine the MTU on a link between ISs as
   specified in [RFCtrill] Section 4.3.2.

   The MTU PDUs have the IS-IS PDU common header (up through the Maximum
   Area Addresses byte) with two new PDU Type numbers, one each, as
   listed in Section 6.  They also have a 20-byte common fixed MTU PDU
   header as shown below.

      +------------+
      | PDU Length |                            (2 bytes)
      +------------+-------------------------+
      |   Probe ID                           |  (6 bytes)
      +--------------------------------------+
      |   Probe Source ID                    |  (6 bytes)
      +--------------------------------------+
      |   Ack Source ID                      |  (6 bytes)
      +--------------------------------------+

   As with other IS-IS PDUs, the PDU length gives the length of the
   entire IS-IS packet starting with and including the IS-IS common
   header.

   The Probe ID field is an arbitrary 48-bit quantity set by the IS
   issuing an MTU-probe and copied by the responding IS into the
   corresponding MTU-ack.  For example, an IS creating an MTU-probe
   could compose this quantity from a port identifier and probe sequence
   number relative to that port.

   The Probe Source ID is set by an IS issuing an MTU-probe to its
   System ID and copied by the responding IS into the corresponding MTU-
   ack.

   The Ack Source ID is set to zero in MTU-probe PDUs.  An IS issuing an
   MTU-ack sets this field to its System ID.

   The TLV area follows the MTU PDU header area.  This area MAY contain
   an Authentication TLV and MUST be padded to the exact size being
   tested with the Padding TLV. Since the minimum size of the Padding
   TLV is 2 bytes, it would be impossible to pad to exact size if the
   total length of the required information bearing fixed fields and
   TLVs added up to 1 byte less than the desired length; however, the
   length of the fixed fields and substantive TLVs for MTU PDUs will be
   quite small compared with their minimum length (minimum 1470 byte MTU
   on an 802.3 link for example), so this will not be a problem.

4. Use of Existing PDUs and TLVs

   The sub-sections below provide details of TRILL use of existing PDUs
   and TLVs.



4.1 TRILL IIH PDUs

   The TRILL IIH PDU is the variation of the LAN IIH PDU used by the
   TRILL protocol. Section 4.4 of the TRILL standard [RFCtrill]
   specifies the contents of the TRILL IIH and how its use differs in
   TRILL from Layer 3 LAN IIH PDU use. The adjacency state machinery for
   TRILL neighbors is specified in Section 4.4 of [RFCtrill] and in
   [RFCadj].

   In a TRILL IIH PDU the IS-IS Common Header and the fixed PDU Header
   are the same as a Level 1 LAN IIH PDU. The Maximum Area Addresses
   octet in the Common Header MUST be set to 0x01.

   The IS-IS Neighbor TLV (#6) is not used in a TRILL IIH and is ignored
   if it appears there.  Instead, TRILL IIH PDUs use the TRILL Neighbor
   TLV (see Section 2.6).



4.2 Area Address

   TRILL uses a fixed zero Area Address as specified in [RFCtrill]
   Section 4.2.3. This is encoded in a four byte Area Address TLV (TLV
   #1) as follows:

          +--------------------------+--------------------------+
          | 0x01 (Area Address Type) | 0x02 (Length of Value)   |
          +--------------------------+--------------------------+
          | 0x01 (Length of Address) | 0x00 (zero Area Address) |
          +--------------------------+--------------------------+



4.3 Protocols Supported

   NLPID 0xC0 has been assigned to TRILL [RFCnlpid]. A Protocols
   Supported TLV (#129, [RFC1195]) including that value MUST appear in
   TRILL IIH PDUs and fragment zero LSP PDUs.

   This document creates two new IS-IS PDUs, namely the MTU-PROBE-PDU,
   and MTU-ACK-PDU, as described in Section 3.  IANA will assign new PDU
   types to these PDUs and reflect them in the PDU registry. [suggested
   values below]

      MTU-PROBE-PDU     Level-1 PDU Number: 23
      MTU-ACK-PDU       Level-1 PDU Number: 28

   This document specifies two new IS-IS TLV types, namely the Group
   Address TLV (GADDR, type 142) and the TRILL Neighbor TLV (type 145),
   that will be reflected in the IS-IS TLV code-point registry. The PDUs
   in which these TLVs are permitted for TRILL is shown in the table
   below along with the section of this document where they are
   discussed. The final "NUMBER" column indicates the permitted number
   of occurrences of the TLV in their PDU, or set of PDUs in the case of
   LSP, which in these two cases is "*" indicating that the TLV MAY
   occur 0, 1, or more times.

                          Section TLV# IIH  LSP  SNP  NUMBER
      GADDR-TLV             2.1    142   -    X   -     *
      TRILL Neighbor TLV    2.5    145   X    -   -     *

   This document specifies eleven new sub-TLVs from existing sub-TLV
   sequences, namely VLAN-FLAGS, Enabled-VLANs, AppointedFwrdrs, TRILL
   Version (TRILL-VER), Nickname, TREES, TREE-RT-IDs, TREE-USE-IDs, INT-
   VLAN, VLAN-GROUP, and MTU. The TLVs in which these sub-TLVs occur are
   shown in the table below along with the section of this document
   where they are discussed.  The final "NUM" column indicates the
   permitted number of occurrences of the sub-TLV cumulatively within
   all occurrences of their TLV in that TLV's carrying PDU (or set of
   PDUs in the case of LSP), as follows:

      0-1 = MAY occur zero or one times. If it occurs more than once,
            results are unspecified.
       1  = MUST occur exactly once. If absent, the PDU is ignored.  If
            it occurs more than once, results are unspecified.
       *  = MAY occur 0, 1, or more times.

6.2 New Sub-Registry Created and Its Initial Contents

   This document creates a new sub-TLV IS-IS sub-registry for sub-TLVs
   within the Group Address (GADDR) TLV and specifies an initial sub-TLV
   within that registry, namely Group MAC Address (GMAC-ADDR), sub-TLV
   #1. The GMAV-ADDR sub-TLV may occur 0, 1, or more times in a GADDR
   TLV.

   The assignment of additional sub-TLV type values in the Group Address
   TLV requires IETF Review as specified in [RFC5226] except that types
   values 0x00 and 0xFF require an IETF Standards action for assignment.

7. Security Considerations

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see [RFCtrill].

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS. IS-IS security
   may be used to secure the IS-IS messages discussed here. See
   [RFC5304] and [RFC5310].
