    <t>
      Peer-to-peer traffic optimization techniques that aim at
      improving locality in the peer selection process have attracted
      great interest in the research community and have been subject
      of much discussion.  Some of this discussion has produced
      controversial myths, some rooted in reality while others remain
      unfounded. This document evaluates the most prominent myths
      attributed to P2P optimization techniques by referencing the
      most relevant study (or studies) that have addressed facts
      pertaining to the myth. Using these studies, we hope to either
      confirm or refute each specific myth.

  <section title='Introduction'>
    <t>
      Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used for file-sharing, streaming
      and realtime communications exchange large amounts of data in
      connections established among the peers themselves and are
      responsible for an important part of the Internet traffic.
      Since applications have generally no knowledge of the underlying
      network topology, the traffic they generate is frequent cause of
      congestions in inter-domain links and significantly contributes
      to the raising of transit costs paid by network operators and
      Internet Service Providers (ISP).
    </t>
    <t>
      One approach to reduce congestions and transit costs caused by
      P2P applications consists of enhancing the peer selection
      process with the introduction of proximity information.  This
      allows the peers to identify the topologically closer resource
      among all the instances of the resources they are looking for.
      Several solutions following such an approach have recently been
      proposed <xref target='Choffnes'/> <xref target='Aggarwal'/>
      <xref target='Xie'/>, some of which are now being considered for
      standardization in the IETF <xref target='ALTO'/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Despite extensive research based on simulations and field
      trials, it is hard to predict how proposed solutions would
      perform in a real-world systems made of millions of peers.  For
      this reason, possible effects and side-effects of optimization
      techniques based on P2P traffic localization have been a matter
      of frequent debate.  This document describes some of the most
      interesting effects, referencing relevant studies which have
      addressed them and trying to determine whether and in what
      measure they are likely to happen.
    </t>
    <t>
      Each possible effect -- or Myth -- is examined in three phases:

      <list style='symbols'>
        <t>
          Facts: in which a list of relevant data is presented,
          usually collected from simulations or field trials;
        </t>
        <t>
          Discussion: in which the reasons for and against the myth
          are discussed based on the facts previously listed;
        </t>
        <t>
          Conclusions: in which the authors try to epress a reasonable
          measure of the plausibility of the myth.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
      This document at the current stage is little more than a
      strawman.  With the help of the IRTF community, the authors
      would like to improve it, in the number of the Facts, in the
      quality of the Discussion and, particularly, in the
      trustworthiness of the Conclusions.

  <section title='Definitions'>
    <t>
      Terminology defined in <xref target='RFC5693'/> is reused here;
      other definitions should be consistent with it.
    </t>
    <section title='Seeder'>
      <t>
        A peer that has a complete copy of the content it is sharing,
        and still offers it for upload. The term "seeder" is adopted
        from BitTorrent terminology and is used in this document to
        indicate upload-only peers also in other kinds of P2P
        applications.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Leecher'>
      <t>
        A peer that has not yet completed the download of a specific
        content (but usually has already started offering for upload
        the part it is in possession of). The term "leecher" is
        adopted from BitTorrent terminology and is used in this
        document to indicate peers that are both uploading and
        downloading, also in other kinds of P2P applications.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Swarm'>
      <t>
        The group of peers that are uploading and/or downloading
        pieces of the same content.  The term "swarm" is commonly used
        in BitTorrent, to indicate all seeders and leechers exchanging
        chuncks of a particular file; however, in this document it is
        used more generally, for example, in the case of P2P streaming
        applications, to refer to all peers receiving and/or
        transmitting the same media stream.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Tit-for-tat'>
      <t>
        A content exchange strategy where the amount of data sent by a
        leecher to another leecher is roughly equal to the amount of
        data received from it.  P2P applications, most notably
        BitTorrent, adopt such an approach to maximize resources
        shared by the users.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Surplus Mode'>
      <t>
        The status of a swarm where the upload capacity exceeds the
        download demand. A swarm in surplus mode is often referred to
        as "well seeded".
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Transit'>
      <t>
        The service through which a network can exchange IP packets
        with all other networks it is not directly connected to. The
        transit service is always regulated by a contract, according
        to which the custumer (i.e. a network operator or an ISP) pays
        the transit provider per amount of data exchanged.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Peering'>
      <t>
        The direct interconnection between two separate networks for
        the purpose of exchanging traffic without recurring to a
        transit provider. Peering is usually regulated by agreements
        taking in account the amount of traffic generated by each
        party in each direction.
      </t>
    </section>
<!--
    <section title='Backhaul'>
      <t>
        The links connecting the backbone (i.e. the core) to the edges

      <t>
        Ostensibly, the increase in application performance is the
        main reason for the consideration of P2P traffic localization
        techniques in academia and industry.  The expected increase
        depends on the specific application: file sharing applications
        witness an increase in the download rate, realtime
        communication applications observe lower delay and jitter, and
        streaming applications can benefit by a high constant bitrate.

          It seems that traffic localization techniques often cause an
          improvement in application performance.  However, it must be
          noted that such beneficial effects heavily depend on the
          network infrastructures.  In some cases, for example in
          networks with relatively low uplink bandwidth, localization
          seems to be useless if not harmful.  Also, beneficial
          effects depend on the swarm size; imposing locality when
          only a small set of local peers are available may even
          decrease download performance for local peers.

          Mathematically, average uplink traffic remains the same as

          localization may lead to local low-bandwiwth leechers
          connecting to each other instead of trying the external
          seeders. Even if such a phenomenon has not been observed in
          simulations and field trials, it could occur to applications
          that use localization as the only means for optimization
          when some content becomes popular in different areas at

    <section title='Impacts on Peering Agreements'
             anchor='peering'>
      <t>
        Peering agreements are usually established on a reciprocity
        basis, assuming that the amount of data sent and received by
        each party is roughly the same (or, in case of asymmetric
        traffic volumes, a compensation fee is paid by the party which
        would otherwise obtain the most gain). P2P traffic
        localization techniques aim at reducing cross-domain traffic
        and thus might also impact peering agreements.
      </t>

      <section title='Facts'>
        <t>
          No significant publications, simulations or trials have
          tried to understand how traffic localization techniques can
          influence factors that rule how peering agreements are
          established and maintained.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Discussion'>
        <t>
          This is a key topic for network operators and ISPs, and
          certainly deserves to be analyzed more accurately. Some
          random thoughts follow.
        </t>
        <t>
          It seems reasonable to expect different effects depending on
          the kinds of agreements. For example:

          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              ISPs with different customer bases: the ISP whose
              customers generate more P2P traffic can achieve a
              greater reduction of cross-domain traffic and thus could
              probably be in a position to re-negotiate the contract
              ruling the peering agreement;
            </t>
            <t>
              ISPs with similar customer bases:

              <list style='symbols'>
                <t>
                  ISPs with different access technologies: customers
                  of the ISP which provides higher bandwidth -- and,
                  in particular, higher uplink bandwidth -- will have
                  more incentives for keeping their P2P traffic
                  local. Consequently, the ISP with a better
                  infrastructure will be able to achieve a greater
                  reduction in cross-domain traffic and will be
                  probably in a position to re-negotiate the peering
                  agreement;
                </t>
                <t>
                  ISPs with similar access technologies: both ISPs
                  would achieve roughly the same reduction in
                  cross-domain traffic and thus the conditions under
                  which the peering agreement had been established
                  would not change much.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          As a consequence of the reasoning above, it seems reasonable
          to expect that the simple fact that one ISP starts
          localizing its P2P traffic will be a strong incentive for
          the ISPs it peers with to do that as well.
        </t>
        <t>
          It's worth noting that traffic manipulation techniques have
          been reportedly used by ISPs to obtain peering agreements
          <xref target='Norton'/> with larger ISPs. One of the most
          used technique involves injecting forged traffic into the
          target ISP's network, in order to increase its transit
          costs. Such a techniques aims at increasing the relevance of
          the source ISP in the target's transit bill and thus
          motivate the latter to sign a peering agreement. However,
          traffic injection is exclusively unidirectional and easy to

          were used to direct P2P requests toward the target network,
          the resulting traffic would appear fully legitimate and,
          since in popular applications that follow the tit-for-tat
          approach peers tend to upload to the peers they download
          from, in many cases also bi-directional.

    <section title='Impacts on Transit'
             anchor='transit'>
      <t>
        One of the main goals of P2P traffic localization techniques
        is to allow ISPs to keep local a part of the traffic generated
        by their customers and thus save on transit costs. However,
        similar techniques based on de-localization rather than
        localization may be used by those ISP that are also transit
        providers to artificially increase the amount of data
        exchanged with networks they provide transit to (i.e. pushing
        the peers run by their customers to establish connections with
        peers in the networks that pay them for transit).
      </t>

      <section title='Facts'>
        <t>
          No significant publications, simulations or trials have
          tried to study effects of traffic localization techniques on
          the dynamics of transit provision economics.
        </t>

      <section title='Discussion'>
        <t>
          It is actually very hard to predict how the economics of
          transit provision would be affected by the tricks some
          transit providers could play on their customers making use
          of P2P traffic localization -- or, in this particular case,
          de-localization -- techniques. This is also a key topic for
          ISPs, definitely worth an accurate investigation.

          that, at the end of the day, no economic factor, no matter

        Peer selection techniques based on locality information are
        certainly beneficial in areas where the density of peers is
        high enough, but may cause damages otherwise. Some studies
        have tried to understand to what extent locality can be pushed
        without damaging peers in isolated parts of the network.

          It seems reasonable to expect that excessive traffic
          localization will cause some degree of deterioration in P2P
          swarms based on the tit-for-tat approach, and the damages of
          such deterioration will likely affect most users in networks
          with lower density of peers.  However, while <xref
          target='LeBlond'/> shows that BitTorrent is extremely
          robust, the level of tolerance to locality for different P2P
          algorithms should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

    <section title='Improved P2P Caching'

      <t>
        P2P caching has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce
        cross-domain as well as uplink P2P traffic. Since the cache
        servers ultimately act as seeders, a cache-aware localization
        service would allow a seamless integration of a caching
        infrastructure with P2P applications <xref

        <t>
          P2P Caching may be beneficial for both ISPs and network
          users, and locality-based optimizations may help the ISP to
          direct the peers towards caches. Anyway it is hard to figure
          at this point in time if the positive effects of
          localization will make caching superfluous or not
          economically justifiable for the ISP.
