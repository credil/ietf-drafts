Internet-Draft        LDP extensions for TP PW OAM          October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a procedure for the configuration of the PW
   VCCV BFD OAM mechanism through LDP extensions.  As the other MPLS-TP
   PW OAM functionalities develop, the procedure may be changed to cover
   them.

   PW VCCV provides end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for PWs,
   and currently supports the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping, LSP
   Ping, and BFD, as described in [RFC5085].  BFD has been chosen to
   cover MPLS-TP CC functionality [base-BFD], and an extended version of
   BFD, as described in [BFD-CV], can accomplish both MPLS-TP CC and CV,
   even signal the AC status.  BFD for VCCV supports two modes of
   encapsulation - either IP/UDP encapsulated (with IP/UDP header) or
   PW-ACH encapsulated (with no IP/UDP header).

   The use of the VCCV control channel provides the context, based on
   the MPLS-PW label, required to bind and bootstrap the BFD session to
   a particular PW (FEC), see the analysis in [tp-oam-analysis].  But in
   order to identify certain extreme cases of misconnectivity and fill
   the requirements that the BFD mechanism MUST be the same for LSP,
   (MS-)PW and Section as well as for LSP Tandem Connection and PW
   Tandem Connection [BFD-CV], BFD still needs to use Discriminator
   values to identify the connection being verified at both ends of the
   PW.

   The discriminator values can be statically configured, or signaled
   via LSP-Ping [[tp-ping-bfd-procedure].  According to the requirements
   in [RFC5654], "The MPLS-TP control plane MUST support the
   configuration and modification of OAM maintenance points as well as
   the activation/deactivation of OAM when the transport path or
   transport service is established or modified", it is naturally to
   extend LDP for setting up BFD or BFD extended version in order to
   configure MPLS-TP CC and CV OAM functionalities during the PW setup.

Internet-Draft        LDP extensions for TP PW OAM          October 2009


3.1.   Operation overviews

   Below, extension to LDP for setting up BFD or BFD extended version
   are defined in order to configure MPLS-TP CC and CV OAM
   functionalities during the PW setup.  PW signaling [RFC4447] defines
   two FECs used to signal PWs.  Of these, FEC Type 129 along with AII
   Type 2 as defined in [RFC5003] fits the identification requirements
   of MPLS-TP, so the current version of this draft just focus on the
   P2P PW (FEC 129) along with AII type 2, P2MP PW will be studied in
   the future.

   The terms "ingress LER" and "egress LER" will not refer in this
   document to any direction in the forwarding plane, but only to the
   LER triggering the PW setup (ingress LER) and the one receiving the
   mapping message (egress LER).

   During the PW signaling, the Control Plane instance in the ingress
   and the egress LER announces the BFD OAM Configuration TLV (inside
   the interface parameters TLV carried by the mapping message,
   following the VCCV parameter field), which includes the "Local
   Discriminator" sub-TLV.

   During the BFD session the ingress LER will use as "MyDiscriminator"
   the value announced in the "Local Discriminator" (mapping message
   sent) and as "YourDiscriminator" the value received in the "Local
   Discriminator" (mapping message received).

   The interval value of BFD control packets both in transmission and
   reception can be negotiated through BFD session itself, so the
   mapping message does not need to carry these time values.  In the
   case BFD extended version should be configured, the ME ID and MEP ID
   do not need to be carried also, for they can be deduced from the
   advertised FEC(129) TLV, as described in the following sections.

3.2.  OAM configuration TLV

   This TLV, specified in [OAM-CONF-FWK], can be used to select which
   OAM technology/method should be used for the PW here.  [RSVP-TE-OAM]
   defines BFD OAM Type and two types of allowed BFD OAM configuration
   TLV, which can also be used for the PW:

   "BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV" which MUST be used for configuring BFD
   for setting up the proactive MPLS-TP CC OAM tool (TLV type = 4).

   "BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV" which MUST be used for configuring
   BFD for setting up the proactive MPLS-TP CC&CV OAM tool (TLV type =
   5).

Internet-Draft        LDP extensions for TP PW OAM          October 2009


   In case the receiving LER does not support the CC&CV functionality,
   they must be silently ignored so as not to affect the setup of PW.

3.3.  BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV

   The BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV (depicted below) is defined for BFD
   OAM specific configuration parameters.  The BFD CC OAM Configuration
   TLV is carried as a sub-TLV of the "OAM Configuration TLV" in the
   "Interface Parameter TLV" in mapping messages, following "the VCCV
   parameter field".

   This new TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries
   sub-TLVs.

   "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV (described in paragraph 3.3.1)

   The BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV May include the following sub-
   TLVs during the mapping message:

   "ICC based ME-IDs" sub-TLV (described in paragraph 3.4.2)

3.4.1.  MEP_IDs

   In order to automatically generate MEP_IDs for MPLS-TP PWs, this
   draft is apt to use the AII associated with that end of the PW.  The
   AII is composed of three fields.  These are the Global_ID, the
   Prefix, and the AC_ID.  The Global_ID used in this document is
   identical to the Global_ID defined in [RFC5003].  The Node_ID is used
   as the Prefix.  The AC_ID is as defined in [RFC5003].  In this way,
   the definition is in accordance with the suggestion in the draft
   [tp-identifier], and there is no need to carry MEP_ID in the mapping
   message.

3.4.2.  ME_IDs

3.4.2.1.  IP Compatible ME-IDs

   In order to automatically generate ME_IDs for MPLS-TP PWs, it is
   convenient to use the corresponding PW identifier.  In an MPLS-TP
   environment, a PW is identified by a set of identifiers which can be
   mapped directly to the elements required by FEC 129 and AII Type 2,
   so there is no need to carry ME_IDs in the mapping messages also.

3.4.2.2.  ICC-based ME_IDs

   ME ID for PWs MAY use the globally unique ICC-based format.  This ME
   ID format MAY be used to identify SME, LME, LTCME, PME and PTCME (as
   defined in [OAM-CONF-FWK]) independently on LER/T-PE addressing
   schemes as well as of the FECs used to identify the PW.

   Length: indicates the total length and it is set to 20.

   ME ID value: the ME ID is a string of up to thirteen characters, each
   character being either alphabetic (i.e.  A-Z) or numeric (i.e. 0-9)
   characters.  It consists of two subfields: the ICC (as defined in
   section 3) followed by a unique ME ID code (UMC).  The UMC MUST be
   unique within the organization identified by the ICC.

   If the receiving LER does not support this ME ID format, it must be
   silently ignored.
