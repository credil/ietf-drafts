Abstract

   In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in
   Applications (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user
   input were mapped into a set of Unicode code points that "make
   sense", which were then encoded and passed to the domain name system
   (DNS).  The current version of IDNA presumes that the input to the
   protocol comes from a set of "permitted" code points, which it then
   encodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do with
   the result of user input.  This document describes the actions taken
   by an implementation between user input and passing permitted code
   points to the new IDNA protocol.


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the operations that can be applied to user
   input in order to get it into a form acceptable by the
   Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol
   [I-D.ietf-idnabis-protocol].  The document describes a general
   implementation procedure for mapping in section 2.

   It should be noted that this document does not specify the behavior
   of a protocol that appears "on the wire".  It describes an operation
   that is to be applied to user input in order to prepare that user
   input for use in an "on the network" protocol.  As unusual as this
   may be for an IETF protocol document, it is a necessary operation to
   maintain interoperability.


2.  The General Procedure

   This section defines a general algorithm that applications ought to
   implement in order to produce Unicode code points that will be valid
   under the IDNA protocol.  An application might implement the full
   mapping as described below, or can choose a different mapping.  In
   fact, an application might want to implement a full mapping that is
   substantially compatible with the original IDNA protocol instead of
   the algorithm given here.

   The general algorithm that an application (or the input method
   provided by an operating system) ought to use is relatively

   straightforward:

   1.  Upper case characters are mapped to their lower case equivalents
       by using the algorithm for mapping Unicode characters.

   2.  Full-width and half-width characters (those defined with
       Decomposition Types <wide> and <narrow>) are mapped to their
       decomposition mappings as shown in the Unicode character
       database.

   3.  All characters are mapped using Unicode Normalization Form C
       (NFC).

   Definitions for the rules in this algorithm can be found in
   [Unicode51].  Specifically:

   o  Unicode Normalization Form C can be found in Annex #15 of
      [Unicode51].

   o  In order to map upper case characters to their lower case
      equivalents (defined in section 3.13 of [Unicode51]), first map
      characters to the "Lowercase_Mapping" property (the "<lower>"
      entry in the second column) in
      <http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/SpecialCasing.txt>, if any.
      Then, map characters to the "Simple_Lowercase_Mapping" property
      (the fourteenth column) in
      <http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt>, if any.

   o  In order to map full-width and half-width characters to their
      decomposition mappings, map any character whose
      "Decomposition_Type" (contained in the first part of of the sixth
      column) in <http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt>
      is either "<wide>" or "<narrow>" to the "Decomposition_Mapping" of
      that character (contained in the second part of the sixth column)
      in <http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt>.

   o  The <http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UCD.html> web page has
      useful descriptions of the contents of these files.

   If this mappings in this document are applied to versions of Unicode
   later than Unicode 5.1, the later versions of the Unicode Standard
   should be consulted.

   These are a minimal set of mappings that an application should
   strongly consider doing.  Of course, there are many others that might
   be done.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document suggests creating mappings that might cause confusion
   for some users while alleviating confusion in other users.  Such
   confusion is not covered in any depth in this document (nor in the
   other IDNA-related documents).
