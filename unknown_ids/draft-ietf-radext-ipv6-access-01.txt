Internet-Draft             RADIUS IPv6 Access                 April 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies new IPv6 RADIUS attributes used to support
   AAA functions of an IPv6 network access.  The IPv6 RADIUS attributes
   already defined in [RFC3162] and [RFC4818] do not define methods for
   assignment of IPv6 addresses to hosts (via DHCPv6) or IPv6 recursive
   DNS servers (via DHCPv6 or [RFC5006]), nor the passing of route
   prefix info (via [RFC4191].  Such Radius attributes are the subject
   of this draft.


2.  Deployment Scenarios

   A common fixed line broadband network scenario is illustrated in
   Figure 1, and is composed of a IP Routing Residential Gateway (RG)
   hosts, a Layer 2 Access-Node (e.g. a DSLAM), one or more Broadband
   Network Gateways (BNG) that are the effectively IP Network Access
   Servers (NASes), and an AAA server.  The RG host is expected to have
   direct connectivity at Layer 2 to both BNGs, with one of the devices
   typically being intended for providing access to a specific operator
   service (e.g.  IP TV) that can be characterized by a known IP subnet.

                                                   +-----+
                                        (Radius)   | AAA |
                                       ...........>|     |
                                       .           +--+--+
                                       v              ^
                                   +---+---+          .
                                   |  BNG  |          .(Radius)
                                   |       |          .
                                   +---+---+          v
                    +------+           |          +---+---+
     +------+       |  AN  |           |          |  BNG  |
     |  RG  +-------|      +-----------+----------+       |
     +------+ (DSL) +------+      (Ethernet)      +-------+

                              Figure 1

   In illustrated deployment scenario the BNGs are assumed to embed a
   DHCPv6 server function that allows them to locally handle any DHCPv6
   requests issued by RG hosts.  This scenario is particularly useful in
   illustrating the possible interaction between RADIUS and DHCPv6,
   however the options defined in this document are not restricted to be
   used only in the presence of such embedded functionality.

   The AAA server is expected to authenticate each RG that typically
   connects by means of PPPoE and to return to the BNG per host

   authorization and network configuration information which, among
   other information, can comprise of: One or more IP addresses
   Recursive DNS servers intended to be used by the host; specific IP
   routes corresponding to service subnets that are then expected to
   assist the RG in selecting the appropriate BNG; an explicit IP
   address that is to be state fully assigned to a given RG host.  The
   method by which the BNG can communicate this information to each host
   is explained in each of the following sub-sections.

2.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more or non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to nodes.  In IPv6, both SLAAC and DHCPv6
   can be used for address assignment.  While SLAAC provides a host with
   a /64 IPv6 prefix from which to construct its address, the host is
   free to construct a 64-bit Interface ID that when concatenated with
   the /64 prefix provides a unique address.  By providing a host only a
   /64 network operators are unaware of the exact IP addresses in use by
   a device.  To contrast SLAAC, DHCPv6 requires a host explicitly
   request non-temporary addresses from a DHCPv6 server permitting an
   operator control over address assignment.  This document specifies a
   new RADIUS attribute for the assignment of non-temporary IPv6
   addresses to a host via DHCPv6.  Other DHCPv6 parameters such as
   preferred and valid address lifetimes are provided for by the NAS and
   not through RADIUS attributes.  As a DHCPv6 client may request an
   address at any time, a RADIUS server may be required to service
   additional RADIUS Access-Requests for a single network access
   session.

2.2.  Recursive DNS Servers

   DHCPv6 provides an option for recursive DNS servers to hosts, as does
   a Router Advertisement supporting the experimental [RFC5006].
   Existing DHCPv4 options only convey DNS as 32-bit IPv4 addresses and
   cannot support a 128-bit IPv6 address.  In the current RADIUS
   specifications there are no IETF/IANA defined attributes for
   recursive DNS and many NAS implement vendor specific attributes
   (e.g.: Ascend-Primary-DNS).  In some operator environments a network
   access session may be configured with a specific set of one or more
   recursive DNS.  This document specifies a new RADIUS attribute to
   convey a list of IPv6 addresses that can be used for a host for
   domain name service.  Best current practice is to configure hosts
   with more than one recursive domain name server, this is achieved in
   the RADIUS environment by returning multiple DNS-Server-IPv6-Address
   options within an Access-Accept.  The NAS shall use the addresses
   returned in the RADIUS DNS-Server-IPv6-Address attribute for the
   DHCPv6 DNS-Servers option [RFC3646], the Router Advertisement
   Recursive DNS Server Option [RFC5006], or both.

2.3.  IPv6 Route Information

   In scenarios where Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   [RFC4862] is used for address assignment, a Router Advertisement is
   multicast with one or more Prefix Information Options with the
   autonomous-bit set to true.  A Prefix Information Option, when used
   for SLAAC, is a /64 prefix to which a host appends its locally-
   generated Interface Id to create a unique 128-bit IPv6 address.
   [RFC3162] currently defines a Framed-IPv6-Prefix which can be used by
   a NAS to advertise on-link prefixes in a Router Advertisement Prefix
   Information Option [RFC4861].  The IPv6 Route Information attribute
   is almost the inverse; it is intended to be used to instruct a host
   connected to the NAS that a specific route is reachable via the NAS/
   router.  [RFC4191] defines an ICMPv6 Route Information Option for
   this purpose, i.e. to convey route information from a router to a
   host.  The Route Information Option is used in environments where
   multiple advertising routers are present.  It directs a host to which
   router each specific route should be the next-hop to.  For each IPv6-
   Prefix-Information attribute, the NAS may advertise a unique
   [RFC4191] Route Information Option.


3.  Attributes

   The fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from left to
   right.

3.1.  Framed-IPv6-Address

   This Attribute indicates an IPv6 Address that is assigned to the
   uplink NAS-facing interface of the user equipment.  It MAY be used in
   Access-Accept packets, and can appear multiple times.  It MAY be used
   in an Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that
   it would prefer these IPv6 address(es), but the server is not
   required to honor the hint.  Since it is assumed that the NAS, when
   necessary, will add a route corresponding to the address it is not
   necessary for the server to also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route
   attribute for the same address.

   This Attribute can be used by DHCPv6 to offer a unique IPv6 address
   or can be used for a-posteriori validation or announcement of an
   autoconfigured address.

   A summary of the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.

   DNS server.  This attribute MAY be included multiple times in Access-
   Accept packets.

   The content of this attribute can be inserted in a Router
   Advertisement as specified in [RFC5006] or mapped to the matching
   DHCPv6 option.

3.3.  Route-IPv6-Information

   This Attribute specifies a prefix (and corresponding route) to be
   authorized for announcement towards the user by the NAS, with the
   reachable by means of routing towards the NAS.  It is used in the
   Access-Accept packet and can appear multiple times.  It may also be
   used in the Access-Request packet.

   A summary of the Route-IPv6-Information attribute format is shown
   below.  The route information option defined in [RFC4191] is captured
   in this and following two attributes.

3.4.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

3.5.  RFC3162 Attribute coexistance

   Syntactically, the Framed-IPv6-Address and the [RFC3162] Framed-IPv6-
   Prefix attributes are identical.  In terms of their intended
   semantics, however as described by this draft the former represents a
   statefully assigned IPv6 address while the latter a prefix intended
   for application on a target NAS interface.  These attributes are
   envisaged to co-exist in Radius messages and thus it is recommended
   that each attribute be used for its intended semantical purpose only.
   A functional substitution of one attribute for the other may however
   be an optional configuration feature of a Radius client and server.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   Since the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from the
   standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling is
   required by Diameter entities.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the use of RADIUS for the purposes of
   authentication, authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled
   networks.  In such networks, the RADIUS protocol may run either over
   IPv4 or over IPv6.  Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS
   protocol apply to the attributes defined in this document.  Since
   IPSEC is natively defined for IPv6, it is expected that running
   RADIUS implementations supporting IPv6 may want to run over IPSEC.
   Where RADIUS is run over IPSEC and where certificates are used for
   authentication, it may be desirable to avoid management of RADIUS
   shared secrets, so as to leverage the improved scalability of public
   key infrastructure.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of three new RADIUS Attribute
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following
   attributes:

   o  Framed-IPv6-Address

   o  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   o  Route-IPv6-Information

   IANA should allocate these numbers from the standard RADIUS
   Attributes space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].
