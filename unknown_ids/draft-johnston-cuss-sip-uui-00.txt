 A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
                                  SIP
                     draft-johnston-cuss-sip-uui-00

Abstract

   The need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User
   Information (UUI) data during session establishment has been
   discussed.  Several approaches to transporting call control User to
   User Information (UUI) data in SIP have been proposed.  As networks
   move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can
   continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to
   interwork with this ISDN service for end-to- end transparency.  This
   document discusses three mechanisms to meet the requirements defined
   in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI document.  A new SIP
   header field which bests meets these requirements is proposed.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC               September 2010


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) using SIP [RFC3261].  Specifically, we discuss a mechanism for
   the transport of general application UUI and also for the transport
   of call control related ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element
   (UU IE) [Q931] and ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter
   [Q763] data in SIP.  UUI is widely used in the PSTN today in contact
   centers and call centers which are transitioning away from ISDN to
   SIP.  This extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints
   implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN services.

   The definition, use cases, requirements, and call flows for SIP call
   control UUI is discussed in [johnston-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  All
   references to requirement numbers (REQ-N) and figure numbers refer to
   this draft.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Possible Mechanisms

   Three possible mechanisms for transporting UUI will be described:
   MIME body, URI parameter, and header field transport.

3.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC2976], was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call
   flows in the previous section show, the information is related to an
   attempt to establish a session and must be passed with the session
   setup request (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or session
   termination requests.  As a result, it is not possible to use INFO in
   these cases.

3.2.  Why Other Protocol Encapsulation UUI Mechanisms are Not Used

   Other protocols have the ability to transport UUI information.  For
   example, consider ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU



Johnston, et al.         Expires March 20, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC               September 2010


   IE) [Q931] and ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter [Q763],
   as discussed in the requirements draft.  In addition, NSS (Narrowband
   Signaling System) [Q1980] is also able to transport UUI information.
   Should one of these protocols be in use, and present in both User
   Agents, then utilizing these other protocols to transport UUI might
   make a lot of sense.  Essentially, this is just adding an additional
   layer in the protocol stack.  SIP is not transporting the UUI, it is
   encapsulating another protocol, and that protocol is transporting the
   UUI.  Once there is a mechanism to transport that other protocol
   using SIP, the UUI transport function is essentially obtained without
   any additional effort or work.

   However, the authors believe that SIP needs to have its own native
   UUI transport mechanism.  It is not reasonable for a SIP UA to have
   to implement another entire protocol (either ISDN or NSS, for
   example) just to get the very simple UUI transport service.  Of
   course, this work does not preclude anyone from using other protocols
   with SIP to transport UUI information.

3.3.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to transport the UUI information as a MIME
   body.  This is in keeping with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in
   which MIME bodies are used to transport ISUP information.  Since the
   INVITE will normally have an SDP message body, the resulting INVITE
   with SDP and UUI will be multipart MIME.  This is not ideal as many
   SIP UAs do not support multipart MIME INVITEs.

   A bigger problem is the insertion of a UUI message body by a redirect
   server or in a REFER.  The body would need to be encoded in the
   Contact URI of the 3xx response or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.
   Currently, no UAs support this capability today, and even defining
   this is problematic.  For example, do all the Content-* header fields
   have to be escaped as well?  What if the escaped Content-Length does
   not agree with the escaped body?

   An example:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
   application/uui&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
   </allOneLine>

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP  Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

   The MIME body approach meets REQs 1-5.  However, it does not meet



Johnston, et al.         Expires March 20, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC               September 2010


   REQ-6 as support for Multipart MIME and escaped bodies in URIs is
   uncommon in SIP UAs.

3.4.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI as a URI parameter
   into the Contact or Refer-To URI.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   An INVITE sent to this Contact URI would contain UUI in the Request-
   URI of the INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that a URI
   parameter carried in a Request-URI will not survive retargeting by a
   proxy as shown in Figure 2 of [johnston-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  That is,
   if the URI is included with an Address of Record instead of a Contact
   URI, the URI parameter in the Reqeuest-URI will not be copied over to
   the Contact URI, resulting in the loss of the information.  As a
   result, this approach does not meet REQ-4.  Note that if this same
   URI was present in a Refer-To header field, the same loss of
   information would occur.

3.5.  Header Field Approach

   Another approach that has been proposed is to use a header field to
   transport the UUI information.  The header field would be included in
   INVITE requests and responses and BYE requests and responses, and
   would pass transparently through proxies.  For redirection, the
   header field would be escaped into the Contact or Refer-To URI.  This
   is commonly supported in UAs due to call transfer use cases.  As a
   result, the header field approach supports REQs 1-7.  In order to
   meet REQ- 8, a SIP feature tag is needed which can be included in
   Supported and Require header fields.

   The Call-Info header field is related to the UUI information.
   However, there are a number of important differences:

   o  Call-Info is typically used for rendering to the user.  While some
      of the UUI information may ultimately be rendered to the user,
      most of the UUI information will be consumed by the end device or
      by an application server.
   o  Call-Info usually contains a URI pointer to the information
      instead of the actual information itself which does not meet
      REQ-5.  It could be possible to use a data URI to carry the UUI
      directly in this header field.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC               September 2010


   o  The use of Call-Info for interworking to and from ISDN networks
      seems problematic.

   Overall, the overloading of the Call-Info header field for carrying
   interworked UUI does not seem like a good idea.  A separate header
   field allows for clear policy and authorization rules to be used.
   For these reasons, a separate header field needs to be defined,
   described here as User-to-User.  For example, here is an example
   User-to-User header field from message F1 in Figure 1 of
   [johnston-cuss-sip-uui-reqs]:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex;purpose=isdn-interwork
    ;content=isdn-uui

   For example, here is an escaped User-to-User header field from the
   redirection response F2 of Figure 3:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex%3Bpurpose%3Disdn-interwork%3B
   content%3Disdn-uui>
   </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE F5 would contain:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex;purpose=isdn-interwork
    ;content=isdn-uui

   An escaped User-to-User header field from the REFER message response
   F1 of Figure 4:

   <allOneLine>
   Refer-To: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex%3Bpurpose%3Disdn-interwork%3B
   content%3Disdn-uui>
   </allOneLine>

   This would result in the INVITE F4 containing:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex;purpose=isdn-interwork
    ;content=isdn-uui


4.  Recommendation

   The recommendation is to define a new SIP header field "User-to-User"
   to transport call control UUI since this mechanism best supports the
   requirements in [johnston-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  There are also



Johnston, et al.         Expires March 20, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC               September 2010


   existing implementations and running code for this header field
   approach.  A SIP feature tag "uui" also needs to be defined so that
   it can be used in Supported and Require header fields to meet REQ-8.

   To help tag and identify the UUI used with this header field,
   "purpose", "content", and "encoding" parameters are defined.  This
   specification only defines encodings of hex and IA5.  Other
   specifications can define other purposes and contents for this header
   field per the requirements of this document.


5.  Syntax for UUI Header Field

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.

       UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
       uui-data    = token
       uui-param   = enc-param | cont-param | purp-param | generic-param
       enc-param   = "encoding=" ("hex" | "IA5" | token)
       cont-param  = "content=" token
       purp-param  = "purpose=" token

   The parameter "encoding=hex" means hexadecimal encoding.  The
   parameter "encoding=IA5" means Internet Alphabet Number 5 encoding,
   also known as ITU-T T.50 [ia5].  If the encoding parameter is not
   present, the default value of "hex" MUST be assumed.  Other encoding
   methods of encoding MAY also be standardized.

   User-to-User header fields with different purpose parameters may be
   present in a request or response.  The number of User-to-User header
   fields which may be present in a request or response is defined for a
   particular purpose (application).  Any size limitations on the UUI
   for a particular purpose must be defined by that purpose.

5.1.  Definition of New Parameter Values

   This specification defines only the values of "hex", "IA5", and for
   the "encoding" parameter.  New values can be defined and added to the
   IANA registry with a standards track RFC, which needs to discuss the
   issues in this section.

   New "encoding" values must reference a common encoding scheme or
   define the exact new encoding scheme.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC               September 2010


   New "content" values must describe the content of the UUI and give
   some example use cases.  The default "encoding" and other allowed
   encoding methods must be defined for this new content.

   New "purpose" values must describe the new purpose and give some
   example use cases.  The default "content" value and other allowed
   contents must be defined for this new purpose.  Any restrictions on
   the size of the UUI data must be described for the new purpose.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Registration of Header Field

   This document defines a new SIP header field named "User-to-User".

   The following row shall be added to the "Header Fields" section of
   the SIP parameter registry:


                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | Header Name      | Compact Form | Reference |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | User-to-User     |              | [RFCXXXX] |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.

6.2.  Registration of Header Field Parameters

   This document defines the parameters for the header field defined in
   the preceding section.  The header field "User-to-User" can contain
   the parameters "encoding", "content", and "purpose".

   The following rows shall be added to the "Header Field Parameters and
   Parameter Values" section of the SIP parameter registry:


   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Header Field     | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | User-to-User     | encoding       | hex               | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | User-to-User     | encoding       | IA5               | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of

   this document.

6.3.  Registration of SIP Option Tag

   This specification registers a new SIP option tag, as per the
   guidelines in Section 27.1 of [RFC3261].

   This document defines the SIP option tag "uui".

   The following row has been added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:

   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name       | Description                              | Reference |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | uui        | This option tag is used to indicate that | [RFCXXXX] |
   |            | a UA supports and understands the        |           |
   |            | User-to-User header field.               |           |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can be exchanged over SIP on a hop-by-hop or
   end-to-end basis.  In some cases, UUI may carry privacy information
   that would require confidentiality and message integrity.  Standard
   SIP security mechanisms, viz., based on TLS, offer these properties
   per-hop.  To preserve multi-hop or end-end confidentiality and
   integrity, S/MIME profile MUST be utilized.  Since the security
   requirements and key management of the UUI information are likely to
   be quite different from the SIP signaling transport, another approach
   would be for the UUI information to be encrypted before being passed
   to SIP for transport.

   Received User-to-User information should only be trusted if it is
   authenticated or if it is received within a trust domain.  For
   example, Spec-T, defined in [RFC3324] could be used to define a trust
   domain.  When utilized by a gateway to map information to or from
   ISDN Q.931 and ISUP Q.763, appropriate policy should be applied based
   on the PSTN trust domain.
