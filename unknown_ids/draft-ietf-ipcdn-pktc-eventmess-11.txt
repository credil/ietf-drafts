1.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
   2580 [RFC2580].

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB         September 2007 
 
 
   A multimedia terminal adapter (MTA) is used to deliver broadband 
   Internet, data, and/or voice access jointly with telephony service 
   to a subscriber's or customer's premises using a cable network 
   infrastructure. A MTA is normally installed at the customer's or 
   subscriber's premises, and it is coupled to a multiple system 
   operator (MSO) using a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) access network. 
    
   A MTA is provisioned by the MSO for broadband Internet, data, and/or 
   voice service. For more information on MTA provisioning refer to 
   [PKT-SP-PROV] and [RFC4682]. MTA devices include one or more 
   endpoints (e.g., telephone ports) which receive call signaling 
   information to establish ring cadence, and codecs used for providing 
   telephony service.  
    
   For more information on call signaling refer to [PKT-SP-MGCP] and 
   [RFC3435].  
    
   For more information on codecs refer to [PKT-SP-CODEC]. 
    
   Given the complexity of such systems it is important that a suitable 
   event management mechanism be defined to allow for effective 
   management. This MIB module provides objects suitable for generation 
   and management of events on the MTA.  
    
3.   Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
   The terms "MIB module" and "information module" are used 
   interchangeably in this memo.  As used here, both terms refer to any 
   of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578]. Some of the terms used in this memo are defined  
   below.  Some additional terms are also defined in the 
   PacketCable(TM) 
   Management Event Mechanism Specification [PKT-SP-MEM1.5] and the  
   PacketCable MTA Device Provisioning Specification [PKT-SP-PROV]. 
    
3.1    PacketCable  
   PacketCable is a CableLabs-led initiative that is aimed at 
   developing interoperable interface specifications for delivering 
   advanced, real-time multimedia services over two-way cable plants. 
    
3.2    IPCableCom 
   IPCableCom is an ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector  
   (ITU-T) project that includes architecture and a series of 
   recommendations that enable the delivery of real time services over 
   the cable television networks using cable modems.

3.3    MTA 
    
   A Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) is a PacketCable or IPCablecom 
   compliant device providing telephony services over a cable or hybrid 
   system used to deliver video signals to a community. It contains an 
   interface to endpoints, a network interface, codecs, and all 
   signaling and encapsulation functions required for Voice over IP 
   transport, call signaling, and Quality of Service signaling. A MTA 
   can be an embedded or a standalone device. An Embedded MTA (E-MTA) 
   is a MTA device containing an embedded Data Over Cable Service 
   Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) Cable Modem. A Standalone MTA  
   (S-MTA) is a MTA device separated from the DOCSIS Cable Modem by 
   non-DOCSIS MAC interface (e.g., Ethernet, USB). 
    
3.4    Endpoint 
   An endpoint or MTA endpoint is a standard RJ-11 telephony physical 
   port located on the MTA and used for attaching the telephone device 
   to the MTA. 
 
    
3.5     MSO  
   Multi-System Operator. A cable company that operates many head-end 
   locations in several cities.  
      
    
3.6    UDP  
   User Datagram Protocol. A connectionless protocol built upon 
   Internet Protocol (IP), as per RFC 768 [RFC768].  
     
    
4.   Overview  
    
   PacketCable, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), 
   and International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication 
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) IPCablecom compliant  
   Multimedia Terminal Adaptors (MTAs) are required to generate 
   management events upon the occurrence of certain operational 
   conditions. For instance, "AC power failure, MTA operational on 
   battery power". The complete set of conditions and the corresponding 
   management events to be generated are specified in [PKT-SP-MEM1.5], 
   [ETSITS101909-22] and [ITU-T-J176], respectively. In addition, the 
   MTA manufacturer is allowed to specify vendor-specific management 
   events. For example, vendor XYZ can specify "Memory read error, 
   terminating process, code: XYZ123".  
    
   When management events are generated, they can either be stored in a 
   local log on the MTA, or transmitted using two possible mechanisms: 
   SNMP and syslog. This is required to be configurable and manageable 
 
 
De Ketelaere/Nechamkin/Channabasappa Expires - March 2008     [Page 4] 
PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB         September 2007 
 
 
   by the management station for each management event (default values 
   can be provided when the events are defined). This Internet-Draft 
   proposes a MIB that can provide for configuration and management of 
   such management events. A means to log the events is provided within 
   the specified MIB module. For syslog as a transport, the necessary 
   information (format, transport etc.) is also specified. For SNMP as 
   a transport, the MIB objects specified in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and 
   SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB as utilized, as specified in [RFC3413]. 
    
   Further, each management event can be uniquely identified using the 
   'Organization ID' and an 'Event ID'. The 'Organization ID' is the 
   enterprise ID of the organization specifying the event (e.g., 4491 
   for CableLabs) and a unique identifier that identifies the event. 
   The 'Event ID' is an identifier that uniquely identifies the event 
   within the 'Organization ID' space. This Internet-Draft does not 
   specify any management events. It only provides a mechanism to 
   manage the storage and transmission of events. 
    
   The EVENT MIB module specified in this document is intended to 
   update the EVENT MIB modules from which it is partly derived: 
     - the PacketCable 1.5 Management Event MIB Specification  
       [PKT-SP-EVEMIB1.5], 
     - the ITU-T IPCablecom management event mechanism MIB requirements 
   [ITU-T-J176]  
    
   Several normative and informative references are used to help define 
   Management Event MIB objects.  As a convention, wherever the 
   requirements are equivalent at the time of the writing, the 
   PacketCable reference is used. However, MTA implementations MUST 
   refer to the corresponding specifications to ensure compliance. 
    
4.1    Structure of the MIB  
    
   The Management Event MIB module is identified by pktcIetfEventMib 
   and is structured into the following sub-trees: 
    
   - pktcEventControl specifies the management information pertinent to 
   control of the device's event generation capabilities.  
    
   - pktcEventThrottle specifies the management information pertinent 
   to throttling the transmission of management events using syslog or 
   SNMP. 
    
   - pktcEventStatus specifies the management information for the 
   device to report status information related to the generated events. 
    
   - pktcEvents specifies the management information for the device to 
   list all the events it is capable of generating. 
    
 
 
De Ketelaere/Nechamkin/Channabasappa Expires - March 2008     [Page 5] 
PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB         September 2007 
 
 
   - pktcEventLog specifies the management information for the device 
   to store the generated events. 
    
   - pktcEventNotifications specifies the management information that 
   defines the SNMP trap and inform messages.  
    
4.2    pktcEventControl  
   The group of objects in this sub-tree provide for three important 
   controls: ability to reset the event logs and event descriptions, 
   syslog configuration and event classes.  
    
   Some highlights are as follows: 
    
   pktcEventReset - this MIB object allows a management station to 
   reset the event logs, the event descriptions, or both. 
    
    
   pktcEventSyslog - this group of MIB objects allow the management 
   station to provide information for transmission of events to a 
   syslog server, such as message formats and transport protocols. 
    
    
   pktcEventClassTable - this MIB table allows for MTAs to classify the 
   management events into different categories, termed 'event classes'. 
   It then allows for common operations to be affected across all the 
   events pertaining to a specific event class. 
    
    
    
4.3    pktcEventThrottle  
   As indicated earlier, the generated events can be stored locally, or 
   transmitted using SNMP, Syslog, or both. However, the management 
   stations receiving such events may wish to control the rate of 
   transmission of such events. This event throttling behavior is 
   provided by the MIB objects in this sub-tree. 
    
   Some highlights are as follows: 
    
   pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus - this MIB object allows for 
   transmissions to be unconstrained, maintained below threshold, 
   stopped at the threshold or inhibited. 
    
   pktcEventThrottleThreshold - this MIB object specifies the throttle, 
   i.e., the number of events over an interval that is considered to be 
   the threshold. 
    
   pktcEventThrottleInterval - this MIB object specifies the interval 
   over which the threshold is calculated.

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB         September 2007 
 
 
    
4.4    pktcEventStatus  
   This sub-tree is designed to provide status information related to 
   event transmissions. It currently contains one MIB object, 
   pktcEventTransmissionStatus, that allows a client to report the 
   status of event transmissions. 
    
    
4.5    pktcEvent 
   This sub-tree is designed to provide a list of all the events that 
   can be generated by an MTA and its associated descriptions. The MIB 
   objects are grouped under the MIB table pktcEventTable. 
    
    
4.6    pktcEventLog 
   This sub-tree is designed to allow the MTA to store all the events 
   that are generated during its operation. The events are stored with 
   information such as the time of the event, its description and 
   related characteristics like severity levels. 
    
    
4.7    pktcEventNotifications 
   This sub-tree specifies the notification information, when MTAs 
   transmit messages using SNMP traps and informs. SNMP traps refer to 
   the SNMPv2-Trap-PDU. SNMPv1 traps are disallowed. 
    
5.   Relationship to Other MIB Modules 
   Some management objects defined in other MIB modules are applicable 
   to an entity implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is assumed 
   that an entity implementing the PKTC-IETF-EVENT-MIB module will also 
   implement the 'interfaces' group of the IF-MIB [RFC2863]. 
    
5.1    MIB modules required for IMPORTS 
   The PKTC-IETF-EVENT-MIB MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI 
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411], 
   SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], 
   SNMP-TARGET-MIB [RFC3413], SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB [RFC3413] and the 
   SYSLOG-TC-MIB [RFCDDD].

               "This MIB object allows a management station to  
               clear the local log of generated events, reset the  
               management event descriptions, or both. 
    
               MTAs generate management events. These events are stored  
               in the MIB table 'pktcEventLogTable'. If a management  
               station needs to clear all the current entries (e.g.,  
               after a troubleshooting operation is complete), it can  
               do so by setting the resetEvLogTable(0) bit to a value  
               of '1'. 
    
               The MTA is pre-configured with the events that it can  
               generate. This is stored in the MIB table  
               'pktcEventTable'. This table also contains the  
               descriptions associated with these events. These  
               descriptions can be modified by a management station.  
               However, if the management station wishes to reset the  
               descriptions, to factory defaults, it can do so by  
               setting the resetEvDescrTable(1) bit to a value of '1'.

               The MTA actions are summarized below: 
    
                 Bit resetEvLogTable(0) set to a value of '1' 
                  - delete all entries in pktcEventLogTable; 
                  - reset the value of pktcEventLogIndex to '0'. 
    
                 Bit resetEvDescrTable(1) set to a value of '1' 
                  - reset the pktcEventTable to the 
                    factory default values. 
    
                 Bits resetEvLogTable(0) and resetEvDescrTable(1) 
                 set to a value of '1' 
                  - perform the above actions as though they were 
                    performed individually (in any order). 
    
                 Setting a reset bit to a value of '0' MUST NOT 
                 result in any action.  
    
               The MTA MUST perform the above actions regardless of  
               persistence (i.e. storage in non-volatile memory). 
    
               The MTA MUST always return a value of '00' when 
               this MIB object is read. 
    
               It is to be noted that the presence of multiple 
               SNMP managers managing the same MTA can result in  
               multi-manager contentions for this MIB object that

               occurrence of this event. Bit local(0) refers to local  
               logging of events, bit sylog(1) refers to the  
               transmission of events using syslog, bit snmpTrap(2)  
               refers to the transmission of events using SNMP Traps 
               (SNMPv2-Trap-PDU) and bit snmpInform(3)refers to the  
               transmission of events using SNMP INFORMs. 
         
               Setting a bit to a value of '1' indicates that the 
               corresponding action will be taken upon occurrence of 
               this event. If none of the bits are set then no action  
               is taken upon occurrence of the event. The success of 
               transmission using syslog and SNMP depends on the  
               MTA configuration. For example, a valid syslog server 
               address is required for syslog message transmission. 
    
               Specification of a management event does not necessarily 
               include the actions to be taken upon its generation,  
               i.e., it does not need to specify if a generated event 
               needs to be transmitted via SNMP, syslog or stored  
               locally. Thus, certain default values are specified,  
               based on the event's severity level specified by the  
               MIB object 'pktcEventSeverityLevel', as follows: 
                   - If the severity level of an event is emergency(0), 
                   alert(1), critical(2) or error(3), set the bits for  
                   local(0), syslog(1) and snmpInform(3) to a value  
                   of '1', and the remaining bits to a value of '0'.  
                   - For an event with any other severity level set 
                   the bits for local(0) and syslog(1) to a value of 
                   of '1', and the rest of the bits to a value of '0'.

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is 
   requested to assign a value for XXX under the mib-2 subtree and to 
   record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the 
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace XXX 
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove 
   this note.

11.    Security Considerations  
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. Security threats include events unreported on 
   errors, redirection of events (deliberately or otherwise) or 
   minimized reporting of errors. Such threats can mask certain 
   misconfiguration attempts and denial of service attacks that can be 
   recognized and thwarted via event reporting. 
    
   MIB objects of significance include: 
   - those that control the event generation, the target syslog address  
   for events and the reporting status, i.e.: 
       pktcEventReset 
       pktcEventSyslogAddressType 
       pktcEventSyslogAddress 
       pktcEventSyslogUdpPort 
        
       pktcEventClassStatus 
    
   - those related to event classes, i.e.: 
       pktcEventClassSeverity 
    
   - those related to throttling, i.e.: 
       pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus 
       pktcEventThrottleThreshold 
       pktcEventThrottleInterval 
    
   - those related to the event reporting capabilities of an MTA, i.e: 
       pktcEventSeverityLevel 
       pktcEventReporting 
       pktcEventText 
       pktcEventClass 
 
 
 
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects 
   with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus 
   important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects 
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when 
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and 
   objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   pktcEventLogTable: This table contains the log of generated event 
   messages. Read access to this table might reveal some specific 
   information that should be kept confidential. 
    
   pktcEventTransmissionStatus: This MIB object reveals the status of 
   event transmission and MAY be sensitive in some environments. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network 
   is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms 
   (for authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT  
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
   an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give 
   access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
   legitimate rights to perform GET or SET (change/create/delete)  
   operations.
