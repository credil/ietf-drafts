Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report
   generation on any device that supports MIBs containing counter
   objects for performance monitoring.  This allows a management station
   to instruct a device to build off-line reports to be collected
   asynchronously by the management station.

Internet-Draft               The REPORT MIB                   April 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous, off-
   line report generation on any device supporting MIBs containing
   counter objects for performance monitoring.  The Reporting MIB
   borrows from the RMON ReportsControl and Reports Tables.  Here the
   ReportsControlTable specifies the report metric, the counter Object
   ID to monitor and other aspects of the report development and
   storage.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Reporting MIB ... and notifications.

4.1.  Report MIB Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the Reporting MIB
   process.

   Figure 1 illustratrates a potential use of the Report-MIB for the
   generation of off-line, remotely generated reports.  The management
   station on the left hand side of the illustration instructs the
   remote device to create reports through manipulation of the
   ReportCntrl Objects in the Report-MIB resident on the remote device.
   The reports instruct the device to monitor the status of speicified

   counters (on other MIBs) periodically and to generate a set of
   metrics describing the temporal behavior of those counter values.
   The reports are stored locally until the management station decides
   to pull them off the device.  The figure shows a case where the
   Report-MIB generates a notification that Report_2 has completed,
   prompting the management station to pull Report_2 from the device.

   Figure 1: REPORT MIB front-end report generation process.

   The Report-MIB defines specifically a set of metrics which are
   computed within all reports.  It also allows for the specification of
   metric extensions which are local to the specific implementation of
   the Report-MIB.  These are identified in the reportCapabilitiesGroup
   metricExtension Table.

Internet-Draft               The REPORT MIB                   April 2009


   Each metric has an associated Object ID of type counter associated
   with it.  The control table specifies a report interval and a bin
   interval.  The report interval is an integral multiple of the bin
   interval.  For each bin interval, the device identifies the change in
   the counter value over the bin interval (called x_i) and then
   computes the associated metric, e.g., sum, sum of the square, etc,
   over the set {x_i}.  It maintains the sum of these computations
   within the metric objects in the 'reportAggrReportsTable'.  Once the
   report interval is complete, the management station has enough
   information to compute a set of interesting and useful statistics.

   The computational model of the REPORT-MIB is illustrated in the
   figure below.  The important controls are a) the contrlInterval, b)
   the cntrlBinInterval, c) the specific counterObjectId, and d) the
   metric.  In the figure x_i represents the ith value of the counter
   change, i.e., x_i = counterValue(t_i+1) - counterValue(t_i).  The
   metrics reported are then computed from the set (x_i).  Three
   examples are identified in the figure, e.g., StatSumX, StatSumSq and
   StatMaxX.  Other existing and potential metrics are discussed below.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the REPORT MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  reportMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the REPORT MIB.

   o  reportMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the
      REPORT MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

      *  Capabilities Group - This group contains the objects which
         describe the clock and metric extensions to the local device...

      *  Reports Control Group - Contains tables allowing a network
         management station to configure a specific set of reports to be
         generated and stored locally on the device...

      *  Reports Group - Contains tables holding the finished and
         current reports' information...

   o  reportMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this REPORT MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the REPORT MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus textual convention is imported from RFC 2579 [RFC2579].

   As and example of how the metrics are to be computed within the
   Report-MIB, consider the standard metric object
   'reportAggrReportsStatSumX'.  For each bin interval defined by the
   object reportCntrlReportsBinInterval, the change in the value of the
   counter pointed to by the Object ID reportCntrlReportsPriObjID is
   calculated.  Then this (delta) value is added to the current value of
   the value contained in the object 'reportAggrReportsStatSumX'.  Then,
   if interested in computing the average change in this object (sampled
   each bin interval) for the duration of the report, the management
   station simply divides reportAggrReportsStatSumX by
   reportAggrReportsStatN.  Although this is a trivial example because
   the value of reportAggrReportStatSumX is simple the difference in the

   counter reportCntrolReportsPriObjID at the start and the end of the
   total report interval, the other metrics defined are not as trival.

   The objects 'reportAggrReportsOverflowStatSumX' and
   'reportAggrReportsHCSumX' are borrowed from ROMN and exist to handle
   integer overflow situations where, e.g., 'reportAggrReportsStatSumX'
   overruns its maximum vary numerous times.

   Computations and utility of the other standard metrics are as
   follows:

   o  reportAggrReportsStatSumXSq -

   o  reportAggrReportsStatMaximum -

   o  reportAggrReportsStatMinimum -

   o  reportAggrReportsStatSumSq -

   o  reportAggrReportsStatSumIX -

   o  reportAggrReportsStatSumIXSq -

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the REPORT-MIB and their intended purpose or
   utility.  This group is currently empty.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The REPORT-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following REPORT-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

       DESCRIPTION
           "The reportMetricExtDefTable describes the metrics
           available to the REPORT-MIB.  The reportMetricExtDefTable
           can define metrics by referencing existing IETF,
           ITU, and other standards organizations' documents,
           including enterprise-specific documents.
           Examples of appropriate references include the
           ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540 [Y.1540] on IP
           packet transfer performance metrics and the
           IETF documents from the IPPM WG; e.g., RFC2681
           on the round trip delay metric [RFC2681] or
           RFC3393 on the delay variation metric [RFC3393].
           Other examples include RFC2679 [RFC2679], RFC2680
           [RFC2680], and RFC3432 [RFC3432].  Although no
           specific metric is mandatory, implementations
           should, at a minimum, support a round-trip delay
           and a round-trip loss metric.

           This table contains one row per metric supported by this
           agent, and it should be populated during system
           initialization."

           When the associated reportGenReportCntrlReqReports object is

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their

Internet-Draft               The REPORT MIB                   April 2009


   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:



Cole, et al.            Expires October 30, 2009               [Page 38]

Internet-Draft               The REPORT MIB                   April 2009


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.
