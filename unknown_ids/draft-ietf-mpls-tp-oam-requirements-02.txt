Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


1.  Introduction

   In the context of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP, see [5] and [6]),
   the rationales for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   mechanisms are twofold as they can serve:

   o  as a network-oriented mechanism (used by a transport network
      operator) to monitor his network infrastructure and to implement
      internal mechanisms in order to enhance the general behaviour and
      the level of performance of his network (e.g., protection
      mechanism in case of node or link failure).  For example, fault
      localization is typically associated with this use case.

   o  as a service-oriented mechanism (used by a transport service
      provider) to monitor services offered to end customers in order to
      be able to react rapidly in case of a problem and to be able to
      verify some of the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) parameters
      (e.g., using performance monitoring) negotiated with the end
      customers.  Note that a transport service could be provided over
      several networks or administrative domains that may not all be
      owned and managed by the same transport service provider.

   More generally, OAM is an important and fundamental functionality in
   transport networks as it contributes to:

   o  the reduction of operational complexity and costs, by allowing for
      efficient and automatic detection, localisation, handling, and
      diagnosis of defects, and by minimizing service interruptions and
      operational repair times.

   o  the enhancement of network availability, by ensuring that defects,
      for example resulting in misdirected customer traffic, and faults,
      are detected, diagnosed and dealt with before a customer reports
      the problem.

   o  meet service and performance objectives, as the OAM functionality
      allows for SLA verification in a multi-maintenance domain
      environment and allows for the determination of service
      degradation due, for example, to packet delay or packet loss.

   This document lists the requirements for the OAM functionality of
   MPLS-TP.  These requirements apply to pseudowires (PWs), Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs), and Sections.

   These requirements are derived from the set of requirements specified
   by ITU-T and published in the ITU-T Supplement Y.Sup4 [7].

   By covering transport specificities, these requirements complement



Vigoureux, et al.       Expires December 30, 2009               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


   those identified in RFC 4377 [8].

   Note that the OAM functionalities identified in this document may be
   used for fault management, performance monitoring and/or protection
   switching applications.  For example, connectivity verification can
   be used for fault management application by detecting failure
   conditions, but may also be used for performance monitoring
   application through its contribution to the evaluation of performance
   metrics (e.g., unavailability time).  Nevertheless, it is outside the
   scope of this document to specify which functionality should be used
   for which application.

1.1.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   In this document we refer to the inability of a function to perform a
   required action, as a fault.  This does not include an inability due
   to preventive maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned
   actions.  See also ITU-T G.806 [2].

   In this document we refer to the situation in which the density of
   anomalies has reached a level where the ability to perform a required
   function has been interrupted, as a defect.  See also ITU-T G.806
   [2].

   In this document we refer to a Label Edge Router (LER), for a given
   LSP or Section, and to a PW Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE), for a
   given PW, as an End Point.  Further, we refer to a Label Switching
   Router (LSR), for a given LSP, and to a PW Switching Provider Edge
   (S-PE), for a given PW, as an Intermediate Point.  This document does
   not make a distinction between End Points (e.g., source and
   destination) as it can be inferred from the context of the sentences.

   In this document we use the term "node" as a general reference to End
   Points and Intermediate Points.

   In this document we refer to both segment and concatenated segments
   as segments (see [6] for definitions relating to the term "segment"
   as well as for other definitions relating to MPLS-TP).


2.  OAM Requirements

   This section lists the requirements by which the OAM functionality of
   MPLS-TP should abide.  Note that some requirements for this



Vigoureux, et al.       Expires December 30, 2009               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


   application of MPLS are similar to some of those listed in RFC 4377
   [8].

   The requirements listed below may be met by one or more OAM
   protocols; the definition or selection of these protocols is outside
   the scope of this document.

2.1.  Architectural Requirements

2.1.1.  Scope of OAM

   The protocol solutions developed to meet the requirements identified
   in this document MUST be applicable to point-to-point bidirectional
   PWs, point-to-point bidirectional LSPs, and point-to-point
   bidirectional Sections and SHOULD additionaly be applicable to
   unidirectional point-to-point and point-to-multipoint LSPs.

   The service emulated by a single segment or a multi-segment PW may
   span multiple domains.  An LSP may also span multiple domains.  It
   MUST be possible to operate OAM functions on a per domain basis.
   More generally, the protocol solutions MUST be applicable end-to-end
   and to segments.

   Since LSPs may be stacked, the protocol solutions MUST be applicable
   on any LSP, regardless of the label stack depth.  Furthermore it MUST
   be possible to estimate OAM fault and performance metrics of a single
   PW or LSP segment or of an aggregate of PWs or LSPs segments.

2.1.2.  Independence

   The protocol solutions SHOULD be independent of the underlying
   tunnelling or point-to-point technology or transmission media.

   The protocol solutions SHOULD be independent of the service a PW may
   emulate.

   Any OAM function operated on a PW, LSP or Section SHOULD be
   independent of the OAM function(s) operated on a different PW, LSP or
   Section.  In other words, only the OAM functions operated on e.g., a
   given LSP should be used to achieve the OAM objectives for that LSP.
   Note that independence should not be understood here in terms of
   isolation as there can be interactions between OAM functions operated
   on e.g., an LSP, and on another LSP or a PW.

   Likewise, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP
   SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) operated on the end-to-
   end PW or LSP.  It SHOULD also be possible to distinguish an OAM
   packet running over a segment of a PW or LSP from another OAM packet



Vigoureux, et al.       Expires December 30, 2009               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


   running on the end-to-end PW or LSP.  Furthermore, any OAM function
   applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP SHOULD be independent of the OAM
   function(s) applied to other segment(s) of the same PW or LSP.
   Finally, the protocol solutions MUST support the capability to be
   concurrently and independently operated end-to-end and on segments.

   OAM functions MUST operate and be configurable even in the absence of
   a control plane.  Conversely, it SHOULD be possible to enable/disable
   the capability to operate OAM functions as part of connectivity
   management and it SHOULD also be possible to enable/disable the
   capability to operate OAM functions after connectivity has been
   established.  In the latter case, the customer MUST NOT perceive
   service degradation as a result of OAM enabling/disabling.  Ideally
   OAM enabling/disabling should take place without introducing any
   customer impairments (e.g., no customer packet losses).  Procedures
   aimed to prevent any traffic impairment MUST be defined for the
   enabling/disabling of OAM functions.  Means for configuring OAM
   functions and for connectivity management are outside the scope of
   this document.

2.1.3.  Addressing, Routing and Forwarding

   The OAM functionality may be deployed in a variety of environments.

   o  In some environments (e.g., IP/MPLS environments), IP routing and
      forwarding capabilities are inherently present in the forwarding
      plane.  In this case, it MUST be possible to operate the OAM
      functions by relying on IP routing and forwarding capabilities.

   o  In some environments (e.g., MPLS-TP environments), IP routing and
      forwarding capabilities may not necessarily be present in the user
      plane.  In this case, it MUST be possible to operate the OAM
      functions without relying on IP routing and forwarding
      capabilities.

   In cases where OAM messages need to incorporate identification
   information (e.g., source and/or destination nodes), the protocol
   solution(s) MUST at least support an IP addressing structure and MUST
   also be extensible to support additional identification schemes.

2.1.4.  Interoperability and Interworking

   It is REQUIRED that OAM interoperability is achieved across the
   environments described in Section 2.1.3.  It is also REQUIRED that
   the two first requirements of Section 2.1.3 still hold and MUST still
   be met when interoperability is achieved.

   When MPLS-TP is run with IP routing and forwarding capabilities, it



Vigoureux, et al.       Expires December 30, 2009               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


   MUST be possible to operate any of the existing IP/MPLS and PW OAM
   protocols (e.g., LSP-Ping [3], MPLS-BFD [9], VCCV [4] and VCCV-BFD
   [10]).

2.1.5.  Data Plane

   OAM functions operate in the data plane.  OAM packets MUST run in-
   band; that is, OAM packets for a specific PW, LSP or Section MUST
   follow the exact same data path as user traffic of that PW, LSP or
   Section.  This is often referred to as fate sharing.

   It MUST be possible to discriminate user traffic from OAM packets.
   This includes a means to differentiate OAM packets from user traffic
   as well as the capability to apply specific treatment to OAM packets,
   at the nodes targeted by these OAM packets.

   As part of the design of OAM protocol solution(s) for MPLS-TP, a
   mechanism, for enabling the encapsulation and differentiation of OAM
   messages on a PW, LSP or Section, MUST be provided.  Such mechanism
   SHOULD also support the encapsulation and differentiation of existing
   IP/MPLS and PW OAM messages.

2.2.  Functional Requirements

   Hereafter are listed the required functionalities composing the
   MPLS-TP OAM toolset.  The list may not be exhaustive and as such the
   OAM mechanisms developed in support of the identified requirements
   SHALL be extensible and thus SHALL NOT preclude the definition of
   additional OAM functionalities, in the future.

   The design of OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP, MUST allow for the ability
   to support experimental OAM functions.  These functions MUST be
   disabled by default.

   The use of any OAM function MUST be optional and it MUST be possible
   to choose which OAM function(s) to use and on which PW, LSP or
   Section to apply it(them) to.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the protocol solution, meeting one or more
   functional requirement(s), be the same for PWs, LSPs and Sections.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the protocol solution, meeting one or more
   functional requirement(s), effectively provides a fully featured
   function; that is, a function which is applicable to all the cases
   identified for that functionality.  In that context, protocol
   solution(s) MUST state their applicability.

   Unless otherwise stated, the OAM functionalities MUST NOT rely on

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


   user traffic; that is, only OAM messages MUST be used to achieve the
   objectives.

2.2.1.  General Requirements

   If a defect or fault occurs on a PW, LSP or Section, mechanisms MUST
   be provided to detect it, diagnose it, localize it, and notify the
   appropriate nodes.  Mechanisms SHOULD exist such that corrective
   actions can be taken.

   Furthermore, mechanisms MUST be available for a service provider to
   be informed of a fault or defect affecting the service(s) it
   provides, even if the fault or defect is located outside of his
   domain.

   The protocol solution(s) developed to meet these requirements may
   rely on information exchange.  Information exchange between various
   nodes involved in the operation of an OAM function SHOULD be reliable
   such that, for example, defects or faults are properly detected or
   that state changes are effectively known by the appropriate nodes.

2.2.2.  Continuity Checks

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable the
   verification of the continuity of a PW, LSP or Section.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

   This function SHOULD be performed pro-actively.

2.2.3.  Connectivity Verifications

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable the
   verification of the connectivity of a PW, LSP or Section.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points and Intermediate
   Points of PWs and LSPs, and between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand.  This function SHOULD be
   performed pro-actively only between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

2.2.4.  Diagnostic

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MAY provide functionality to enable the
   conduction of diagnostic tests on a PW, LSP or Section.  An example

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


   of such diagnotic test would consist in looping the traffic at an
   Intermediate Point, back to the End Point it originates from.
   Another example of such diagnotic test would consist in estimating
   the bandwidth of e.g., an LSP.

   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points and Intermediate
   Points of PWs and LSPs, and between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

2.2.5.  Route Tracing

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable an End
   Point to discover the Intermediate (if any) and End Point(s) along a
   PW, LSP or Section, and more generaly to trace the route of a PW, LSP
   or Section.  The information collected MUST include identifiers
   related to the nodes and interfaces composing that route.

   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points and Intermediate
   Points of PWs and LSPs, and between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

2.2.6.  Lock Instruct

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable an End
   Point of a PW, LSP or Section to instruct its associated End Point(s)
   to lock the PW, LSP or Section.  Note that lock corresponds to an
   administrative status in which forwarding traffic on and from the PW,
   LSP or Section is disabled.

   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

2.2.7.  Lock Reporting

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable an
   Intermediate Point of a PW or LSP to report, to an End Point of that
   same PW or LSP, an external lock condition affecting that PW or LSP.

   This function SHOULD be performed pro-actively.

   This function SHOULD be performed between Intermediate Points and End
   Points of PWs and LSPs.

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


2.2.8.  Alarm Reporting

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable an
   Intermediate Point of a PW or LSP to report, to an End Point of that
   same PW or LSP, a fault or defect condition affecting that PW or LSP.

   This function SHOULD be performed pro-actively.

   This function SHOULD be performed between Intermediate Points and End
   Points of PWs and LSPs.

2.2.9.  Remote Defect Indication

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable an End
   Point to report, to its associated End Point, a fault or defect
   condition that it detects on a PW, LSP or Section for which they are
   the End Points.

   This function SHOULD be performed pro-actively.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

2.2.10.  Client Failure Indication

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable the
   propagation, across an MPLS-TP network, of information pertaining to
   a client defect of fault condition detected at an End Point of a PW
   or LSP, if the client layer OAM mechanisms do not provide an alarm
   notification/propagation mechanism.

   This function SHOULD be performed pro-actively.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs and LSPs.

2.2.11.  Packet Loss

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable the
   quantification of packet loss ratio over a PW, LSP or Section.

   Note that packet loss ratio is the ratio of the user packets not
   delivered to the total number of user packets transmitted during a
   defined time interval.  The number of user packets not delivered is
   the difference between the number of user packets transmitted by an
   End Point and the number of user packets received at an End Point.

   This function MAY either be performed pro-actively or on-demand.

Internet-Draft        OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             June 2009


   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

   It SHOULD be possible to rely on user-plane traffic to achieve that
   functionality.

2.2.12.  Delay Measurement

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide functionality to enable the
   quantification of the one-way, and if appropriate, the two-way, delay
   of a PW, LSP or Section.

   o  One-way delay is the time elapsed from the start of transmission
      of the first bit of a packet by an End Point until the reception
      of the last bit of that packet by the other End Point.

   o  Two-way delay is the time elapsed from the start of transmission
      of the first bit of a packet by a End Point until the reception of
      the last bit of that packet by the same End Point, when loopback
      is performed at the other End Point.

   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand and MAY be perform pro-
   actively.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

   It SHOULD be possible to rely on user-plane traffic to achieve that
   functionality.


3.  Congestion Considerations

   A mechanism (e.g., rate limiting) MUST be provided to prevent OAM
   packets from causing congestion in the PSN.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document, as itself, does not imply any security consideration
   but OAM, as such, is subject to several security considerations.  OAM
   messages can reveal sensitive information such as passwords,
   performance data and details about e.g., the network topology.

   The nature of OAM therefore suggests having some form of
   authentication, authorization and encryption in place.  This will

   transport network.

   In general, mechanisms SHOULD be provided to ensure that OAM
   functions cannot be accessed unauthorized.

   Further, OAM messages MAY be authenticated to prove their origin and
   to make sure that they are destined for the receiving node.

   An OAM packet received over a PW, LSP or Section MUST NOT be
   forwarded beyond the End Point of that PW, LSP or Section, so as to
   avoid that the OAM packet leaves the current administrative domain.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions required by this draft.
