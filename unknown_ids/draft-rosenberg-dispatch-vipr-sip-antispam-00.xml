   <abstract>
     <t>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a new
     technique for inter-domain federation of SIP calls. ViPR makes
     use of a the PSTN as an introduction mechanism to verify the
     correctness of mappings from phone numbers to domains. The PSTN
     introduction mechanism can also be used as a techqnique for
     blocking spam - a SIP caller is only authorized when they're
     calling domain has previously called that same number over the
     PSTN. This document describes an extension to SIP which enables
     authorization of SIP calls based on a prior PSTN introduction.

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>The anti-spam tickets described in this specification are the key
     security mechanism in ViPR for mitigation of SPAM. The domain
     originating a call inserts a ticket in the SIP INVITE sent to the other
     domain. The Border Element in the domain receiving the call (see <xref
     target="fig-arch"></xref> can check the ticket to ensure that this
     originating domain has been authorized by the terminating domain. This
     document relies heavily on the concepts and terminology defined in <xref
     target="I-D.rosenberg-dispatch-vipr-overview"></xref> and will not make
     sense if you have not read that document first.</t>

   <section title="Terminating Side Procedures">
     <t>The Border Element will receive the TLS ClientHello which begins
     the TLS handshake. The Border Element will present its own configured
     cert. Once TLS handshaking is complete, the Border Element notes the
     domain from the SubjectAltName on the other side of the TLS connection,
     and associates it with that connection.</t>

     <t>Next, the Border Element will receive an INVITE. This INVITE will
     contain a ticket in the X-Cisco-ViPR-Ticket header field value. The
     Border Element extracts this header field. This call flow assumes it is
     present. The Border Element parses it, and obtains the epoch value
     encoded in the ticket. This is matched against the current epoch value
     for the configured password. If they match, processing continues. The
     Border Element verifies the signature is correct. Next, it examines the
     start and stop time of the validity. If the current time is between the
     start and stop times, the check is passed. Next, the Border Element
     checks the issued-to domain in the ticket. It compares that domain
     against the domain name in the SubjectAltName of the peer on the other
     side of the TLS connection, as noted above. Next, it takes the
     Request-URI of the SIP INVITE. That will be of the form
     sip:+number@domain. If it is not in that form, and if the number does
     not begin with a plus, the request is dropped. The value, including the
     plus, is then compared Number in the ticket. If it is equal, the check
     has passed. The Border Element leaves the header field in the request,
     but forwards to the Call Agent.</t>

     <t>In addition, the Border Element will typically be configured to apply
     its SIP message validation logic, and enforce restrictions on the sizes
     of various SIP header fields. This provides an additional layer of
     security in case malicious SIP messages are sent.</t>

     <t>The Border Element will also apply port forwarding in the case of
     NAT, so that the incoming request is forwarded to the appropriate Call
     Agent node.</t>

     <t>The Call Agent will receive incoming SIP INVITEs.
     The Request-URI of the INVITE will contain an E.164 number as indicated
     by a leading plus. If the Request-URI is not an E164, the request must
     be rejected with a 403. Only E164 numbers can be accepted on a ViPR
     trunk.</t>

   </section>

   <section title="Originating Side Procedures">
     <t>The routes stored to other domains in the Call Agent will each store
     a ticket to utilize with calls to that route. The Call Agent learns
     about these routs and the information needed to construct the ticket
     from the <xref target="I-D.draft-rosenberg-dispatch-vipr-vap">VAP
     protocol</xref>. When sending a SIP request to one of these domains, the
     Call Agent MUST include the ticket in any dialog forming request or
     request that is not in an existing dialog. </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Tickets">
     <t>This ticket is a sequence of characters. These MUST be placed into a
     X-Cisco-ViPR-Ticket SIP header field value. Consequently the format for
     this header field is:</t>

     <figure>
       <artwork><![CDATA[Ticket = "X-Cisco-ViPR-Ticket" HCOLON ticket-val 
ticket-val = 1*alphanum
]]></artwork>
     </figure>

     <t></t>

     <t>This header field MUST be utilized in all INVITE requests and all
     out-of-dialog requests. It is not utilized in responses. The
     ticket-value is a base64 encoded version of an object that is composed
     of a series of TLVs. Each TLV is a 16 bit type, a 16 bit length, and a
     variable length value. The length field refers to the length of the
     value portion of the TLV, measured in bytes. The following TLV types are
     defined:</t>

     <t><list style="numbers">
         <t>Ticket Unique ID: This TLV has a type of 0x0001. It contains a
         128 bit ID that has a unique identifier for this ticket. The value
         MUST contain a 128 bit UUID defined by <xref
         target="RFC4122"></xref>. This TLV MUST be present. However at this
         time it is used for diagnostic purposes only.</t>

         <t>Salt: This TLV has a type of 0x0002. It contains a value which
         MUST be at least 32 bits, and contains a random number. Its presence
         ensures that each ticket contains sufficient randomness. This TLV
         MUST be present.</t>

         <t>Validity: This TLV has a type of 0x0003. It contains two 64 bit
         NTP times. The first is the start of the validity of the ticket, the
         next is the end time for the validity of the ticket. This TLV MUST
         be present.</t>

         <t>Number: This TLV has a type of 0x0004. It contains a string which
         has an E164 number, included the "+", which may be called using this
         ticket. This TLV MUST be present.</t>

         <t>Granting Node: This TLV has a type of 0x0005. It contains a 128
         bit value which is the nodeID of the node which granted the ticket.
         This TLV MUST be present.</t>

         <t>Granting Domain: This TLV has a type of 0x0006. The domain which
         granted the ticket. A string, up to 256 characters, each of which
         must be a valid domain name character. The TLV has variable length.
         This TLV MUST be present.</t>

         <t>Granted-To Domain: This TLV has a type of 0x0007. The domain to
         which the ticket is granted. A string, up to 256 characters, each of
         which must be a valid domain name character. The TLV has a variable
         length. This TLV MUST be present.</t>

         <t>Epoch: This TLV has a type of 0x0008. It contains a 16 bit epoch
         value. It is used to select a key. This TLV MUST be present.</t>

         <t>Integrity: This TLV has a type of 0x0009. It contains a 160 bit
         integrity value, computed using HMAC-SHA1. This TLV MUST be
         present.</t>
       </list></t>

     <t>The base64 encoding uses the bas64url encoding from <xref
     target="RFC4648">RFC4648</xref>, with the exception of the pad
     character, which is a "." instead of an "=". This ensures that the
     output is a valid SIP token.</t>

     <t>To compute the MAC, the following is done. First, the key is
     obtained. The key is actually a 128 bit key, configured into the system.
     The key, P, is then used to compute Km:</t>

     <t>Km = HMAC-SHA1(P, S | Epoch)</t>

     <t>Based on PBKDF2 from <xref target="RFC2898">PKCS #5</xref> with
     HMAC-SHA1 as PRF and iteration count of 1. Where S is the 32 bit salt
     and Epoch is the 32 bit Epoch, from the ticket. This produces a 160 bit
     Km. The MAC is then computed as another HMAC-SHA1, over the entire
     ticket up to but not including the Integrity itself, using Km as the
     key. This produces the 160 bit MAC.</t>
