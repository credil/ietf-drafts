Internet-Draft      NEMO Problem Statement in PMIPv6       March 7, 2011


1. Introduction

   The recent rapid propagation of Wi-Fi handheld devices and increasing
   demand for Internet access everywhere, even within moving vehicles,
   have made network mobility (NEMO) technology much noticeable.

   To realize NEMO support, the NEMO basic support protocol (NEMO-BSP)
   has been specified [NEMO-BSP]. The NEMO-BSP defines a mobile router
   (MR), which is based on the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) client protocol, so
   the MR needs to update the binding information to the home agent (HA)
   [MIPv6].

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [PMIPv6] protocol provides network-
   based IP mobility management to a mobile host without requiring host
   stack involvement and IP reconfiguration within same PMIPv6 domain.
   However, it defines only the host mobility case. To facilitate NEMO
   support in the PMIPv6 domain, as a first approach, applicable methods
   using NEMO-BSP need to be discussed.

   This document is a problem statement for NEMO support within the
   PMIPv6 domain. Specifically, it describes NEMO support scenarios by
   using the NEMO-BSP, which is a standard protocol designed by IETF,
   within the PMIPv6 where the MR's HA is located at a local mobility
   anchor (LMA) or outside the PMIPv6 domain. We then summarize issues
   and problems occurring in these scenarios. Moreover, we discuss
   requirements for improving NEMO.

2. Terminology and Functional Components

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

   o  Mobile Network Node (MNN) - The node that has an address
      containing the MNP, as defined in [RFC 3963].

   o  Mobile Router (MR) - It is extended from Mobile IPv6 client
      protocol and in charge of mobility management on behalf of MNN
      within a mobile network, as defined in [RFC 3963].

3. Protocol Operation

   An MR, as defined in NEMO-BSP, is required to perform a binding
   update (BU) to an MR-HA for a newly configured MR's care-of-address
   (CoA) based on the prefix of the attached network. Depending on the
   location of the MR-HA, the NEMO support might vary. Therefore, we
   consider two scenarios for NEMO-BSP support in the PMIPv6 domain
   where the MR-HA is located at an LMA or outside the PMIPv6 domain.
   The MNN is assumed to have no mobility protocol stack.

3.1. An MR-HA outside the PMIPv6

   In this case, a PMIPv6 domain is used as a delivery network between
   the MR-HA and MR. The mobile access gateway (MAG) detecting the MR's
   attachment receives a home network prefix (HNP) from an LMA. Then,
   the HNP is delivered to the MR through a router advertisement (RA)
   message, and a PMIPv6 tunnel is established between the MAG and the
   LMA. The MR configures its MR-CoA based on the received HNP and then
   performs BU for the MR-HA. A MAG emulates the MR's home network
   regardless of its access link. So additional BU procedures are not
   required when the MR moves to another MAG within same PMIPv6 domain.

   Mobile networks and outside the PMIPv6 domain have different mobility
   anchor. All MNNs configure their IP addresses based on the prefix of
   the MR's HA. When the MNN moves out of the PMIPv6 domain, this node
   configures its address based on the HNP assigned by the LMA, breaking
   session continuity. This procedure is also applied in the opposite
   case.

   Packets are delivered to the final MNN via several mobility agents,
   like the HA, LMA, MAG, and MR. The HA encapsulates packets with
   tunnel headers, and then they traverse the PMIPv6 tunnel between the
   LMA and MAG. So triple tunneling overhead occurs, which can easily
   lead to large bandwidth consumption for the wireless network. This
   overhead may severely impact the 3G or WiMAX access link, which has a
   relatively narrow bandwidth compared to Wi-Fi access networks.

3.2. An MR-HA on LMA

   To take charge of the HA's function, an LMA needs to process the MR's
   BU signaling message. Then, it performs double look-up processing and
   makes an IP tunnel header for the MAG and MR. If the MR moves to
   another MAG within the same PMIPv6 domain, reconfiguration of MR-CoA
   and additional BU signaling are not required. The PMIPv6 supports
   only the per-MN prefix model in [PMIPv6], but all MNNs share the MR's
   HNP, assigned by the LMA. In this case, multi-link subnet issues may
   occur [MULTI-ISSUES].  The prefix the MNN uses is assigned and
   registered for the MR, but the prefix can be shared with other MNNs.
   So, when this node travels outside the PMIPv6 domain, it SHOULD
   receive a new HNP and configure a new IP address. Packet overhead
   also happens due to the triple tunneling header.

4. Considerations of NEMO support in the PMIPv6

   This section presents considerations for NEMO support within the
   PMIPv6 domain. It consists of two parts: the requirements for basic
   functioning and performance improvement.

4.1. Basic functional requirements

   1) Prefix delegation support for an MNN: An MNN needs a unique prefix
      for freely roaming support. Therefore, an appropriate prefix
      delegation method SHOULD be considered. As one solution, a DHCPv6
      prefix delegation method MAY be used [DHCPv6-PD-NEMO].

   2) No host stack involvement: A NEMO SHOULD be supported to
      attach/detach an MR and engage in mobility management without host
      stack involvement

   3) Node mobility support: A NEMO solution SHOULD support session
      continuity for mobile nodes that roam freely between a mobile
      network and the outer part of a PMIPv6 domain.

4.2. Requirements for performance improvement

   1) Resource-efficient handoff management: When a mobile network moves
      to another MAG within the same PMIPv6 domain, wired/wireless
      network resources SHOULD be saved during handoff. Individual
      signaling for an MNN is not desirable.

   2) Minimal packet overhead: When packets are delivered from an LMA
      and MNN, packet overhead SHOULD be minimized. This overhead is
      generated by routing, tunneling, and additional signaling between
      network entities.

   3) Minimal packet loss during handoff: Packet loss caused by a
      handoff event during a change in the attachment point SHOULD be
      minimal.

   4) Minimal end-to-end delay: Multiple tunneling is caused by
      anchoring points as the number of encapsulated tunnel headers.
      This increases end-to-end packet delay. This delay SHOULD be
      minimized.
