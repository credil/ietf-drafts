Internet-Draft         Nomcom Incumbent Processing              May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IETF Nomcom model [RFC3777], going back to the origins of the
   Nomcom as described in [RFC1602] and [RFC2027], assumes that all
   nominees are to be treated identically, e.g., that there are no
   differences between incumbents who are willing to serve an additional
   term and new nominees.  That assumption has proven unrealistic in
   practice.  The differences make the current selection model for
   leadership roles inefficient for the community, for incumbents and
   potential alternate nominees and for the Nomcom itself.  People are
   reluctant to "run against" incumbents and Nomcom members inevitably
   have difficulty comparing unknown alternate nominees against
   incumbents (sometimes to the advantage of the incumbents and
   sometimes to the advantage of the nominees).  Recent proposals for
   changes to the Nomcom's practices about revealing nominee names
   [Dawkins-Openlist] may exacerbate the problem by making a challenge
   to an incumbent even more public than it is under the procedure of
   RFC 3777 as it has been interpreted in recent years.

   In evaluating an incumbent, the Nomcom should be able to consider
   actual performance in the role as well as the delicate balance
   between the advantages and disadvantages of longer tenure (including
   the disadvantages of removing someone who has done a reasonable job
   in a role for which a significant fraction of the first term is often
   spent learning to function smoothly) and to do so independently of a
   wider field of potential alternatives for which there is less role-
   specific data available.

   Consequently, there is reason to believe that a different model for
   consideration of renewal or replacement for members of the leadership
   would be more efficient for the Nomcom, would impose less hardship on
   incumbents and the community, would avoid the problems associated
   with trying to compete directly with an incumbent for a role, and
   would lead to better comparisons and perhaps better choices.  This
   document outlines that alternate method.

   Although somewhat different considerations may apply to IESG and
   other positions selected by the Nomcom, this document tries to avoid
   making any distinction.  Even though particular bodies are used in
   the examples in this document, the proposed procedure applies to all
   Nomcom-selected positions.  The Nomcom may apply its discretion, as
   usual, to details of the process.

   For clarity, this document uses the term "incumbent" to refer to
   someone occupying a particular position at the time the Nomcom
   process begins and "nominee" to refer to someone nominated for a
   position who is not the incumbent in that position.  This terminology
   differs slightly from that of 3777, which does not make a distinction

   between the two groups and refers to both as "nominees".

1.1.  Mailing List

   [[anchor2: RFC Editor: Please remove this section.]]

   This proposal should be discussed on the ietf-nomcom@ietf.com list.


2.  Separating Review and Nominations for Open Positions

   The current nomination process pits incumbents, incumbent
   performance, and questions of stability in relevant bodies against
   other potential nominees.  This is undesirable for a number of
   reasons.  It creates the notion of incumbents being "fired" rather
   than honorably retired to the citizenry after a brief period of
   contributing to the community by assuming a leadership role.  And,
   while there is significant value in treating stability as a goal,
   too-low turnover in a decision-making body can contribute to that
   body's having an incomplete impression of the views of the community.

   It is worth noting that the trend in recent years (since at least
   2002, the earliest year for which data or conveniently available) has
   been to return, rather than replace incumbents (see the table below
   for the data).  If the Nomcom is going to return about half the
   incumbents in each cycle, time considering other nominees is time
   that could have been spent in more carefully considering nominees
   that hadn't served previously.  The separation proposed here should
   promote more effective consideration of whether a given incumbent
   should be returned.  If a decision is made to do so, no other
   nominees need be recruited, asked to submit information, evaluated,
   and so on, and there is no need to poll the community about possible
   replacements that aren't needed in this NomCom cycle.  In addition to
   producing better results, the change is likely to reduce Nomcom
   workload, possibly encouraging a larger and more diverse pool of
   volunteers for the Nomcom itself.

                  Table 1: Returned Incumbents per NomCom

   This specification changes the current model by reintroducing some
   principles that the authors believe are widely held in the community
   and optimizing the selection process to support those principles.
   The principles include:

   o  Service in the IETF's leadership bodies is a short-term
      contribution to the community, not a career.  Indeed, willingness
      to assume those positions may be considered a responsibility to
      the community.

   o  It takes long enough to learn the job of being effective in an
      IAB, IESG, or IAOC role (and most other roles that can be
      anticipated as being designated for Nomcom selection) that, in
      general, having someone retire after a single term is uneconomic
      for the community.

   o  Just as retirement of an incumbent after one term should be
      considered a major step because of the inefficiencies of the
      learning period, the six-month or more period in which an
      incumbent is uncertain about whether work should be planned that
      spans the "first meeting of the next year" (or some other term
      cutoff) introduces inefficiencies that should be minimized to the
      degree possible.

   o  While the issue lies largely outside the scope of this document,
      it is worth considering that a demonstrated shortage of people
      willing to do work in the IETF should be taken as an indication
      that there is insufficient real community interest in the work,
      and an appropriate level of resources, to reach meaningful
      consensus and produce high-quality results.  While that position
      appears to be reasonably well-understood with regard to the number
      of active IETF participants interested in putting a working group
      together and in finding leadership for working groups, the same

Internet-Draft         Nomcom Incumbent Processing              May 2009


      principle probably should be applied to ADs, Areas, and IAB seats:
      if there are only one or two people willing and qualified to do a
      particular job, that may be an indication that the IETF should
      review the appropriateness of that role (in the case of the IESG,
      the existence or definition of the area) or should reconsider the
      time and other requirements of the roles involved.

   To deal effectively with these problems, the Nomcom consideration and
   evaluation process is divided into two phases.

2.1.  Phase 1: Review of Incumbents

   Incumbent performance should be evaluated, rather than being compared
   to potential other nominees to serve as replacements.  The incumbent
   will always have more experience.  An incumbent who has done his or
   her job well will have accumulated strong proponents and probably
   strong detractors.  Direct comparison between the actual performance
   of incumbents and the potential performance of nominees is inevitably
   difficult.

   In Phase 1, the Nomcom will evaluate the performance of incumbents,
   collecting information from the community as needed to do that.  It
   is worth noting that names of incumbents are known to the community
   regardless of any Nomcom action or decisions.  The Nomcom is advised
   that an incumbent who is willing to serve an additional term should
   be returned at least once (i.e., permitted/encouraged to serve two
   terms) unless there is strong evidence of problems (e.g.,
   incompetence, inability to work with WGs, inability to work with
   other incumbents, non-feasance, or malfeasance).  For incumbents who
   are completing their second or subsequent terms, the Nomcom should
   balance the advantages and disadvantages of long tenure as Nomcoms
   have done in the past.

   Discussions between the Nomcom and an incumbent as to whether that
   incumbent is willing to serve again should be covered by the Nomcom's
   normal confidentiality rules except as mutually agreed (e.g., if an
   incumbent wishes to make a public announcement that he or she is
   unwilling to serve an additional term, there is nothing for the
   Nomcom to keep confidential).  If the Nomcom chooses to not return a
   incumbent who is willing to serve, the expectation is that this will
   be indistinguishable to the community (and to outside observers) from
   the incumbent voluntarily stepping down.  Under normal circumstances,
   the Nomcom is expected to conduct informational evaluations of even
   those incumbents who have chosen to step down (the evaluations may
   inform later choices), but such incumbents may work with the Nomcom
   on the style of evaluation as appropriate, perhaps supplying in-depth
   analysis of the relevant Area and its status and issues as an
   alternative to an in-depth evaluation of the incumbent's performance.

Internet-Draft         Nomcom Incumbent Processing              May 2009


   At the end of this phase, the Nomcom submits the list of returning
   incumbents as candidates to the relevant confirming body as usual.
   The confirming body makes its decision and the choices are announced
   to the community.  The list of (remaining) open slots is then
   announced to the community before the nominal closing date for
   nominations and recommendations.  Any incumbent who is not returned
   in this phase is not eligible for the relevant position in the second
   phase, so no one ever "runs against" an incumbent.

2.2.  Phase 2: Nomination and Selection of New Candidates

   This procedure works exactly as described in RFC 3777, as amended
   [RFC3777], with the understanding that no incumbent will ever be a
   candidate for the same position under this process.  As a side-
   effect, the process specified in this document makes it more
   difficult than it has traditionally been to shift people around
   within the IESG and possibly between the IAB and IESG.

2.3.  Revised schedule

   Because of other proposals to alter the Nomcom timeline, it is
   inappropriate to propose a separate timeline here.  However, it is
   worth noting that one interesting side-effect of this proposal is
   that consideration and evaluation of incumbents could occur in
   parallel with the beginning of calls for nominations.  Of course a
   nomination for a slot held by an incumbent who was returned would
   become a no-op.  There would be some advantages to guaranteeing
   confidentiality, even from Nomcom members, for the identities of
   anyone applying for such slots until the decision with regard to the
   incumbent was public and silently discarding the nominations if the
   incumbent were returned (see Section 3).


3.  Issues with Public Nominations and Incumbents

   Over the years, there have been many discussions of the degree of
   confidentiality that is appropriate for the Nomcom, especially with
   regard to identification of the names of nominees being considered.
   That discussion surfaced most recently in conjunction with
   [Dawkins-Openlist].  The arguments against having the names be
   completely open focus on two main cases:

   o  Some people fear publicly competing with incumbents.  They are
      concerned that it would be interpreted as an attack or statement
      of lack of confidence in the incumbent and that the incumbent, if
      returned, would resent those actions and retaliate by making it
      more difficult for the challenger (or his organization) to
      progress documents.

Internet-Draft         Nomcom Incumbent Processing              May 2009


   o  Relationships within or among organizations might make such
      nominations problematic even though the organizations might be
      willing to tolerate any problems if the nominee were actually
      selected (especially if it were not known whether the incumbent
      stepped down voluntarily).  An individual might be reluctant to be
      nominated against her boss.  A company might find it difficult to
      permit a nomination when the incumbent (or another nominee) was in
      a visible position with another company with which the first one
      had very close linkages.  And so on.

   It is important to note that, regardless of whether these concerns
   are actually valid or not, they are perceived as valid and that the
   perception may reduce the number of people who are available as
   nominees for a given position.

   Having decisions made about incumbents and whether they were begin
   returned made, and made public, before the target cutoff date for
   nominations would eliminate the first of these problems and
   significantly reduce the second.


4.  Summary of Changes to RFC 3777

   Some of the procedures described in this document could be put in
   place without updating the current NomCom process, but [RFC3777] must
   be updated to provide for the following actions:

   1.  Section 4, bullet 13 of [RFC3777] ties the announcement of
       positions being reviewed to the call for NomCom volunteers ("The
       Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be reviewed
       and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
       volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
       nominating committee").  This document calls for the NomCom to be
       selected and seated, and to evaluate incumbents, before
       announcing a list of positions that are unambiguously "open".

   2.  Section 5, bullet 14 of [RFC3777] calls for the NomCom to forward
       candidates to the confirming bodies as a group ("specifying a
       single candidate for each open position").  This document calls
       for a two-stage forwarding - first, renewed incumbent candidates
       are forwarded for confirmation, and then non-incumbent candidates
       are forwarded for confirmation.

   3.  Given that the notion of "partial-slate confirmation" has been
       contentious in past NomComs, it is probably best to insert
       language that calls for confirming bodies to confirm renewed
       incumbent candidates without waiting for a complete slate of
       candidates.

7.  Security considerations

   This specification is about IETF Procedures for leadership selection.
   It has no direct consequences for Internet security issues although
   it is possible that it might produce a better IAB or IESG that might,
   in turn, be more effective in dealing with those issues.
