Abstract

   This memo specifies how IPv6 only mobile nodes (MN) receiving host-
   based mobility management using Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) can
   communicate with IPv4 only servers.  The protocol is based on home
   agents maintaining a table similar to NAT64 and linking it to the
   binding cache.  This technique avoids the problems encountered when
   NAT64 is used for mobile nodes in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  How IPv6
   only mobile nodes can receive multicast data from IPv4 only content
   providers is also explained.

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               October 2010


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  NAT64 together with DNS64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] and the translation algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] enables IPv6-only hosts to communicate
   with IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64 is designed for fixed hosts.  When used for mobile nodes
   several problems occur as described in
   [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].  In this document we
   redesign NAT64 for host based mobility protocol called Dual Stack
   Mobile IPv6.  The design uses DNS64 as is and integrates NAT64
   operation with the binding cache of Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.

   The document continues in Section 3 with a set of requirements on a
   solution for NAT64 for Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  In Section 4 the
   protocol design is presented, multicast translation is explained in
   Section 5 while handover and route optimization cases are covered in
   Section 6.  In Section 7 extensions to DSMIPv6 are described.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3775], [RFC5555],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] and [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64].


3.  Requirements

   NAT64 has two main problems if used for the mobile nodes: the first
   one is related to mobility and the second one is related to NAT
   keepalives.

   DNS64 uses the IPv6 prefix assigned to the NAT64 IPv6 interface in
   the domain in translating IPv4 address of the server to an IPv6
   address.  This prefix will be referred to as Pref64 as in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] defines two types of prefixes: Well-
   Known Prefix or Network-Specific Prefix.  If the well-known prefix of
   64:FF9B::/96 is used then the mobile node would always get the same
   mapping wherever it moves so no problems can be anticipated.
   However, for various reasons this is not expected to be the case in
   general.

   If Network-Specific Prefixes (NSP) are used problems can be
   anticipated especially for mobile nodes.  This happens because DNS64



Sarikaya & Xia           Expires April 23, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               October 2010


   server used by the mobile node may use a different NSP that NAT64 box
   is not configured with.  When the mobile node moves to a foreign
   network, the mobile node's DNS requests can be done in two ways:
   either mobile node tunnels it to the home agent and the home agent
   sends it to the DNS server in the home network or the mobile node
   sends it locally and it goes to the DNS server of the foreign
   network.  The former case poses no problems as DNS64 server is
   synchronized with NAT64 server at the home network.  The latter case
   poses problems because NSP in the IPv6 address synthesized by the
   local DNS64 is not recognized by the home NAT64 server, i.e. its
   interface is not configured with this NSP.  In this case the mobile
   node's IPv6 packet may not reach the destination IPv4-only server.

   In this document the solution to the prefix mismatch problem involves
   the HA keeping track of all NSPs.  HA is responsible for routing the
   MN's packet with the new NSP which may take a longer path or the
   packet may not even reach the destination.

   Mobile nodes in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 initiate route optimization
   with the correspondent nodes when they move to a foreign network by
   sending first a home test init (HoTI) message to the home agent.
   This and subsequent messages (Care-of Test Init (CoTI), Home Test
   (HoT) and Care-of Test (CoT)) contain IPv6 extension headers.
   NAT64's translation algorithm [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] does not
   translate IPv6 extension headers.  As a result, HoTI and similar
   messages would be rejected at the NAT64 device and the mobile node
   would end up receiving an ICMP message.

   This fundamental restriction of IPv6-IPv4 translation is avoided in
   this document by an additional requirement not to initiate the route
   optimization with IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64 is a NAT device which keeps NAT table as the NAT state.  NAT
   state is soft state and it expires if it is not refreshed during a
   certain time interval.  NAT devices delete existing bindings at the
   end of a time interval if no activity is detected during that
   interval.  Timer values of two minutes for UDP [RFC4787] and four
   minutes for TCP [RFC2663] are recommended.  However, existing NAT
   devices are known to have non-deterministic and typically short
   expiration times especially for UDP-based bindings.

   Outbound refresh (mobile node initiated) is necessary for allowing
   the client (mobile node) to keep the mapping alive.  NAT keepalives
   are used for this purpose [RFC5245].  Mobile nodes go to sleep mode
   when inactive in which battery usage is minimized.  However sending
   NAT keepalive messages for outbound refresh may drain the mobile
   node's battery because it has to cut short its sleep mode.

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               October 2010


   NAT keepalives should be avoided for the mobile nodes.  This
   requirement is met by integrating NAT64 state with binding cache that
   the home agent creates for the mobile node in order to keep track of
   its mobility and by having the home agent to refresh NAT binding with
   the NAT device.

   While resolving issues of NAT64 related to mobility, it is desirable
   to keep compatibility with fixed hosts.  This requirement is met by
   reusing DNS64 for mobile nodes as well.

   The behaviour of IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes using host
   based mobility protocol Mobile IPv6 is specified in [RFC5555].
   However this document does not specify how IPv6-only mobile nodes can
   access IPv4-only servers.  Hence this specification complements
   [RFC5555].

   NAT64 is designed for unicast communication, the translation
   algorithm is defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] does not
   translate multicast packets.  IPv6 only hosts receiving multicast
   data from IPv4 only servers is not covered.

   For many applications multicast communication for mobile nodes in a
   dual stack Mobile IPv6 environment is a requirement.  This
   requirement is met by designing a multicast translation scheme for
   Dual Stack Mobile IPv6.  This technique applies to any source
   multicast.


4.  NAT64 Procedure

   Mobile nodes reverse tunnel their packets to the home agent when
   roaming and at the home network the home agent is the default router.
   When forwarding packets sent by the mobile node, the home agent first
   checks the Source Address field of the inner header in the binding
   cache to find the corresponding binding cache entry for this mobile
   node's home address.  A further check is made if the destination
   address's prefix matches Pref64.  In case of a match, IPv6-only flag
   in the binding cache entry for the mobile node is set if it was not
   set already.

   HA creates a "NAT state" of

   <MN source address, IPv6 source port> <--> <IPv4 Interface address,
   IPv4 source port>

   HA also adds a keepalive interval together with the address.
   Everytime HA detects a new session with the same destination address
   and the same Pref64, it adds a new entry to the binding cache and the

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               October 2010


   keepalive interval.  This state is linked to the binding cache entry
   for MN.

   Keepalive interval is used to send NAT keepalive messages.  NAT
   keepalive messages are ICMP Echo Request messages [RFC3519].  They
   are sent to the destination address associated with the keepalive
   interval.  Keepalive interval is used to keep track of inactivity of
   the mobile node's session with its NAT64 host, IPv4-only server.  Any
   ICMP Echo Request message sent from the home agent serves as outbound
   refresh message for the session and any corresponding ICMP Echo Reply
   received serves as the inbound refresh.

   ICMPv6 Echo Request message is translated into ICMPv4 Echo Request
   message at NAT64 server following translation rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].  An ICMP Echo is sent to IPv4 only
   server as an IPv4 packet.  IPv4 server replies with IPv4 Echo Reply
   which is translated into ICMPv6 Echo Reply message and received by
   the home agent.

   Home agent forwards any subsequent packets for the same session
   corresponding to <MN source address, source port> and refreshes the
   keepalive interval.  Home agent does not do any inbound refresh.
   Incoming packets for this session do not refresh the keepalive
   interval since it is the interval for outbound refresh.  It is up to
   IPv4 only server to do the inbound refreshes.


5.  Multicast Translation

   In this section we specify how mobile node can receive IPv4 multicast
   data from IPv4-only content provider based on the current multicast
   support scheme in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775].  The reverse
   translation of IPv6 multicast data for IPv4-only receivers is out of
   scope.

   IPv6-only mobile node will join IPv4 multicast group by sending MLD
   Membership Report message to the home agent.  This message is sent in
   the mobile node-home agent tunnel.  Mobile node will use synthesized
   IPv6 address of IPv4 multicast group address, e.g. a /96 prefix used
   for any source multicast called IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix followed by
   a.b.c.d, IPv4 multicast group address.  IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix
   takes the form of FFxx::/96, it is non-SSM prefix
   [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46].  Multicast router at the home agent
   receives this join message from the mobile node for the group
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d.

   Each home agent is assigned a unique IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.
   Mobile nodes can learn this value by means out of scope with this

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               October 2010


   document.  With this, mobile node can easily create an IPv6 multicast
   address from the IPv4 group address a.b.c.d that it wants to join.

   Home agent as multicast anchor checks the group address and
   recognizes IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  It next checks the last 32
   bits is an IPv4 multicast address in range 224/8 - 239/8.  If all
   checks succeed, home agent joins a.b.c.d using IGMP on its IPv4
   interface.

   Home agent identifies the mobile node from the tunnel and adds the
   multicast group address to the multicast state associated with this
   node's binding cache entry.  Home agent also sets IPv6-only bit if it
   was not set before.

   When home agent receives multicast data for the group a.b.c.d, it
   first obtains the IPv6 address IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d and
   then checks to see if at least one mobile node is subscribed to this
   address from the binding cache and multicast state.

   Home agent will then translate IPv4 multicast data packet into an
   IPv6 multicast data packet.  The destination address is IPv6 group
   address IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix:a.b.c.d and source address is home
   agent's IPv6 interface address.  The value in Type of Service (TOS)
   field of IPv4 packet is copied into IPv6 Traffic Class field.  IPv4
   IPv4 Protocol and TTL fields are copied into IPv6 Next Header and Hop
   Limit fields respectively.  IPv4 payload is copied into IPv6 payload.
   UDP checksum is updated which completes the packet translation
   process [Thesis].  Home agent duplicates the packet for each mobile
   node member of this group and sends each packet tunneled to the
   individual mobile node separately.

   Any IPv4 fragments sent by the routers must be translated into IPv6
   packets with IPv6 Fragment Header.  Fragmentation Offset field is
   copied into the corresponding field in the Fragment Header. 16-bit
   Identification field is copied into the low-order 16 bits of IPv6
   Fragment Header Identification field.  The high-order bits of the 32-
   bit IPv6 Fragment Header Identification field are set to zero.  More
   Fragments (MF) flag is copied to the corresponding field in IPv6
   Fragment Header [Thesis].

   Multicast translation described in this section is not mobile node
   agnostic.  Home agent gets the join message directly from the mobile
   node and then updates the membership database which is connected to
   the binding cache.  Home agent has to know all members of each IPv4
   group so that it can correctly duplicate the data packets and tunnel
   to individual mobile nodes.

   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) can also be supported similar to the



Sarikaya & Xia           Expires April 23, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               October 2010


   Any Source Multicast (ASM) described above.  In case of SSM, IPv4
   multicast addresses use 232.0.0.0/8 prefix and IPv6 multicast
   addresses use FF3X::/96 prefix.  A unique SSM can be configured such
   as FF3E::/96.  This prefix is referred to as IPV6_TRSSM_ADDRESS
   prefix.  Since SSM translation requires a unique address for each
   IPv4 multicast source, an IPv6 unicast prefix, e.g.  FF3E::/96 must
   be configured to the translator to represent IPv4 sources.  This
   prefix is prepended to IPv4 source addresses, e.g. 232.1.2.3 in
   translated packets to obtain FF3E::232.1.2.3.  Also this prefix must
   be routed towards the translator on the IPv6 network, to enable
   reverse path forwarding for multicast, and to inform other PIM
   routers about the correct destination for PIM (S,G) Join messages
   [Thesis].


6.  Handover, Route Optimization and Return Routability

   The mobile node moves to a foreign network and sends DNS request
   locally and the request goes to the DNS server of the foreign network
   that is configured with a different NSP.  Mobile node gets a
   different synthetic AAAA RR with a different IPv6 address of the
   destination.  MN reverse tunnels its IPv6 packet destined to IPv4-
   only server to the home agent.

   Home agent checks the source address (mobile node's home address) of
   the inner header in the binding cache for any entry with IPv6-only
   flag set.  Next destination address's prefix is checked in a list of
   Pref64's that are supported.  In case of a match, home agent forwards
   IPv6 packet as described in Section 4.  In addition home agent also
   removes all NAT table entries matching MN home address since MN is no
   longer using the same Pref64.  If the prefix does not match, home
   agent forwards the packet.  However the packet may not reach its
   destination (NAT64 server) due to configuration, i.e. no roaming
   agreement with the foreign network.

   If IPv6-only flag is not set then this is the first packet sent to a
   new IPv4-only server.  Home agent processes this packet as described
   in Section 4.

   The effect of handover on multicast translation described in
   Section 5 depends on how IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix is configured.
   Mobile node may get a different IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix locally
   after moving to a foreign network.  Mobile node sends a join request
   (Multicast Listener Discovery Report message) with a new multicast
   group address to the home agent in a tunnel.  Home agent adds this
   group address to its membership database.  Home agent MUST add the
   new IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix to the multicast prefix table.  Home
   agent MUST set IPv6-only flag in the binding cache for this mobile

   node.

   Route optimization (RO) in DSMIPv6 is used to avoid triangular route
   every packet to the corresponding node takes by enabling the mobile
   node to directly send the packets to the correspondent node
   [RFC3775].  RO is established using control signaling involving the
   home agent, mobile node and correspondent node.  After RO is
   established mobile node sends its packets directly to the
   correspondent node.  The source address of these packets are the
   care-of address and MN home address is included in an extension
   header called home address option.  All RO packets involve extension
   headers.

   Because all route optimization packets (signaling and data) contain
   extension headers the translation algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] used in NAT64 would simply ignore the
   data included in these headers.  As a result, route optimization can
   not even be initiated.  This point is also observed in
   [I-D.haddad-mext-nat64-mobility-harmful].  IPv6 only mobile nodes
   involved in communication with IPv4-only servers MUST NOT use route
   optimization.  This ensures that all traffic between the mobile node
   and corresponding node goes through the home agent and correct IPv6-
   IPv4 packet translation can be conducted.


7.  Extensions to Dual Stack Mobile IPv6

   Binding cache entry contains the following new entry:

   A flag indicating whether or not this mobile node is IPv6-only node.

   IPv6-only flag is set after receiving the first IPv6 packet
   containing a synthetic IPv6 address.  This flag is used to connect
   the binding cache with the NAT table.

   Home agent is configured with a table of NAT64 prefixes, Pref64's
   that are supported in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 home domain and its
   roaming partners.  For each Pref64, home agent keeps a 32-bit suffix
   which is concatenated to the prefix.  The resulting 96-bit value is
   concatenated with IPv4 address of the destination IPv4-only server to
   obtain the synthesized IPv6 address.

   If the Well-Known Prefix is used this table contains 64:FF9B::/96.
   In this case there is no associated suffix.

   Home agent keeps a NAT table for IPv6-only mobile nodes communicating
   with IPv4-only servers.  NAT table contains at a minimum entries for
   associating MN home address, IPv6 source port to the corresponding

Internet-Draft              NAT64 for DSMIPv6               October 2010


   IPv4 interface address of the home agent and source port information.
   Each entry also contains a keepalive interval value for this session.

   MN home address in the NAT table MUST correspond to a binding cache
   entry with IPv6-only flag set.

   IPv6-only mobile nodes MUST avoid initiating return routability
   procedure described in Section 5.2.5 of [RFC3775].  When the home
   agent receives a Home Test Init message, it checks the source address
   (mobile node's home address) in the binding cache.  If the
   corresponding binding cache entry has its IPv6-only flag set home
   agent drops the Home Test Init message.

7.1.  Multicast Extensions

   Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST support at least one
   IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefix.  Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST
   support IGMP on its IPv4 interface.

   Home agent has a table of IPV6_TRASM_ADDRESS prefixes.  This table
   normally contains a single entry, i.e. the local prefix value.  It
   may be populated by more entries in case of handover as described in
   Section 6.  The entries are kept as soft-state and removed after a
   period of no activity.

   Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST support at least one
   IPV6_TRSSM_ADDRESS prefix.  Multicast anchor at the home agent MUST
   support IGMPv3 on its IPv4 interface as source filtering needed for
   SSM is supported only by IGMPv3.


8.  Security Considerations

   For IPv4-only or dual stack mobile nodes security considerations
   stated in [RFC5555] apply.  This document specifies procedures for
   MIPv6 [RFC3775] for the case of IPv6-only mobile nodes which are not
   covered in [RFC5555].  Security considerations for IPv4 interface of
   the home agent is similar to [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   and the considerations stated there apply.


9.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
