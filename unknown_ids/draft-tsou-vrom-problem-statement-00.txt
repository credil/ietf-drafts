      Virtual Resource Operations & Management in the Data Center
                  draft-tsou-vrom-problem-statement-00

Abstract

   The adoption of cloud computing brings a number of benefits but also
   a number of challenges to the data center operations.  Such
   challenges include automation and management of data center resources
   including servers, storage and networking elements.  In particular,
   this document describes the problem of operational and management
   challenges that virtualization brings in the (carrier) cloud data
   center as an enabler of new technologies such as self-provisioning
   and elastic capacity and related benefits of consolidation, reduced
   total cost of ownership, and energy management.  This document does
   not cover the problem of address resolution in massive data centers.
   It does not cover technologies related to VDI either.

1.  Introduction

   Virtualization increasing adoption in the data center, involving
   resources such as servers, storage and although still evolving, the
   network as well, it has helped deliver some of the essential
   characteristics of cloud computing [NIST800-145].  Those cloud
   characteristics include: measured Service, rapid elasticity, on-
   demand self service, resource pooling, and broad network access.  The
   resulting virtualized data center resources need to be
   operationalized and managed with new tools and techniques that are
   still in process of maturing.

   In addition, vendors are providing equipment and services categorized
   as the so-called unified computing stack [UCStack], the set of
   converging technologies supported by products of server CPU, I/O,
   storage connectivity, and network elements at the core of the
   virtualized data center.  Carrier and other service providers are
   deliverying cloud services most commonly using the service model
   known as IaaS, or Infrastructure-as-a-Service.  The need to mix and
   match products from different vendors can lead to interoperability
   challenges that need to be addressed by standards from the start, or
   risk vendor lock-in.

   This document focuses on the problem statement of various data center
   virtual resources operations and management areas.  This document
   does not cover the problem of address resolution in massive data
   centers nor the problem of technologies known as VDI.

3.  Operational Challenges for Virtualization

   A number of challenges arise at the virtualized data center
   supporting cloud services.  Some of them are:

   1.  New devices and elements

       *  Monitor VM lifecycle, including VM migration ("lift & shift")

       *  Address management for VM lifecycle support

       *  Resource monitoring for faults and abnormal conditions

       *  Resource availability, peformance metrics and usage based
          metering

       *  Hypervisor status and interface monitoring

   2.  Infrastructure management support

       *  Connectivity needs for virtualization management

       *  Policy management and enforcement in the Virtualized DC

       *  IPFIX for virtualization performance management

       *  Interoperability of multiple hypervisors

       *  Open programmatic interfaces to support access and management
          of Datacenter contents and resources

   3.  Service management enablement

       *  Supporting secure low-latency VLAN and VPN connections in
          large scale on on-demand (pay as you go) basis for capacity
          management of dedicated pool of resources

       *  Service hosting, co-location, and distributed virtualized
          redundancy for seamless scaling

       *  Facilities management including premises, security, privacy
          and data integrity management for regulatory compliancy

       *  Management of virtual private clouds (VPC), VPN-based clouds


4.  VM Migration Operational Challenges

   VM migration, also called by other names such as VM Motion, "lift &
   shift", etc., implies moving a VM to another location within a data
   center, or even to a different data center, with the consequent
   operational and management challenges.

   Just to name a few of the challenges:

   o  Policy reconfiguration in the destination device

   o  Other dynamic information updating in destination

   o  Address management and reconfiguration when involving different
      data centers

   In addition, there are a few models for the interconnection of
   clouds, such as cloud peering and brokering [GartnerCB], already
   working their way into real implementations that will allow more
   complex VM migration schemes but that also represent their own set of
   operational and management challenges.


5.  VPC Operational Challenges

   From the cloud deployment models, the VPC or VOCS is a variant within
   the IaaS model that brings together most of the operational
   requirements into the unified computing stack, and in particular the
   network side, directly.  VPC embodies Cloud Services that are
   delivered over a virtual private network (VPN) and therefore the VPN
   protocols and implementations need to be enhanced to support cloud
   "characteristics" including operational requirements.  At a higher
   level, a VPC needs to meet SLA and enfore policies, meet demands from
   the management of order requests, self-provisioning, usage-based
   metering, and management, either through programmatic interfaces or
   by other means.

   There are two cases, 1) the pure play cloud provider, that needs to
   use another carrier to interconnect the different data centers, and
   2) the carrier offering over their own network.  In both of those
   cases, the VPN protocols need operations to support end-to-end SLA
   monitoring or even just internal service level objectives in addition
   to customer SLA, all which requires corresponding metrics, based on
   usage per resource and per customer.

   In the second case, there are additional improvements that can be
   made as in the case of the deployment of a Data Center Edge device
   (DE), a box in between the data center and the network edge that will
   simplify provisioning and operations by eliminating the need of a
   CE-PE pair.


6.  Conclusion and Recommendation

   With the new networking, server and storage technologies converging
   in to the data center in the form of a unified computing stack at
   whose core is virtualization stack, many new operational and
   management challenges arise.

   Therefore, we recommend that the IETF engage in the study of the
   problem of virtualized resources operations and management in the
   data center and, if appropriate, the development of interoperable
   solutions.

   This document does not add additional manageability considerations.
