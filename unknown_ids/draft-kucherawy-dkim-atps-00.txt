Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment            September 2010


1.  Introduction

   [DKIM] defines a mechanism for transparent domain-level signing of
   messages for the purpose of declaring that a particular
   Administrative Mail Domain (ADMD) takes some responsibility for a
   message.  [ADSP] creates a mechanism by which an ADMD can declare
   that mail from it is expected to include a valid DKIM signature from
   that same ADMD, and mail that does not should be considered suspect
   or even discarded by receivers.

   Absent is a mechanism by which an ADMD can announce that signatures
   on its mail from other ADMDs should also be considered acceptable by
   verifiers.  This memo presents an experimental mechanism for doing
   so.

   The results of this experiment are intended to yield statistics or
   other information as to the efficacy of this or similar models, and
   may lead to either evolution of this work toward the Standards Track
   or to its abandonment.  We anticipate at least a few interoperating
   implementations in short order so that the experiment may begin.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  E-Mail Architecture Terminology

   Readers should be familiar with the material and terminology
   discussed in [MAIL] and [EMAIL-ARCH].

3.  Discussion

   Participation in this experiment is divided into two parties:
   Senders, whose domains appear in the RFC5322.From field of a [MAIL]
   message, and Verifiers, who implement the validation procedures
   described in [DKIM] and [ADSP].

   A Sender participates in this protocol if it wishes to announce that
   a message from it (in the RFC5322.From sense) should be considered
   valid as long as it bears a signature from any in a list of specified
   domains.  One might, for example, wish to delegate signing authority
   for its DNS domain to an approved messaging service provider.

   A Verifier participates in this protocol if it wishes to ensure that

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment            September 2010


   a message bears one or more signatures from sources approved to sign
   mail on behalf of the Sender, and identify for special treatment mail
   that does not meet that criterion.

   A Verifier with this interest has presumably already implemented ADSP
   and is therefore making one DNS query for each DKIM signature (to
   retrieve the matching public key) on the message, and one to check
   for any published ADSP record.  Given this, it seems to make sense
   that the ADSP record is the right place to declare that this
   extension is in use.  Therefore, a tag indicating this extension will
   be added to ADSP.

4.  Queries and Replies

   This section describes in detail the queries issued, the replies
   received, and how they should be interpreted and applied.

4.1.  Extension to ADSP

   [ADSP] replies contain a "tag=value" sequence, but only one tag
   ("dkim") is currently defined.

   This protocol will add an additional tag "atps" whose value is "y" if
   this extension is in use.  The absence of this flag, or any other
   value in the tag, MUST be ignored and the verifier MUST act as if
   this protocol is not in use.

   The formal syntax definition, per [ABNF]:

           adsp-atps-tag = %x61.74.70.73 *WSP "=" *WSP %x79

   The registration for this tag can be found in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].

4.2.  ATPS Query Details

   If a Sender announces via the ADSP extension that it is using this
   protocol and the Verifier is also participating, then the Verifier
   issues a TXT query to the DNS to a specific name looking for
   confirmation by the sender that a particular third party signature is
   authorized by the Sender.  The query SHOULD be repeated for every
   domain found in the "d=" tag of a [DKIM] signature on the message
   that verified.  These MAY be done in any order or in parallel.

   Where the RFC5322.From field contains multiple addresses, this
   process MAY be repeated for each domain found in the field, and these
   MAY be done in any order.

   The name for the query is constructed as follows:



Kucherawy                Expires March 25, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment            September 2010


   1.  Extract the value of the "d=" tag from the signature and feed it
       to the [MD5] hash algorithm.

   2.  Convert the output of the MD5 hash to a string of 32 hexadecimal
       digits, two for each byte in the hash output, in order.  Where
       alphabetic characters are needed in the conversion, lowercase
       characters should be used.

   3.  Append the string "._atps."

   4.  Append the domain name found in the RFC5322.From field of the
       message.

   The formal syntax definition, per [ABNF]:

           atps-query = 32*HEXDIG %x2e.5f.61.74.70.73.2e domain-name

   The "domain-name" is as defined in Section 3.5 of [DKIM].

   See Appendix A for an example of a query construction.

   Since the size of a [DNS] query is limited to 255 bytes, the size of
   "domain-name" in the ABNF above is constrained to 216 bytes.

4.3.  ATPS Reply Details

   At this time, only three possibilities need to be identified in this
   specification:

   o  An answer is returned (i.e.  [DNS] reply code NOERROR).  In this
      case, the protocol has been satisfied and the Verifier may
      conclude that the signing domain is authorized by the Sender to
      sign its mail.  Further queries SHOULD NOT be initiated.  There is
      at present no need to parse the content (if any) but this is
      likely to be needed as this protocol is extended.

   o  No answer is returned (i.e.  [DNS] reply code NXDOMAIN).  In this
      case, the "d=" domain has not been authorized to act as a third-
      party signer for this Sender, and thus the Verifier MUST continue
      to the next query.

   o  An error is returned (i.e. any other [DNS] reply code).  It is no
      longer possible to determine whether or not this message satisfies
      the Sender's list of authorized third-party signers.  The Verifier
      SHOULD stop processing and defer the message for later processing,
      such as requesting temporary failure code from the MTA.

   If all queries are completed and return NXDOMAIN, then the message

   does not satisfy the policy advertised by the Sender, and the
   action(s) suggested by the "dkim" tag in the ADSP reply SHOULD be
   applied.

5.  IANA Considerations

   No actions are required by IANA at this time.  The following need
   only be applied if and when this specification reaches the Standards
   Track.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses potential security issues related to this
   experimental protocol.

6.1.  Transient Security Failures

   Approving a third party signer exposes the Sender to the risk that
   the third party signer becomes compromised and then begins to sign
   malicious or nuisance messages on behalf of the Sender.  This can
   obviously reflect negatively on the Sender, and the impact of this
   can become more severe as automated domain reputation systems are
   developed and deployed.  Thorough vetting and monitoring practices by
   Senders of third party signers will likely need to become the norm.

6.2.  Load on the DNS

   A Verifier participating in DKIM, ADSP and ATPS will now issue a
   number of TXT queries to the DNS equal to two plus twice the number



Kucherawy                Expires March 25, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            DKIM ATPS Experiment            September 2010


   of valid signatures on the message plus the number of invalid
   signatures on the message.  This is in addition to any PTR and A
   queries the MTA may issue at the time the actual message relaying or
   delivery is initiated.  Obviously this can be burdensome on the DNS
   resolver, and waiting for that number of queries to return when they
   are issued in parallel can trigger timeouts in the MTA.

   An alternative to this that has not yet been explored is the storage
   of the ATPS data at a specific URL tied to the Sender's domain name.
   This would alleviate pressure on the DNS at the expense of requiring
   the Sender to operate a web server and the addition of the
   establishment of a TCP connection.  Moreover, the Verifier would be
   well advised to implement caching of this data to prevent ATPS from
   being used as a denial-of-service vector.

Appendix A.  Example Query and Reply

   This section presents an example of the use of this protocol to query
   for a third-party authorization and discusses the interpretation of
   the result.

   Presume a message for which the RFC5322.From domain is "example.com",
   and it bears two valid signatures, one from "one.example.net" and one
   from "two.example.net".  The following actions are taken:

   1.  A TXT query is made, per [ADSP], to
       "_adsp._domainkey.example.com" to query for its Author Domain
       Signing Practices.  If no valid reply is returned or the reply
       does not contain an "atps" tag with value "y", the algorithm
       stops with [AUTHRES] result "none".

   2.  An MD5 hash of "one.example.net" is computed and converted to
       hexadecimal form.  The result of this is the string
       "5d6794099a6ce988a5a7ec5f4c285a42".

   3.  A TXT query is issued to
       "5d6794099a6ce988a5a7ec5f4c285a42._atps.example.com".

   4.  If a reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES] result
       "pass".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is returned, the
       algorithm stops with a result of "temperror" or "permerror" as
       appropriate.

   5.  An MD5 hash of "two.example.net" is computed and converted to
       hexadecimal form.  The result of this is the string
       "69ccfaf20790ccf4e348eabc61ed86ad".

   6.  A TXT query is issued to
       "69ccfaf20790ccf4e348eabc61ed86ad._atps.example.com".

   7.  If a reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES] result
       "pass".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is returned, the
       algorithm stops with a result of "temperror" or "permerror" as
       appropriate.

   8.  As there are no valid signatures left to test, the algorithm
       stops with a result of "unknown", "fail" or "discard" as per the
       value on the ADSP "dkim" tag.
