             Media Type for Sensor Markup Language (SENML)
                        draft-jennings-senml-03

Abstract

   This specification defines media types for representing simple sensor
   measurements in JSON.  A simple sensor, such as a temperature sensor,
   could use this media type in protocols such as HTTP to transport the
   values of a sensor.

Internet-Draft                Sensor Markup               September 2010


1.  Overview

   Connecting sensors to the internet is not new, and there have been
   many protocols designed to facilitate it.  This specification defines
   new media types for carrying simple sensor information in a protocol
   such as HTTP or CoAP[I-D.shelby-core-coap].  This format was designed
   so that processors with very limited capabilities could easily encode
   a sensor reading into the media type, while at the same time a server
   parsing the data could relatively efficiently collect a large number
   of sensor readings.  There are many types of more complex
   measurements and readings that this media type would not be suitable
   for.  A decision was made not to carry most of the meta data about
   the sensor in this media type to help reduce the size of the data and
   improve efficiency in decoding.

   JSON[RFC4627] was selected as a basis for the encoding as it
   represents a widely understood way of encoding data that is popular
   in current web based APIs and represents reasonable trade-offs
   between extensibility, simplicity, and efficiency.

   The data is structured as a single JSON object (with attributes) that
   contains an array of measurements.  Each measurement is a JSON object
   that has attributes such as a unique identifier for the sensor, the
   time the measurement was made, and the current value.  For example,
   the following shows a measurement from a temperature gauge in JSON
   syntax.

   {"m":[{ "n": "0017f202a5c5-Temp", "v":23.5, "u":"degC" }]}

   In the example above, the array in the object has a single
   measurement for a sensor named "0017f202a5c5-Temp" with a temperature
   of 23.5 degrees Celsius.


2.  Requirements and Design Goals

   The design goal is to be able to send simple sensor measurements in
   small packets on mesh networks from large numbers of constrained
   devices.  Keeping the total size under 80 bytes makes this easy to
   use on a wireless mesh network.  It is always difficult to define
   what small code is, but there is a desire to be able to implement
   this in roughly 1 KB of flash on a 8 bit microprocessor.  Experience
   with Google power meter and other large scale deployments has
   indicated strongly that the solution needs to support allowing
   multiple measurements to be batched into a single HTTP request.  This
   "batch" upload capability allows the server side to efficiently
   support a large number of devices.  The multiple measurements could
   be from multiple related sensors or from the same sensor but at

   different times.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Semantics

   Each media type caries a single JSON object that represents a set of
   measurements.  This object contains several optional attributes
   described below, followed by an mandatory array of one or more
   measurements.

   bn:  This is a base name string that is perpended to the names found
      in the measurements.  This attribute is optional.
   bt:  A base time that is added to the time found in a measurement.
      This attribute is optional.
   ver:  Version number of media type format.  This attribute is
      optional positive integer and defaults to 1 if not present.
   m: Array of measurements.  Required, and there must be at least one
      measurement in the array.

   Each measurement contains several attributes, some of which are
   optional and some of which are mandatory.

   n: Name of sensor.  When appended to the "bn" attribute, this must
      result in a globally unique identifier for the sensor.
   u: Units for the sensor value.  Optional.  Acceptable values are
      specified in Section 7.1
   v: Value of sensor.  Optional if an s value is present, otherwise
      required.
   s: Integrated sum of the sensor values over time.  Optional.  This
      attribute is in the units specified in the u value multiplied by
      seconds.
   t: Time when measurement was made.  Optional.

   Open Issue:  Ongoing conversations around Privacy, Accuracy/
   Confidence, Valid time, and tags.

   The bt, v, s, and t attributes are floating point numbers.  Systems
   receiving measurements MUST be able to process the range of numbers
   that are representable as an IEEE double-precision floating-point
   numbers [IEEE.754.1985].  The number of significant digits in any
   measurement is not relevant, so a reading of 1.1 has exactly the same

   semantic meaning as 1.10.  If the value has an exponent, the "e" MUST
   be in lower case.  The mantissa SHOULD be less than 19 characters
   long and the exponent SHOULD be less than 5 characters long.

   Systems reading one of the JSON objects MUST check for the ver
   attribute.  If this value is a version number larger than the version
   which system understands, the system SHOULD NOT use this JSON object.
   This allows the version number to indicate that the object contains
   mandatory to understand attributes.  New version numbers can only be
   defined in RFC which update this specification or it successors.

   The n value is concatenated to the bn value to get the name of the
   sensor.  The resulting name needs to uniquely identity and
   differentiate the sensor from all others.  If the name contains 48
   bits of random material, or 48 bits of material that is procedurally
   assigned in a unique way, it is considered to be good enough
   uniqueness.  One way to achieve this uniqueness is to include a
   EUI-48 identifier (A MAC address) or some other 48 bit identifier
   that is guaranteed uniqueness (such as a 1-wire address) that is
   assigned to the device.  UUIDs [RFC4122] are another way to generate
   a unique name.

   The resulting concatenated name MUST consist only of characters out
   of the set "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", "-", ":", ".", or "_"
   and it MUST start with a character out of the set "A" to "Z", "a" to
   "z", or "0" to "9".  This restricted character set was chosen so that
   these names can be directly used as in other types of URI including
   segments of an HTTP path with no special encoding.
   [I-D.ietf-6man-text-addr-representation] contains advice on encoding
   an IPv6 address in a name.

   If either the bt or t value is missing, the missing attribute is
   considered to have a value of zero.  The bt and t values are added
   together to get the time of measurement.  A time of zero is
   considered to mean that the sensor does not know the time and the
   measurement was made roughly "now".  A negative value is used to
   indicate seconds in the past from roughly "now".  A positive value is
   used to indicate the number of seconds since the start of the year
   1970 in UTC excluding leap seconds.

   Open Issue:  Should this be atomic seconds instead of "Unix" style
   time?

   Open Issue:  What about NaN and Infinity in the floating point
   numbers?

   Open Issue:  If bt & t where floating point, this would allow sub
   second precision.  What time precision is needed?

   Open Issue:  What to do about Y2K38 problem that comes form
   representing time in this way?  This is coming up very soon and will
   no doubt impact devices using this.  Would it be better to use an
   epoch of 2010 instead of 1970?  There does not seem to be any need to
   represent values before 2010.  Would using a floating point double
   work better?


5.  Syntax

   All of the data is UTF-8, but since this is for machine to machine
   communications on constrained systems, only characters with code
   points between U+0001 and U+007F are allowed.

   The contents MUST consist of exactly one JSON object as specified by
   [RFC4627].  This object MAY contain a "bn" attribute with a value of
   type string.  This object MAY contain a "bt" attribute with a value
   of type number.  The object MAY contain other attribute value pairs.
   The object MUST contain exactly one "m" attribute with a value of
   type array.  The array MUST have one or more measurement objects.

   Inside each measurement object the "n" and "u" attribute are of type
   string and the "t", "v", and "s" attributes are of type number.

5.1.  Simple Example

   The following shows a temperature reading taken approximately "now":
   {"m":[{ "n": "0017f202a5c5-Temp", "v":23.5 }]}

5.2.  Complex Example

   The following example show the voltage at Tue Jun 8 18:01:16 UTC 2010
   along with the current at that time and at each second for the
   previous 5 seconds.
   {"m":[
        { "n": "voltage", "u": "V",
              "v": 120.1, "anExtension": 0.0 },
        { "n": "current", "t": -5, "v": 1.2 },
        { "n": "current", "t": -4, "v": 1.30 },
        { "n": "current", "t": -3, "v": 0.14e1 },
        { "n": "current", "t": -2, "v": 1.5 },
        { "n": "current", "t": -1, "v": 1.6 },
        { "n": "current", "t": 0   "v": 1.7 },
          ]
    "bn": "0017f202a5c5",
    "bt": 1276020076,
     "someExtensions": "a value",
   }

6.  Usage Considerations

   The measurements support sending both the current value of a sensor
   as well as the an integrated sum.  For many types of measurements,
   the sum is more useful than the current value.  For example, an
   electrical meter that measures the energy a given computer uses will
   typically want to measure the cumulative amount of energy used.  This
   is less prone to error than reporting the power each second and
   trying to have something on the server side sum together all the
   power measurements.  If the network between the sensor and the meter
   goes down over some period of time, when it comes back up, the
   cumulative sum helps reflect what happened while the network was
   down.  A meter like this would typically report a measurement with
   the units set to watts, but it would put the sum of energy used in
   the "s" attribute of the measurement.  It might optionally include
   the current power in the "v" attribute.

   While the benefit of using the integrated sum is fairly clear for
   measurements like power and energy, it is less obvious for something
   like voltage.  Reporting the sum of the temperatures makes it easy to
   compute averages even when the individual temperature values are not
   reported frequently enough to compute accurate averages.
   Implementors are encouraged to report the cumulative sum as well as
   the raw value of a given sensor.

   Applications that use the cumulative sum values need to understand
   they are very loosely defined by this specification, and depending on
   the particular sensor implementation may behave in unexpected ways.
   Applications should be able to deal with the following issues:

   1.  Many sensors will allow the cumulative sums to "wrap" back to
       zero after the value gets sufficiently large.
   2.  Some sensors will reset the cumulative sum back to zero when the
       device is reset, loses power, or is replaced with a different
       sensor.
   3.  Applications cannot make assumptions about when the device
       started accumulating values into the sum.

   Typically applications can make some assumptions about specific
   sensors that will allow them to deal with these problems.  A common
   assumption is that for sensors whose measurement values are always
   positive, the sum should never get smaller; so if the sum does get
   smaller, the application will know that one of the situations listed
   above has happened.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA"
   with the RFC number of this specification.

7.1.  Units Registry

   IANA will create a registry of unit symbols.  The primary purpose of
   this registry is to make sure that symbols uniquely map to give type
   of measurement.  Definitions for many of these units can be found in
   [NIST822] and [BIPM].

   New entries can be added to the registration by either Expert Review
   or IESG Approval as defined in [RFC5226].  Experts should exercise
   their own good judgement but need to consider the following
   guidelines:

   1.   There needs to be a real and compelling use for any new unit to
        be added.
   2.   Units should define the semantic information and be chosen
        carefully.  Implementors need to remember that the same word may
        be used in different real-life contexts.  For example, degrees
        when measuring latitude have no semantic relation to degrees
        when measuring temperature; thus two different units are needed.
   3.   These measurements are produced by computers for consumption by
        computers.  The principle is that conversion has to be easily be
        done when both reading and writing the media type.  The value of
        a single canonical representation outweighs the convenience of
        easy human representations or loss of precision in a conversion.
   4.   Use of SI prefixes such as "k" before the unit is not allowed.
        Instead one can represent the value using scientific notation
        such a 1.2e3.
   5.   For a given type of measurement, there will only be one unit
        type defined.  So for length, meters are defined and other
        lengths such as mile, foot, light year are not allowed.  For
        most cases, the SI unit is preferred.
   6.   Symbol names that could be easily confused with existing common
        units or units combined with prefixes should be avoided.  For
        example, selecting a unit name of "mph" to indicate something
        that had nothing to do with velocity would be a bad choice, as
        "mph" is commonly used to mean mile per hour.
   7.   The following should not be used because the are common SI
        prefixes:  Y, Z, E, P, T, G, M, k, h, da, d, c, n, u, p, f, a,
        z, y, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi, Ei, Zi, Yi.
   8.   The following units should not be used as they are commonly used
        to represent other measurements Ky, Gal, dyn, etg, P, St, Mx, G,
        Oe, Gb, sb, Lmb, ph, Ci, R, RAD, REM, gal, bbl, qt, degF, Cal,
        BTU, HP, pH, B/s, psi, Torr, atm, at, bar, kWh.
   9.   The unit names are case sensitive and the correct case needs to
        be used, but symbols that differ only in case should not be
        allocated.

   10.  A number after a unit typically indicates the previous unit
        raised to that power, and the / indicates that the units that
        follow are the reciprocal.  A unit should have only one / in the
        name.

7.2.  Media Type Registration

   The following registrations are done following the procedure
   specified in [RFC4288] and [RFC3023].

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA"
   with the RFC number of this specification.

7.2.1.  senml+json Media Type Registration

   To:  ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject:  Registration of media type application/senml+json

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  senml+json

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  none

   Encoding considerations:  Must be encoded as binary.  See additional
   constraints in [RFC4627].

   Security considerations:  Sensor data can contain a wide range of
   information ranging from information that is very public, such the
   outside temperature in a given city, to very private information that
   requires integrity and confidentiality protection, such as patient
   health information.  This format does not provide any security and
   instead relies on the transport protocol that carries it to provide
   security.  Given applications need to look at the overall context of
   how this media type will be used to decide if the security is
   adequate.

   Interoperability considerations:  JSON allows new fields to be
   defined and applications should be able to ignore fields they do not
   understand to ensure forward compatibility with extensions to this
   specification.

   Published specification:  RFC-AAAA

   Applications that use this media type:  N/A

8.  Security Considerations

   Sensor data can range from information with almost no security
   considerations, such as the current temperature in a given city, to
   highly sensitive medical or location data.  This specification
   provides no security protection for the data but is meant to be used
   inside another container or transport protocol such as S/MIME or HTTP
   with TLS that can provide integrity, confidentiality, and
   authentication information about the source of the data.

   Further discussion of security proprieties can be found in
   Section 7.2.


9.  Acknowledgement

   Campbell and Carsten Bormann for their review comments.
