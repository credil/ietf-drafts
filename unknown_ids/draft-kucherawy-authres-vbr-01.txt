Internet-Draft        Auth-Results VBR Registration        November 2010


1.  Introduction

   [AUTHRES] defined a new header field for electronic mail messages
   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in a
   machine-readable format.  In the interim, a proposal for rudimentary
   domain-level reputation called Vouch By Reference [VBR] was published
   and is now beginning to see popular use.

   Fortunately, [AUTHRES] created IANA registries of reporting
   properties, enabling an easy remedy for this problem.  This memo thus
   registers an additional reporting property allowing a VBR result to
   be relayed as an annotation in a message header.

2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  Discussion

   Vouch By Reference [VBR] introduced a mechanism by which a message
   receiver can query a "vouching" service to determine whether or not a
   trusted third party is willing to state that mail from a particular
   source can be considered legitimate.  When this assessment is done at
   an inbound border mail gateway, it would be useful to relay the
   result of that assessment to internal mail entities such as filters
   or user agents.

4.  Definition

   This memo adds to the "Email Authentication Method Name Registry",
   created by IANA upon publication of [AUTHRES], the "header.md" and
   "header.mv" reporting items.

   The value associated with "header.md" in the header field MUST be the
   DNS domain name about which a VBR query was made.  This is typically
   taken from the "md" tag of the "VBR-Info" header filed.  ([VBR]
   describes the methods for selecting the construction and execution of
   that query.)

   The value associated with "header.mv" in the header field MUST be the
   DNS domain that was queried as the potential voucher for the
   "header.md" domain.  This is typically one of the values of the "mv"
   tag in the "VBR-Info" header field on the message being evaluated,
   although a local list of vouchers may be used in place of that value
   as described in [VBR].

   Where the VBR-Info header field was not present on a message but a
   mail server decides to conduct a VBR query anyway, the server MAY
   still generate an Authentication-Results field to relay the results
   of the VBR query.  In this instance, the "header.md" value MUST be
   the domain name that was evaluated as the sending domain using VBR,
   and the "header.mv" value MUST be the domain name that was used as
   the voucher.

   This memo also adds to the "Email Authentication Results Name
   Registry" the following result codes and definitions:

   none:  No valid VBR-Info header was found in the message, or a domain
      name to be queried could not be determined.

   pass:  A VBR query was completed and the vouching service queried
      gave a positive response.

   fail:  A VBR query was completed and the vouching service queried did
      not give a positive response, or the message contained multiple
      VBR-Info header fields with different "mc" values.

   temperror:  A VBR query was attempted but could not be completed due
      to some error that is likely transient in nature such as a
      temporary DNS error.  A later attempt may produce a final result.

   permerror:  A VBR query was attempted but could not be completed due
      to some error that is likely not transient in nature such as a
      permanent DNS error.  A later attempt is unlikely to produce a
      final result.

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo creates a mechanism for relaying [VBR] results using the
   structure already defined by [AUTHRES].  The Security Considerations
   sections of those documents should be consulted.

Appendix A.  Authentication-Results Examples

   This section presents an example of the use of this new item header
   field to indicate VBR results.

A.1.  VBR Results

   A message that triggered a VBR query, returning a result:

        Authentication-Results: mail-router.example.net;

                    header.b=oINEO8hg;

                    header.md=newyork.example.com
                    header.mv=voucher.example.org
        Received: from newyork.example.com
                  (newyork.example.com [192.0.2.250])
              by mail-router.example.net (8.11.6/8.11.6)
                  for <recipient@example.net>
                  with ESMTP id i7PK0sH7021929;

        Message-Id: <12345.abc@newyork.example.com>
        Subject: here's a sample

   Example 1: Header field reporting results from a VBR query

   Here we see an example of a message that was signed using DKIM and
   also included a VBR-Info header field.  On receipt it is found that
   the "md=" field in the latter and the "d=" field in the former
   matched and also that the DKIM signature verified, so a VBR query was
   performed.  The vouching service, voucher.example.org, indicated the
   sender can be trusted, so a "pass" result is included in the
   Authentication-Results field affixed prior to delivery.
