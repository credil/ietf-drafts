Abstract

   By default, message header parameters in Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) messages can not carry characters outside the ISO-8859-1
   character set.  RFC 2231 defines an escaping mechanism for use in
   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) headers.  This document
   specifies a profile of that encoding suitable for use in HTTP.

Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

   There are multiple HTTP headers that already use RFC 2231 encoding in
   practice (Content-Disposition) or might use it in the future (Link).
   The purpose of this document is to provide a single place where the

Internet-Draft          RFC2231 Encoding in HTTP             August 2008


1.  Introduction

   By default, message header parameters in HTTP ([RFC2616]) messages
   can not carry characters outside the ISO-8859-1 character set
   ([ISO-8859-1]).  RFC 2231 ([RFC2231]) defines an escaping mechanism
   for use in MIME headers.  This document specifies a profile of that
   encoding for use in HTTP.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the augmented BNF notation defined in Section
   2.1 of [RFC2616], including its rules for linear whitespace (LWS).
   [[LWS: This needs to be checked.]]

   Non-ASCII characters used in prose for examples are encoded using the
   format "Backslash-U with Delimiters", defined in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC5137].

   Note that this specification uses the term "character set" for
   consistency with other IETF specifications such as RFC 2277 (see
   [RFC2277], Section 3).  A more accurate term would be "character
   encoding" (a mapping of code points to octet sequences).


3.  A Profile of RFC 2231 for Use in HTTP

   RFC 2231 defines several extensions to MIME.  The sections below
   discuss if and how they apply to HTTP.

   In short:

   o  Parameter Continuations aren't needed (Section 3.1),

   o  Character Set and Language Information are useful, therefore a
      simple subset is specified (Section 3.2), and

   o  Language Specifications in Encoded Words aren't needed
      (Section 3.3).

Internet-Draft          RFC2231 Encoding in HTTP             August 2008


3.1.  Parameter Continuations

   Section 3 of [RFC2231] defines a mechanism that deals with the length
   limitations that apply to MIME headers.  These limitations do not
   apply to HTTP ([RFC2616], Section 19.4.7).

   Thus in HTTP, senders MUST NOT use parameter continuations, and
   therefore recipients do not need to support them.

3.2.  Parameter Value Character Set and Language Information

   Section 4 of [RFC2231] specifies how to embed language information
   into parameter values, and also how to encode non-ASCII characters,
   dealing with restrictions both in MIME and HTTP header parameters.

   However, RFC 2231 does not specify mandatory-to-implement character
   encoding, making it hard for senders to decide which character set to
   use.  Thus, recipients implementing this specification MUST support
   the character sets "ISO-8859-1" [ISO-8859-1] and "UTF-8" [RFC3629].

   Furthermore, RFC 2231 allows leaving out the character encoding
   information.  The profile defined by this specification does not
   allow that.

   The syntax for parameters is defined in Section 3.6 of [RFC2616]:

     parameter     = attribute "=" value


     attribute     = token
     value         = token | quoted-string

     quoted-string = <quoted-string, defined in [RFC2616], Section 2.2>
     token         = <token, defined in [RFC2616], Section 2.2>

   This specification extends the grammar to:

     parameter     = reg-parameter | ext-parameter

     reg-parameter = attribute "=" value
     ext-parameter = attribute "*=" ext-value

     ext-value     = charset  "'" [ language ] "'" value-chars

     charset       = "UTF-8" | "ISO-8859-1" | ext-charset
                   ; NOTE: case-insensitive

     ext-charset   = token ; see IANA charset registry
                   ; (<http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>)

     language      = <Language-Tag, defined in [RFC4646], Section 2.1>

     value-chars   = *( pct-encoded | attr-char )

     pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

     attr-char     = ALPHA | DIGIT
                   | "-" | "." | "_" | "~" | ":"
                   | "!" | "$" | "&" | "+"

     ALPHA         = %x41-5A | %x61-7A
                   ; A-Z | a-z
     DIGIT         = %x30-39
                   ; any US-ASCII digit "0".."9"
     HEXDIG        = DIGIT | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"
                   ; NOTE: case-insensitive

3.2.1.  Examples

   Non-extended notation, using "token":

     foo: bar; title=Economy

   Non-extended notation, using "quoted-string":

     foo: bar; title="US-$ rates"

   Extended notation, using the unicode character \u'00A3' (POUND SIGN):

     foo: bar; title*=iso-8859-1'en'%A3%20rates

   Note: the Unicode pound sign character \u'00A3' was encoded using
   ISO-8859-1 into the single octet A3, then percent-encoded.  Also note
   that the space character was encoded as %20, as attr-char does not
   contain it.

   Extended notation, using the unicode characters \u'00A3' (POUND SIGN)
   and \u'20AC' (EURO SIGN):

     foo: bar; title*=UTF-8''%c2%a3%20and%20%e2%82%ac%20rates

   Note: the unicode pound sign character \u'00A3' was encoded using
   UTF-8 into the octet sequence C2 A3, then percent-encoded.  Likewise,
   the unicode euro sign character \u'20AC' was encoded into the octet
   sequence E2 82 AC, then percent-encoded.  Also note that HEXDIG
   allows both lower-case and upper-case character, so recipients must
   understand both, and that the language information is optional, while
   the character set is not.

3.3.  Language specification in Encoded Words

   Section 5 of [RFC2231] extends the encoding defined in [RFC2047] to
   also support language specification in encoded words.  Although the
   HTTP/1.1 does refer to RFC 2047 ([RFC2616], Section 2.2), it's not
   clear to which header field exactly it applies, and whether it is
   implemented in practice (see
   <http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/111> for details).

   Thus, the RFC 2231 profile defined by this specification does not
   include this feature.


4.  Guidelines for Usage in HTTP Header Definitions

   Specifications of HTTP headers that use the extensions defined in
   Section 3.2 should clearly state that.  The best way to achieve this
   is to normatively reference this specification, and to include the
   ext-parameter production into the ABNF for that header.

4.1.  When to Use the Extension

   Section 4.2 of [RFC2277] requires that protocol elements containing
   text can carry language information.  Thus, the ext-parameter
   production should always be used when the parameter value is of
   textual nature.

   Furthermore, the extension should also be used whenever the parameter
   value needs to carry characters not present in the US-ASCII
   ([USASCII]) character set (note that it would be unacceptable to
   define a new header that would be restricted to a subset of the
   Unicode character set).

4.2.  Error Handling

   Header specifications that include parameters should also specify
   whether same-named parameters can occur multiple times.  If
   repetitions are not allowed (and this is believed to be the common
   case), the specification should state whether regular or the extended
   syntax takes precedence.  In the latter case, this could be used by
   senders to use both formats without breaking recipients that do not
   understand the syntax.

   Example:

     foo: bar; title="EURO exchange rates";
               title*=utf-8''%e2%82%ac%20exchange%20rates

   In this case, the sender provides an ASCII version of the title for
   legacy recipient, but also includes an internationalized version for
   recipients understanding this specification -- the latter obviously
   should prefer the new syntax over the old one.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not discuss security issues and is not believed to
   raise any security issues not already endemic in HTTP.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA Considerations related to this specification.
