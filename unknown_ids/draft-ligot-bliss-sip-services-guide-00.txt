Abstract

   Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features and
   services requires to use numerous specifications.  Today, for each
   service in the scope of BLISS, one can already find references to
   many possible specifications which do not cover the same things.
   Some of them are primitive operations (GRUU, REFER, target dialog,
   ...), some are requirements or call flow examples, some others have a
   larger scope: TISPAN specs, SPIT to implement Call Barring...  The
   goal of this document is not to present the best solutions; but to
   give an overview of every standard specification related to these
   services, centralizing and categorizing them as input to the working
   group.

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              November 2007


1.  Introduction, scope

   BLISS working group is chartered to facilitate effective feature
   interoperability for advanced services sharing common functional
   primitives utilizing SIP.  In particular, it focuses on advanced call
   features requiring non-trivial call control.  Goal of this document
   is not to give recommendation or to give a technical appreciation of
   referenced specifications.  So, references that could be found in
   this document SHOULD NOT be considered as the recommended way of
   implementing any service.  This document aims at providing the
   current "snapshot" of "SIP services" specifications, centralizing
   what currently exist.

   This first version presented here shows that the number of
   specifications around call features is quite impressive, sometimes
   individual drafts have addressed a very specific problem that has
   been forgotten in the internet draft morgue.  Some other
   specifications like TISPAN ones have to be considered from a
   different point of view: they are most of the time referencing
   existing IETF specifications when they exist, generally trying to
   additionally standardize the format of a user profile which contains
   the configuration elements of the service.  This approach assumes
   that there is a user profile database, operated somewhere, which is
   of course completely out of IETF concerns.  In that case, goal is
   indeed not to give any appreciation on these external specifications,
   but it is still useful to describe what does exist, what difference
   MAY exist between them, and if they diverge, try to explain why.
   Thus, this document categorizes them in order to outline what is
   currently missing, which documents can be compared at the same
   "level", and when overlap between different specifications are
   identified, start analysing if there is a fundamental protocol change
   or requirement behind it.  Today, service categories that are
   considered as in-scope of BLISS are the following:

   o  Call forwarding

   o  Call Transfer

   o  Hold

   o  Call Baring

   o  Conference

   o  Call parking

   o  Do not disturb

   o  Call completion

   This list will be the starting point of this guide, it MAY be
   extended to other topics in the future if it is considered as useful.
   For each of these services, it provides: - first, a short description
   of the service, - second, user's requirements or frameworks which
   give grounds of any implementation, - third, references to documents
   that contain call flows showing the application of the service, -
   finally, a short description of any specification that has been
   identified (possibly erroneously) as useful to implement a service,
   giving some "hints" on why it is referenced in this context.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Call Forwarding

3.1.  Description

   Call forwarding allows users to divert a call from its destination
   without answering it.  There is a few cases of call forwarding.  For
   example, users should be able to forward calls towards another person
   when he is already on the phone, when he does not answer or when he
   is unavailable.  Call forwarding should also allow users to setup
   unconditional forwarding based on a set of rules.

   Call forwarding is also called "Call diversion".

3.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   none found

3.3.  Call flows samples

   o  sections 7,8,9 of [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] present some
      cases of call forwarding.  Theses call flows are mainly
      implementation dependant.  TS183 004 [TS183004], from TISPAN, uses
      call flows like those from sipping-service-examples but gives more
      specifications over the implementation.  In particular, it defines
      the user profile data model related to this service.

   o  section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-bliss-problem-statement] includes some
      examples of call forwarding.

3.4.  Specifications

   o  RFC4458 [RFC4458] specifies two new parameters for the contact
      field that could be added when a call is forwarded.  These
      parameters are 'cause' and 'target': they allow voicemails, for
      instance, to send an adapted greeting to the caller who has been
      transferred.  RFC4244 [RFC4244] introduces a new optional header:
      'history-info' which contains the list of previous target URIs of
      the call and could contain additional values such as the cause of
      each call forwarding, levels of privacy, etc.

   o  TS183 004 [TS183004] from TISPAN shows how to use a centralized
      server for holding configuration and how to allow users to manage
      their profile and configurations.

   o  RFC 3880 [RFC3880], CPL, presents a language which can be used by
      users in this context in order to upload rules of call forwarding
      to their proxy.  The proxy should interpret this set of rules and
      apply them without any action from the endpoint.

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              November 2007


   o  Like CPL, LESS [I-D.wu-iptel-less] is a language that could be
      used to configure call forwarding but on the terminal side.

   o  RFC 3841 [RFC3841] could be used to register fall back destination
      for a user.  It could also be used to register UA like voicemail.

   o  As call forwarding often comes with privacy requirements, RFC3323
      [RFC3323] could be helpful but it also introduces some
      requirements over the networks' infrastructure.

4.  Call Transfer

4.1.  Description

   Call transfer occurs when a communication is already established
   between parties and one of them, the transferor, wants to transfer
   the other party, the transferee, to another party, the target, which
   is not already a member of the dialog.

   Requirements for this services often include privacy and
   authentication.  The target of a transfer could be a service, a
   conference room, or something else...

   Transfer could be managed.  In this case, the transferor invites the
   target, establishes a communication with it while the other party is
   usually on hold and then ends its communication with it.  Finally, it
   transfers the tranferee to the target.

4.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  Section 4 of cc-transfer [I-D.ietf-sipping-cc-transfer] gives
      requirements of the service.

4.3.  Call flows samples

   o  Section 4, 5 and 6 of service-examples
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] present some call flows using
      REFER or MESSAGE in order to initiate the transfer.

   o  draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer [I-D.ietf-sipping-cc-transfer]
      gives more details about transfer using REFER.  This draft shows a
      lot of different cases using for example RFC3323 [RFC3323].  Call
      flows of TISPAN, TS183 029 [TS183029], are nearly the same.

4.4.  Specifications

   o  RFC 3515 [RFC3515] specifies the REFER method which allows a
      terminal to ask another terminal to send another SIP request.
      This is the most commonly used method for making transfer.

   o  When the target receives the REFER request, it sends, in most
      cases, an INVITE to the transferee.  The transferee SHOULD accept
      this INVITE.  RFC 3891 [RFC3891] and RFC 4538 [RFC4538] introduce
      new headers which allow the transferee to know that the new INVITE
      is related to another dialog.  RFC 3892 [RFC3892] lets it know who
      sent the REFER.  RFC3893 [RFC3893] allows to sign these
      informations.

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              November 2007


   o  REFER implies an event package, RFC 3265 [RFC3265], that can be
      suppressed using RFC 4488 [RFC4488].  This event package allows
      the transferor to get information about the status of the
      transfer.  INVITE can also imply events as specified in RFC4235
      [RFC4235].

   o  In order to prevent the INVITE generated by the REFER to reach all
      terminals of the transferee, GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] allows to
      get a direct address to the user agent concerned by the new
      INVITE.

   o  Presence [RFC3856] could be a source of information about the
      status of one user which can help application to define next
      target of a call.

   o  Users may desire to initiate a transfer which is not managed by
      their terminal.  In this case RFC 4730 [RFC4730] allows
      intermediaries to receive events from the keypad of the user's
      terminal.

   o  Like with RFC 3840 [RFC3840] and RFC 3841 [RFC3841], capabilities
      of the target could be received by the transferor using RFC 4508
      [RFC4508].

   o  Privacy [RFC3323]i is also a basic requirement for this service.

5.  Hold

5.1.  Description

   Justification of this service is that it is often useful to prevent
   the other party from listening to the conversation for a short
   period.  Instead of hearing the other party, the party on hold could
   hear a music.  Moreover, the terminal on hold SHOULD know it is on
   hold in order to give a correct feedback to the user.

5.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   none found

5.3.  Call flows samples

   o  section 1, 2 and 3 of service-examples
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] present some call flow cases
      of hold.

   o  TS183 010 [TS183010] from TISPAN use similar call flows.

5.4.  Specifications

   o  Call flows showed in both documents in previous section use RFC
      3725 [RFC3725], 3PCC, in order to change SDP parameters of the
      call.

   o  If music has to be sent from a server, a media server MAY be
      needed, this is partially defined into RFC4240 [RFC4240].

6.  Call Baring

6.1.  Description

   Users SHOULD be able to block, or make any preventive action on
   unsolicited calls based on a set of rules.  This service could be
   executed either on the endpoint or on an intermediary server.
   Service provider could also be interested in setting a set of rules
   on top of users ones.

6.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  draft-froment-sipping-spit-requirements
      [I-D.froment-sipping-spit-requirements].  This document defines a
      set of requirements to define policies allowing to make any kind
      of reactive actions to prevent SPIT.

   o  draft-tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction
      [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction].  This document
      describes a framework for the usage of SPIT policies.

6.3.  Call flows samples

   none found

6.4.  Specifications

   o  spit-policy [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy].  This is a
      policy document format specification proposal for the requirements
      defined in draft-froment-sipping-spit-requirements
      [I-D.froment-sipping-spit-requirements].  This can be used to
      implement Call barring, but scope is larger since it can be used
      to make white or black lists, or to have different reactive
      actions (block, polite block, ask for a Turing test, ask for
      consent, send an email...), depending on the policies.

   o  acr-code [I-D.ietf-sip-acr-code] defines criteria which can be
      used to reject calls: Privacy [RFC3323], using P-Asserted-Identity
      header [RFC3325] or by reading the content of From header.  It
      also defines an error code: 433.

   o  TS183 011 [TS183011] defines the service data model to be put on
      an application server and introduces a set of rules, based on
      Initial Filter Criterias (IFC) specified into TS183 033
      [TS183033].

   o  CPL [RFC3880] and LESS [I-D.wu-iptel-less] allow users to write
      down a set of rules, which are stored on a server for the first

7.  Conference

7.1.  Description

   Conference allows more than two peoples to speak together.  It may
   also provide users with some features like allowing to invite
   somebody inside the conference or moderate the room, ...  Most of
   these requirements are very well defined into RFC 4245 [RFC4245]

7.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  RFC4245 [RFC4245] only defines which conferencing requirements are
      expected from users.

   o  RFC4353 [RFC4353] does not specify any service but terms, roles,
      actions of each participant, user, software.

   o  RFC4597 [RFC4597] presents some scenarios of conference which
      could lead to some problems unless followed carefully.

7.3.  Call flows samples

   o  section 10 and 11 of service-examples
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] show some very basics call
      flows of conferencing.

7.4.  Specifications

   o  RFC 4575 [RFC4575] allows users to get information over the
      current room by defining an event package.  When a user joins a
      room, he could, for example, subscribe to this event package and
      receive notifications when somebody else join this room.  uri-
      list-conferencing [I-D.ietf-sip-uri-list-conferencing] gives
      another way to publish his URI while joining the conference and
      allows other users to retrieve the list of members of the current
      room.  conference-list-event
      [I-D.koren-sipping-conference-list-event] presents another list of
      events related to conferences.

   o  RFC 4579 [RFC4579] explains how to add or remove somebody from a
      conference room by using REFER/INVITE or REFER/BYE.  It also
      explains how to create a conference room using an INVITE and how
      headers like Join [RFC3911] or Replace [RFC3891] SHOULD be used.
      This document also presents features allowing users to change
      their User Agents without leaving the room or allowing users to
      convert simple dialog with two parties into a conference.  As
      adding somebody inside a conference is basically a transfer, there
      is more documentation of this in the "Transfer" section above.

   o  While members of a room MAY NOT have the same capabilities
      depending on their user agent, conference server should be able to
      do transcoding.  This is specified into:transc-conf
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-transc-conf] and
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-transc-framework].

   o  TS183 005 [TS183005] from TISPAN uses specifications from IETF.
      This document does not include any reference to RFC 4575 [RFC4575]

   o  RFC4240 [RFC4240] defines media servers and how they can be used
      for making announcements.  RFC 5022 [RFC5022] explains how to
      control them.

   o  Even if RFC 3550 [RFC3550] is not directly related to SIP, it
      specifies how RTP streams could be mixed.

   o  adhoc-conferencing [I-D.camarillo-sipping-adhoc-conferencing]
      gives specifications for using servers in ad-hoc mode.

8.  Call parking

8.1.  Description

   Call parking allows users to put a call on hold, hang up his terminal
   and retrieve the call from this terminal or from another terminal
   using a unique URI.

8.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   none found

8.3.  Call flows samples

   o  sections 15 and 16 of service-examples
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] show some very basic call
      flows of conferencing.

8.4.  Specifications

   o  A first specification of call parking could be found into:
      draft-procter-bliss-call-park-extension
      [I-D.procter-bliss-call-park-extension].

   o  Call parking could be considered as equivalent to two transfers to
      a kind of conference room.  In that case, specifications described
      above could be reused.

   o  The call which is parked could be considered as 'on hold'.

9.  Do not disturb

9.1.  Description

   This service should allow users to prevent temporary calls from one
   or all users from disturbing him.  This means he does not want INVITE
   messages matching pre-defined rules to make his terminal ring because
   he will not answer.

   There is, at the present time, no particular specification. (other
   than sending an error message from RFC 3261 [RFC3261], for example,
   to the caller).  However a draft: draft-elwell-bliss-dnd-00
   [I-D.elwell-bliss-dnd] gives an analysis of the current situation.

9.2.  Frameworks and requirements

11.  Conclusion

   This first version shows that specifications are actually numerous.
   It also shows that there is a lack of framework and requirements.
   Information is difficult to find, and is sometimes hidden in
   individual contributions which are not always understood by non-IETF
   people as "unofficial".  It MAY partially explain why SIP services
   implementors are not always satisfied and it clearly does not help
   interoperability.  That's why this document was created.  Some
   external references, like the TISPAN specification have a different
   objective and are difficult to compare since they take some
   assumptions on the network architecture, but they still sometimes
   contain protocol requirements that MAY be impact protocol
   specifications.  It is today an open issue to decide if this document
   should address features out of BLISS working group scope...
