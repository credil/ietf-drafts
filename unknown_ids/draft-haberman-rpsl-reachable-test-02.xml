    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The deployment of new IP connectivity typically results in
      intermittent reachability for numerous reasons which are outside the
      scope of this document. In order to aid in
      the debugging of these persistent problems, this document proposes the
      creation of a new Routing Policy Specification Language attribute <xref
      target="RFC4012"></xref> that allows a network to advertise an IP
      address which is reachable and can be used as a target for diagnostic
      tests (e.g., pings).</t>

      <t>The goal of this diagnostic address is to provide operators a means
      to advertise selected hosts that can be targets of tests for such common
      issues as reachability and Path MTU discovery.</t>

      <t>The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="RPSL Extension for Diagnostic Address">
      <t>Network operators wishing to provide a diagnostic address for its
      peers, customers, etc. can advertise its existence via the Routing
      Policy Specification Language <xref target="RFC4012"></xref> <xref
      target="RFC2622"></xref>. The pingable attribute is a member of the route
      and route6 objects in the RPSL. The pingable attribute has the following
      characteristics:</t>

      <texttable>
         <ttcol align="center">Attribute</ttcol>
         <ttcol align="center">Value</ttcol>
         <ttcol align="center">Type</ttcol>

         <c>pingable</c>
         <c>&lt;ipv6-address&gt; or &lt;ipv4-address&gt;</c>
         <c>mandatory, multi-valued</c>

         <c>ping-hdl</c>
         <c>&lt;nic-handle&gt;</c>
         <c>mandatory, multi-valued</c>
      </texttable>

      <t>The pingable attribute allows a network operator to advertise an IP address
      of a node which should be reachable from outside networks.  This node can be
      used as a destination address for diagnostic tests.  The ping-hdl provides a link to
      contact information for an entity capable of responding to queries concerning the specified
      IP address. An example of using the
      pingable attribute is shown in <xref target="rpsl-example"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Using the RPSL Pingable Attribute">
      <t>The presence of one or more pingable attributes signals to network
      operators that the maintainer of the referenced network is providing the
      address(es) for external diagnostic testing. Tests involving the
      advertised address(es) SHOULD be rate limited to no more than ten probes in a
      five minute window unless prior arrangements are made with the maintainer of
      the attribute.</t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>Randy Bush and David Farmer provided the original concept for the pingable
         attribute and useful comments on preliminary versions of this draft.  Joe Abley
         provided comments that justified moving the attribute to the route/route6 object and
         the inclusion of a point of contact. Larry Blunk provided useful comments to
         improve the document.</t>
