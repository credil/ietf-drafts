      <t>This document defines the encapsulation and forwarding functions
      applicable to packets traversing an MPLS-TP Label Switched Path
      (LSP), Pseudowire (PW), or Section (see <xref target="entities" />
      for the definitions of these transport entities).  Encapsulation and

        in this document.</t>

        <section title="LSP Packet Encapsulation and Forwarding">
          <t>Encapsulation and forwarding of packets traversing MPLS-TP
          LSPs MUST follow standard MPLS packet encapsulation and
          forwarding as defined in <xref target="RFC3031" /> and <xref

          this document.</t>

          <t>Data-plane support for Internet Protocol (IP) packet
          encapsulation, addressing, and forwarding is OPTIONAL.</t>

          <t>Data-plane Quality of Service capabilities are included in
          the MPLS-TP in the form of the MPLS Differentiated Services
          (DiffServ) architecture <xref target="RFC3270" />.  Both E-LSP
          and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes are included.  The Traffic Class
          field (formerly the EXP field) of an MPLS label follows the
          definition of <xref target="RFC5462" /> and <xref
          target="RFC3270" /> and MUST be processed according to the rules
          specified in those documents.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="LSP Payloads">
          <t>The MPLS-TP includes support for the following LSP payload
          types:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Network-layer protocol packets</t>
            <t>Pseudowire packets</t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t>The rules for processing LSP payloads that are network-layer
          protocol packets SHALL be as specified in <xref target="RFC3032"
          /> except as specifically noted otherwise in this document.</t>

          <t>The rules for processing LSP payloads that are pseudowire
          packets SHALL be as specified in <xref target="RFC3985" /> and
          the attendant standards defined by the IETF Pseudowire Emulation
          Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Working Group.</t>

          <t>Note that the payload of an MPLS-TP LSP may be a packet type
          that itself contains one or more MPLS labels.  This is true, for
          instance, when the payload is a pseudowire or another MPLS-TP
          LSP.  From the data-plane perspective, however, an MPLS-TP
          packet is an MPLS packet as specified in <xref target="RFC3032"
          />, and so in particular has precisely one label stack, and one
          label in the stack with its S (Bottom of Stack) bit set to
          1.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="LSP Types">
          <t>The MPLS-TP includes the following LSP types:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Point-to-point unidirectional</t>
              <t>Point-to-point associated bidirectional</t>
              <t>Point-to-point co-routed bidirectional</t>
              <t>Point-to-multipoint unidirectional</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Point-to-point unidirectional LSPs are supported by the basic
          MPLS architecture <xref target="RFC3031" /> and are REQUIRED to
          function in the same manner in the MPLS-TP data plane except as
          explicitly stated otherwise in this document.</t>

          <t>A point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP between LSRs A
          and B consists of two unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one
          from A to B and the other from B to A, which are regarded as a
          pair providing a single logical bidirectional transport path.
          The nodes A and B are REQUIRED to be aware of this pairing
          relationship, but other nodes need not be.</t>

          <t>A point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSP is a
          point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP with the additional
          constraint that its two unidirectional component LSPs follow the
          same path in the network.  This means that if one of the
          component LSPs follows the path through the nodes N0, ..., Nk,
          originating on N0 and terminating on Nk, then the path of the
          other component LSP is Nk, ..., N0, and that at each node an
          ingress interface of one component LSP is an egress interface of
          the other.  In addition, each node along the path is REQUIRED to
          be aware of the pairing relationship between the component
          LSPs.</t>

          <t>A point-to-multipoint unidirectional LSP functions in the
          same manner in the data plane, with respect to basic label
          processing and packet-switching operations, as a point-to-point
          unidirectional LSP, with one difference: an LSR may have more
          than one (egress interface, outgoing label) pair associated with
          the LSP, and any packet it transmits on the LSP is transmitted
          out all associated egress interfaces.  Point-to-multipoint LSPs
          are described in <xref target="RFC4875" /> and
          <xref target="RFC5332" />.</t>

      <section title="Sections">
        <t>Two MPLS-TP LSRs are considered to be topologically adjacent at
        a particular layer n &gt;= 0 of the MPLS-TP LSP hierarchy if there
        exists a link between them at the next lowest network layer.  Such
        a link, if it exists, will be either an MPLS-TP LSP (if n &gt; 0)
        or a data-link provided by the underlying server layer network (if
        n = 0), and is referred to as an MPLS-TP Section at layer n of the
        MPLS-TP LSP hierarchy.  Thus, the links traversed by a layer n+1
        MPLS-TP LSP are layer n MPLS-TP sections.</t>

        <t>Note that the MPLS label stack associated with an MPLS-TP
        section at layer n consists of n labels, in the absence of stack
        optimisation mechanisms such as PHP.  Note also that in order for
        two LSRs to exchange MPLS-TP control packets over a section, an
        additional label, the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) (see

    <section title="Media-Specific Considerations">
      <t>This section discusses considerations for support of the MPLS-TP
      data plane by specific underlying server layer media.</t>

      <section title="Ethernet">
        <section title="Destination MAC Address Determination">
          <t>When two MPLS-TP nodes are connected by a point-to-point
          Ethernet link, the question arises as to what destination
          Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) address should be specified
          in Ethernet frames transmitted to the peer node over the link.
          The problem of determining this address does not arise in
          IP/MPLS networks because of the presence of the Ethernet Address
          Resolution Protocol (ARP) <xref target="RFC0826" /> or IP
          version 6 Neighbor Discovery protocol <xref target="RFC4861" />,
          which allow the unicast MAC address of the peer device to be
          learned dynamically.</t>

          <t>If existing mechanisms are available in an MPLS-TP network to
          determine the destination unicast MAC addresses of peer nodes -
          for example if the network also happens to be an IP/MPLS network
          - such mechanisms SHOULD be used.  The remainder of this section
          discusses the available options when this is not the case.</t>

          <t>One possibility is for each node to be statically configured
          with the MAC address of its peer.  Static MAC address
          configuration MAY be used in an MPLS-TP network, but can present
          an administrative burden and lead to operational problems.</t>

          <t>Another possibility is to use the Ethernet broadcast address,
          but this may lead to excessive frame distribution and processing
          at the Ethernet layer.  Broadcast traffic may also be treated
          specially by some devices and this may not be desirable for
          MPLS-TP data frames.</t>

          <t>The preferred approach is therefore to use as the destination
          MAC address an Ethernet multicast address reserved for MPLS-TP.
          The address allocated for this purpose by the Internet Assigned
          Numbers Authority (IANA) is 01-00-5E-XX-XX-XX.  An MPLS-TP
          implementation MUST process Ethernet frames received with this
          destination MAC address by default.</t>

          <t>[Editor's note: Decide what to say about multipoint Ethernet
          and switched links.  Decide if there is a need for protocol
          mechanisms to support learning of the Ethernet unicast MAC
          addresses of MPLS-TP peers that are not also IP peers.]</t>
