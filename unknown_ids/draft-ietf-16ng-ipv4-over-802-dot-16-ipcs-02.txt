Abstract

   IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband
   access.  IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service specific
   convergence sublayers (Asynchronous Transfer Mode Convergence
   Sublayer (ATM CS) and Packet Convergence Sublayer (Packet CS) are the
   two main service specific convergence sublayers) for transmitting

   upper layer protocols.  The packet CS is used for the transport of
   all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE 802.3
   (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.1Q (VLAN).  The IP specific part of the
   Packet CS enables the transport of IPv4 packets directly over the
   IEEE 802.16 MAC.

   This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission
   Unit (MTU) and address assignment procedures for transmitting IPv4
   packets over IP Convergence Sublayer of the IEEE 802.16.

Internet-Draft        IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IP CS        February 2008


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 [11] is a connection oriented access technology for the
   last mile.  The IEEE 802.16 specification includes the PHY and MAC
   details.  The MAC includes various convergence sublayers (CS) for
   transmitting higher layer packets.  IPv4 packets can be carried over
   the IEEE 802.16 specified air interface via:

   1.  IP-specific part of the Packet CS or
   2.  IEEE 802.3-specific part of the Packet CS

   The scope of this specification is limited to the operation of IPv4
   over the IP-specific part of the packet CS (referred to as "IPv4 CS"
   or simply "IP CS" in this document).

   The mobile station (MS)/host is attached to an access router via a
   base station (BS).  The MS and the BS are connected via the IEEE
   802.16 air interface at the link and physical layers.  The IPv4 link
   from the MS terminates at an access router that may be a part of the
   BS or an entity beyond the BS.  The base station is a layer 2 entity
   (from the perspective of the IPv4 link between the MS and access
   router (AR)) and relays the IPv4 packets between the AR and the MS
   via a point-to-point connection over the air interface.

   This document specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting
   IPv4 [2] packets over IP CS of IEEE 802.16.  This document also
   specifies the MTU and address assignment method for the IEEE 802.16
   based networks using IP CS.

   This document also mentions about ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
   and Multicast Address Mapping whose operation is similar to any other
   point-to-point link model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


2.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in [10].


3.  Typical Network Architecture for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16

   In a network that utilizes the IEEE 802.16 air interface, each MS is
   attached to an Access Router (AR) through a Base Station (BS), a
   layer 2 entity.  The AR can be an integral part of the BS or the AR

   could be an entity beyond the BS within the access network.  IPv4
   packets between the MS and BS are carried over a point-to-point MAC
   transport connection which has a unique connection identifier (CID).
   The packets between BS and AR are carried using L2 tunnel (typically
   GRE tunnel) so that MS and AR are seen as layer 3 peer entities.  At
   least one L2 tunnel is required for each MS, so that IP packets can
   be sent to MSs before they acquire IP addresses.  The figure below
   illustrates the network architecture.




      +-----+   CID1    +------+          +-----------+
      | MS1 |----------+|  BS  |----------|     AR    |-----Internet
      +-----+         / +------+          +-----------+
         .           /        ____________
         .     CIDn /        ()__________()
      +-----+      /            L2 Tunnel
      | MSn |-----/
      +-----+


     Figure 1: Typical Network  Architecture for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16

   The above network model serves as an example and is shown to
   illustrate the point to point link between the MS and the AR.  The L2
   tunnel is not required if BS and AR are integrated into a single box.


4.  Frame Format for IPv4 Packets

   IPv4 packets are transmitted in Generic IEEE 802.16 MAC frames as
   shown in the following figure.

5.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   The MTU value for IPv4 packets on an IEEE 802.16 link is
   configurable.  The default MTU for IPv4 packets over an IEEE 802.16
   link SHOULD be 1400 bytes.  This default value accommodates for the

Internet-Draft        IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IP CS        February 2008


   overhead of the GRE tunnel used to transport IPv4 packets between the
   BS and AR and the 6-byte IEEE 802.16 MAC header over the air
   interface.

   The Length parameter of IEEE 802.16 MAC frame has a size of 11 bits.
   Hence the total PDU size is 2048 bytes.  The IPv4 payload can be a
   maximum value of 2038 bytes ( Total PDU size (2048) - (MAC Header (6)
   + CRC (4)), which is the maximum possible MTU.  The IPv4 payload size
   can vary and can be either greater or less than the default value.
   The MTU value of the MS can be configured via Path MTU Discovery [6],
   Packetization layer path MTU discovery [7], DHCP MTU option [8] or
   static configuration of each MS.


6.  Subnet Model and IPv4 Address Assignment

   The Subnet Model recommended for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16 using IP CS is
   based on point-to-point link between MS and AR, hence each MS shall
   be on different IP subnet.  The point-to-point link between MS and AR
   is achieved using a set of IEEE 802.16 MAC connections (identified by
   CIDs) and at least an L2 tunnel (usually GRE tunnel) per MS between
   BS and AR.  If the AR is co-located with the BS then the set of IEEE
   802.16 MAC connections between the MS and BS/AR represent the
   point-to- point connection.

   DHCP [4] SHOULD be used for assigning IPv4 address for the MSs.  DHCP
   messages are transported over IEEE 802.16 MAC transported connection
   to and from the AR.  In case DHCP server does not reside in AR, the
   AR SHOULD implement DHCP relay Agent [5].


7.  Address Resolution Protocol

   The IP CS does not allow for transmission of ARP [3] packets,
   accordingly, other mechanisms for address resolution must be used.
   In a point-to-point link model, address resolution may not be needed.


8.  IP Multicast Address Mapping

   IPv4 multicast packets are carried over the point-to-point link
   between the AR and the MS (via the BS).  The IPv4 multicast packets
   are classified normally at the IP CS if the IEEE 802.16 MAC
   connection has been setup with a multicast IP address as a
   classification parameter for the destination IP address.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies transmission of IPv4 packets over IEEE 802.16
   networks with IPv4 Convergence Sublayer and does not introduce any
   new vulnerabilities to IPv4 specifications or operation.  The
   security of the IEEE 802.16 air interface is the subject of [11].  In
   addition, the security issues of the network architecture spanning
   beyond the IEEE 802.16 base stations is the subject of the documents
   defining such architectures, such as WiMAX Network Architecture [12].


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Multiple Convergence Layers - Impact on Subnet Model

   Two different MSs using two different convergence sublayers (e.g. an
   MS using Ethernet CS only and another MS using IP CS only) cannot
   communicate at data link layer and requires interworking at IP layer.
   For this reason, these two nodes must be configured to be on two
   different subnets.  For more information refer [9].


Appendix B.  Sending and Receiving IPv4 Packets

   IEEE 802.16 MAC is a point-to-multipoint connection oriented air-
   interface, and the process of sending and receiving of IPv4 packets
   is different from multicast capable shared medium technologies like
   Ethernet.

   Before any packets being transmitted, IEEE 802.16 transport
   connection must be established.  This connection consists of IEEE
   802.16 MAC transport connection between MS and BS and an L2 tunnel
   between BS and AR.  This IEEE 802.16 transport connection provides a
   point-to-point link between MS and AR. all the packets originated at

Internet-Draft        IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IP CS        February 2008


   the MS always reach AR before being transmitted to the final
   destination.

   IPv4 packets are carried directly in the payload of IEEE 802.16
   frames when the IPv4 CS is used.  IPv4 CS classifies the packet based
   on upper layer (IP and transport layers)header fields to put the
   packet on one of the available connections identified by the CID.
   The classifiers for the IPv4 CS are source and destination IPv4
   addresses, source and destinations ports, Type-of-Service and IP
   protocol field.  The CS may employ Packet Header Suppression (PHS)
   after the classification.

   The BS tunnels the packet that has been received on a particular MAC
   connection to the AR.  BS reconstructs the payload header if the PHS
   is in use before the packet is tunneled to the AR.  Similarly the
   packets received on a tunnel interface from the AR, would be mapped
   to a particular CID using IPv4 classification mechanism.

   AR performs normal routing for the packets that it receives and
   forwards the packet based on its forwarding table.  However the DHCP
   relay agent in the AR, MUST maintain the tunnel interface on which it
   receives DHCP requests, so that it can relay the DHCP responses to
   the correct MS.  One way of doing this is to have a mapping between
   MAC address and Tunnel Identifier.
