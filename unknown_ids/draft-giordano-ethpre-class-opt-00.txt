Abstract

   Ethernet, standardized as IEEE802.3, is a family of frame-based
   networking technologies for local area networks. It's the most
   widespread wired LAN technology.
   This document proposes a variation of the frame structure to perform
   a frame's classification and a switching optimization (fundamental
   step for QoS mechanism in local area networks).

2.  Introduction

   Ethernet, standardized as IEEE802.3, (now Ethernet or 802.3) is a
   family of frame-based networking technologies for local area
   networks (LAN). It's the most widespread wired LAN technology.
   This document proposes a variation of the frame structure to perform
   a frame's classification and a switching optimization (fundamental
   step for QoS mechanism in local area networks).
   
   Actual 802.3 frame
   
           -----------------------------------------
    field  |PRE |SFD |DA  |SA  |LT  |Payload  |FCS | 
           -----------------------------------------
    byte   |7   |1   |6   |6   |2   |46 - 1500|4   |
           -----------------------------------------
   
   Acronyms:
   PRE - The preamble field consists of seven bytes of alternating ones
   and zeros and It is used for synchronization.
   SFD - Start Frame Delimiter is the 8-bit sequence 10101011 is the
   same as the eighth byte of the Ethernet preamble.
   DA - The destination address specifies the station or stations to
   which a packet should be sent.
   SA - The source address field contains the unique address of the
   transmitter station.
   LT - The length field.
   FCS - Frame check sequence is an error checking field. It's generated
   using the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) on the destination address,
   source address, length, and payload fields.
   
   In this frame there isn't an information about the type or the
   priority of data carried.
   Now a days IEEE802.1q standard (the evolution of 802.3) has a 
   classification mechanisms implemented with 802.1p but this
   type of frame is not large supported from LAN devices.

   Actual 802.1q frame
   
           ----------------------------------------------
    field  |PRE |SFD |DA  |SA  |TAG |LT  |Payload  |FCS | 
           ----------------------------------------------
                               |    \
                               |     \
                               --------------------
                               |TPID|PRI |CFI |VID|
                               --------------------
                      bit      |16  |3   |1   |12 |
                               --------------------

   Acronyms:
   TPID - The Tag Protocol Identifier identifies the frame as an
   IEEE 802.1q tagged frame.
   PRI - Priority, this field refers to the IEEE 802.1p 8 levels
   priority.
   CFI - The Canonical Format Indicator specifies if the MAC address is
   in canonical or non canonical format.
   VID - The VLAN Identifier identifies the VLAN to which the frame
   belongs.
							   
   This type of classification can also be defined as best-effort
   Layer 2 QoS. It is implemented in network adapters and switches.
   The traffic is simply classified and sent to the destination. 
   No type of resources reservation are established.
	
    e.g. 1) A switch which supports both types of protocols (802.3 and
            802.1q) receive traffic in a 802.3 frame from a PC;
         2) It converts the original frame in a 802.1q frame;
         3) the switch performs an IP packet inspection to read ToS or
            DSCP value from IP header;
         4) It writes this value in the CoS field of the 802.1q frame;
         5) the frame is sent in a specific output queue in function of
            802.1p CoS value;
         6) when the queue is served the switch converts the frame in a
            802.3 format and sent it in a UART output interface.

3.  Implementation and Operations

   New Ethernet preamble format

           ----------------------------------------------
    field  |PRE |SFD+PRI  |DA  |SA  |LT  |Payload  |FCS |
           ----------------------------------------------
    byte   |7   |1        |6   |6   |2   |46 - 1500|4   |
           ----------------------------------------------
                |    \
                |     \
                -----------
                |SFD |PRI |
                -----------
        bit     |5   |3   |
                -----------

   Acronyms:
   PRE - The preamble field consists of seven bytes of alternating ones
   and zeros and It is used for synchronization.
   SFD - Start Frame Delimiter is the 5-bit sequence 10111 and it
   identifies the start of the frame.
   PRI - Priority, this is a 3-bit field similar to the IEEE 802.1p
   levels priority.

   Using preamble's bit a switch can know the frame's priority before of
   the switching process and it doesn't use resources to perform IP
   packet inspection or to do a frame conversion.
   Another advantage is represented by the fact that the switch must
   change its switching modality with the priority value:

   preamble priority < 5  ---> switch engine: store & forward
   preamble priority >= 5 ---> switch engine: cut through

   With cut through method the switch starts forwarding a frame before
   the whole frame has been received. This technique reduces latency
   through the switch and delay of critical applications.
