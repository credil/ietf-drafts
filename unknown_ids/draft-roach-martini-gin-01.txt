                       draft-roach-martini-gin-01

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism by which a SIP server acting as a
   traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) can register with a SIP
   Service Provider (SSP) to receive phone calls for extensions
   designated by phone numbers.  In order to function properly, this
   mechanism relies on the fact that the phone numbers are fully
   qualified and globally unique.

1.  Introduction

   One of SIP's primary functions is providing rendezvous between users.
   By design, this rendezvous has been provided through a combination of
   the server look-up procedures defined in RFC 3263 [2], and the
   registrar procedures described in RFC 3261 [1].

   The intention of the original protocol design was that any user's AOR
   would be handled by the authority indicated by the hostport portion
   of the AOR.  The users registered individual reachability information
   with the this authority, which would then route incoming requests
   accordingly.

   In actual deployments, some SIP servers have been deployed in
   architectures that, for various reasons, have requirements to provide
   dynamic routing information for large blocks of AORs, where all of
   the AORs in the block were to be handled by the same server.  For
   purposes of efficiency, many of these deployments do not wish to
   maintain separate registrations for each of the AORs in the block.
   This leads to the desire for an alternate mechanism for providing
   dynamic routing information for blocks of AORs.

   Because this problem has certain similarities with the REGISTER
   operation, several non-standard, ad hoc extensions to REGISTER have
   been developed to address this desire.  The document "SIP IP-PBX
   Registration Problems" [3] describes several deployed IP PBX
   registration techniques, along with a number of problems that arise
   from the approaches that have been implemented to date.

   Although the use of REGISTER to update reachability information for
   multiple users simultaneously is somewhat beyond the original
   semantics defined for REGISTER, this approach has seen significant
   deployment in certain environments.  In particular, deployments in
   which small to medium SIP PBX servers are addressed using E.164
   numbers have used this mechanism to avoid the need to maintain DNS
   entries or static IP addresses for the PBX servers.

   In recognition of the momentum that a REGISTER-based approach has
   within that relatively narrow ecological niche, this document defines
   a REGISTER-based approach that is tailored to E.164-addressed
   extensions in a SIP PBX environment.  It is not intended for general-
   purpose registration of SIP URIs in which the user portion is non-
   numeric or non-globally-unique.


2.  Constraints

   The following paragraph is perhaps the most important in

   understanding the solution defined in this document.

   Within the problem space that has been established for this work,
   several constraints shape our solution.  These are being defined in
   the MARTINI requirements document.  In terms of impact to the
   solution at hand, the following two constraints have the most
   profound effect: (1) The PBX cannot be assumed to be assigned a
   static IP address; and (2) No DNS entry can be relied upon to
   consistently resolve to the IP address of the PBX.


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms defined in section 2 of "SIP IP-PBX
   Registration Problems" [3].


4.  Mechanism Overview

   The overall mechanism is achieved using a REGISTER request with a
   specially-formatted Contact URI.  This document also defines an
   option tag that can be used to ensure a registrar and any
   intermediaries understand the mechanism described herein.

   The Contact URI itself is tagged with a URI parameter to indicate
   that it actually represents a multitude of phone-number-associated
   contacts.

   We also define some lightweight extensions for GRUU to allow the use
   of public GRUUs assigned by the SSP.

   Finally, we non-normatively demonstrate that existing procedures that
   can be used to generate temporary GRUUs for terminals behind the PBX.

   Aside from these extensions, the REGISTER message itself is processed
   by a registrar in the same way as normal registrations: by updating
   its location service with additional AOR to Contact bindings.

   Note that the list of extensions associated with a PBX is a matter of
   local provisioning at the SSP and at the PBX.  The mechanism defined
   in this document does not provide any means to detect or recover from
   provisioning mismatches (although the registration event package can
   be used as a standardized means for auditing such extensions; see
   Section 7.2.1).

5.  Registering for Multiple Phone Numbers

   To register for multiple phone numbers, the PBX sends a REGISTER
   message to the SSP.  This REGISTER varies from a typical register in
   two important ways.  First, it must contain an option tag of "bulk-
   number-contact" in both a "Require" header field and a "Proxy-
   Require" header field.  Second, in at least one "Contact" header
   field, it must include a Contact URI that contains the URI parameter
   "bnc", and no user portion (hence no "@" symbol).  A URI with a "bnc"
   parameter MUST NOT contain a user portion.

   Because of the constraints discussed in Section 2, the host portion
   of the Contact URI will generally contain an IP address, although
   nothing in this mechanism enforces or relies upon that fact.  If the
   PBX operator chooses to maintain DNS entries that resolve to the IP
   address of his PBX via RFC 3263 resolution procedures, then this
   mechanism works just fine with domain names in the Contact header
   field.

   The URI parameter indicates that special interpretation of the
   Contact URI is necessary: instead of representing a single, concrete
   Contact URI to be inserted into the location service, it represents a
   multitude of Contact URIs (one for each associated phone numbers),
   semantically resulting in a multitude of AOR-to-Contact rows in the
   location service.

   The registrar, upon receipt of a REGISTER message in the foregoing
   form, will use the value in the "To" header field to identify the PBX
   for which registration is being requested.  It then authenticates the
   PBX (using, e.g., SIP Digest authentication, mutual TLS, or some
   other authentication mechanism).  After the PBX is authenticated, the
   registrar updates its location service so that each of the phone
   numbers associated with the PBX creates a unique AOR to Contact
   mapping.  Semantically, each of these mappings will be treated as a
   unique row in the location service.  The actual implementation may,
   of course, perform internal optimizations to reduce the amount of
   memory used to store such information.

   For each of these unique rows, the AOR will be in the format that the
   SSP expects to receive from external parties (e.g.
   "sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com"), and the corresponding Contact
   will be formed adding a user portion to the REGISTER's Contact URI
   containing the fully-qualified, E.164-formatted phone number
   (including the preceding "+" symbol) and removing the "bnc"
   parameter.  For example, if the "Contact" header field contains the
   URI <sip:198.51.100.3:5060;user=phone;bnc>, then the Contact value
   associated with the aforementioned AOR will be
   <sip:+12145550102@198.51.100.3:5060;user=phone>.

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing     February 2010


   Aside from the "bnc" parameter, all URI parameters present on the
   "Contact" URI in the REGISTER message MUST be copied to the Contact
   value stored in the location service.


6.  SSP Processing of Inbound Phone Number Requests

   In general, after processing the AOR to Contact mapping described in
   the preceding section, the SSP Proxy/Registrar (or equivalent entity)
   performs traditional Proxy/Registrar behavior, based in such mapping.
   For inbound SIP requests whose AOR indicates an E.164 number assigned
   to one of the SSP's customers, this will generally involve setting
   the target set to the registered contacts associated with that AOR,
   and performing request forwarding as described in section 16.6 of RFC
   3261.


7.  Interaction with Other Mechanisms

   The following sections describe the means by which this mechanism
   interacts with relevant REGISTER-related extensions currently defined
   by the IETF.

   Currently, the descriptions are somewhat informal, and omit some
   details for the sake of brevity.  If the MARTINI working group
   expresses interest in furthering the mechanism described by this
   document, they will be fleshed out with more detail and formality.

7.1.  Globally Routable User-Agent URIs (GRUU)

   To enable advanced services to work with extensions behind a SIP PBX,
   it is important that the GRUU mechanism defined by RFC 5627 [8] work
   correctly with the mechanism defined by this document.

7.1.1.  Public GRUUs

   When a PBX registers a Bulk Number Contact (a Contact with a "bnc"
   parameter), and also invokes GRUU procedures for that Contact during
   registration, then the SSP will assign a public GRUU to the PBX in
   the normal fashion.  Because the URI being registered contains a
   "bnc" parameter, the GRUU will also contain a "bnc" parameter.  In
   particular, this means that the GRUU will not contain a user portion.

   When a terminal registers with the PBX using GRUU procedures for a
   Contact, it adds an "sg" parameter to the GRUU parameter it received
   from the SSP.  This "sg" parameter contains a disambiguation token
   that the SSP can use to route the request to the proper user agent.

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing     February 2010


   So, for example, when the PBX registers the with the following
   contact header field:

   Contact: <sip:198.51.100.3;user=phone;bnc>;
     +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"

   Then the SSP may choose to respond with a Contact header field that
   looks like this:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:198.51.100.3;user=phone;bnc>;
   pub-gruu="sip:ssp.example.com;gr=urn:
   uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6";
   +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"
   ;expires=7200
   </allOneLine>

   When its own terminals register, the PBX can then add whatever device
   identifier it feels appropriate in an "sg" parameter, and present
   this value to its own terminals.  For example, assume the extension
   associated with the phone number "+12145550102" sent the following
   Contact header field in its register:

   Contact: <sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>;
     +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:d0e2f290-104b-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66>"

   The PBX will add an "sg" parameter to the pub-gruu it received from
   the SSP with a token that uniquely identifies the device (possibly
   the URN itself; possible some other identifier); insert a user
   portion containing the fully-qualified E.164 number associated with
   the extension; and return the result to the terminal as its public
   GRUU.  This resulting Contact header field would look something like
   this:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>;
   pub-gruu="sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com;gr=urn:
   uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6;sg=00:05:03:5e:70:a6";
   +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:d0e2f290-104b-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66>"
   ;expires=3600
   </allOneLine>

   When an incoming request arrives at the SSP for a GRUU corresponding
   to a bulk number contact ("bnc"), the SSP performs slightly different
   processing for the GRUU than a Proxy/Registrar would.  When the GRUU
   is re-targeted to the registered bulk number contact, the SSP MUST
   copy the "sg" parameter from the GRUU to the new target.  The PBX can
   then use this "sg" parameter to determine which user agent the

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing     February 2010


   request should be routed to.

7.1.2.  Temporary GRUUs

   PBXes have two options for creating temporary GRUUs for use by its
   terminals.

7.1.2.1.  Approach 1 - Self Made GRUUs

   If a PBX wishes to provide temporary GRUUs for its terminals, it may
   do so by producing its own "Self-made GRUUs" (as defined in section
   4.3 of RFC 5627).  These GRUUs are produced using the PBX's own IP
   address (or domain, if it maintains one in DNS).  The temporary GRUUs
   are then propagated to terminals using normal GRUU mechanism.

   The ability to produce temporary GRUUs in this fashion is predicated
   on the conditions described in section 4.3 of RFC 5627.  In
   particular, it requires PBX to be publicly routable, and willing to
   accept requests destined for its own Self-made GRUUs from sources
   other than the SSP.  If these conditions cannot be satisfied (or the
   PBX operator chooses not to satisfy them for policy reasons), then
   the PBX users will not be able to make use of temporary GRUUs.

   This mechanism is also predicated on the IP address for the PBX being
   relatively stable over long period of time.  This is generally a safe
   assumption to make, as frequent PBX IP address changes will result in
   intermittent connectivity issues and interruptions to ongoing calls.

   On a related note: when used with this extension, the SSP will not
   return a temporary GRUU in the registration response for any contacts
   that include a "bnc" parameter in their URI.

   For example, using the same setup as in the "Public GRUU" section
   above, an extensions registering with the PBX might obtain a temp
   gruu by receiving a Contact header field that looks like:

7.1.2.2.  Approach 2 - Anonymous Public GRUUs

   If a PBX does not satisfy the criteria for producing its own "Self-
   made GRUUs," then it may create temporary GRUUs based on the public
   GRUUs it received from the SSP at registration time.  To create
   Temporary GRUUs of this form, the PBX will add an opaque "sg"
   parameter to the public GRUU it received from the SSP, and will omit
   the user portion.

   Note that, because these GRUUs are temporary GRUUs, a unique "sg"
   parameter will be generated for each successful registration attempt.
   The PBX tracks the various "sg" values associated with each user



Roach                    Expires August 29, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing     February 2010


   agent, and can re-target to the correct instance when the request
   arrives.

   For this approach to function, the SSP must be able to resolve a GRUU
   based solely on the value of its "gr" parameter, as the user portion
   of the GRUU will not contain an E.164 number.  Further, the SSP will
   not know which actual extension the request is destined for, only
   that it corresponds to an extension belonging to the PBX.

   Using the same basic setup as the example for the public GRUU, a
   terminal might receive a temporary GRUU by getting back a Contact
   header field that looks like this:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>;
   temp-gruu="sip:ssp.example.com;gr=urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-
   00a0c91e6bf6;sg=0UYYRV046P";+sip.instance="<urn:uuid:d0e2f290-104b-
   11df-8a39-0800200c9a66>";expires=3600
   </allOneLine>

7.2.  Registration Event Package

   As this mechanism inherently deals with REGISTER behavior, it is
   imperative to consider its impact on the Registration Event Package
   defined by RFC 3680 [6].  In practice, there will be two main use
   cases for subscribing to registration data: learning about the
   overall registration state for the PBX, and learning about the
   registration state for a single PBX extension.

7.2.1.  PBX Aggregate Registration State

   If the PBX (or another interested and authorized party) wishes to
   monitor or audit the registration state for all of the extensions
   currently registered to that PBX, it can subscribe to the SIP
   registration event package at the PBX's main URI -- that is, the URI
   used in the "To" header field of the REGISTER message.

   The NOTIFY messages for such a subscription will contain a body that
   contains one record for each phone number associated with the PBX.
   The AORs will be in the format expected to be received by the SSP
   (e.g., "sip:+12145550105@ssp.example.com"), and the Contacts will
   correspond to the mapped Contact created by the registration (e.g.,
   "sip:+12145550105@98.51.100.3").

   In particular, the "bnc" parameter is forbidden from appearing in the
   body of a reg-event notify.

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing     February 2010


7.2.2.  Individual Extension Registration State

   If the SSP receives a SUBSCRIBE request for the registration event
   package with a Request-URI that indicates a contact registered via
   the "Bulk Number Contact" mechanism defined in this document, then it
   MUST proxy that SUBSCRIBE to the PBX in the same way that is would
   proxy an INVITE bound for that AOR.

   Defining the behavior in this way is important, since the reg-event
   subscriber is interested in finding out about the comprehensive list
   of devices associated with the phone number.  Only the PBX will have
   authoritative access to this information.  For example, if the user
   has registered multiple terminals with differing capabilities, the
   SSP will not know about the devices or their capabilities.  By
   contrast, the PBX will.

7.3.  Client-Initiated (Outbound) Connections

   RFC 5626 [7] -- needs analysis.  Some people think it might "just
   work."

7.4.  Non-Adjacent Contact Registration (Path)

   RFC 3327 [4] -- needs analysis.  Some people think it might "just
   work."

7.5.  Service Route Discovery

   RFC 3608 [5] -- needs analysis.  Some people think it might "just
   work."


8.  Examples

   These will be fleshed out more in later versions of the draft, with
   explanations of the processing performed at each step.  For the time
   being, they just show the basic syntax described above.  The current
   sections represents what we have been calling "Use Cases" on the
   MARTINI mailing list; however, it has been pointed out that the
   things we were calling "Use Cases" were not, actually "Use Cases" as
   much as they were potential modes of operation.  To avoid the baggage
   around any pre-existing terms, we are referring to these items as
   "Wumpuses" for the time being.

8.1.  Wumpus 3

   This example shows a basic bulk REGISTER transaction, followed by an
   INVITE addressed to one of the registered terminals.

8.2.  Wumpus 9

   This example shows a bulk REGISTER transaction with the SSP making
   use of the "Path" header field extension [4].  This allows the SSP to
   designate a domain on the incoming Request URI that does not
   necessarily resolve to the PBX from when the SSP applies RFC 3263
   procedures to it.

9.  Issues Solved

   The document "SIP IP-PBX Registration Problems" [3] describes a
   number of problems that arise in the ad hoc solutions currently

   deployed.  This section evaluates these issues against the mechanism
   proposed in this document.

   No Explicit Indicator:  This mechanism includes both an explicit
      indicator that the mechanism must be applied (a new "bulk-number-
      contact" option tag) as well as a specific protocol marker that
      indicates exactly where the extension is to be applied (the "bnc"
      URI parameter).

   Undefined Behavior on PAU Mismatch:  This mechanism does not propose
      the use of P-Associated-URI in the REGISTER response as an
      integral part of the document.  PBXes that wish to learn
      registration information for its associated extensions may
      subscribe to their own registration state, as described in
      Section 7.2.1.

   REGISTER Response Growth:  This mechanism does not propose the use of
      P-Associated-URI in the REGISTER response as an integral part of
      the document.  PBXes that wish to learn registration information
      for its associated extensions may subscribe to their own
      registration state, as described in Section 7.2.1.

   Illegal Wildcarding Syntax:  Rather than defining a general-purpose
      wild-carding syntax, this mechanism defines a very lightweight
      syntax for indication of where E.164 numbers are to be substituted
      in Contact URIs.

   Loss of Target Info:  Because the binding from AOR to Contact URI is
      under control of the requestor, and because the model of proxy/
      registrar routing defined in RFC 3261 is maintained, the system
      exhibits the same properties as it would if each user were
      registered individually.  Target information is preserved.

   Request-URI vs. Loose-Route Mismatches:  As before: because the
      binding from AOR to Contact URI is under control of the requestor,
      and because the model of proxy/registrar routing defined in RFC
      3261 is maintained, the system exhibits the same properties as it
      would if each user were registered individually.  Loose routing
      and Request-URI handling are kept consistent with proxy/registrar
      handling described in RFC 3261, so no mismatches can arise.

   Authorization Policy Mismatches:  Because the binding from AOR to
      Contact URI is under control of the publisher, it can ensure that
      the Contact URI associated with an AOR matches the Contact URIs it
      uses for outgoing calls.  This eliminates the authorization policy
      mismatches described.

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing     February 2010


   P-Asserted-Identity Mismatches:  Because the information published by
      this mechanism inherently mimics individual registration for each
      of the associated AORs, the expectation that each of these AORs
      can be used as a P-Asserted-Identity is preserved, avoiding any
      implementation confusion regarding valid values for this field.

   Trust Domain Mismatches for Privacy/Identity:  The MARTINI working
      group appears to be reaching rough consensus that this issue is
      out of scope and out of charter for solutions it is responsible
      for considering.  It is not analyzed with respect to the proposed
      solution.



10.  IANA Considerations

   This isn't even close to finished.  It's here to remind me that there
   are IANA impacts.

10.1.  New SIP Option Tag

   bulk-number-contact

10.2.  New SIP URI Parameters

   bnc, sg
