			<t>This draft describes a mechanism to enable the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol to select
				between different signature algorithms to use with Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA). 
				It also provides optional support for interoperability between nodes that do not share any 
				common signature algorithms.</t>

		<section anchor="sec-intro" title="Introduction">
			<t> The usage scenarios associated with neighbor discovery have recently been
				extended to include environments with mobile or nomadic nodes. 
				Many of these nodes have limited battery power and computing resources. Therefore, heavy public key signing
				algorithms like RSA are not feasible to support on such constrained nodes.  Fortunately, more lightweight
				yet secure signing algorithms do exist and have been standardized, e.g. Elliptic Curve based algorithms.</t>
			<t>It is then a worthwhile goal to extend secure neighbor discovery to support signing and corresponding hashing 
				algorithm agility. Besides 
				accommodating power-constrained nodes, signing and hashing algorithm agility is also desired as a safety measure
				over time, to offer alternatives when cryptanalysis of one type of algorithm makes significant progress.
			  
			</t>
			<t>The aim of this memo is to outline options for allowing public key signing algorithm and hashing algorithm 
				agility for nodes configured to perform secure neighbor discovery operations.
				The extent to which these options impact existing specifications <xref target="RFC3971"/> and
				<xref target="RFC3972"/> is also addressed.</t>
                </section>
		<section anchor="sec-problem-overview" title="Overview">

			<section title="Compatibility with existing specifications">
			

			<t>	The current SEND protocol specification, <xref target="RFC3971"/>, mandates the use of the RSA signature algorithm. 
				Since the time of its writing, different signature algorithms have been shown to be secure and have been 
				adopted by other protocols in an effort to reduce key length, signature generation and verification time, and 
				increase security level.

				This shift in signature algorithm adoption particularly benefits  lightweight devices, which are 
				power and memory-limited but in need of secure signing algorithms support. For these reasons, we feel that 
				the restriction on the signature algorithm for SEND is no longer warranted.</t>
			
			<section title="Classification of SEND nodes">
				<t>At the time of this writing, there are no known large-scale or even small-scale deployments of <xref target="RFC3971"/>-compatible devices.
				However, in the interest of caution, we assume that there exist nodes that support only the RSA algorithm and that are configured
				to perform secure neighbor discovery. Such nodes may not be updated in the near term or for the foreseeable future.
				On the other hand, it appears that there will be deployments of nodes that support only Elliptic Curve Cryptography as their
				public key algorithm, i.e. ECDSA as a signature algorithm, rather than traditional RSA. </t>

				<t> To ensure that all possible network/link configurations are considered when designing a signature agility solution, 
				we categorize nodes (hosts and routers) according to their support for different signature algorithms, as follows: 
				<list style="hanging">
				
					<t hangText="Type H1 host:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/> A host that only supports one type of  signature algorithm and has a CGA generated 
										with the public key of this algorithm.  </t>
										 <t>Examples of this type of hosts: an old host that does not support signature agility, 
											 i.e. only supports RSA signature algorithm; or, a host that only supports ECDSA signature.</t>
									
					<t hangText="Type H2 host:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/> A host that supports multiple signature algorithms and has a CGA generated with 
						only one key selected from among its supported algorithms.</t>
										<t>Examples of this type of hosts: (1) a host that supports RSA and ECDSA signature algorithms, 
										but only has a CGA derived with an RSA public key; (2) a host that supports RSA and ECDSA signature algorithms, 
										but only has a CGA derived with an ECC public key. </t>
										
					<t hangText="Type H3 host:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>A host that supports multiple signature algorithms and has a CGA generated with 
										multiple keys of different supported algorithms.</t>
										<t>Such CGA generation is made possible by the introduction of a new  CGA extension (see companion
											draft <xref target="cheneau-cga-pk-agility"/>). Such hosts can be compatible with hosts of other types  for
										secure neighbor discovery.</t>
					<t hangText="Type H4 host:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/> A host that supports multiple signature algorithms and has multiple CGAs, each of which is  
										 associated with a single key of one supported algorithm.  For simplicity,
										we do not consider hosts that have multiple CGAs, one or more of which are generated from multiple public
										keys. </t>
									<!-- TC 2/16/2009, Marcelo thinks we should clarify the first sentence -->
										<t> A node MUST select and settle on one CGA when building a trust relationship with another device via SeND (more 
											below). In such cases, a destination node may be reached at a CGA associated with a signature algorithm 
											that the originating node cannot verify.  The destination node will need to securely redirect the originating node 
											to one of its other CGA(s) (presumably with a common signature algorithm). The need for a method to secure 
											the binding between the two CGAs of the destination node  is still an open problem.</t> 
										 <t>Based on this reasoning, consideration of H4 type nodes is left for future work. <!-- MCV 2/27: this way
										 	we don't appear lazy :-) --></t> 
				</list></t>
			

				<t>Routers are more likely to possess 
					the resources necessary to support multiple signature and hashing algorithms. It is also more feasible
					that routers employ certificates. However, for a basic signature agility solution, we do not mandate that 
					routers support multiple signature and hashing algorithms. </t>  
				<t>Possible router devices with different signature algorithm support ability are: 
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="Type R1 router:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>A router that only supports one type of signature algorithm and has a CGA and Certificate with 
						a public key of this algorithm.  </t>
					
					<t>Such routers are expected to be commonplace, as compliance with <xref target="RFC3971"/> suffices for them. </t>
					<t hangText="Type R2 router:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/> A router that supports multiple types of signature algorithms and has one CGA and Certificate with 
										a public key of one of the algorithm types.  </t>
										<t>This type of router can sign and verify signatures of the type of certificate it owns, and additionally, 
										 it can verify signatures of other algorithm types. </t>

					<t hangText="Type R3 router:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>A router that supports multiple types of signature algorithms
						and has one CGA composed of multiple Publics Keys and multiple certificates containing each a Public Key.</t>
					<t hangText="Type R4 router:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>A router that supports multiple types of signature algorithms and has multiple CGAs 
										and Certificates with public key of several different algorithm types.  </t>
										<t>This type of router can sign and verify signatures of multiple types. Such routers may not be attractive to 
											build and deploy due to increased requirements on its resources. Moreover using multiple CGAs (with no bindings) 
											may make that routers appear as having multiple identities.</t>
	

				
				</list>
				</t>
				<t>Note that all types of router presented above can be configured to use SEND over multiple interfaces or to have multiple addresses on the same interface. In this case, the router will use separate CGAs. Such configuration is treated in this draft as if the different addresses refer to separate entities.</t>

			</section>

			<section title="Principal Scenarios">
				<t>Based on the discussion above, a SEND agility solution should at least properly deal with the communication between devices of type H1, H2, H3, R1, R2 and R3.</t>
			<t> <list style="empty">
				<t>An H1 or R1 node interacting with an H2 or R2 node: i.e., a node supporting only RSA (for example, 
					an old non-agility node which only supports RFC3971) and a node supporting 
					both RSA and ECDSA (or other new algorithms). These two nodes may <!-- TC s/must/may/ --> be able to perform secure neighbor discovery.</t>
				<t>An H1 or R1 node interacting with another H1 or R1 node, but their algorithms differ: e.g., a node supporting only 
					RSA (for example, an old non-agility node which only supports RFC3971) and a node supporting only 
					ECDSA (or other new algorithms). In this case, implementations supporting SEND signature agility solution 
					may likely realize the incompatibility, while older implementations may not. </t>
				<t>A node of any type (H1, H2, H3, R1, R2, R3) interacting with another node, their algorithms differ but there is a 3rd party willing/able to help: 
					this is an optional solution applicable to the previous scenario, where two nodes that support SEND but do not have any 
					signature algorithms in common can talk through a third party (router). In this case they should be able to 
					perform facilitated secure neighbor discovery.</t>
				<t>An H2, H3 or R2 node interacting with another H2, H3, or R2 node: e.g., two nodes that support at least one signature algorithms 
					in common will be able to perform secure neighbor discovery.</t>
				<t>An additional rule for  H2, H3 or R2, R3 node interacting with another H2, H3, or R2, R3 node applies: two nodes that support two or more signature algorithms 
					in common (one of which is likely preferred over the other), will be able to perform secure neighbor discovery with any of these signature algorithms.</t>

		<section title="Agility Requirements">
			<t>We hold the following to be requirements on a signing algorithm agility solution for SEND: </t>

				<t>A Signature-Algorithm-Agility-Node should be able to communicate with a Non-Signature-Algorithm-Agility-Node, 
					but not necessarily employ SEND. Traditional ND should suffice, to accommodate nodes that only support

					the use of unsecured ND messages when communicating with a node that does not share any common signature
					algorithm.</t>
				<t>Two Signature-Algorithm-Agility nodes that support a common Signature Algorithm and hashing algorithm 
					should be able to communicate

				When sending unsolicited message, a node MAY have to rely on the entries of its Neighbor Cache.
				The Neighbor Cache will provide hints concerning the Signature Algorithm supported by the neighbors.
				Neighbor Cache can assist the node in the Signature Algorithm selection process when:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						A router advertises unsolicited Router Advertisement message to the All-Nodes multicast address
						(e.g. to indicate a prefix lifetime is going down to 0).
						The router needs to know which signature algorithm(s) to use in order to send verifiable messages to hosts.
						To do so, the router MAY rely on the Neighbor Cache and compute an intersection of the set of all Supported Signature Algorithms.
						The router will then be able to advertise a Router Advertisement signed multiple times 
						with the resulting subset of Supported Signature Algorithms or
						advertise multiple Router Advertisements, each signed with a single Signature Algorithm part of the intersection.
					</t>
					<t>
						A node sends unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement (e.g. when changing its Link-Layer address). This is similar to the previous
						problem and can also be solved using the Neighbor Cache the same way.
					</t>
					<t>
						A router sends a Redirect message to a host. Choosing a supported signature algorithm  
						without probing the node can be difficult. However, Neighbor Cache will most likely contain
						an entry for the host, prior to the decision to send a Redirect message, because of the Address
						Resolution process. 
						<!-- TC 04/22/09: well, not really true, because the previous message could have be unsecured, must find a way to rephrase -->

				On reception of this message, a requesting node performs CGA verification, Nonce (if included in the initial request) and

				logged. Then, if the status message is 0, that node can treat the original packet that created the need for a Notary
				Signature Check Request message as a secured packet. <!-- TC 04/17/09 May not be useful: This amounts to  resuming the SEND
				protocol using secure packets.-->  On a status value different from 0, the packet will be considered as unsecure and be treated

		<t>
			<xref target="Univ-Sig-Option"/> presents a new Universal Signature Option. A recommended use of this option is to allow signatures of equivalent security level (i.e. Public Keys with equivalent key lengths) as shown in <xref target="tab_sec_equiv"/>. See also section 4 of the companion draft <xref target="cheneau-cga-pk-agility"/>. </t>
			
		<t>
			Usage of SHA-1 for signature is strongly NOT RECOMMENDED, and when available should be preferred by the usage of SHA-256. SHA-1 security is
			been proved to be flawed in the light of recent attacks <xref target="Recent SHA-1 Attack"/> <xref target="NIST-st"/>.
		</t>
		<t>
			The Universal Signature Option is vulnerable to downgrade attacks. That is, given that a node can employ multiple signature types, an attacker may choose to use a flawed one. To mitigate this issue, nodes are allowed, on a local policy, to refuse to check certain types of signature (i.e. those which are know to be flawed) and will treat the associated messages as unsecured. When trying to completely mitigate downgrade attacks, an administrator MAY deploy SEND-secured nodes only authorizing a single signature algorithm scheme. This comes at a price of a reduced interoperability.
		</t>
		<t>
			<xref target="notary"/> introduces an optional notary functionality that offers to nodes to check messages on their behalf, involving
			heavy cryptographic computation. This can lead to flooding attacks and Denial of Services. However, Neighbor Discovery Protocol <xref target="RFC4861"/> and Secure Neighbor
			Discovery Protocol <xref target="RFC3971"/> are already prone to flooding attacks. One possible solution is to use rate limiting on Signature Check Request
			messages.
		</t>
		<t>
			Notary functionality is also vulnerable to "Good Router Goes Bad" attacks (as described in <xref target="RFC3756"/>). Notary can make
			node trust unsecured packets and drop valid ones.
			This issue can be mitigated when multiple notaries are present on a link. The node can use a round-robin algorithm to load-balance the
			Signature Check Request message, thus reducing the risk of cache poisoning by a compromised notary.

				When using multiple public keys to form a CGA, one may reach the maximum number 
				of possible public keys <!--MCV 6/1/09: where is this constraint coming from?? 
				TC 06/03/09: maximum here means that if you exceed this number, the size is over the MTU size, this isn't a "constrain"
				--> before each Neighbor 
				Discovery Message exceed the Maximum Transfer Unit (which must be at least 1280 octets according to 
				<xref target="RFC2460"/>). This section aims to approximate this limit.
			</t>
			<t>
				Numerous factors (presence and number of option, size of public keys, etc)  influence the size of the Neighbor 
				Discovery message. For example, when sending a SEND-secured Router Advertisement message:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>The IPv6 header is 40 bytes long. Described in <xref target="RFC2460"/>.</t>	
					<t>The bare Router Advertisement message (without any option) is 16 bytes long. Described in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>
					<t>A Prefix Information Option (can appear more than once) is 32 bytes long. Described in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>
					<t>A Source Link-Layer Option, when a IEEE 802 address is used, is 8 bytes long. Described in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>
					<t>A MTU Option is 8 bytes long. Described in <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>
					<t>The CGA Option is the size of the CGA Parameter Data Structure plus 4 bytes rounded up to the closest multiple of 8 value. This option is defined in <xref target="RFC3971"/>.
						The CGA Parameter Data Structure (defined in <xref target="RFC3972"/> size depends on the following fields:
						<list style="symbols">
							<t>Modifier: 16 bytes long.</t>
							<t>Subnet Prefix: 8 bytes long.</t>
							<t>Collision Count: 1 byte long.</t>
							<t>Public Key:  variable size. <xref target="table_RSA_PK"/> provides size of the commonly used DER-encoded RSA Public Keys. 
								<xref target="table_ECC_PK"/> provides size for the commonly used DER-encoded ECC Public Keys.</t>
							<t>Extension(s): variable size. Public Key Extension field defined in <xref target="cheneau-cga-pk-agility"/> is 4 bytes plus the 
								size of the Public Key long. Public Key size are defined in <xref target="table_RSA_PK"/> and <xref target="table_ECC_PK"/>.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>The Timestamp Option is 16 bytes long. Defined in <xref target="RFC3971"/>.</t>
					<t>The Nonce Option minimum size is 8 bytes long. Defined in <xref target="RFC3971"/>.</t>
					<t>The Universal Signature Option depends on the size of the Digital Signature. The fixed part of the option is 20 bytes long. 
						This option is updated in this document. <xref target="table_RSA_sig"/> presents common sizes for usual Digital Signature field when using RSA. 
						<xref target="table_ECDSA_sig"/> presents common sizes for Digital Signature field when using ECDSA. This option size must be a multiple of 8 bytes.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<!-- TC 04/28/09: only use one option (MTU, SLLO, Prefix) per message and sending multiple messages to announce all this option is allowed for RAs -->
			<t>
			A Router Advertisement message, carrying a Prefix Information Option and a Source Link-Layer Option, without Nonce, with one 1024-bits long RSA Public Key and a 
				Public Exponent of 3 in the CGA Option is 456 bytes long. Using the same RSA Public Key, adding one ECC P-521 key to CGA Option, the same message, signed with a 
				Universal Signature option generated by RSA and a Universal Signature Option signed by ECDSA, is 768 bytes long.  Note that EC P-521 and 1024-bits RSA keys 
				should not be used together <!--  MCV 6/1: is this what you meant by "shouldn't be alongside"? if so, is it strictly because of their size? we should say so instead of
				/in addition to pointing to that section
				TC 06/03/09: this is indeed because 1024-bits RSA isn't the equivalent in security level of a P-521 EC, adding text to solve this, as you proposed --> 
				because they do not present the same security level (see <xref target="secc"/>) and are shown here to indicate sizes of messages with "big" keys.
