Abstract

   This memo describes a framework and guidelines for the development of
   performance metrics that are beyond the scope of existing working
   group charters in the IETF.  In this version, the memo refers to a
   Performance Metrics Entity, or PM Entity, which may in future be a
   working group or directorate or a combination of these two.

Internet-Draft           Perf. Metric Framework             October 2007


1.  Introduction

   There have always been some uncertainties about the performance and
   suitability of new technologies and applications for their intended
   audience, and the Internet is no exception.  Most uncertainties are
   effectively addressed through quantified assessment of key
   performance indicators.  Standardized performance metrics add the
   desirable features of consistent implementation, interpretation, and
   comparison.

   There are at least three phases in the development of performance
   standards.  They are:

   1.  Definition of a Performance Metric and its units of measure

   2.  Specification of a Method of Measurement

   3.  Specification of the Reporting Format

   In some metric development activites, there are additional steps,
   such as setting numerical requirements or objectives.  This memo will
   focus on metric definition, but it is worth noting that the products
   of this phase benefit when the challenges of measurement are
   considered.

   In this version, the memo refers to a Performance Metrics Entity, or
   PM Entity, which may in future be a working group or directorate or a
   combination of these two.

1.1.  Background and Motivation

   Although the IETF has two Working Groups dedicated to the development
   of performance metrics, they each have strict limitations in their
   charters:

   - The Benchmarking Methodology WG has addressed a range of networking
   technologies and protocols in their long history (such as IEEE 802.3,
   ATM, Frame Relay, and Routing Protocols), but the charter strictly
   limits their performance characterizations to the laboratory
   environment.

   - The IP Performance Metrics WG has the mandate to develop metrics
   applicable to live IP networks, but it is specifically prohibited
   from developing metrics that characterize traffic (such as a VoIP
   stream).

   A BOF held at IETF-69 introduced the IETF community to the
   possibility of a generalized activity to define standardized

Internet-Draft           Perf. Metric Framework             October 2007


   performance metrics.  The existence of a growing list of Internet-
   Drafts on performance metrics (with community interest in
   development, but in un-chartered areas) illustrates the need for
   additional performance work.  The majority of people present at the
   BOF supported the proposition that IETF should be working in these
   areas, and no one objected to any of the proposals.

   The IETF does have current and completed activities related to the
   reporting of application performance metrics (e.g.  RAQMON) and is
   also actively involved in the development of reliable transport
   protocols which would affect the relationship between IP performance
   and application performance.

   Thus there is a gap in the currently chartered coverage of IETF WGs:
   development of performance metrics for non-IP-layer protocols that
   can be used to characterize performance on live networks.

1.2.  Organization of this memo

   This memo is divided in two major sections beyond the Purpose and
   Scope section.  The first is a definition and description of a
   performance metric and its key aspects.  The second defines a process
   to develop these metrics that is applicable to the IETF environment.


2.  Purpose and Scope

   The purpose of this memo is to define a framework and a process for
   developing performance metrics in the IETF.

   The scope includes metric definition for any protocol developed by
   the IETF.  However, other frameworks exist for IETF chartered work
   [RFC2330], and this memo is not intended to superceed the existing
   working methods.

   Question: How do we write this scope so as not to conflict with IPPM
   and BMWG?  Can we say that this framework may be useful to those
   activities as well, and leave it at that?  Perhaps this will do:

   This process is not intended to govern performance metric development
   in existing IETF WG, such as IPPM and BMWG.  However, the framework
   and guidelines may be useful in these activities, and MAY be applied
   where appropriate.


3.  Metrics Development

   This section provides key definitions and qualifications of

Internet-Draft           Perf. Metric Framework             October 2007


   performance metrics.

3.1.  Definitions of a Metric

   A metric is a measure of an observable behavior of an application,
   protocol or other system.  The definition of a metric often assumes
   some implicit or explicit underlying statistical process, and a
   metric is an estimate of a parameter of this process.  If the assumed
   statistical process closely models the behavior of the system then
   the metric is "better" in the sense that it more accurately
   characterizes the state or behavior of the system.

   A metric should serve some defined purpose.  This may include the
   measurement of capacity, quantifying how bad some problem is,
   measurement of service level, problem diagnosis or location and other
   such uses.  A metric may also be an input to some other process, for
   example the computation of a composite metric or a model or
   simulation of a system.  Tests of the "usefulness" of a metric
   include:

      (i) the degree to which its absence would cause significant loss
      of information on the behavior or state of the application or
      system being measured

      (ii) the correlation between the metric and the quality of service
      / experience delivered to the user (person or other application)

      (iii) the degree to which the metric is able to support the
      identification and location of problems affecting service quality.

   For example, consider a distributed application operating over a
   network connection that is subject to packet loss.  A Packet Loss
   Rate (PLR) metric is defined as the mean packet loss rate over some
   time period.  If the application performs poorly over network
   connections with high packet loss rate and always performs well when
   the packet loss rate is zero then the PLR metric is useful to some
   degree.  Some applications are sensitive to short periods of high
   loss (bursty loss).  If both bursty and independent loss occur, it is
   possible that there may be periods during which the PLR metric would
   be the same however the application performance would be different -
   i.e.  PLR is weakly correlated with application performance - which
   would suggest that the metric is weak.

3.2.  Composed Metrics

   Some metrics may not be measured directly, but may be composed from
   metrics that have been measured.  Usually the contribution metrics
   have a limited scope in time or space, and they can be combined to

Internet-Draft           Perf. Metric Framework             October 2007


   estimate the performance of some larger entity.

   [I-D.ietf-ippm-framework-compagg] gives the framework for three types
   of composed metrics: Temporal Aggregation, Spatial Aggregation, and
   Spatial Composition.

   Spatial Composition is described in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-spatial-composition].  Other memos in this framework
   are TBD.

   >>>Not sure what's intended in this next one >>>

   - Derivative / Composite metrics (e.g. combined effect of several
   different metrics)

3.3.  Metric Specification

   Process for specifying a metric

3.4.  Classes of Metrics

   Simplify process by identifying classes of metric

3.5.  Qualifying Metrics

   Each metric SHOULD be assessed according to the following list of
   qualifications:

   o  Unambiguously defined?

   o  Units of Measure Specified?

   o  Measurement Errors Identified?

   o  Repeatable?

   o  Implementable?

   o  Assumptions concerning underlying process?

   o  Use cases?

   o  Correlation with application performance/ user experience?

   (not sure that the last one is essential, it can be useful to
   characterize a network attribute without linking it to application
   performance/user experience)

3.6.  Reporting Models

   A metric, or some set of metrics, may be measured over some time
   period, measured continuously, sampled, aggregated and/or combined
   into composite metrics and then reported using a "push" or "pull"
   model.  Reporting protocols typically introduce some limitations and
   assumptions with regard to the definition of a metric.


4.  Performance Metric Development Process

4.1.  New Proposals for Metrics

   The following entry criteria will be considered for each proposal.

   Proposals SHOULD be prepared as Internet Drafts, describing the
   metrics and conforming to the qualifications above as much as
   possible.

   Proposals SHOULD be vetted by the corresponding protocol development
   Working Group prior to discussion by the PM Entity.  This aspect of
   the process includes an assessment of the need for the metrics
   proposed and assessment of the support for their development in IETF.

   Proposals SHOULD include an assessment of interaction and/or overlap
   with work in other Standards Development Organizations.

   Proposals SHOULD specify the intended audience and users of the
   metrics.  The development process encourages participation by members
   of the intended audience.

4.2.  Proposal Approval

   Who does this???

   The IETF/IESG/Relevant ADs/Relevant WG/PM Entity ???

   This section depends on the direction of the solution, or form that
   the PM Entity takes.

4.3.  PM Entity Interaction with other WGs

   The PM Entity SHALL work in partnership with the related protocol
   development WG when considering an Internet Draft that specifies
   performance metrics for a protocol.  A sufficient number of
   individuals with expertise must be willing to consult on the draft.
   If the related WG has concluded, comments on the proposal should
   still be sought from key RFC authors and former chairs, or from the

Internet-Draft           Perf. Metric Framework             October 2007


   WG mailing list if it was not closed.

   A dedicated mailing list MAY be initiated for each work area, so that
   protocol experts can subscribe to and receive the message traffic
   that is relevant to their work.

   In some cases, it will be appropriate to have the IETF session
   discussion during the related protocol WG session, to maximize
   visibility of the effort to that WG and expand the review.

4.4.  Standards Track Performance Metrics

   The PM Entity will manage the progression of PM RFCs along the
   Standards Track.  See [I-D.bradner-metricstest].  This may include
   the preparation of test plans to examine different implementations of
   the metrics to ensure that the metric definitions are clear and
   unambiguous (depending on the final form of the draft above).


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   In general, the existence of framework for performance metric
   development does not constitute a security issue for the Internet.

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656].
