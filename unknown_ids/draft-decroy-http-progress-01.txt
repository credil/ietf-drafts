Abstract

   This document specifies extenions to HTTP to allow progress messages
   for user-agents during lengthy transactions, and to allow better 
   flow-control of large message body submission in cases where HTTP
   authentication is required by servers and/or intermediaries.

2.  Introduction and motivation

2.1 The need for progress information

   Increasingly, resource transfers using HTTP are subject to ever-
   more complex processing, particularly by proxy servers.  Processing 
   such as scanning resources for viruses at an HTTP proxy creates 
   special problems that cannot be resolved cleanly with the current 
   specification of HTTP.

   Many types of processing require access to an entire message body.
   This can take considerable time to accumulate depending on upstream 
   link bandwidth and/or other factors.  It may not be safe to send 
   any part of the resource to the client until processing is complete.

   Frequently problems occur where human users of client agents give up
   waiting for visible progress, typically resulting in retries wasting
   time and network resources.

   Furthermore, some automated clients will give up waiting when no
   resource data is received within a certain timeframe.

   There is a clear need for upstream agents to be able to provide 
   timely progress notifications to downstream agents to enable them to
   make proper decisions about whether it is appropriate to keep 
   waiting.


2.3 Aim of this document

   This document aims to solve this problems by providing a defined 
   mechanism whereby intermediaries or server agents can provide visible
   progress notifications back to the client agent (and the human user),
   thereby avoiding inappropriate timeouts, and retries;

3 Header field definitions

   This document defines a new header field to indicate progress.  
   This field allows optional textual state indication as well as 
   requiring numeric indication of completeness.

3.1 Progress

   The Progress field MAY appear in any request message sent by a client
   or in any server or proxy-generated 1xx series of response messages.  
   The Progress field MUST not appear in any other series of response 
   messages.

   A server that complies with this document upon receiving a request 
   containing a Progress field MUST provide an interim response message 
   (1XX) within a reasonable time period AND provide further periodic 
   updates until the final response to the request is sent.  
   
   A proxy that complies with this document upon receiving a request
   containing a Progress field MUST forward the tag unchanged to any
   upstream agent.  The proxy however is responsible for providing
   progress messages to the client, and in the event that no upstream
   notifications are available, it MUST satisfy the client progress
   notifications whilst it is still prepared to process the request.
   
   The proxy SHOULD pass any 1XX messages back through to the 
   client unchanged.  

   Progress indication is worthless if it is not timely.  A discussion
   of timing is in section 4


   The form of the field is defined below

3.1.1 Client request

   Progress = "Progress" ":" SP interval

   interval = the time in seconds in which the client expects a response

   Example:
   
   Progress: 10

Internet-Draft                http-progress                  August 2007


3.1.2 1xx Responses

   Progress         = "Progress" ":" SP numeric [";" SP textual] 

   textual          = any text valid in a header

   numeric          = (percent | bytes-processed "/" bytes-total)

   percent          = "%" number

   bytes-processed  = number
   
   bytes-total      = number | "UNKNOWN"

   The textual information is intended to be displayed verbatim to a
   user in an area usually associated with progress indication.  The 
   numeric-progress field can be used to display a progress bar and/or
   show how much data has been received by an upstream proxy.
   
   the language of the text information SHOULD be the same language
   as indicated as preferred by the client in its original request, e.g.
   by using the values from the Accept-Language: header in the request

   Examples of its use are:

      Progress: 20480/UNKNOWN; Generating content

   This could be sent by a server to indicate progress of generation of
   content.

      Progress: 20480/UNKNOWN; Download in progress

   Could be sent by an upstream proxy that is retrieving a message body,
   has received 20480 bytes, and doesn't know the content length.  

      Progress: 1200000/1200000; Download complete, scanning

   Could be sent by an upstream proxy that has just completed retrieving 
   a message body, has received 1200000 of 1200000 bytes, and is about 
   to scan the content before sending it on to the client.

      Progress: %25; Scanning content for viruses

   Could be sent by an upstream proxy that is currently 25% through 
   virus scanning of a message body.

      Progress: %45; Enumerating mail folders

   could be sent by a webmail server opening a user mailbox

4.  Timing
   
4.1 Progress intervals
   
   The client Progress header indicates a time in seconds which is the
   time within which it expects a response (either final or interim
   containing progress information).  The server or proxy SHOULD use 
   this specified time as the initial time and periodic time for
   updates, or choose another time.   If the server chooses to use 
   another periodic interval, this should be one chosen with regard to
   the usefulness of the interval to a waiting human, and it is 
   suggested that an interval of about 5 - 10 seconds would be 
   appropriate.

   Agents generating progress notifications MAY choose to send a 
   notification whenever any significant change in state occurs.  
   
   However in the interests of bandwidth, agents SHOULD NOT send 
   progress notifications more frequently than once per second.
   This includes an intermediary which may be generating notifications
   and relaying notifications from upstream.

   It is left up to the implementor of intermediaries to choose which 
   notifications they may choose to relay or generate themselves, 
   remembering that this is intended for a human user, but will be 
   useful to automated agents as well.

6. Compatibilty issues.

   None identified.  RFC2616 already mandates that any agent must be 
   able to cope with multiple interim responses.

   A server not understanding the Progress header in a request will
   not generate progress notifications.

   A client unaware of this document will not generate requests with
   the Progress header.

   A proxy not understanding the Progress header already should be 
   passing unknown headers through to upstream, and also passing back 
   1XX responses.

7.  Implementation Notes

   Most user agents provide screen real-estate to display progress, 
   often in the "status bar" of the window.  It is envisaged that the
   progress notifications outlined in this document would be shown in
   there.
