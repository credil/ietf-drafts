    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
		<t>
			The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) <xref target="RFC4975" pageno="false" format="default" /> is 
			designed to use MSRP relays <xref target="RFC4976" pageno="false" format="default" />  as a means for 
			Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement.
		</t>
		<t>
			However, many Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" />  
			networks, in which MSRP usage is emerging, also contain SIP Application Layer Gateways (ALGs), that anchor 
			and controls media, perform tasks such as NAT traversal, performance monitoring, lawful intercept, address
			domain bridging, interconnect Service Layer Agreement (SLA) policy enforcement, etc.  An example is the 
			Interconnection Border Control Function (IBCF) <xref target="3GPP.23.228" pageno="false" format="default" />, 
			defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The IBCF controls a media relay that handles all 
			types of SIP session media (voice, video, MSRP, etc).
		</t>
		<t>
			MSRP, as defined in RFC 4975 <xref target="RFC4975" pageno="false" format="default" /> and RFC 4976 
			<xref target="RFC4976" pageno="false" format="default" />, does not work when an MSRP endpoints communicate 
			with such ALGs, unless the ALGs implement MSRP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) functionality.
			The reason is that ALGs modify the address:port information in SDP c/m-line in order to anchor media, 
			and since the active MSRP UA establishes the MSRP TCP connection based on the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path
			attribute, this means that the MSRP connection will not, unless the ALG also modifies the MSRP URI of the 
			topmost SDP a=path attribute be routed through the ALG, which in many scenarios will prevent the MSRP
			connection from being established. However, if the ALG modifies the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, 
			then the MSRP URI comparison procedure <xref target="RFC4975" pageno="false" format="default" />, which 
			requires consistency between the address information in the MSRP messages and the address information 
			carried in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, will fail. The matching 
			will fail if ALGs modify the address information in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, but do not 
			enable MSRP B2BUA functionality and perform the corresponding modification in the associated MSRP messages. 
			However, the enabling of MSRP B2BUA functionality requires substantially more resource usage in the ALG, 
			that normally result in negative performance impact.
		</t>
		<t>
			This specification defines an MSRP extension, Alternative Connection Establishment (ACE), that in certain cases 
			allows MSRP endpoints to communicate with ALGs without a need for the ALGs to enable MSRP B2BUA  functionality. 
			In such cases, ALGs that anchor the MSRP connection simply modify the SDP c/m-line address information 
			(similar to what it does for non-MSRP media types), and MSRP endpoints that support the ACE extension can use the SDP c/m-line 
			address information for establishing the TCP (or TLS) connection to be used for sending and receiving of MSRP messages.
		</t>
		<t>	
			The ACE extension is fully backward compatible. In scenarios where MSRP endpoints that do not support the
			ACE extension are able to establish MSRP connectivity, an MSRP endpoint that supports the ACE extension behaves 
			in the same way as an MSRP endpoint that does not support it.
			The ACE extension only provides an alternative mechanism for negotiating and providing 
			the address information for the MSRP TCP connection. Once the MSRP TCP connection has been 
			created, an MSRP endpoint that supports the ACE extension MUST act according to the 
			procedures (e.g. for creating MSRP messages, performing checks when receiving MSRP messages etc) 
			defined in RFC 4975 (and RFC 4976, when it is using a relay for MSRP communication).

    <section title="Alternative Connection Establishment Mechanism" toc="default">
		<section title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				This section defines how an MSRP endpoint that supports the ACE extension generates SDP offers 
				and answers for MSRP, and what SDP information elements the MSRP endpoint uses when creating
				the TCP connection for the MSRP messages.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="MSRP Offerer Procedures" toc="default">
			<t>
				When an MSRP endpoint sends an SDP offer for MSRP, it generates the SDP offer according to the 
				procedures in RFC 4975 (and RFC 4976, if it is using a relay for MSRP communication), with the 
				following additions and modifications:
			</t>
			<t>
				1) The MSRP endpoint MUST include an SDP a=msrp-ace attribute in the MSRP media description 
				of the SDP offer.
			</t>
			<t>
				2) If the MSRP endpoint is not using a relay for MSRP communication, it MUST include an SDP a=setup 
				attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP offer, according to the procedures in RFC 6135.
			</t>
			<t>
				3) If the MSRP endpoint is using a relay for MSRP communication, it MUST include the address 
				information on the relay (the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute), rather than the address 
				information of itself, in the SDP c/m-line associated with the MSRP media description. In addition, 
				it MUST include an SDP a=setup:passive attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP offer. 
			</t>
			<t>
				When the MSRP endpoint receives the first SDP answer to the SDP offer above, and the SDP answer indicates that the 
				offered MSRP media has been accepted by the remote MSRP endpoint (i.e. the port number of the MSRP media description 
				is not set to zero), if the MSRP media description of the SDP answer does not contain an SDP a=msrp-ace attribute, 
				the MSRP endpoint MUST check whether any of the following criteria is fulfilled:
			</t>
			<t>
				1) The SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP media description does not match the information 
				in the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute, and the MSRP media description contains an SDP a=setup:active 
				attribute (indicating that the remote MSRP endpoint is "active"). 
			</t>
			<t>
				2) The MSRP media description contains multiple SDP a=path attributes (indicating that MSRP relays are used).
			</t>
			<t>
				If any, or both, of the criteria above is fulfilled, the MSRP endpoint MUST fallback to RFC 4975 behavior, by 
				sending a new SDP offer according to the procedures in RFC 4975 and RFC 4976. The new offer MUST NOT 
				contain an SDP a=msrp-ace attribute. 
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: In the absence of the SDP a=msrp-ace attribute in the new offer, the ALG will in all cases have to, 
				in order to be able to anchor MSRP media, enable MSRP B2BUA functionality.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: The MSRP endpoint can send the new offer within the existing early dialog <xref target="RFC3261" 
				pageno="false" format="default" />, or it can terminate the early dialog and establish a new dialog by sending 
				the new offer in a new initial INVITE request.
			</t>
			<t>
				In all other cases, where the MSRP endpoint becomes "active", it MUST use the SDP c/m-line for establishing 
				the MSRP TCP connection. If the MSRP endpoint becomes "passive", it will wait for the remote MSRP endpoint 
				to establish the TCP connection, according to the procedures in RFC 4975.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="MSRP Answerer Procedures" toc="default">
			<t>
				When an MSRP endpoint receives an SDP offer for MSRP, if the MSRP media description does not contain 
				an SDP a=msrp-ace attribute, the MSRP endpoint MUST check whether any of the following criteria is 
				fulfilled:
			</t>
			<t>
				1) The SDP c/m-line address information associated with the MSRP media description does not match the 
				information in the MSRP URI of the topmost SDP a=path attribute, and the remote MSRP endpoint will 
				become "active" (either by default, or by negotiation using the procedures in RFC 6135).
			</t>
			<t>
				2) The MSRP media description contains multiple SDP a=path attributes (indicating that MSRP relays 
				are used).
			</t>
			<t>
				3) The MSRP endpoint uses a relay for MSRP communication, and is not able to become "passive" (the 
				MSRP media description of the offer contains an SDP a=setup:passive attribute).
			</t>
			<t>
				If any, or all, of the criteria above is fulfilled, the MSRP endpoint MUST fallback to RFC 4975 
				behavior, and generate the associated SDP answer according to the procedures in RFC 4975 and RFC 4976. 
				The MSRP endpoint MUST NOT insert an SDP a=msrp-ace attribute in the MSRP media description of the 
				SDP answer.
			</t>
			<t>
				In all other cases, the MSRP endpoint generates the associated SDP answer according to the 
				procedures in RFC 4975 and RFC 4976, with the following additions and modifications:
			</t>
			<t>
				1) The MSRP endpoint MUST include an SDP a=msrp-ace attribute in the MSRP media description of the SDP answer.
			</t>
			<t>
				2) If the MSRP endpoint is not using a relay for MSRP communication, it MUST include an SDP a=setup 
				attribute in the MSRP media description of the answer, according to the procedures in RFC 6135.

				according to the procedures in RFC 4975.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Usage With The Alternative Connection Model" toc="default">
			<t>
				An MSRP endpoint that supports the ACE extension MUST in addition also support the mechanism defined in 
				RFC 6135, as it extends the number of scenarios where the ACE extension can be used, and ALGs do not
				need to enable MSRP B2BUA functionality. An example is where a MSRP endpoint is using a relay for MSRP
				communication, and it needs to be "passive" in order to use the ACE extension (instead of doing a fallback
				to RFC 4975 behavior.

	<section title="ALG assumptions" toc="default">
		<section title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				This document does not specify explicit ALG behavior, eventhough some of the procedures will be enabled 
				by ALGs. However, as the main reason behind the ACE extension is to allow MSRP endpoints to communicate 
				in networks where ALGs are present, this document makes certain assumptions regarding to how such ALGs 
				behave.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="MSRP awareness" toc="default">
			<t>
				This document assumes that an ALG, in order to support interoperability between UAs that support the 
				ACE extension and UAs that do not support the extension, is MSRP aware, meaning that it implements 
				MSRP B2BUA functionality, and that it enables that functionality in cases where support of the ACE 
				extension is not indicated. In cases where support of the ACE extension is indicated by at least 
				one MSRP endpoint, the ALG can simply modifies the SDP c/m-line address information for the MSRP 
				connection. However, MSRP communication will work if the ALG enables MSRP B2BUA functionality also 
				in such cases.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="TCP connection reuse" toc="default">
			<t>
				When the ACE extension is used, in cases where ALGs do not need to enable MSRP B2BUA functionality, 
				the ALGs are not required to parse and modify the MSRP payload. An ALG that does not parse the MSRP
				payload might not enable re-usage of TCP connections for multiple MSRP sessions. Instead, in order to 
				associate an MSRP message with a specific session, the ALG often assigns a unique local address:port
				combination for each MSRP session.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="SDP integrity" toc="default">
			<t>
				This document assumes that ALGs are able to modify the SDP address information associated with 
				the MSRP media, and therefore can not be deployed in environments that require SIP identity 
				<xref target="RFC4916" pageno="false" format="default" /> based peer-to-peer SDP protection.
			</t>				
		</section>		
		<section title="TLS" toc="default">
			<t>				
				This document considers two approaches how an ALG handles TLS protected MSRP connections.
			</t>
			<t>
				In the first approach, the ALG relays the MSRP media packets at the transport layer. The 
				TLS handshake and resulting security association (SA) are established peer-to-peer between the MSRP
				endpoints. The ALG will see encrypted MSRP media packets, but is unable to inspect the cleartext 
				content.
			</t>
			<t>
				In the second approach, the ALG acts as a TLS B2BUA, meaning that separate SAs are established 
				between the ALG and each MSRP endpoint. The ALG decrypts MSRP media packets received from one 
				MSRP endpoint, and then re-encrypts them before sending them toward the other MSRP
				endpoint. With this approach, the ALG can inspect and modify the MSRP message content.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security" toc="default">					
		<section title="Man in the middle" anchor="sec-security-mitm" toc="default">
			<t>
				In some cases, where MSRP B2BUA functionality does not need to be enabled, 
				the ACE extension makes it easier for a man in the middle (MiTM) to transparently 
				insert itself in the communication between MSRP endpoints in order to monitor or 
				record unprotected MSRP communication. It does not however make it easier for a 
				MiTM to monitor TLS protected MSRP, or in any significant way modify TLS protected 
				MSRP content or even find out that the packets contain MSRP messages, since that 
				would require the MiTM to implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, no matter if UAs 
				support the ACE extension or not. It would thus require the MiTM to 
				terminate the TCP/TLS/MSRP connection in both directions.
			</t>
		</section>
				
		<section title="TLS" anchor="sec-security-tls" toc="default">
			<t>
				The ACE extension supports the usage of name based authentication for TLS, also in 
				the presence of ALGs.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: If an ALG acts as a TLS B2BUA, MSRP endpoints will also be able to use
				fingerprint based authentication for TLS, no matter if they support the ACE
				extension or not. In such cases, as the ALG acts as a TLS endpoints, MSRP endpoints 
				might be given an incorrect impression that there is an end-to-end SA between the 
				MSRP endpoints.
			</t>
			<t>
				If an ALG does not act as a TLS B2BUA, fingerprint based authentication will not 
				work, as the "SIP Identity" based integrity protection of SDP will break. 
				Therefore, in addition to the authentication mechanisms defined in RFC 4975, 
				an MSRP endpoint supporting the ACE extension SHOULD also support an authentication 
				mechanism that does not rely on peer-to-peer SDP integrity.
			</t>
			<t>
				It is RECOMMENDED that an MSRP endpoint supports one of the following authentication 
				mechanisms:
			</t>
			<t>
				1) TLS certificates together with support of interacting with a
				Certificate Management Service [ref to draft-ietf-sip-certs], to
				which it publishes the public version of its own self-signed
				certificate and from which it fetches on need the public certificates
				of other endpoints.
			</t>
			<t>
				2) TLS-PSK managed e.g by MIKEY-TICKET based Key Management and Key
				Management Service <xref target="RFC6043" pageno="false" format="default" />.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: 3GPP has specified usage of the MIKEY-TICKET based Key
				Management and Key Management Service authentication mechanism for
				the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).
			</t>
			<t>
				When an MSRP endpoint generates an SDP offer for MSRPS it MUST, in 
				addition to the SDP attributes associated with the TLS authentication mechanisms
				described in RFC 4975, it MUST include any information elements associated with the
				other authentication mechanisms that it supports.
			</t>
			<t>
				Unless the MSRP endpoints are able to use name based authentication, and they
				support a common authentication mechanism, they MUST use that mechanism.
				If the MSRP endpoints do not support such common authentication mechanism,
				they MUST try fingerprint based authentication, which will succeed if there
				are no ALGs present. If that also fails, the MSRP endpoints MUST either:
			</t>
			<t>
				1) Consider the TLS authentication as failed, in accordance with RFC 4975; or
			</t>
			<t>
				2) If the SIP signalling between the MSRP endpoints is protected through e.g. 
				SIPS, use fingerprint based authentication without requiring peer-to-peer SDP 
				integrity, and thus trust the network endpoints in the signaling path for SDP 
				integrity.
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: As defined in RFC 4975, if TLS authentication fails, the user need to be
				able to decide whether to try to anyway establish an MSRP connection.
