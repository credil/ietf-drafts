Abstract

   Where the payload carried over a pseudowire carries a number of
   identifiable flows it can in some circumstances be desirable to carry
   those flows over the equal cost multiple paths that exist in the
   packet switched network.  This draft describes two methods of
   achieving that, the one by including an additional label in the label
   stack, the other by using a block of alternative pseudowire labels.

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  November 2007


1.  Introduction

   A pseudowire is defined as a mechanism that carries the essential
   elements of an emulated service from one provider edge (PE) to one or
   more other PEs over a packet switched network (PSN) [RFC3985].

   A pseudowire is normally transported over one single network path,
   even if multiple ECMP paths exit between the ingress and egress
   PEs[RFC4385] [RFC4928].  This is required to preserve the
   characteristics of the emulated service (e.g. avoid misordering for
   example for SAToP pseudowire's [RFC4553]).  Except in the extreme
   case described in Section 6, the new capability proposed in this
   draft does not change this default property of pseudowires.

   Some pseudowire's (for example Ethernet pseudowires) transport IP
   packets between two router locations (creating a virtual direct
   Ethernet link between these two routers).  Such pseudowire's may
   carry from hundred's of Mbps to Gbps of traffic.  Such pseudowire's
   do not require ordering to be preserved between packets of the
   pseudowire.  They only require ordering to be preserved within the
   context of each individual transported IP flow.  Operators have
   requested the ability to explicitly configure such a pseudowire to
   leverage the availability of multiple ECMP paths.  This allows for
   better capacity planning as the statistical multiplexing of a larger
   number of smaller flows is more efficient than with a smaller set of
   larger flows.

   This specification describes two methods of load balancing the
   pseudowire

   o  Use of a load balance label

   o  Allocation of multiple pseudowire labels

   The load balance label mechanism is the more general and more
   powerful method, and as such is the prefered approach.  The
   pseudowire lable block is an OPTINAL method that may be negotiated by
   PEs unable to support the additional label needed by the load balance
   label method.

1.1.  Load Balance Label

   In this approach an additional label is interposed between the
   pseudowire label and the control word, or if the control word is not
   present, between the pseudowire label and the pseudowire payload.
   This additional label is called the pseudowire load balancing label
   (LB label).  Indivisible flows within the pseudowire MUST be mapped
   to the same pseudowire LB label by the ingress PE.  The pseudowire



Bryant, et al.            Expires May 11, 2008                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  November 2007


   load balancing label stimulates the correct ECMP load balancing
   behaviour in the PSN.  On receipt of the pseudowire packet at the
   egress PE (which knows this additional label is present) the label is
   discarded without processing.

   Note that there is no protocol constraint on the value of a LB label.

   This is the prefered method of acheiving load balancing.

1.2.  Pseudowire Labels Block

   In this approach a contiguous block of pseudowire labels are
   allocated to each pseudowire by the egress PE.  Flows carried by the
   pseudowire labels are spread over the set of pseudowire labels, such
   that Indivisible flows within the pseudowire MUST are mapped to the
   same pseudowire label by the ingress PE.  The use of a multiplicity
   of alternate pseudowire labels stimulates the correct ECMP load
   balancing behaviour in the PSN.

   Note that the pseudowire labels MUST be allocated as a contiguous
   block.

   Support for this method is OPTIONAL.


2.  Native Service Processing Function

   The Native Service Processing (NSP) function is a component of a PE
   that has knowledge of the structure of the emulated service and is
   able to take action on the service outside the scope of the
   pseudowire.  In this case it is required that the NSP in the ingress
   PE identify flows, or groups of flows within the service, and
   indicate the flow (group) identity of each packet as it is passed to
   the pseudowire forwarder.  Since this is an NSP function, by
   definition, the method used to identify a flow is outside the scope
   of the pseudowire design.  Similarly, since the NSP is internal to
   the PE, the method of flow indication to the pseudowire forwarder is
   outside the scope of this document


3.  Pseudowire Forwarder

   The pseudowire forwarder must be provided with a method of mapping
   flows to load balanced paths.  Where the method chosen is the label
   block method, the forwarder uses the flow information provided by the
   NSP to allocate a flow to one of the VC labels in the load balancing
   label block.  In all other respects forwarder operation is identical
   to the normal single VC label case.



Bryant, et al.            Expires May 11, 2008                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  November 2007


   When the load balance label method is used the forwarder must
   generate a label for the flow or group of flows.  How the load
   balance label values are determined is outside the scope of this
   document, however the load balance label allocated to a flow SHOULD
   remain constant.  It is recommended that the method chosen to
   generate the load balancing labels introduces a high degree of
   entropy in their values, to maximise the entropy presented to the
   ECMP path selection mechanism in the LSRs in the PSN, and hence
   distribute the flows as evenly as possible over the available PSN
   ECMP paths.  The forwarder at the ingress PE prepends the pseudowire
   control word (if applicable), then prepends either the pseudowire
   load balancing label, followed by the pseudowire label.
   Alternatively it prepends the pseudowire control word (if
   applicable), then selects and appends one of the allocated pseudowire
   labels.

   The forwarder at the egress PE uses the pseudowire label to identify
   the pseudowire.  If the label block approach is used operation is
   identical to the current non-load balanced case.  Alternatively, from
   the pseudowire context, the egress PE can determine whether a
   pseudowire load balancing label is present, and if one is present,
   the label is discarded.

   All other pseudowire forwarding operations are unmodified by the
   inclusion of the pseudowire load balancing label.

4.  Load Balance Signaling

   This section describes the signalling procedures when [RFC4447] is
   used.  It is expected that only one of the two load balance
   mechanisms will chosen, in which case the signalling mechanism



Bryant, et al.            Expires May 11, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  November 2007


   corresponding to the rejected method will not be progressed.

4.1.  Signaling Load Balance Label

   When using the signalling procedures in [RFC4447], there is a
   Pseudowire Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type used to signal the desire
   to include the load balance label when advertising a VC label.

   The presence of this parameter indicates that the egress PE requests
   that the ingress PE place a load balance label between the pseudowire
   label and the control word (or is the control word is not present
   between the pseudowire label and the pseudowire payload).

   If the ingress PE recognises load balance label indicator parameter
   but does not wish to include the load balance label, it need only
   issue its own label mapping message for the opposite direction
   without including the load balance label Indicator.  This will
   prevent inclusion of the load balance label in either direction.

   If PWE3 signalling [RFC4447] is not in use for a pseudowire, then
   whether the load balance label is used MUST be identically
   provisioned in both PEs at the pseudowire endpoints.  If there is no
   provisioning support for this option, the default behaviour is not to
   include the load balance label.

4.1.1.  Structure of Load Balance Label TLV

   The structure of the load balance label TLV is shown in Figure 3.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   | LBL           |    Length     |    must be zero               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 3: Multiple VC TLV

   Where:

   o  LBL is the load balance label TLV identifier assigned by IANA.

   o  Length is the length of the TLV in octets and is 4.

4.2.  Signalling Label Block

   When using the signalling procedures in [RFC4447], there is a
   Pseudowire Interface load balance sub-TLV type used to signal the
   desire load balance the pseudowire over a block of pseudowire VC



Bryant, et al.            Expires May 11, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  November 2007


   labels.

   The presence of this TLV indicates that the egress PE requests that
   the ingress PE distribute the ingress flows present in the pseudowire
   over the block of VC labels sent in this TLV.

   This mechanism is fully backwards compatible.  If the ingress PE does
   not recognise the load balance TLV or does not wish to use it, it
   simply ignores this TLV.

4.2.1.  Structure of Multiple VC TLV

   The field structure is defined in Figure 4.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                            Last Label                         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 4: Multiple VC TLV

   Where:

   o  MultipleVC is the TLV identifier assigned by IANA

   o  Length is 12

   o  First Label is a 20-bit label value as specified in [RFC3032]
      represented as a 20-bit number in a 4 octet field that indicates
      the start of the load balance label block

   o  Last Label is a 20-bit label value as specified in [RFC3032]
      represented as a 20-bit number in a 4 octet field that indicates
      the end of the load balance label block

   First Label SHOULD be the normal VC for this pseudowire.


5.  OAM

   The following OAM considerations apply to both methods of load
   balancing.




Bryant, et al.            Expires May 11, 2008                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  November 2007


   Where the OAM is only to be used to perform a basic test that the
   pseudowires have been configured at the PEs VCCV[I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv]
   messages may be sent using any load balance pseudowire path, i.e.
   over any of the multiple pseudowire labels, or using any pseudowire
   load balance label.

   Where it is required to verify that a pseudowire is fully functional
   for all flowsVCCV [I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv] connection verification
   message MUST be sent over each ECMP path to the pseudowire egress PE.
   This problem is difficult to solve and scales poorly. .  We believe
   that this problem is addressed by the following two methods:

   1.  If a failure occurs within the PSN, this failure will normally be
       detected by the PSN's IGP (link/node failure, link or BFD or IGP
       hello detection), and the IGP convergence will naturally modify
       the ECMP set of network paths between the Ingress and Egress
       PE's.  Hence the PW is only impacted during the normal IGP
       convergence time.

   2.  If the failure is related to the individual corruption of an LFIB
       entry in a router, then only the network path using that specific
       entry is impacted.  If the PW is load balanced over multiple
       network paths, then this failure can only be detected if, by
       chance, the transported OAM flow is mapped onto the impacted
       network path, or all paths are tested.  This type of error may be
       better solved be solved by other means such as LSP self test
       [I-D.ietf-mpls-lsr-self-test].

   To troubleshoot the MPLS PSN, including multiple paths, the
   techniques described in [RFC4378] and [RFC4379] can be used.


6.  Applicability

   This design applies to MPLS pseudowires where it is meaningful to
   deconstruct the packets presented to the ingress PE into flows.  The
   mechanism described in this document promotes the distribution of
   flows within the pseudowire over different network paths.  This in
   turn means that whilst packets within a flow are delivered in order
   (subject to normal IP delivery perturbations due to topology
   variation), order is not maintained amongst packets of different
   flows.  It is not proposed to associate a different sequence number
   with each flow.  If sequence number support is required this
   mechanism is not applicable.

   Where it is known that the traffic carried by the pseudowire is IP
   the method of identifying the flows are well known and can be
   applied.  Of particular importance when the pseudowire is an Ethernet



Bryant, et al.            Expires May 11, 2008                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  LB-fat-pw                  November 2007


   the Ethernet control frames are always using the same network path
   and hence remain in order.

   Methods of identifying separable flows for payloads other than IP are
   less well known, but commonly applied in link bundling between
   adjacent switches.  In this case however the latency distribution
   would be larger than is found in the link bundle case.  The
   acceptability of the increased latency is for further study.


7.  Comparision of the Approaches

   There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to each approach:

   o  The LB label method has a better statistical multiplexing
      capability.

   o  The LB label method has a better semantic than the PW Label block
      approach as this latter merges the pseudowire emultiplexor and the
      load balance semantics.

   o  The LB label preserves label space and hence the FIB table size.

   o  The PW Label Block preserves the data plane path of the egress PE

   o  The PW Label Block has better hardware backwards compatibility.

   o  Both approach anyway require data plane forwarding change for the
      ingress PE.

   o  The LB Label method requires a data plane forwarding change for
      the egress PE.


8.  Security Considerations

   The pseudowire generic security considerations described in [RFC3985]
   and the security considerations applicable to a specific pseudowire
   type (for example, in the case of an Ethernet pseudowire [RFC4448]
   apply.

   There are no additional security risks introduced by this design.


9.  IANA Considerations

   Registry as a Load Balance Label indicator.

   TBD        12            Load Balance VC Block


10.  Congestion Considerations

   The congestion considerations applicable to pseudowires as described
   in [RFC3985] and any additional congestion considerations developed
   at the time of publication apply to this design.

   The ability to explicitly configure a PW to leverage the availability
   of multiple ECMP paths is beneficial to capacity planning as, all
   other parameters being constant, the statistical multiplexing of a
   larger number of smaller flows is more efficient than with a smaller
   number of larger flows.

   Note that if the classification into flows is only performed on IP
   packets the behaviour of those flows in the face of congestion will
   be as already defined by the IETF for packets of that type and no
   additional congestion processing is required.

   Where flows that are not IP are classified pseudowire congestion
   avoidance must be applied to each non-IP load balance group.
