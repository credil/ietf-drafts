Internet-Draft               SIPREC Protocol               December 2010


1.  Introduction

   Communication Session recording requires establishment of the
   recording session between communication system and recording system.
   In order to allow access to such recordings, information about the
   communication session (metadata) is also shared between SRC and SRS.

   The SIPREC Requirements [I-D.ietf-siprec-req] list a set of
   requirements that need to be met by session recording protocols.  The
   SIPREC protocol, which is specified in this document, meets these
   requirements.

   The SIPREC protocol uses SIP as the protocol for session
   establishment with special attention to reducing size of the required
   SIP messages.  In addition, it is designed for future extendability
   and protocol version management to ensure backward compatability.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   defines the terminology used throughout this document, Section 3
   discusses the scope of SIPREC (i.e., which tasks fall within the
   scope of SIPREC and which ones are performed using different
   mechanisms), Section 4 provides a non-normative overview of SIPREC
   operation, and subsequent sections provide the normative
   specification of SIPREC.


2.  Definitions

   The core SIPREC defintions are taken from the requirements document
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-req].

   [Henry's note: do we really need this section since this is just a
   copy and paste?]

      Session Recording Server (SRS): A Session Recording Server (SRS)
      is a SIP User Agent (UA) that is a specialized media server or
      collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An SRS is
      a logical function that typically archives media for extended
      durations of time and provides interfaces for search and retrieval
      of the archived media.  An SRS is typically implemented as a
      multi-port device that is capable of receiving media from several
      sources simultaneously.  An SRS is typically also the sink of the
      recorded session metadata.

   Session Recording Client (SRC)  A Session Recording Client (SRC) is a
      SIP User Agent (UA) that acts as the source of the recorded media,
      sending it to the SRS.  An SRC is a logical function.  Its
      capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical

      devices.  In practice, an SRC could be a personal device (such as
      a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border
      Controller (SBC) or a SIP Media Server (MS) integrated with an
      Application Server (AS).  This specification defines the term SRC
      such that all such SIP entities can be generically addressed under
      one definition.  The SRC itself or another entity working on its
      behalf (such as a SIP Application Server) may act as the source of
      the recording metadata.

   Communication Session (CS)  A session created between two or more SIP
      User Agents (UAs) that is the target for recording.

   Recording Session (RS)  The SIP session created between an SRC and
      SRS for the purpose of recording a Communication Session.

   Metadata  Information that describes recorded media and the CS to
      which they relate.

   SIPREC  The set of SIP extensions that supports recording of
      Communication Sessions.

   Pause during a Communication Session:  The action of temporarily
      discontinuing the transmission and collection of RS media.

   Resume during a Communication Session:  The action of recommencing
      the transmission and collection of RS media.

   Figure 1 shows the relationship between the defintions.

3.  Scope

   The scope of the SIPREC protocol includes the establishment of the
   recording sessions and the reporting of the metadata.  The following
   items, which is not an exhaustive list, do not represent the SIPREC
   protcol itself and are considered out of the scope of the SIPREC
   protcol:

   o  Recording policies that determine whether the CS should be
      recorded

   o  Retention policies that determine how long a recording is stored

   o  Searching and accessing the recorded media and metadata

   o  Delivering recording session metadata through non-SIP mechanism


4.  Overview of operations

   This section provides a description of SIPREC operations.

   As mentioned in the architecture document

   [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture], there are a couple of types of call
   flows based on the location of the Session Recording Client.  The
   following sample call flows provide a quick overview of the
   operations between the SRC and the SRS.

4.1.  Delivering recorded media

   When the SRC is deployed as a B2BUA, the SRC can route call requests
   from UA(A) to UA(B).  As a SIP B2BUA, the SRC has access to the media
   path between the user agents.  When the SRC is aware that it should
   be recording the conversation, the SRC may bridge the media between
   UA(A) and UA(B).  The SRC then establishes the Recording Session with
   the SRS and sends replicated media towards the SRS.

   When one of the endpoint is also acting as the SRC, the endpoint
   itself will be establishing the Recording Session to the SRS.  Since
   the endpoint has access to the media in the communication session,

   A conference focus may also act as an SRC since it has access to all
   the media from each conference participant.  In this example, a user
   agent may REFER the conference focus to the SRS, and the SRC may
   choose to mix media streams from all participants as a single media
   stream towards the SRS.

4.2.  Delivering recording metadata

   Certain metadata, such as the attributes of the recorded media
   stream, are already included in the SDP of the recording session.
   This information is reused as part of the metadata.  The SRC may
   update or add additional metadata about recorded media streams in
   requests such as INVITE, reINVITE, and UPDATE in the Recording
   Session.

   The rest of the metadata will be delivered as content.  Metadata can
   also be represented as a stream of events.  There are 4 ways to
   transport metadata events as outlined in the architecture document:

   SIP INVITE Content: for a simple call recording use case where no
   mid-dialog events are required to be delivered after the RS is
   established, the SIP INVITE may include content for all the metadata

   Event Package: Metadata can also be conveyed from the SRC to the SRS
   using the SIP event notification mechanism [RFC3265].  Using a
   subscription allows the SRC to deliver metadata to the SRS when the
   lifecycles of the CS and RS are different.  This also allows the SRC
   to deliver session metadata and recorded media separately, for
   example, an SRS that reports metadata for multiple recording sessions
   as a single subscription.

   [Henry's note: is it the responsibility of the SRS to find the URI of
   the SRC when sending the SUBSCRIBE request?]

   In some cases session metadata can be conveyed through non-SIP
   mechanism such as HTTP or JTAPI.  These non-SIP mechanisms are
   considered out of the scope of the SIPREC protocol, however, it is
   envisoned that a link with a URI can be provided in the recording
   session INVITE message so that the SRS can access the session
   metadata via the URI provided that the SRS supports the type of URI.

5.  SIP Extensions

   The recording session is a SIP Session and negotiates recorded media
   streams sent from the SRC to the SRS.  In order to identify itself as
   a recording session, the SRC MUST include the src media feature tag
   [I-D.johnston-siprec-cc-rec] in the Contact header of the initial
   INVITE request.  When the SRS provides the response, the SRS MUST
   include the srs media feature tag in the Contact header.

   The From header MUST contain the identity of the SRC.  Participants
   information is not recorded in the From or To header; they are
   included in the metadata information.

   Note that a recording session does not have to have live within the
   scope of a single communication session.  As outline in REQ-004 of
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-req], the recording session can be established in
   the absence of a communication session.  In this case, the SRC MUST
   offer an SDP with zero m= lines.

   Recorded media from multiple communication sessions may be handled in
   a single recording session.  The SRC provides a reference of each
   recorded media stream to the metadata described in the next section.

   The SRC MUST be able to accept re-INVITE from SRS with the updated
   SDP as part of the session timer mechanism.

5.1.  SDP handling

   SRC can include one or more media streams to the SRS.  The SRS MUST
   respond with the same number of media descriptors in the SDP body of
   the 200 OK.

   The SRC should use a=sendonly attribute as the SRC does not expect to
   receive media from the SRS.  As SRS only receives RTP streams from
   SRS, the 200 OK response will normally contain SDP with a=recvonly
   attribute.

   Since the SRC may send recorded media of different participants (or
   even mixed streams) to the SRS, the SDP MUST provide a label on each
   media stream in order to identify the recorded stream with the rest
   of the metadata.  The a=label attribute [RFC4574] will be used to
   identify each recorded media stream, and the label name will be used
   as the reference for the metadata.  Note that a participant may have
   multiple streams (audio and video) and each stream is labeled
   separately.

   [Henry's note: I think the direction of media should be provided in
   the metadata as long as we have a label to reference it in the

   To remove a recorded media stream from the recording session, send a
   reINVITE and set the port to zero in the m= line.

   To add a recorded media stream, send a reINVITE and add a new m=
   line.

   The SRS may respond with a=inactive attribute as part of the SDP in
   the 200 OK response when the SRS is not ready to receive recorded
   media.  The SRS can send re-INVITE to update the SDP with a=recvonly
   when it is ready to receive media.

   The following sequence diagram shows an example of SRS responds with
   SDP that contain a=inactive, and then later update media information
   update with re-INVITE.

5.2.  Metadata

   The format of the full metadata will be described as part of the
   mechanism in [I-D.ram-siprec-metadata].

   As mentioned in the previous section, the SDP of the recording
   session is the metadata for all recorded media streams.  The label
   attribute contains a reference to the rest of the metadata
   information.

   For all basic metadata information such as communication session,
   participants, call identifiers and direction, they can be included in
   the initial INVITE request sent by the SRC.  Metadata can be included
   as content in the INVITE request.  A new "dispoition-type" of
   Content-Disposition is defined for this purpose and the value is
   "recording-session".

   Recording metadata can also be a stream of events.  The metaadata
   events can be reported using SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY mechanism.

   packages assuming both effectively contains the same content for

5.3.  Recording Pause and Resume

   To temporarily discontinue streaming of recorded media from the SRC
   to the SRS, the SRC MUST send a reINVITE and set a=inactive for each
   recorded media stream to be paused.

   To resume streaming of recorded media, the SRC must send a reINVITE
   and set a=sendonly for each recorded media stream to resume.

   [Henry's note: how do we tell the difference between pause/resume of
   recorded media and mute/unmute of the communication session?]

   Required parameters: none

   Options parameters: none


10.  Security Considerations

   The recording session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog
   [RFC3261], therefore, the recording session can reuse any of the
   existing SIP security mechanism available for securing the recorded
   media as well as metadata.

10.1.  Authentication and Authorization

   The recording session reuses the SIP mechanism to challenge requests
   that is based on HTTP authentication.  The mechanism relies on 401
   and 407 SIP responses as well as other SIP header fields for carrying
   challenges and credentials.

   The SRS may have its own set of recording policies to authorize
   recording requests from the SRC.  The use of recording policies is
   outside the scope of the SIPREC protocol.
