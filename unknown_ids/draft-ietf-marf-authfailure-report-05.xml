		<t>This memo registers an extension report type to ARF 
                   for use in reporting messages that fail one or more 
                   authentication checks performed on receipt of a 
                   message, with the option to include forensic

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="ARF"/> defines a message format for 
                    sending reports of abuse in the messaging infrastructure, 
                    with an eye towards automating both the generation and 
                    consumption of those reports.  There is now also a desire
                    to extend the ARF format to include reporting of 
                    messages that fail to authenticate using known 
                    authentication methods, as these are sometimes evidence 
                    of abuse that can be detected and reported through 
                    automated means.  The same mechanism can be used to 
                    convey forensic information about the specific reason 
                    the authentication method failed.  Thus, this memo 
                    presents such extensions to the Abuse Reporting Format 
                    to allow for detailed reporting of message authentication 
                    failures. </t>

		<t> The current report format defined in <xref target="ARF"/>
		    lacks some specific features required to do effective
		    sender authentication reporting.  This section defines
		    extensions to ARF to accommodate this requirement.
                 </t>

		<section anchor="arf-fields" title="New ARF Feedback Type">
			<t> A new feedback type of "auth-failure" is defined as
			    an extension to Section 8.2 of
		            <xref target="ARF"/>.
			    See <xref target="auth-failures"/>
			    for details. </t>

			<t> A message that uses this feedback type has the
			    following modified header field requirements for
			    the second (machine-parseable) <xref target="MIME"/> part of the
			    report:

			    <list style="hanging">

                                  failure.  To report multiple failures for a 
                                  single message, multiple reports MUST be 
                                  generated. This indicates to the receiver the
                                  failure that generated the report.

		<section anchor="forgeries" title="Forgeries">
			<t> These reports may be forged as easily as ordinary
			    Internet electronic mail.  User agents and
			    automatic mail handling facilities (such as mail
			    distribution list exploders) that wish to make
			    automatic use of DSNs of any kind should take
			    appropriate precautions to minimize the potential
			    damage from denial-of-service attacks. </t>

			<t> Security threats related to forged DSNs include the
			    sending of:

				<list style="letters">
					<t> A falsified authentication failure
					    notification when the message was
					    in fact delivered to the indicated
					    recipient; </t>

					<t> Falsified signature information,
					    such as selector, domain, etc. </t>
				</list> </t>

			<t> Perhaps the simplest means of mitigating this
			    threat is to assert that these reports should
			    themselves be signed with something like DKIM.
			    On the other hand, if there's a problem with the
			    DKIM infrastructure at the verifier, signing DKIM
			    failure reports may produce reports that aren't
			    trusted or even accepted by their intended
			    recipients. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="autogen" title="Automatic Generation">
			<t> Automatic generation of these reports by verifying
			    agents can cause a denial-of-service attack when
			    a large volume of e-mail is sent that causes
			    sender authentication failures for whatever
			    reason. </t>

			<t> Limiting the rate of generation of these
			    messages may be appropriate but threatens to
			    inhibit the distribution of important and possibly
			    time-sensitive information. </t>

			<t> In general ARF feedback loop terms, it is
			    suggested that report generators only create
			    these (or any) ARF reports after an out-of-band
			    arrangement has been made between two parties.
			    This mechanism then becomes a way to adjust
			    parameters of an authorized abuse report feedback
			    loop that is configured and activated by private
			    agreement rather than starting to send them
			    automatically based solely on discovered data in
			    the DNS. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="empty-sender"
		         title="Envelope Sender Selection">
			<t> In the case of transmitted reports in the form of 
                         a new message, it is necessary to consider the 
                         construction and transmission of the message so as 
                         to avoid amplification attacks, deliberate or 
                         otherwise.  See Section 5 of <xref target="ARF"/> 
                         for further information.
                        </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="multiple-incidents"
		         title="Reporting Multiple Incidents">
			<t> If it is known that a particular host generates
			    abuse reports upon certain incidents, an attacker
			    could forge a high volume of messages that will
			    trigger such a report.  The recipient of the
			    report could then be innundated with reports.
			    This could easily be extended to a distributed
			    denial-of-service attack by finding a number of
			    report-generating servers. </t>

			<t> The incident count referenced in
			    <xref target="ARF"/> provides
			    a limited form of mitigation.  The host
			    generating reports may elect to send reports only
			    periodically, with each report representing a
			    number of identical or near-identical incidents.
			    One might even do something inverse-exponentially,
			    sending reports for each of the first ten
			    incidents, then every tenth incident up to 100,
			    then every 100th incident up to 1000, etc.
			    until some period of relative quiet after which
			    the limitation resets. </t>

			<t> The use of this for "near-identical" incidents
			    in particular causes a degradation in reporting
			    quality, however.  If for example a large number
			    of pieces of spam arrive from one attacker,
			    a reporting agent may decide only to send a
			    report about a fraction of those messages.
			    While this averts a flood of reports to a
			    system administrator, the precise details of
			    each incident are similarly not sent. </t>

		<section anchor="redaction_dkim_reports"
		         title="Redaction of Data in DKIM Reports">
                         <t>This memo requires that the canonicalized header 
                         and body be returned without being subject to redaction
                         when a DKIM failure is being reported.  This is 
                         necessary to ensure that the returned canonicalized 
                         forms are useful for debugging as they must be compared 
                         to the equivalent form at the signer.  If a message is 
                         altered in transit, and the returned data are also 
                         redacted, the redacted portion and the altered portion 
                         may overlap, rendering the comparison results 
                         meaningless.  However, unredacted data can leak 
                         information the reporting entity considers to be 
                         private.  It is for this reason the return of the 
                         canonicalized forms is not required.
