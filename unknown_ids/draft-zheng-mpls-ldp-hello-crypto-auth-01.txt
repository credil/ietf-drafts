1. Introduction 

   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC 5036] utilizes LDP 
   sessions that run between LDP peers. The peers may be directly 
   connected at the link level or may be remote. A label switching 
   router (LSR) that speaks LDP may be configured with the identity of 
   its peers or may discover them using the LDP Hello message sent 
   encapsulated in UDP that may be addressed to "all routers on this 
   subnet" or to a specific IP address. Periodic Hello messages are

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication       March 2011 
    

   also used to maintain the relationship between LDP peers necessary 
   to keep the LDP session active. 

   Unlike all other LDP messages, the Hello messages are sent using UDP 
   not TCP. This means that they cannot benefit from the security 
   mechanisms available with TCP. [RFC5036] does not provide any 
   security mechanisms for use with Hello messages except to note that 
   some configuration may help protect against bogus discovery events. 

   Spoofing a Hello packet for an existing adjacency can cause the 
   valid adjacency to time out and in turn can result in termination of 
   the associated session. This can occur when the spoofed Hello 
   specifies a smaller Hold Time, causing the receiver to expect Hellos 
   within this smaller interval, while the true neighbor continues 
   sending Hellos at the previously agreed lower frequency. Spoofing a 
   Hello packet can also cause the LDP session to be terminated 
   directly, which can occur when the spoofed Hello specifies a 
   different Transport Address, other than the previously agreed one 
   between neighbors. Spoofed Hello messages is observed and reported 
   as real problem in production networks. 

   As described in [RFC5036], the threat of spoofed Basic Hellos can be 
   reduced by accepting Basic Hellos only on interfaces to which LSRs 
   that can be trusted, and ignoring Basic Hellos not addressed to the 
   "all routers on this subnet" multicast group. Spoofing attacks via 
   Extended Hellos are potentially more serious threat. An LSR can 
   reduce the threat of spoofed Extended Hellos by filtering them and 
   accepting only those originating at sources permitted by an access 
   list. However, performing the filtering using access lists requires 
   LSR resource, and the LSR is still vulnerable to the IP source 
   address spoofing. 

   This document introduces a new Cryptographic Authentication TLV 
   which is used in LDP Hello message as an optional parameter. It 
   enhances the authentication mechanism for LDP by securing the Hello 
   message against spoofing attack, and an LSR can be configured to 
   only accept Hello messages from specific peers when authentication 
   is in use. 

   Using this Cryptographic Authentication TLV, one or more secret keys 
   (with corresponding key IDs) are configured in each system. For each 
   LDP Hello packet, the key is used to generate and verify a HMAC Hash 
   that is stored in the LDP Hello packet. For cryptographic hash 
   function, this document proposes to use SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and 
   SHA-512 defined in US NIST Secure Hash Standard (SHS) [FIPS-180-3]. 
   The HMAC authentication mode defined in NIST FIPS 198 is used [FIPS-

   198]. Of the above, implementations MUST include support for at 
   least HMAC-SHA-256 and SHOULD include support for HMAC-SHA-1 and MAY 
   include support for either of HMAC-SHA-384 or HMAC-SHA-512. 

 

2. Cryptographic Authentication TLV 

2.1. Optional Parameter for Hello Message 

   [RFC5036] defines the encoding for the Hello message. Each Hello 
   message contains zero or more Optional Parameters, each encoded as a 
   TLV. Three Optional Parameters are defined by [RFC5036]. This 
   document defines a new Optional Parameter: the Cryptographic 
   Authentication parameter. 

         Optional Parameter               Type 
        -------------------------------  -------- 
         IPv4 Transport Address           0x0401 (RFC5036) 
         Configuration Sequence Number    0x0402 (RFC5036) 
         IPv6 Transport Address           0x0403 (RFC5036) 
         Cryptographic Authentication     0x0404 (this document, TBD by 
                                                IANA) 
   The Cryptographic Authentication TLV Encoding is described in 
   section 2.2.

      0 - HMAC-SHA-1 
      1 - HMAC-SHA-256 
      2 - HMAC-SHA-384 
      3 - HMAC-SHA-512 
      4-255 - Reserved for future use 
   (TBD by IANA) 

   - Reserved: MUST be set to zero on transmit, and ignored on receipt 

   - Auth Key ID: The authentication key ID in use for this packet.  
      This allows one or more keys to be active simultaneously. 

   - Authentication Data:  

     This field carries the digest computed by the Cryptographic 
     Authentication algorithm in use. The length of the Authentication 
     Data varies based on the cryptographic algorithm in used, which is 
     shown as below:  

         Auth type               Length 
        ----------------------  ---------- 
         HMAC-SHA1              20 bytes 
         HMAC-SHA-256           32 bytes 
         HMAC-SHA-384           48 bytes 
         HMAC-SHA-512           64 bytes 
      

3. Cryptographic Aspects  

   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, 
   which is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used:  

   - H is the specific hashing algorithm specified by Auth Type (e.g. 
      SHA-256).  

   - K is the Authentication Key for the Hello packet. 

   - Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.  

   - B is the block size of H, in octets.  

     For SHA-1 and SHA-256:   B == 64  

     For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication       March 2011 
    

   - L is the length of the hash outputs, in octets.  

   - XOR  is the exclusive-or operation.  

   - Ipad is the byte 0x36 repeated B times. 

   - Opad is the byte 0x5c repeated B times.  

   - Apad is the byte 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times. 

    

3.1. Cryptographic Key  

   As described in RFC 2104, the authentication key K can be of any 
   length up to B. Applications that use keys longer than B bytes will 
   first hash the key using H and then use the resultant L byte string 
   as the actual key to HMAC.  

   In this application, Ko is always L octets long. If the 
   Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal to K. If 
   the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long, then Ko is 
   set to H(K). If the Authentication Key (K) is less than L octets 
   long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K) with trailing 
   zeros such that Ko is L octets long.  

    

3.2. Hash  

   First, the Authentication Data field in the Cryptographic 
   Authentication TLV is filled with the value Apad and the Auth Type 
   field is set accordingly per Cryptographic Authentication algorithm 
   in use.  

   Then, to compute HMAC over the Hello packet it performs:  

     H(Ko XOR Opad || H(Ko XOR Ipad || (Hello Packet)))  

   Hello Packet here is the entire LDP Hello packet including the IP 
   header.

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication       March 2011 
    

3.3. Result  

   The resultant Hash becomes the Authentication Data that is       
   sent in the Authentication Data field of the Cryptographic 
   Authentication TLV. The length of the Authentication Data field is 
   always identical to the message digest size of the specific hash 
   function H that is being used.  

    

4. Processing Hello Message Using Cryptographic Authentication 

4.1. Transmission Using Cryptographic Authentication 

   Prior to transmitting Hello message, the Auth Type field is set to 
   indicate the authentication type in use. The Length in the 
   Cryptographic Authentication TLV header is set as per the 
   authentication algorithm that is being used. It is set to 24 for 
   HMAC-SHA-1, 36 for HMAC-SHA-256, 52 for HMAC-SHA-384 and 68 for 
   HMAC-SHA-512. 

   The Auth Key ID field is set to the ID of the current authentication 
   key. The HMAC Hash is computed as explained in Section 3. The 
   resulting Hash is stored in the Authentication Data field prior to 
   transmission. The authentication key MUST NOT be carried in the 
   packet. 

    

4.2. Receipt Using Cryptographic Authentication 

   The receiving LSR applies acceptability criteria for received Hellos 
   using cryptographic authentication. If the Cryptographic 
   Authentication TLV is unknown to the receiving LSR, the received 
   packet MUST be discarded according to Section 3.5.1.2.2 of [RFC5036]. 

   If the Cryptographic Authentication TLV in a received Hello packet 
   does not contain a known and acceptable Auth Type value, then the 
   received packet MUST be discarded. If the Auth Key ID field does not 
   match the ID of a configured authentication key, the received packet 
   MUST be discarded. 

   Before the receiving LSR performs any processing, it needs to save 
   the values of the Authentication Data field. The receiving LSR then 
   replaces the contents of the Authentication Data field with Apad, 
   computes the Hash, using the authentication key specified by the 

 
 
Zheng, et al.        Expires September 14, 2011               [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication       March 2011 
    

   received Auth Key ID field, as explained in Section 3. If the 
   locally computed Hash is equal to the received value of the 
   Authentication Data field, the received packet is accepted for other 
   normal checks and processing as described in [RFC5036]. Otherwise, 
   the received packet MUST be discarded. 

    

5. Security Considerations 

   Section 1 of this document describes the security issues arising 
   from the use of unsecured LDP Hello messages. In order to combat 
   those issues, it is RECOMMENDED that all deployments use the 
   Cryptographic Authentication TLV to secure the Hello message. 

   The quality of the security provided by the Cryptographic    
   Authentication TLV depends completely on the strength of the    
   cryptographic algorithm in use, the strength of the key being used, 
   and the correct implementation of the security mechanism in 
   communicating LDP implementations. Also, the level of security 
   provided by the Cryptographic Authentication TLV varies based on the 
   authentication type used. 

    

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA maintains a registry of LDP message parameters with a sub-
   registry to track LDP TLV Types. This document request IANA to 
   assign a new TLV Types as follows: 

   TLV                           Type 

   Cryptographic Authentication  0x0404 (TBD) 

   This document also request IANA to assign a new registry titled "LDP 
   Hello Authentication Type", its recommended values as follows: 

         Value   LDP Hello Authentication Type Name 
        -------  ----------------------------------- 
           0      HMAC-SHA1 
           1      HMAC-SHA-256 
           2      HMAC-SHA-384 
           3      HMAC-SHA-512 
         4-255    Unassigned 
        (TBD)
