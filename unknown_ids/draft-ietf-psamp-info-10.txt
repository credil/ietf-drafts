Abstract

   This memo defines an information model for the Packet Sampling
   (PSAMP) protocol.  It is used by the PSAMP protocol for encoding
   sampled packet data and information related to the Sampling process.
   As the PSAMP protocol is based on the IPFIX protocol, this
   information model is an extension to the IPFIX information model.

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model          September 2008


1.  Introduction

   Packet Sampling techniques are required for various measurement
   scenarios.  The Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol provides mechanisms
   for packet selection using different Filtering and Sampling
   techniques.  A standardized way for the export and storage is
   required.  The definition of the PSAMP information and data model is
   based on the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].  The PSAMP protocol
   document [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] specifies how to use the IPFIX
   protocol in the PSAMP context.

   This document examines the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102] and
   extends it to meet the PSAMP requirements [RFC3917].  Therefore, the
   structure of this document is strongly based on the IPFIX document.
   It complements the PSAMP protocol specification by providing an
   appropriate PSAMP information model.  The main part of this document,
   section 8, defines the list of Information Elements to be transmitted
   by the PSAMP protocol.  Sections 5 and 6 describe the data types and
   Information Element properties used within this document and their
   relationship to the IPFIX information model.

   The main body of section 8 was generated from an XML document.  The
   XML-based specification of the PSAMP Information Elements can be used
   for automatically checking syntactical correctness of the
   specification.  Furthermore it can be used - in combination with the
   IPFIX information model - for automated code generation.  The
   resulting code can be used in PSAMP protocol implementations to deal
   with processing PSAMP information elements.

   For that reason, the XML document that served as the source for
   section 8 is attached to this document in Appendix A.

   Note that although partially generated from the attached XML
   documents, the main body of this document is normative while the
   appendices are informational.

2.  PSAMP Documents Overview

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework]: "A Framework for Packet Selection and
   Reporting", describes the PSAMP framework for network elements to
   select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, and to
   export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a collector.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech]: "Sampling and Filtering Techniques for
   IP Packet Selection", describes the set of packet selection
   techniques supported by PSAMP.

   [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol]: "Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Protocol
   Specifications" specifies the export of packet information from a
   PSAMP Exporting Process to a PSAMP Collecting Process.

   This document, "Information Model for Packet Sampling Exports",
   defines an information and data model for PSAMP.

3.  Terminology

   IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined in
   Section 2 of [RFC5101].  PSAMP-specific terminology used in this
   document is defined in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol].  As
   in [RFC5101] and [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol], these IPFIX- and PSAMP-
   specific terms have the first letter of a word capitalized when used
   in this document.

4.  Relationship between PSAMP and IPFIX

   As described in the PSAMP protocol [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] a PSAMP
   Report can be seen as a very special IPFIX Data Record.  It
   represents an IPFIX Flow containing only a single packet.  Therefore,
   the IPFIX information model can be used as a basis for PSAMP Reports.

   Nevertheless, there are properties required in PSAMP Reports which
   cannot be modelled using the current IPFIX information model.  This
   document describes extensions to the IPFIX information model which
   allow the modelling of information and data required by PSAMP.

   Some of these extensions allow the export of what may be considered
   sensitive information.  Refer to the Security Considerations section
   for a fuller discussion.

   Note that the export of sampled or filtered PSAMP Reports may not
   need all the Information Elements defined by the IPFIX information
   model [RFC5102], as discussed in sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the PSAMP
   Framework [I-D.ietf-psamp-framework].

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model          September 2008


5.  Properties of a PSAMP Information Element

   The PSAMP Information Elements are defined in accordance with
   sections 2.1 to 2.3 of the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102] to which
   reference should be made for more information.  Nevertheless, we
   strongly recommend defining the optional "units" property for every
   information element (if applicable).

   The Data Types defined in section 3.1 of the IPFIX Information Model
   [RFC5102] are also used for the PSAMP Information Elements.

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model          September 2008


6.  Type Space

   The PSAMP Information Elements MUST be constructed from the basic
   abstract data types and data type semantics described in section 3 of
   the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].  To ensure consistency between
   IPFIX and PSAMP, the data types are not repeated in this document.
   The encoding of these data types is described in the IPFIX Protocol
   [RFC5101].

Internet-Draft           PSAMP Information Model          September 2008


7.  Overloading Information Elements

   Information Elements SHOULD NOT be overloaded with multiple meanings
   or re-used for multiple purposes.  Different Information Elements
   SHOULD be allocated for each requirement.

   Although the presence of certain other Information Elements allows
   the selection method to be inferred, a separate Information Element
   is provided for the selectorAlgorithm to include as scope for the
   Selector Report Interpretation [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol].

   Even if the Information Elements are specified with a specific
   selection method (i.e. a specific value of selectorAlgorithm) in
   mind, these Information Elements are not restricted to the selection
   method and MAY be used for different selection methods in the future.

8.  The PSAMP Information Elements

   This section describes the Information Elements used by the PSAMP
   protocol.

   For each Information Element specified in sections 8.1 - 8.6 below a
   unique identifier is allocated in accordance with section 4 of the
   IPFIX information model [RFC5102].  The assignments are controlled by
   IANA as an extension of the IPFIX Information Model.

   The Information Elements specified by the IPFIX information model
   [RFC5102] are used by the PSAMP protocol where applicable.  To avoid
   inconsistencies between the IPFIX and the PSAMP information and data
   models, only those Information Elements that are not already
   described by the IPFIX information model are defined here.

   List of additional PSAMP Information Elements:

8.1.1.  selectionSequenceId

   Description:

      From all the packets observed at an Observation Point, a subset of
      the packets is selected by a sequence of one or more Selectors.

8.2.1.  selectorAlgorithm

   Description:

      This Information Element identifies the packet selection methods
      (e.g., Filtering, Sampling) that are applied by the Selection
      Process.

      Most of these methods have parameters.  Further Information
      Elements are needed to fully specify packet selection with these
      methods and all their parameters.

      The methods listed below are defined in [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-
      tech].  For their parameters, Information Elements are defined in
      the Information Model Document [I-D.ietf-psamp-info].  The names
      of these Information Elements are listed for each method
      identifier.

      Further method identifiers may be added to the list below.  It
      might be necessary to define new Information Elements to specify
      their parameters

      The selectorAlgorithm registry is maintained by IANA and can be
      updated when specifications of the new method(s) and any new
      Information Elements are provided.

      New assignments for the PSAMP selectionAlgorithm will be
      administered by IANA, and subject to Expert Review [RFC5226].  The
      group of experts must double check the selection method
      definitions and Information Elements with already defined
      selection methods and Information Elements for completeness,
      accuracy and redundancy.  Those experts will initially be drawn
      from the Working Group Chairs and document editors of the IPFIX
      and PSAMP Working Groups.

      The following packet selection methods identifiers are defined in
      [I-D.ietf-psamp-info]:
      +----+------------------------+------------------------+
      | ID |        Method          |      Parameters        |

   Description:

      This Information Element specifies the maximum possible
      measurement error of the reported value for a given Information
      Element.  The absoluteError has the same unit as the Information
      Element it is associated with.  The real value of the metric can
      differ by absoluteError (positive or negative) from the measured
      value.  This Information Element provides only the error for
      measured values.  If an Information Element contains an estimated
      value (from sampling) the confidence boundaries and confidence
      level have to be provided instead.

   Description:

      This Information Element specifies the upper limit of a confidence
      interval.  It is used to provide an accuracy statement for an
      estimated value.  The confidence limits define the range in which
      the real value is assumed to be with a certain probability p.
      Confidence limits always need to be associated with a confidence
      level that defines this probability p.  Please note that a
      confidence interval only provides a probability that the real
      values lies within the limits.  That means the real value can lie
      outside the confidence limits.

9.  Security Considerations

   The PSAMP information model itself does not directly introduce
   security issues.  Rather it defines a set of attributes which may for
   privacy or business issues be considered sensitive information.

   For example, exporting values of header fields may make attacks
   possible for the receiver of this information, which would otherwise
   only be possible for direct observers of the reported Flows along the
   data path.  Specifically, the Information Elements pertaining to
   packet sections MUST target no more than the packet header, some
   subsequent bytes of the packet, and encapsulating headers if present.
   Full packet capture of arbitrary packet streams is explicitly out of
   scope, per [RFC2804].

   The underlying protocol used to exchange the information described
   here must therefore apply appropriate procedures to guarantee the
   integrity and confidentiality of the exported information.  Such
   procedures are defined in separate documents, specifically the IPFIX
   protocol document [RFC5101].

10.  IANA Considerations

   The PSAMP Information Model, as set out in this document, has two
   sets of assigned numbers.  Considerations for assigning them are
   discussed in this section, using the example policies as set out in
   the "Guidelines for IANA Considerations" document [RFC5226]

10.1.  Related Considerations

   As the PSAMP protocol uses the IPFIX protocol, refer to the IANA
   considerations section in [RFC5102] for the assignments of numbers
   used in the protocol and for the numbers used in the information
   model.

10.2.  PSAMP Related Considerations

   This document specifies an initial set of PSAMP Information Elements
   fulfilling the needs specified in [I-D.ietf-psamp-sample-tech], as an
   extension to the IPFIX Information Elements [RFC5102].

   Note that the PSAMP Information Element IDs were initially started at
   the value 301, in order to leave a gap for any ongoing IPFIX work
   requiring new Information Elements.  It is expected that this gap in
   the Information Element numbering will be filled in by IANA with new
   IPFIX Information Elements.

   Each new selection method MUST be assigned a unique value for the
   selectorAlgorithm Information Element.  Its configuration
   parameter(s), along with the way to report it/them with an Options
   Template, MUST be clearly specified.  The initial content of the
   selection method registry is found in section 8.2.1.

   New assignments for the PSAMP selection method will be administered
   by IANA and subject to Expert Review [RFC5226].  The group of experts
   must double check the Information Elements definitions with already
   defined Information Elements for completeness, accuracy and
   redundancy.  Those experts will initially be drawn from the Working
   Group Chairs and document editors of the IPFIX and PSAMP Working
   Groups.  The selectorAlgorithm registry is maintained by IANA and can
   be updated as long as specifications of the new method(s) and any new
   Information Elements are provided.

Appendix A.  Formal Specification of PSAMP Information Elements

   This appendix contains a formal description of the PSAMP information
   model XML document.  Note that this appendix is of informational
   nature, while the text in section Section 8 generated from this
   appendix is normative.

   Using a formal and machine readable syntax for the information model
   enables the creation of PSAMP aware tools which can automatically
   adapt to extensions to the information model, by simply reading
   updated information model specifications.

   The wide availability of XML aware tools and libraries for client
   devices is a primary consideration for this choice.  In particular
   libraries for parsing XML documents are readily available.  Also
   mechanisms such as the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) allow for
   transforming a source XML document into other documents.  This draft
   was authored in XML and transformed according to [RFC2629].

   It should be noted that the use of XML in exporters, collectors or
   other tools is not mandatory for the deployment of PSAMP.  In
   particular, exporting processes do not produce or consume XML as part
   of their operation.  It is expected that PSAMP collectors MAY take
   advantage of the machine readability of the information model vs.
   hardcoding their behavior or inventing proprietary means for
   accommodating extensions.

   Using XML-based specifications does not currently address possible
   IANA implications associated with XML Namespace URIs.  The use of
   Namespaces as an extension mechanism implies that an IANA registered
   Namespace URI should be available and that directory names below this
   base URI be assigned for relevant IETF specifications.  The authors
   are not aware of this mechanism today.

  Abstract:
   This memo defines an information model for the Packet Sampling
   (PSAMP) protocol.  It is used by the PSAMP protocol for encoding
   sampled packet data and information related to the Sampling process.
   As the PSAMP protocol is based on the IPFIX protocol, this
   information model is an extension to the IPFIX information model.

        Information Elements are defined in the Information Model
        Document [I-D.ietf-psamp-info]. The names of these
        Information Elements are listed for each method
        identifier.

        Further method identifiers may be added to the list
        below. It might be necessary to define new Information
        Elements to specify their parameters

        The selectorAlgorithm registry is maintained by IANA and
        can be updated when specifications of the new
        method(s) and any new Information Elements are
        provided.

        New assignments for the PSAMP selectionAlgorithm will be
        administered by IANA, and subject to Expert Review
        [RFC5226].  The group of experts must double check the
        selection method definitions and Information Elements
        with already defined selection methods and Information
        Elements for completeness, accuracy and redundancy. Those
        experts will initially be drawn from the Working Group
        Chairs and document editors of the IPFIX and PSAMP
        Working Groups.

        The following packet selection methods identifiers are

        This Information Element specifies the upper limit of a
        confidence interval. It is used to provide an accuracy
        statement for an estimated value. The confidence limits
        define the range in which the real value is assumed to be
        with a certain probability p. Confidence limits always need
        to be associated with a confidence level that defines this
        probability p. Please note that a confidence interval only
        provides a probability that the real values lies within the
        limits. That means the real value can lie outside the
        confidence limits.

      <paragraph>
        This Information Element specifies the confidence level. It is
        used to provide an accuracy statement for estimated values.
        The confidence level provides the probability p with which the
        real value lies within a given range. A confidence level
        always needs to be associated with confidence limits that
        define the range in which the real value is assumed to be.
