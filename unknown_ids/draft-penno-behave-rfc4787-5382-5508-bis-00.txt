Internet-Draft           NAT behavioral updates                July 2011


1.  Terminology

   The reader should be familiar with all terms defined in defined in
   [RFC2663] , [RFC4787] , [RFC5382] and [RFC5508]


2.  Introduction

   [RFC4787], [RFC5382] and [RFC5508] greatly advanced NAT
   interoperability and conformance.  But with widespread deployment and
   evolution of NAT more development and operational experience was
   acquired some areas of the original documents need further
   clarification or updates.  This documents provides such
   clarifications and updates.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Scope

   This document focuses solely on NAPT44 and its goal is to clarify,
   fill gaps or update requirements of [RFC4787], [RFC5382] and
   [RFC5508].  It is out of the scope of this document the creation of
   completely new requirements not associated with the documents cited
   above.  New requirements would be better served elsewhere and if they
   are CGN specific in [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements]


3.  TCP Session Tracking

   [RFC5382] specifies TCP timers associated with various connection
   states but does not specify the TCP state machine a NAPT44 should use
   as a basis to apply such timers.  The TCP state machine below,
   adapted from [RFC6146], provides guidance on how TCP session tracking
   could be implemented - it is non-normative.

3.1.  TCP Transitory Connection Idle-Timeout

   [RFC5382]:REQ-5 The transitory connection idle-timeout is defined as
   the minimum time a TCP connection in the partially open or closing
   phases must remain idle before the NAT considers the associated
   session a candidate for removal.  But the document does not clearly
   states if these can be configured separately.  This document
   clarifies that a NAT device SHOULD provide different knobs for
   configuring the open and closing idle timeouts.

   This document further acknowledges that most TCP flows are very short
   (less than 10 seconds) [FLOWRATE][TCPWILD]and therefore a partially

Internet-Draft           NAT behavioral updates                July 2011


   open timeout of 4 minutes might be excessive if security is a
   concern.  Therefore it MAY be configured to be less than 4 minutes in
   such cases.

3.2.  TCP RST

   [RFC5382] leaves the handling of TCP RST packets unspecified.  This
   document does not try standardize such behavior but clarifies based
   on operational experience that a NAT that receives a TCP RST for an
   active mapping and performs session tracking MAY immediately delete
   the sessions and remove any state associated with it.

   If the NAT device that performs TCP session tracking receives a TCP
   RST for the first session that created a mapping, it MAY remove the
   session and the mapping immediately.


4.  Address Pooling Paired (APP)

   [RFC4787]: REQ-2 [RFC5382]:ND Address Pooling Paired behavior for NAT
   is recommended in previous documents but behavior when a public IPv4
   run out of ports is left undefined.  This document clarifies that new
   sessions for a endpoint that already has a mapping associated with a
   public IP that ran out of ports SHOULD be dropped.  The administrator
   MAY provide a knob that allows a NAT device to use ports from another
   public IP until ports become available in the original public IP.
   This is trade-off between subscriber service continuity and APP
   strict enforcement.


5.  EIF Security

   [RFC4787]:REQ-8 and [RFC5382]:REQ-3 A NAT device MAY provide access
   lists associated with EIF mappings in order to restrict which hosts
   can originate inbound sessions.  Even though a NAT device allows
   third parties to initiate inbound sessions though an EIF mapping, it
   might want to restrict or allow this hability to certain prefixes.


6.  EIF Protocol Independent

   [RFC4787]:REQ-8 and[RFC5382]: REQ-3 Current RFCs do not specify
   whether EIF mappings are protocol independent.  In other words, if a
   outbound TCP SYN creates a mapping it is left undefined whether
   inbound UDP can create sessions and packets are forwarded.  EIF
   mappings SHOULD be protocol independent in order allow inbound
   packets for protocols that multiplex TCP and UDP over the same IP:
   port through the NAT and maintain compatibility with stateful NAT64

   [RFC6146].  But the administrator MAY provide a configuration knob to
   make it protocol dependent.


7.  EIF Mapping Refresh

   [RFC4787]: REQ-6 [RFC5382]: ND The NAT mapping Refresh Direction MAY
   have a "NAT Inbound refresh behavior" of "True" but it does not
   clarifies how this applies to EIF mappings.  The issue in question is
   whether inbound packets that match an EIF mapping but do not create a
   new session due to a security policy or other should refresh the
   mapping timer.  This document clarifies even when a NAT device has a
   inbound refresh behavior of TRUE, that such packets SHOULD NOT
   refresh the mapping.  Otherwise a simple attack of a packet every 2
   minutes can keep the mapping indefinitely.

   Moreover, due to high risk of resource crunch, a NAT device MAY
   provide a knob to limit the number of inbound sessions spawned from a
   EIF mapping.


8.  EIM Protocol Independent

   [RFC4787] [RFC5382]: REQ-1 Current RFCs do not specify whether EIM
   are protocol indepedent.  In other words, if a outbound TCP SYN
   creates a mapping it is left undefined whether outbound UDP can reuse
   such mapping and create session.  This document clarifies that EIM
   mappings SHOULD be protocol independent in order allow protocols that
   multiplex TCP and UDP over the same source IP and port to use a
   single mapping.  But the administrator MAY provide a configuration
   knob to make it protocol dependent.


9.  Port Parity

   NAT devices MAY disable Port Parity given that [RFC3605] is widely
   supported.


10.  ICMP Query Mappings Timeout

   Section 3.1 of [RFC5508] says that ICMP Query Mappings are to be
   maintained by NAT device.  However, RFC doesn't discuss about the
   Query Mapping timeout values.  Section 3.2 of that RFC only discusses
   about ICMP Query Session Timeouts.  ICMP Query Mappings MAY be
   deleted once the last the session using the mapping is deleted.

Internet-Draft           NAT behavioral updates                July 2011


11.  Hairpinning Support for ICMP Packets

   [RFC5508]:REQ-7 This requirement specifies that NAT devices enforcing
   Basic NAT MUST support traversal of hairpinned ICMP Query sessions.
   This implicitly means that address mappings from external address to
   internal address (similar to Endpoint Independent Filters) MUST be
   maintained to allow inbound ICMP Query sessions.  If an ICMP Query is
   received on an external address, NAT device can then translate to an
   internal IP.

   [RFC5508]:REQ-7 This requirement specifies that all NAT devices
   (i.e., Basic NAT as well as NAPT devices) MUST support the traversal
   of hairpinned ICMP Error messages.  This too requires NAT devices to
   maintain address mappings from external IP address to internal IP
   address in addition to the ICMP Query Mappings described in section
   3.1 of that RFC.


12.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Dan Wing, Suresh Kumar, Mayuresh Bakshi and Rajesh Mohan
   for review and discussions.


13.  IANA Considerations

   None.


14.  Security Considerations

   In the case of EIF mappings due to high risk of resource crunch, a
   NAT device MAY provide a knob to limit the number of inbound sessions
   spawned from a EIF mapping.
