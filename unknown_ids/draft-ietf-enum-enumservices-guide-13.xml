      <t>E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) <xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/> 
      provides an identifier mapping
      mechanism to map <xref target='ITU.E164.2005'>E.164 numbers</xref> to
      <xref target='RFC3986'>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)</xref>.
      One of the primary concepts of ENUM is the definition of "Enumservices",
      which allows for providing different URIs for different applications
      of said mapping mechanism. 
      </t>

      <t>The IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered an unnecessary
      amount of variation in the format of Enumservice Specifications.
      The ENUM Working Group's view of what particular fields and
      information are required and/or recommended has also evolved,
      and capturing these best current practices is helpful in both
      the creation of new Enumservice Specifications, as well as the
      revision or refinement of existing Enumservice Specifications.
      </t>

      <t>This document specifies a revision of the IANA Registry for
      Enumservices, which was originally described
      in <xref target='RFC3761'/>. This document
      obsoletes Section 3 of RFC 3761.

    <section anchor='requirements' title='Registration Requirements'>

        <t>As specified in the ABNF found in
        <xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/>, an Enumservice is made
        up of Types and Subtypes.  For any given Type, the allowable
        Subtypes (if any) must be defined in the Enumservice
        Specification.  There is currently no concept of a registered
        Subtype outside the scope of a given Type.
        </t>
        <!-- Thus, the registration process uses the 'type' as its main key
        within the IANA Registry.</t> -->

        <t>While the combination of each Type and all of its Subtypes
        constitutes the allowed values for the 'Enumservice' field, it
        is not sufficient to simply list the allowed values of 
        those fields. To allow interoperability, a complete
        Enumservice Specification MUST document the semantics of the Type and
        Subtype values to be registered, and MUST contain all
        sections listed in <xref target='requiredSections'/> of this
        document.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, in order for an Enumservice to be registered,
        the entire Registration Document requires approval by the
        experts according to the 'Expert Review' process defined
        in <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines
        for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.
        </t>

        <t>All Enumservice Specifications are expected to conform also
        to various requirements laid out in the following sections.
        </t>

        <section anchor='FunctReq' title='Functionality Requirements'>

          <t>A registered Enumservice must be able to function as a
          selection mechanism when choosing
          one <xref target='RFC3403'>NAPTR resource record</xref> from
          another.  That means that the Enumservice Specification MUST
          specify what is expected when using that very NAPTR record,
          and the URI which is the outcome of the use of it.
          </t>

          <t>Specifically, a registered Enumservice MUST specify the
          URI Scheme(s) that may be used for the Enumservice, and,
          when needed, other information that will have to be
          transferred into the URI resolution process itself.
          </t>

        </section>

        <section anchor='NamingReq' title='Naming Requirements'>

          <t>An Enumservice MUST be unique in order to be useful as a
          selection criterion:
        
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='symbols'>
              
              <t>The Type MUST be unique.
              </t>
            
              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>The Subtype (being dependent on the Type) MUST be
              unique within a given Type.
              </t>

            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Types and Subtypes MUST conform to the ABNF specified in
          <xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/>.
          </t>

          <t>The ABNF specified in
          <xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/> allows the "-" (dash)
          character for Types and Subtypes . To avoid confusion with
          possible future prefixes, a "-" MUST NOT be used as the
          first nor as the second character of a Type nor a Subtype.
          Furthermore, a "-" MUST NOT be used as the last character of
          a Type nor a Subtype.  In addition, Types and Subtypes are
          case insensitive and MUST be specified in small letters.
          </t>

          <t>To avoid confusion with Enumservice fields using an
          obsolete syntax, any identifying tag of any Enumservice MUST
          NOT be set to nor start with "E2U".
          </t>

          <t>The Subtype for one Type MAY have the same identifier as
          a Subtype for
          a different registered Type but it is not sufficient to
          simply reference another Type's Subtype.  The functionality
          of each Subtype MUST be specified in the context of the Type
          being registered.

          recommendations.

        <section anchor='SecReq' title='Security Requirements'>

          <t>An analysis of security issues is REQUIRED for all
          registered Enumservices. (This is in accordance with the
          basic requirements for all IETF protocols.)
          </t>

          <t>All descriptions of security issues MUST be as accurate
          and extensive as feasible.  In particular,
          a statement that there are "no security issues associated
          with this Enumservice" must not be confused with "the
          security issues associated with this Enumservice have not
          been assessed".
          </t>

          <t>There is no requirement that an Enumservice must be
          completely free of security risks.  Nevertheless, all known
          security risks MUST be identified in an Enumservice
          Specification.
          </t>

          <t>The security considerations section of Enumservice
          Specifications is subject to continuing evaluation and
          modification, in accordance with
          <xref target='ChangeControl'/>.
          </t>

          <t>Some of the issues to be looked at in a security
          analysis of an Enumservice are:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='numbers'>

              <t>Complex Enumservices may include provisions for
              directives that institute actions on a user's resources.
              In many cases provision can be made to specify arbitrary
              actions in an unrestricted fashion which may then have
              devastating results (especially if there is a risk for
              a new ENUM look-up, and because of that an infinite loop
              in the overall resolution process of the E.164 number).
              </t>

              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>Complex Enumservices may include provisions for
              directives that institute actions which, while not
              directly harmful, may result in disclosure of
              information that either facilitates a subsequent attack
              or else violates the users' privacy in some way.
              </t>

              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>An Enumservice might be targeted for applications
              that require some sort of security assurance but do not
              provide the necessary security mechanisms themselves.
              For example, an Enumservice could be defined for storage
              of confidential security services information such as
              alarm systems or message service passcodes, which in
              turn require an external confidentiality service.
              </t>

            </list>

          </t>

        </section>

        <section anchor='PubReq' title='Publication Requirements'>

          <t>Enumservices Specifications MUST be published according to
          the requirements for 'Specification Required' set
          in <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines
          for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.
          RFCs fulfill these
          requirements. Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
          Enumservice Specifications be published as RFCs.

          <t>In case the Enumservice Specification is not published as
          an RFC, sufficient information that allows to uniquely

    <section  anchor='cookbook' title='Enumservice Creation Cookbook'>

      <section title='General Enumservice Considerations'>

        <t>ENUM is an extremely flexible identifier mapping mechanism,
        using E.164 (phone) numbers as input identifiers, and returning 
        URIs as output identifiers. Because of this flexibility, almost 
        every use case for ENUM could be implemented in several ways.
        </t>

        <t>Section 2 of <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA 
        Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref> provides motivation why 
        management of a name space might be necessary. Even though the 
        namespace for Enumservices is rather large (up to 32 alphanumeric 
        characters), there are reasons to manage this in accordance with 
        Section 2 of <xref target='RFC5226'/>.  The following is a list of 
        motivations applying to Enumservices:

        <vspace blankLines='1'/>
        <list style='symbols'>

          <t>Prevent hoarding or wasting of values: Enumservice Types
          are not an opaque identifier to prevent collisions in the
          namespace, but rather identify the use of a certain
          technology in the context of ENUM.  Service Types might also
          be displayed to end users in implementations, so meaningful
          Type strings having a clear relation to the protocols and
          applications used are strongly RECOMMENDED.
          Therefore, preventing hoarding, wasting, or "hijacking" of
          Enumservice Type names is important.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Sanity check to ensure sensible or necessary requests:
          This applies to Enumservices, since especially various
          Enumservices for the same purpose would reduce the chance of
          successful interoperability, and unnecessarily increase the
          confusion among implementers.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Delegation of namespace portions: Theoretically, the Type
          and/or Subtype structure of Enumservices would allow for
          delegations of Type values, and self-supporting management
          of Subtype values by a delegate within the Type value. Such
          delegates could for example be other standardization
          bodies. However, this would require clear policies regarding
          publication and use of such Subtypes. Delegation of
          Enumservice namespace portions is therefore currently not
          supported.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Interoperability: Since the benefit of an Enumservice
          rises with the number of supporting clients, the
          registration and use of several services for a similar or
          identical purpose clearly reduces interoperability.
          Operational circumstances suggest to keep the space occupied
          by all services published in the NAPTR RRSet at any owner in
          the e164.arpa domain bounded. Registration of nearly
          identical services and subsequent competing or parallel use
          could easily increase the DNS operational complexity.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>Generally, before commencing work on a new Enumservice 
        registration, the following should be considered:

            at &lt;http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/enum/index.html&gt;,
            and search the Internet-Drafts Archive at
            &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/&gt;.  As some Internet-Drafts may have
            expired and no longer be available in the Internet-Drafts Archive,
            it may be useful to search the &lt;enum@ietf.org&gt; mailing list 
            archives and to perform a web search. Furthermore, bear in mind
            that some work on Enumservices may have been considered outside

            <t><xref target='classification'/> provides three general 
            categories for Enumservice classification. In some cases, there
            might be several options for designing an Enumservice. For 
            example, a mapping service using HTTP could be considered a 
            "protocol Type" Enumservice (using HTTP as the protocol), 
            while it could also be viewed as
            an "application Type" Enumservice, with the application being 
            access to mapping services. In such a case where several 
            options are 
            available, defining use cases before commencing work on 
            the Enumservice itself might be useful before making a 
            decision on which  
            aspect of the Enumservice is more important.

        <t>Because of its flexibility, Enumservices can be and are used
        in a lot of different ways. This section contains a classification
        of Enumservices, and provides guidance for choosing suitable 
        Type and Subtype strings for each individual Enumservice
        Class. 

        <!-- The choice of a suitable 'name' is independent of the 
        classification. -->

        <t>The Classification of each Enumservice MUST be listed in
        the Enumservice Specification (see
        <xref target='enumServiceReg'/>).  If the Enumservice cannot be
        assigned to one of the classes outlined below, the
        Enumservice Specification MUST contain a section on the
        difficulties encountered while trying to classify the service
        to help the experts in their decision.

          <t>Advice for choosing a proper 'name' string is independent of 
          the classification of the Enumservice.</t>
          <t>Generally, the 'name' string used for registering an Enumservice
          SHOULD give a clear indication of what the Enumservice is about.
          The 'name' has no technical significance in the processing of 
          the NAPTR (it doesn't even appear in resource record instances
          of the Enumservice). However, it
          is likely to be used for labeling the 
          Enumservice to end users.
          </t>
          <t>Suitable 'names' are concise, distinctive, and clearly related
          to the underlying service with which a client is going to interact.

-->
        <section anchor='generalcons' title='General Type / Subtype Considerations'>
          <t>To avoid confusion, the name of a URI Scheme MUST NOT be
          used as a Type name for an Enumservice which is not specifically
          about the respective protocol or URI Scheme. For example,
          the Type name 'imap' would be inadequate for use in an
          Enumservice about "Internet mapping" services, because it
          corresponds to an existing URI Scheme or protocol for
          something different.
          </t>

          <t>If Subtypes are defined, the minimum number SHOULD be
          two (including the empty subtype, if defined). 
          The choice of just one possible Subtype for a given Type
          does not add any information when selecting a ENUM record,
          and hence can be left out completely.
          However, potential future expansion of a Type towards several
          Subtypes may justify the use of Subtypes, even in the case
          just one is currently defined, as noted in 
          <xref target='ExtensionOfExisting'/>.
          </t>

          <t>It is perfectly legal under a certain Type to mix the
          Enumservice without a Subtype ("empty Subtype") with Enumservices 
          containing
          a Subtype. In that case, however, the Enumservice with an
          empty Subtype SHOULD be specified to reflect the base
          service, while the other Enumservices SHOULD
          be specified to reflect variants.

          <t>Such an Enumservice indicates that an interaction using the
          named protocol will result for use of this NAPTR. The expected
          behavior of a system using this Enumservice MUST be clear from
          the protocol.</t>

          <t>A good indication that an Enumservice belongs to this Class is 
          the fact that a client does not need to understand the actual

        <section anchor='applicationclass' title='Application-Based Enumservice Classes'>

          <t>Application-based Enumservices are used when the kind of
          service intended is not fully defined by a protocol specification.
          There are three cases here:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='symbols'>
            <t>Common Application Enumservice:
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            The application reflects a kind of interaction that can be realized
            by different protocols, but where the intent of the publisher is the
            same. From a user's perspective, there is a common kind of interaction -
            how that interaction is implemented is not important. The Enumservice
            Specification MUST describe the interaction and expected behavior in
            enough detail that an implementation can decide if this activity is one
            in which it can engage. However, it is RECOMMENDED that the Enumservice
            is defined in a way that will allow others to use it at a later date. An
            Enumservice that defines a generalized application is preferred to one
            that has narrow use.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            An example of this flavor of Enumservice is email. Whilst this might
            appear to be a "pure" protocol scheme, it is not. The URI Scheme is
            'mailto', and does not identify the protocol used by the sender or the
            recipient to offer or retrieve emails.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Another example is SMS, where the existence of such an Enumservice
            indicates that the publishing entity is capable of engaging in sending
            or receiving a message according to the Short Messaging Service
            specifications. The underlying protocol used and the URI Scheme for the
            addressable end point can differ, but the "user visible" interaction of
            sending and receiving an SMS is similar.
            </t>         

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>Subset Enumservice:
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            The application interaction reflects a subset of the interactions
            possible by use of a protocol. Use of this Enumservice indicates that
            some options available by use of the protocol will not be accepted or
            are not possible in this case. Any such Enumservice Specification MUST
            define the options available by use of this NAPTR in enough detail that
            an implementation can decide whether or not it can use this Enumservice.

            Examples of this kind of Enumservice are voice:tel and fax:tel. In both
            cases the URI holds a telephone number. However, the essential feature
            of these Enumservices is that the telephone number is capable of
            receiving a voice call or of receiving a Facsimile transmission,
            respectively. These form subsets of the interactions capable of using
            the telephone number, and so have their own Enumservices. These allow an
            end point to decide if it has the appropriate capability of engaging in
            the advertised user service (a voice call or sending a fax) rather than
            just being capable of making a connection to such a destination address.
            This is especially important where there is no underlying mechanism
            within the protocol to negotiate a different kind of user interaction.
            </t>

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>Ancillary Application Enumservice
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Another variant on this is the Ancillary Application. This is one in
            which further processing (potentially using a number of different
            protocols or methods) is the intended result of using this Enumservice.
            An example of this kind of application is the PSTN:tel Enumservice. This
            indicates that the NAPTR holds Number Portability data. It implies that
            the client should engage in number portability processing using the
            associated URI.

            Note that this Enumservice usually does not itself define the kind of
            interaction available using the associated URI. That application is
            negotiated with some other "out of band" means (either through prior
            negotiation, or explicitly through the number portability process, or
            through negotiation following the selection of the final destination
            address).

        <t>Generally, the Type name of an Enumservice is REQUIRED to
        give a clear indication of what the Enumservice is about.
        Usually, an Enumservice falls under one of the following
        categories:

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <list style='symbols'>

            <t>"Protocol" Enumservices are exclusively tied to a
            specific protocol. Such Enumservices typically use that
            single protocol and its respective <xref
            target='RFC3986'>Uniform Resource
            Identifier (URI)</xref> Scheme (sometimes
            including a secure variant), and SHOULD use the protocol
            name / URI Scheme name as the Type. In case the secure
            variant has a different URI Scheme / protocol name, the
            URI Scheme name of the base protocol SHOULD be preferred.
            Examples of such Enumservices include <xref
            target='RFC3764'> 'SIP'</xref>, <xref
            target='RFC3762'>'H323'</xref> and

            <vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

            <t>"Application" Enumservices usually use the abstract
            application name as the Enumservice Type. The name of
            the actual protocol and URI Scheme may differ from the
            Type, but may also be identical (especially when <xref
            target='RFC3958'>application service location</xref> is
            used). If application name and URI Scheme name are
            identical, it is RECOMMENDED to use that name also as the
            Enumservice Type. In case the actual protocol / URI
            Scheme differs from the application name, it is
            RECOMMENDED to use that application name as Enumservice
            Type. Examples of such Enumservices are <xref

        use case will both accelerate the Expert Review Process, as well as
        make any eventual registration easier to understand and implement
        by other parties.</t>

<!-- redundant, now that text from "review guidelines" is moved to above

        <t>This document describes all of the necessary sections
        required and recommended, and makes suggestions on content.

      </section>

      <section title='Step 2: Write and Submit Registration Document'>

        <t>An Internet-Draft (or another specification as
        appropriate) MUST be written and made publicly available
        (submitted).  The Registration Document MUST follow the
        guidelines according to <xref target='cookbook'/> and
        <xref target='requiredSections'/> of this document.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title='Step 3: Request Comments from the IETF Community'>

        <t>The authors MUST send an email to &lt;enum@ietf.org&gt;,
        in which comments on the Registration Document are requested. A 
        proper public reference (a URL is RECOMMENDED) 
        to the Registration Document MUST be included in this email.
        </t>  

        <t>The authors SHOULD allow a reasonable period of time to
        elapse, such as two to four weeks, in order to collect any
        feedback.  The authors then consider whether or not to
        take any of those comments into account, by making changes to
        the Registration Document and submitting a revision, or otherwise
        proceeding.  The following outcomes are open to the authors. 
        The choice of path is left to the authors' judgement.  
        </t>

        <t>Note: Whatever that outcome is, the Experts are not bound to
        any decision during this phase.</t>


        <section title='Outcome 1: No Changes Needed'>

          <t>No changes to the Registration Document are made, and the
          authors proceed to Step 4 below.</t>

          <t>This outcome is recommended when the feedback received
          does not lead to a new revision of the Registration Document.

        </section>

        <section title='Outcome 2: Changes, but no further Comments Requested'>

          <t>The authors update the Registration Document and is/are
          confident that all issues are resolved and do not require
          further discussion. The authors proceed to Step 4
          below.

          <t>This outcome is recommended when minor objections have
          been raised, or minor changes have been suggested.

        </section>

        <section title='Outcome 3: Changes and further Comments Requested'>

          <t>The authors update and submit the Registration Document, and
          proceed to Step 3 above, which involves sending another
          email to &lt;enum@ietf.org&gt; to request additional
          comments for the updated version.
          </t>

          <t>This outcome is recommended when substantial objections
          have been raised, or substantial changes have been
          suggested.

      </section>

      <section title='Step 4: Submit Registration Document'>

        <t>If the Registration Document is to be published as RFC, the
        normal IETF publication process applies (see
        <xref target='instructions2authors'/>), i.e. the Registration
        Document is submitted to the RFC Editor in the form of an
        Internet Draft. For Independent Submission the guidelines
        in <xref target='RFC4846'>Independent Submissions to the RFC
        Editor</xref> apply.

        <t>For publications as RFC Steps 6 below does not apply.
        </t>

        <t>If the Registration Document is not published as RFC, 
        the authors submit the Registration Document to IANA for
        Expert Review via the http://iana.org/ website.

      one. Such cases include adding a new Subtype to an existing
      Type. Depending on the nature of the extension, the original
      Enumservice Specification needs to be extended (Updates) or replaced
      (Obsoletes) <xref target='RFC2223'></xref>.
      Specifically, an update is appropriate when a new subtype is
      being added without changes to the existing repertoire. A

      or changes to the assumptions of URI support in clients.

    <section title='Security Considerations'>

      <section title='Considerations Regarding This Document'>

        <t>Since this document does not introduce any new technology, protocol, 
        or Enumservice Specification, there are no specific security issues to 
        be considered for this document.  However, as this is a guide to authors

        considered closely by authors and experts.

      </section>

      <section anchor='secguide' title='Enumservice Security Considerations Guideline'>

        <t><xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/> already outlines
        security considerations affecting ENUM as a whole.
        Enumservice Specifications do not need to and SHOULD NOT
        repeat considerations already listed in that document.
        However, Enumservice Specifications SHOULD include a reference
        to that section.
        </t>

        <t>
        ENUM refers to resources using existing URI Schemes and protocols.
        Enumservice Specifications do not need to and SHOULD NOT repeat
        security considerations affecting those protocols and URI Schemes
        themselves.
        </t>

        <t>However, in some cases, the inclusion of those protocols and URI
        Schemes into ENUM specifically could introduce new security issues.  In 
        these cases, those issues or risks MUST be covered in the 'Security 
        Considerations' section of the Enumservice Specification.
        Authors should pay particular attention to any indirect risks that are 
        associated with a proposed Enumservice, including cases where the 
        proposed Enumservice could lead to the discovery or disclosure of 
        Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

          <t>IANA maintains the Enumservice Registry sorted in
          alphabetical order. The first sort field is Type, the
          second is Subtype.</t>

          <t>Each Enumservice starts with a caption, which is composed
          of Type and Subtype, separated by a colon; e.g. if the Type
          is "foo" and the Subtype "bar", the resulting caption is

        </section>


        <section anchor='RegistrationProcedure' title='Registration Procedure'>

          <t>There is a difference in process depending on whether or
          not the Enumservice Specification will be published as RFC.
          In case of RFC, the normal IETF procures (according to
          <xref target='RFC5226' />) apply. In case of a specification
          other than RFC, there is a slight difference to
          <xref target='RFC5226' /> (see below). The reason for this
          lies in the complexity of Enumservice Specifications.
          Registration Documents will most likely undergo changes
          during Expert Review, so that in most cases it will not be
          published by the time the Expert Review is carried out.</t>

          <section anchor='RegistrationProcedureRFC' title='Published as RFC'>
            
            <t>As soon as IANA receives the Registration Document from
            the RFC Editor, IANA will take care of the 'Expert Review
            Process' according to <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines
            for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in
            RFCs"</xref>.</t>

            <t>After successful Expert Review IANA will register the
            Enumservice, i.e.  add the Enumservice to the IANA
            "Enumservice Registrations" Registry (see
            also <xref target='Location'></xref>).
            </t>
            
            <t>The RFC Editor will now take care of the publication of
            the RFC.</t>

          </section>

          <section anchor='RegistrationNonRFC' title='Published as generic Specification'>

            <t>Whenever a Registration Document is submitted via the
            IANA website, IANA will take care of the 'Expert Review
            Process' according to <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines
            for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in
            RFCs"</xref>.</t>

            <t>Once the experts have approved the Enumservice, IANA
            will inform the authors. This information SHOULD also
            include a reminder, that the authors are now responsible
            for publication of the Registration Document (see
            also <xref target='Step6'></xref>) and that the
            Enumservice will be added to the IANA Registry only after
            its Enumservice Specification is published according to
            'Specification Required' as defined
            in <xref target='RFC5226'></xref> (see
            also <xref target='Step7'></xref>). The Registration
            process will now be on hold until the authors the authors
            inform IANA about the publication of the Enumservice
            Specification (see also <xref target='Step7'></xref>).
            </t>

            <t>Once the authors have informed IANA about the
            publication, IANA MUST ensure that the requirements to
            "Specification Required" as defined in
            <xref target='RFC5226' /> are met, the reference to the
            specification is unambiguous, and the content of the
            Enumservice Specification is identical to the Registration
            Document as approved by the Experts. IANA will then
            register the Enumservice, i.e.  add the Enumservice to the
            IANA "Enumservice Registrations" Registry (see
            also <xref target='Location'></xref>).

        <section anchor='ChangeControl' title='Change Control'>
         
          <t>Change control of any Enumservice Registrations is done
          by "Expert Review" and "Specification Required" according to
          <xref target='RFC5226'/>. Updates of Enumservice
          Specifications MUST comply with the guidelines described in
          this document. Updates are handled the same way as
          initial Enumservice Registrations.
          </t>

          <t>Authorized Change Controllers are the experts and the
          IESG.</t>
          
          <t>Enumservice registrations MUST NOT be deleted. An
          Enumservice that is believed no longer appropriate for use,
          can be declared obsolete by publication of a new
          Enumservice Specification changing its "Intended
          Usage" field to "OBSOLETE"; such Enumservices will be
          clearly marked in the lists published by IANA.
          As obsoletions are updates, they are also handled the same
          way as initial Enumservice Registrations.

          </t>

        </section>


        <section anchor='Restrictions' title='Restrictions'>

          <t>As stated in <xref target='NamingReq'/>, a "-" (dash)
          MUST NOT be used as the first nor as the second character of
          a Type nor a Subtype. Furthermore, any identifying tag of
          any Enumservice MUST NOT be set to nor start with "E2U".
          Any Enumservice
          registration requests covered by these restrictions MUST be
          rejected by IANA, and the 'Expert Review Process' SHOULD NOT
          be initiated.
          </t>

          <t><xref target='enumServiceReg'/> contains examples for
          Enumservice registrations. Therefore, IANA MUST NOT register
          an Enumservice with Type or Subtype set to "foo", "bar", or
          "sbar", unless the experts explicitly confirm an exception.

          <t>alex: Some minor changes - the only real open issue is 
             whether or not we should go to an XML template instead of the 
             plain text one. IANA provided a "chunk", but gave no feedback
             about schema, namespace, etc. so it is deemed not "normative"

          <t>jason: Per the co-chair and Peter Koch, doc changed to BCP.
             Doc doesn't specify a protocol but a process. Both RFC 2026, 
             section 5, and section 4.3 of RFC 5226 suggest that process documents,
             and IANA Guidelines in particular, usually are published as BCP RFCs.
             Also, there's little to implement independently in this draft that 
             could help advance it on the Standards Track.
