Abstract

   This draft specifies OAM messages to indicate service disruptive
   conditions for MPLS based Transport Network Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs).  The notification mechanism employs a generic method for a
   service disruptive condition to be communicated to a Maintenance End
   Point (MEP).  An MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) channel is defined along with messages to communicate various
   types of service disruptive conditions.

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM            August 2011


1.  Introduction

   In traditional transport networks, circuits such as T1 lines are
   typically provisioned on multiple switches.  When an event that
   causes disruption occurs on any link or node along the path of such a
   transport circuit, OAM indications are generated which may in turn
   suppress alarms and/or activate a backup circuit.  The MPLS based
   Transport Network provides mechanisms equivalent to traditional
   transport circuits.  Therefore a Fault Management (FM) capability
   must be defined for MPLS.  This capability is being defined to meet
   the MPLS-TP requirements as defined in RFC 5654 [1], and the MPLS-TP
   Operations, Administration and Maintenance Requirements as defined in
   RFC 5860 [2].  These mechanisms are intended to be applicable to
   other aspects of MPLS as well.  However, applicability to other types
   of LSPs is beyond the scope of this document.

   Two broad classes of service disruptive conditions are identified.

   1.  Fault: the situation in which the density of anomalies has
       reached a level where the ability to perform a required function
       has been interrupted.

   2.  Lock: an administrative status in which it is expected that only
       test traffic, if any, and OAM (dedicated to the LSP) can be sent
       on an LSP.

   Within the Fault class, a further category, Defect is identified.  A
   defect is the inability of a function to perform a required action.
   A defect is a persistent fault.

   This document specifies an MPLS OAM channel called an "MPLS-OAM Fault
   Management (FM)" channel.  A single message format and a set of
   procedures are defined to communicate service disruptive conditions
   from the location where they occur to the endpoints of LSPs which are
   affected by those conditions.  Multiple message types and flags are
   used to indicate and qualify the particular condition.

   Corresponding to the two classes of service disruptive conditions
   listed above, two messages are defined to communicate the type of
   condition.  These are known as:

      Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)

      Lock Report (LKR)

2.  MPLS Fault Management Messages

   This document defines messages to indicate service disruptive
   conditions.  Two messages are defined, Alarm Indication Signal, and
   Lock Report.  The semantics of the individual messages are described
   in subsections below.  Fault OAM messages are applicable to LSPs used
   in the MPLS Transport Profile.  Such LSPs are bound to specific

   server layers based upon static configuration or signaling in a
   client/server relationship.

   Fault Management messages are carried in-band of the client LSP or
   MS-PW by using the Associated Channel Header (ACH).  For LSPs other
   than PWs, the ACH is identified by the Generic Associated Channel
   Label (GAL) as defined in RFC5586 [4].  To facilitate recognition and
   delivery of Fault Management messages, the Fault Management Channel
   is identified by a unique ACH codepoint.

   Fault OAM messages are generated by server MEPs at intermediate nodes
   where a client LSP is switched.  When a server (sub-)layer, (e.g. a
   link or bidirectional LSP) used by the client LSP fails, the
   intermediate node sends Fault Management messages downstream towards
   the endpoint of the LSP.  Strictly speaking, when a server MEP
   detects a service disruptive condition, Fault Management messages are
   generated by the convergence server-to-client adaptation function.
   The messages are sent to the client MEPs by inserting them into the
   affected client LSPs in the direction downstream of the fault
   location.  These messages are sent periodically until the condition
   is cleared.

2.1.  MPLS Alarm Indication Signal

   The MPLS Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) message is generated in
   response to detecting faults in the server (sub-)layer.  The AIS
   message SHOULD be sent as soon as the condition is detected.  For
   example, an AIS message may be sent during a protection switching
   event and would cease being sent (or cease being forwarded by the
   protection switch selector) if the protection switch was successful
   in restoring the link.

   The primary purpose of the AIS message is to suppress alarms in the
   layer network above the level at which the fault occurs.  When the
   Link Down Indication is set, the AIS message MAY be used to trigger
   recovery mechanisms.

2.1.1.  MPLS Link Down Indication

   The Link Down Indication (LDI) is communicated by setting the L-flag
   to 1.  The L-flag is set in the AIS message in response to detecting
   a defect in the server layer.  The L-flag MUST NOT be set until the
   fault has been determined to be a defect.  The L-flag MUST be set if
   the fault has been determined to be a defect.  For example during a
   protection switching event the L-flag is not set.  However if the
   protection switch was unsuccessful in restoring the link within the
   expected repair time, the L-flag MUST be set.

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM            August 2011


   The setting of the L-flag can be predetermined based on the
   protection state.  For example, if a server layer is protected and
   both the working and protection paths are available, both the active
   and standby server MEPs should be programmed to send AIS with the
   L-flag clear upon detecting a fault condition.  If the server layer
   is unprotected or the server layer is protected but only the active
   path is available, the active server MEP should be programmed to send
   AIS with the L-flag set upon detecting a LOC condition.  Note again
   that the L-flag is not until a defect has been declared.  Thus if
   there is any hold-off timer associated with the LOC, then the L-flag
   is not set until that timer has expired.

   The receipt of an AIS message with the L-flag set MAY be treated as
   the equivalent of loss of continuity (LOC) at the client layer.  The
   choice of treatment is related to the rate at which the Continuity
   Check (CC) function is running.  In a normal transport environment,
   CC is run at a high rate in order to detect a failure within 10s of
   milliseconds.  In such an environment, the L-flag MAY be ignored and
   the AIS message is used solely for alarm suppression.

   In more general MPLS environments the CC function may be running at a
   much slower rate.  In this environment, the Link Down Indication
   enables faster switch-over upon a failure occurring along the client
   LSP.

2.2.  MPLS Lock Report

   The MPLS Lock Report (LKR) message is generated when a server
   (sub-)layer entity has been administratively locked.  Its purpose is
   to communicate the locked condition to the client layer entities.
   When a server layer is administratively locked it is not available to
   carry client traffic.  The purpose of the LKR message is to suppress
   alarms in the layer network above the level at which the
   administrative lock occurs and to allow the clients to differentiate
   the lock condition from a fault condition.  While the primary purpose
   of the LKR message is to suppress alarms, similar to AIS with the LDI
   (L-flag set), the receipt of an LKR message MAY be treated as the
   equivalent of loss of continuity at the client layer.

2.3.  Propagation of MPLS Fault Messages

   If the CC function is disabled, a MEP SHOULD generate AIS messages
   toward any client when either the AIS or LKR indication is raised.
   Note that the L-flag is not automatically propagated.  The rules of
   Section 2.1.1 apply.  In particular, the L-flag is not set until a
   defect has been declared.

3.  MPLS Fault Management Channel

   The MPLS Fault Management channel is identified by the ACH as defined
   in RFC 5586 [4] with the Channel Type set to the MPLS Fault
   Management (FM) code point = 0xHH.  [HH to be assigned by IANA from
   the PW Associated Channel Type registry.  Note: An early codepoint
   allocation has made: 0x0058 Fault OAM (TEMPORARY - expires
   2012-07-20)] The FM Channel does not use ACH TLVs and MUST NOT
   include the ACH TLV header.  The FM ACH Channel is shown below.

5.  Sending and Receiving Fault Management Messages

5.1.  Sending a Fault Management Message

   Service disruptive conditions are indicated by sending FM messages.
   The message type is set to the value corresponding to the condition.
   The refresh timer is set to the maximum time between successive FM
   messages.  This value MUST NOT be changed on successive FM messages
   reporting the same incident.  If the optional clearing procedures are
   not used, then the default value is 1 second.  Otherwise the default
   value is 20 seconds.

   A Global_ID MAY be included.  If the R-flag clearing procedures are
   to be used, the IF_ID TLV MUST be included.  Otherwise, the IF_ID TLV
   MAY be included.

   The message is then sent.  Assuming the condition persists, the

   message MUST be retransmitted two more times at an interval of one
   second.  Further retransmissions are made according to the value of
   the refresh timer.  Retransmissions continue until the condition is
   cleared.

5.2.  Clearing a FM Indication

   Ceasing to send FM messages will clear the indication after 3.5 times
   the refresh timer.  To clear an indication more quickly, the
   following procedure is used.  The R-flag of the FM message is set to
   one.  Other fields of the FM message SHOULD NOT be modified.  The
   message is sent immediately and then retransmitted two more times at
   an interval of one second.

5.3.  Receiving a FM Indication

   When a FM message is received, a MEP examines it to ensure that it is
   well formed.  If the message type is reserved or unknown, the message
   is ignored.

   If the R-flag is set to zero, the MEP checks to see if a condition
   matching the message type and IF_ID exists.  If it does not, the
   condition to the message type is entered.  An expiration-timer is set
   to 3.5 times the refresh timer.  If the message type and IF_ID match
   an existing condition, message is considered a refresh and the
   expiration-timer is reset.

   If the R-flag is set to one, the MEP checks to see if a condition
   matching the message type and IF_ID exists.  If it does, that
   condition is cleared.  Otherwise the message is ignored.

   If the expiration-time expires, the condition is cleared.


6.  Minimum Implementation Requirements

   At a minimum an implementation MUST support the following:

   1.  Sending AIS and LKR messages at a rate of 1 per second.

   2.  Support of setting the L-flag to indicated a defect.

   3.  Receiving AIS and LKR messages with any allowed Refresh Timer
       value.

   The following items are optional to implement.

   1.  Sending AIS and LKR message with other values of the Refresh
       Timer other than 1 second.

   2.  Support of receiving the L-flag.

   3.  Support of setting the R-flag to a value other than zero.

   4.  Support of receiving the R-flag.

   5.  All TLVs.


7.  Security Considerations

   MPLS-TP is a subset of MPLS and so builds upon many of the aspects of
   the security model of MPLS.  MPLS networks make the assumption that
   it is very hard to inject traffic into a network, and equally hard to
   cause traffic to be directed outside the network.  The control plane
   protocols utilize hop-by-hop security, and assume a "chain-of-trust"
   model such that end-to-end control plane security is not used.  For
   more information on the generic aspects of MPLS security, see RFC
   5920 [6].

   This document describes a protocol carried in the G-ACh RFC 5586 [4],
   and so is dependent on the security of the G-ACh, itself.  The G-ACh
   is a generalization of the Associated Channel defined in RFC 4385
   [7].  Thus, this document relies heavily on the security mechanisms
   provided for the Associated Channel and described in those two
   documents.

   A specific concern for the G-ACh is that is can be used to provide a
   covert channel.  This problem is wider than the scope of this
   document and does not need to be addressed here, but it should be
   noted that the channel provides end-to-end connectivity and SHOULD
   NOT be policed by transit nodes.  Thus, there is no simple way of
   preventing any traffic being carried between in the G-ACh consenting
   nodes.

   A good discussion of the data plane security of an associated channel
   may be found in RFC 5085 [9].  That document also describes some
   mitigation techniques.

   It should be noted that the G-ACh is essentially connection-oriented
   so injection or modification of control messages specified in this
   document require the subversion of a transit node.  Such subversion
   is generally considered hard in MPLS networks, and impossible to
   protect against at the protocol level.  Management level techniques
   are more appropriate.

   Spurious fault OAM messages form a vector for a denial of service
   attack.  However, since these messages are carried in a control
   channel, except of one case discussed below, one would have to gain
   access to a node providing the service in order to effect such an
   attack.  Since transport networks are usually operated as a walled
   garden, such threats are less likely.

   If external MPLS traffic is mapped to an LSP via a PHP forwarding
   operation, it is possible to insert a GAL label followed by a fault
   OAM message.  In such a situation an operator SHOULD filter any fault
   OAM messages with the GAL label at the top of the label stack.


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Pseudowire Associated Channel Type

   Fault OAM requires a unique Associated Channel Type which are
   assigned by IANA from the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types
   Registry.

   Registry:
   Value        Description              TLV Follows  Reference
   -----------  -----------------------  -----------  ---------
   0xHHHH       Fault OAM                No           (This Document)

8.2.  MPLS Fault OAM Message Type Registry

   This sections details the MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry, a new name
   spaces to be managed by IANA.  The Type space is divided into
   assignment ranges; the following terms are used in describing the
   procedures by which IANA allocates values: "Standards Action" (as
   defined in RFC 5226 [8]) and "Private Use".

   MPLS Fault OAM Message Types take values in the range 0-255.
   Assignments in the range 0-251 are via Standards Action; values in
   the range 251-255 are for Private Use, and MUST NOT be allocated.

   Message Types defined in this document are:

      Msg Type           Description
      --------           -----------------------------
        0x0              Reserved
        0x1              Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)
        0x2              Lock Report (LKR)

8.3.  MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry

   This sections details the MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry, a new name
   spaces to be managed by IANA.  The Type space is divided into
   assignment ranges; the following terms are used in describing the
   procedures by which IANA allocates values: "Standards Action" (as
   defined in RFC 5226 [8]), "Specification Required" and "Private Use".

   MPLS Fault OAM TLVs which take values in the range 0-255.
   Assignments in the range 0-191 are via Standards Action; assignments
   in the range 192-248 are made via "Specification Required"; values in
   the range 248-255 are for Private Use, and MUST NOT be allocated.

   TLVs defined in this document are:

      Value    TLV Name
      -----    -------
          0    Reserved
          1    Interface Identifier TLV
          2    Global Identifier
