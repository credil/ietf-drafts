Abstract

   MPEG2-TS is a container format that describes the schema of the
   audio, video content and the in-band control information.  The format
   information called MPEG2-TS preamble must be acquired before a RTP
   receiver processed any data received in MPEG2-TS.  In this document,
   a Retransmission Server is specified to deliver MPEG2-TS preamble
   prior to unicast RTP packets.  The Retransmission Server caches raw
   RTP packets with MPEG2-TS preamble information, and sends them to the
   RTP receiver which initiates rapid acquisition of MPEG2-TS multicast
   sessions.

Internet-Draft            Preamble Acquisition              October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Multimedia multicast flows usually carry streams of inter-related
   data.  Certain information must first be acquired by the receivers to
   start processing multimedia data sent in the multicast session.
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] refers to this information
   as Reference Information.  The Reference Information is
   conventionally sent periodically in the multicast session and usually
   consists of items such as a description of the schema for the rest of
   the data, references to which data to process, encryption information
   including keys, as well as any other information required to process
   the data in the primary multicast stream.

   When a multicast flow is used for carrying MPEG2 Transport Stream
   (MPEG2-TS),the Reference Information is usually called MPEG2-TS
   preamble.  MPEG2-TS [ISO13818-1] is an encapsulation and transport
   method that multiplexes video and audio content, together with
   ancillary metadata, and produces a synchronized multiplexed stream.
   A receiver must first acquire the metadata before demultiplexing and
   decoding an incoming MPEG2-TS.  However, MPEG2-TS preamble does often
   not reside in MPEG2-TS contiguously and is usually dispersed over a
   large period.  Thus, the receiver starting to receive an MPEG2-TS at
   a random location will have to wait until the whole required
   information shows up in the received data.
   [I-D.begen-avt-rtp-mpeg2ts-preamble] details the problem, and defines
   new messages to carry MPEG-TS preamble.

   Comparing to [I-D.begen-avt-rtp-mpeg2ts-preamble], an alternative is
   proposed here for carrying MPEG-TS preamble without defining any new
   messages in this document.  A retransmission server identifies MPEG-
   TSes carrying preamble information, buffers these TSes, and sends
   them out when a receiver join the multicast MPEG2-TS session.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview of MPEG-2 Transport Streams

   MPEG-2 Transport Stream is a communications protocol for audio,
   video, and data.  It is a type of container format that encapsulates
   Packetized Elementary Streams(PES) and other data.  A transport
   stream as illustrated in Figure 1 is specified in MPEG-2 Part 1,
   Systems [ISO13818-1].  It is also known as ITU-T Rec. H.222.0.  Its

   design goal is to allow multiplexing of video and audio and to
   synchronize the output.

                    Figure 1: MPEG-2 Transport Streams

   As illustrated in Figure 1, Program Specific Information (PSI)
   consists of metadata carried in the transport stream.  PSI includes
   Program Association Table (PAT), Conditional Access Table (CAT),
   Program Map Table (PMT) and other information.  A PAT has information
   about all the programs carried in the transport stream.  It lists the
   13-bit Program IDs (PID) for all the PMTs, associating them with the
   individual programs.  In this document, terminologies PSI and
   MPEG2-TS preamble are interchangeable.

   Media including video, audio and text in an MPEG2-TS is self
   describing, and the receiver must parse certain control information
   in the PAT, CAT and PMT tables (i.e., PSI) contained in the transport
   stream in order to know how to parse the rest of the stream (i.e., to
   find the audio and video elementary streams, private data and the
   encryption information for a given program).  This document specifies
   a mechanism to acquire PSI rapidly when a receiver joins in a
   MPEG2-TS multicast session.


4.  Preamble Acquisition of MPEG2-TS Multicast Sessions

   Conventional MPEG2 video encoders encode the video content in Groups
   of Pictures (GoP).  Each GoP is encoded independently from other GoPs
   and starts with an intra-coded frame (I-frame) that does not have any
   reference to other frames in the same GoP, i.e., an I-frame contains

Internet-Draft            Preamble Acquisition              October 2009


   the representation of an entire picture and can be decoded
   independently.  Thus, the start of an I-frame is said to be a Random
   Access Point (RAP).

   On the other hand, due to the temporal compression, rest of the
   frames in the same GoP may have references to the I-frame or to other
   frames in the same GoP.  Due to this interdependency among the
   frames, one generally has to receive certain elements of the GoP
   prior to decoding any part of the GoP.  For example, the decoder can
   decode a frame that is dependent on two other frames only after these
   two frames are decoded.

   When a receiver joins the multicast session, it needs to wait until
   the next RAP shows up in the multicast stream before it can start
   decoding. to reduce the acquisition time when the RTP receiver joins
   a multicast session at a random point in time,
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] introduces the concept of
   the Burst Source and new RTCP feedback messages as illustrated in
   Figure 2.  The Burst Source has a cache where the most recent packets
   from the primary multicast session are continuously stored.  The
   feedback target is the entity to process RTP receiver's request for
   rapidly acquiring the primary multicast stream.

   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] details the procedure of
   rapid acquisition, at the same time, unicast PSI RTP transport is
   highlighted in this document.
   o  The retransmission server contiguously parses the primary
      multicast stream, and search for a MPEG2-TS with 0 Program Map ID
      (PID). the Transport stream with PID 0 is Program Association
      Table(PAT) which further lists all programs available in the
      transport stream.  Each of the programs listed in PAT has an
      associated value of PID for its Program Map Table (PMT).  The
      retransmission server stores the TS with PAT information.
   o  The retransmission server then further search for TSes with PMT
      information through the PIDs indicated in the PAT.  The
      retransmission server also stores these identified TSes.
   o  The retransmission server caches TS with PID 1 which includes
      Conditional Access Table(CAT).

   Some other preamble information included in different TSes is also
   identified and stored in the retransmission server.  These cached
   TSes will be packed into unicast PSI RTP packets for preamble
   acquisition, as is illustrated in the following sections.

4.1.  Message Flow

   Figure 3 depicts message flows for PSI acquisition.  A RTP receiver
   sends a rapid acquisition request for a new multicast RTP session to
   the feedback target address of that session.  This RTCP feedback
   message is defined as the RAMS-Request (RAMS-R) message in
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] and MAY also contain
   parameters, such as the bandwidth limit, buffering capacity available
   at the RTP receiver, and so on.

   A retransmission server receives the RAMS-R message and sends an
   RAMS-Information (RAMS-I) message to the RTP receiver.  The first
   RAMS-I message MAY precede the unicast burst or it MAY be sent during
   the burst.  The retransmission server then starts sending unicast PSI
   RTP packets prior to delivering Unicast RTP Burst.

   In this document, a "unicast PSI RTP" delivering process is added
   here for transporting necessary MPEG2-TS preamble information.
   Section 4.2 details the format of the unicast PSI RTP Packets.  Other
   details can be referred to in
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The RTP header is formatted according to [RFC3550] with some further
   clarifications listed below:
   o  Marker (M) Bit: This bit SHALL be used to indicate the last packet
      of unicast RTP burst.  It SHALL be set to zero for PSI RTP packets
      if any unicast RTP packet followed, otherwise it SHOULD be set 0.
   o  Payload Type: The same payload type as unicast RTP Burst packets
      is used in all unicast PSI RTP packets.
   o  Sequence Number (SN): The sequence number has the standard
      definition.  It MUST be one higher than the sequence number in the
      previously transmitted RTP packet in the same session.
   o  Timestamp (TS): The timestamp SHALL be set to a time corresponding
      to the packet's transmission time.
   o  Synchronization Source (SSRC): the SSRC values MUST be the same as
      unicast RTP burst packets.

   OSN (original sequence number) field is used for the sequence number
   of the associated original RTP packet in [RFC4588].  In this
   document, PSI RTP packets are newly generated by the retransmission
   server, and are treated by the receiver as the same session as
   unicast RTP burst.  The OSNs of PSI RTP packets are thus determined
   by the OSN of the first unicast RTP burst packets.  For example,
   there are two unicast PSI RTP packets while the OSN of the first
   unicast RTP burst packets is n, the OSN fields of the two PSI RTP
   packets MUST be n-2, n-1 respectively.

   "Original RTP Packet Payload" field is used to carry stored TSes with
   MPEG2-TS preamble information.


5.  Security Considerations

   Comparing to [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp], this document
   specifies delivering PSI information to a RTP receiver prior to
   unicast RTP burst packets.  PSI is key information for a decoder to
