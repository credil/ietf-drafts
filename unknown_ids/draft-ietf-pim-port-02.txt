Abstract

   This draft describes how a reliable transport mechanism can be used
   by the PIM protocol to optimize CPU and bandwidth resource
   utilization by eliminating periodic Join/Prune message transmission.
   This draft proposes a modular extension to PIM to use either the TCP
   or SCTP transport protocol.

Internet-Draft   A Reliable Transport Mechanism for PIM     October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The goals of this specification are:

   o  To create a simple incremental mechanism to provide reliable PIM
      message delivery in PIM version 2.

   o  The reliable transport mechanism will be used for Join-Prune
      message transmission only.

   o  Can be used for link-local transmission of Join-Prune messages or
      multi-hop for use in a multicast VPN environments.

   o  When a router supports this specification, it need not use the
      reliable transport mechanism with every neighbor.  That is,
      negotiation on a per neighbor basis will occur.

   The explicit non-goals of this specification are:

   o  Changes to the PIM protocol machinery as defined in [RFC4601].
      The reliable transport mechanism will be used as a plugin layer so
      the PIM component does not know it is really there.

   o  Provide support for automatic switching between Datagram mode and
      Transport mode.  Two routers that are PIM neighbors on a link will
      always use Transport mode if and only if both have Transport mode
      enabled.

   This document will specify how periodic JP message transmission can
   be eliminated by using TCP [RFC0761] or SCTP [RFC4960] as the
   reliable transport mechanism for JP messages.

   This specification enables greater scalability in multicast
   deployment since the processing required for protocol state
   maintenance can be reduced.  In addition to reduced processing on PIM
   enabled routers, another important feature is the reduced join and
   leave latency provided through a reliable transport.

   In many existing and emerging networks, particularly wireless and
   mobile satellite systems, link degradation due to weather,
   interference, and other impairments can result in temporary spikes in
   the packet loss.  In these environments, periodic PIM joining can
   cause join latency when messages are lost causing a retransmission
   only 60 seconds later.  By applying a reliable transport, a lost join
   is retransmitted rapidly.  Furthermore, when the last user leaves a
   multicast group, any lost prune is similarly repaired and the
   multicast stream is quickly removed from the wireless/satellite link.
   Without a reliable transport, the multicast transmission could

   otherwise continue until it timed out, roughly 3 minutes later.  As
   network resources are at a premium in many of these environments,
   rapid termination of the multicast stream is critical to maintaining
   efficient use of bandwidth.

2.  Protocol Overview

   PIM Over Reliable Transport (PORT) is a simple extension to PIMv2 for
   refresh reduction of PIM JP messages.  It involves sending
   incremental rather than periodic JPs over a TCP/SCTP connection
   between PIM neighbors.

   This document does not restrict PORT to any specific link types.  It
   is however not recommended to use PORT on e.g. multi-access LANs with
   many PIM neighbors.  This due to the fact that there may be a full
   mesh of PORT connections, and that there is no join suppression.

   PORT can be incrementally used on a link between PORT capable
   neighbors.  Routers which are not PORT capable can continue to use
   PIM in Datagram Mode.  PORT capability is detected using new PORT
   Capable PIM Hello Options.

   Once PORT is enabled on an interface and a PIM neighbor also
   announces that it is PORT enabled, only Reliable JP messages will be
   used.  That is, only Reliable JP messages are accepted from, and sent
   to, that particular neighbor.  Native JP messages may still be used
   for other neighbors.

   Reliable JP messages are sent using a TCP/SCTP connection.  When two
   PIM neighbors are PORT enabled, both for TCP or both for SCTP, they
   will immediately, or on-demand, establish a connection.  If the
   connection goes down, they will again immediately, or on-demand, try
   to reestablish the connection.  No JP messages (neither Native nor
   Reliable) are sent while there is no connection.

   When PORT is used, only incremental JPs are sent from downstream
   routers to upstream routers.  As such, downstream routers do not
   generate periodic JPs for routes which RPF to a PORT-capable
   neighbor.

   For Joins and Prunes, which are received over a TCP/SCTP connection,
   the upstream router does not start or maintain timers on the outgoing
   interface entry.  Instead, it keeps track of which downstream routers
   have expressed interest.  An interface is deleted from the outgoing
   interface list only when all downstream routers on the interface, no
   longer wish to receive traffic.

   There is no change proposed for the PIM JP packet format.  However,
   for JPs sent over TCP/SCTP connections, no IP Header is included.
   The message begins with the PIM common header, followed by the JP
   message.  See section Section 5 for details on the common header.

   When a router is configured to use PIM over TCP on a given interface,

   option in its Hello messages.  When the router cannot setup a TCP
   connection, it will refrain from including this option.

4.  Establishing Transport Connections

   While a router interface is PORT enabled, a PIM-over-TCP or a PIM-
   over-SCTP option is included in the PIM Hello messages sent on that
   interface.  When a router on a PORT-enabled interface receives a
   Hello message containing a PIM-over-TCP/PIM-over-SCTP Option from a
   new neighbor, or an existing neighbor that did not previously include
   the option, it switches to PORT mode for that particular neighbor.

   When a router switches to PORT mode for a neighbor, it stops sending
   and accepting Native JP messages for that neighbor.  Any state from
   previous Native JP messages is left to expire as normal.  It will
   also attempt to establish a Transport connection (TCP or SCTP) with
   the neighbor.

   When the router is using TCP it will compare the TCP Connection ID it
   announced in the PIM-over-TCP Capable Option with the TCP Connection
   ID in the Hello received from the neighbor.  The router with the
   lower Connection ID will do an active Transport open to the neighbor
   Connection ID.  The router with the higher Connection ID will do a
   passive Transport open.  An implementation may open connections only
   on-demand, in that case it may be that the neighbor with the higher
   Connection ID does the active open, see Section 4.3.  Note that the
   source address of the active open must be the announced Connection
   ID.

   When the router is using SCTP, the IP address comparison need not be
   done since the SCTP protocol can handle call collision.

   If PORT is used both for IPv4 and IPv6, both IPv4 and IPv6 PIM Hello
   messages are sent, both containing PORT Hello options.  If two
   neighbors announce the same transport (TCP or SCTP) and the same
   Connection ID in the IPv4 and IPv6 Hello messages, then only one
   connection is established and is shared.  Otherwise, two connections
   are established and are used separately.

   The PIM router that performs the active open initiates the connection
   with a locally generated source transport port number and a well-
   known destination transport port number.  The PIM router that
   performs the passive open listens on the well-known local transport
   port number and does not qualify the remote transport port number.
   See Section 5 for well-known port number assignment for PORT.

   When a Transport connection is established (or reestablished), the
   two routers MUST both send a full set of JP messages for which the
   other router is the upstream neighbor.  This is needed to ensure that
   the upstream neighbor has the correct state.  When moving from
   Datagram mode, or when the connection has gone down, the router



Farinacci, et al.        Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft   A Reliable Transport Mechanism for PIM     October 2009


   cannot be sure that all the previous JP data was received by the
   neighbor.  Any state received while in Datagram mode that is not
   refreshed, will be left to expire.

   When a Transport connection goes down, Join or Prune state that was
   sent over the Transport connection is still retained.  The neighbor
   should not be considered down until the neighbor timer has expired.
   This allows routers to do a control-plane switchover without
   disrupting the network.  If a Transport connection is reestablished
   before the neighbor timer expires, the previous state is intact and
   any new JP messages sent cause state to be created or removed
   (depending on if it was a Join or Prune).  If the neighbor timer does
   expire, only the upstream router, that has oif-list state, to the
   expired downstream neighbor will need to clear state.  A downstream
   router, when an upstream neighboring router has expired, will simply
   RPF to a new neighbor where it would trigger JP messages like it
   would in [RFC4601].  It is required of a PIM router to clear its
   neighbor table for a neighbor who has timed out due to neighbor
   holdtime expiration.

   Note, since JP messages are sent over a Transport connection, no
   Prune Override or Join Suppression are possible for these messages.

4.1.  TCP Connection Maintenance

   TCP is designed to keep connections up indefinitely during a period
   of network disconnection.  If a PIM-over-TCP router fails, the TCP
   connection may stay up until the neighbor actually reboots, and even
   then it may continue to stay up until you actually try to send the
   neighbor some information.  This is particularly relevant to PIM,
   since the flow of JPs might be in only one direction, and the
   downstream neighbor might never get any indication via TCP that the
   other end of the connection isn't really there.

   Most applications using TCP want to detect when a neighbor is no
   longer there, so that the associated application state can be
   released.  Also, one wants to clean up the TCP state, and not keep
   half-open connections around indefinitely.  This is accomplished by
   using PIM Hellos and by not introducing an application-specific or
   new PIM keep-alive message.  Therefore, when a GENID changes from a
   received PIM Hello message, and a TCP connection is established or
   attempting to be established, the local side will tear down the
   connection and attempt to reopen a new one for the new instance of
   the neighbor coming up.  However, if the connection is shared by
   multiple interfaces and the GENID changes only for one of them, then
   there was not a full reboot and the connection is likely to still
   work.  In that case, the router should just resend all JP state for
   that particular neighbor.  This is similar to how state is refreshed



Farinacci, et al.        Expires April 29, 2010                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   A Reliable Transport Mechanism for PIM     October 2009


   when GENID changes for PIM in datagram mode.

   There may be situations where a router ignores some joins or prunes.
   E.g. due to wrong RP information or receiving joins on an RPF
   interface.  A router may try to cache such messages and apply them
   later if only a temporary error.  It may however also ignore the
   message, and later change its GENID for that interface to make the
   neighbor resend all state, including any that may have been
   previously ignored.  It is possible that one receives JP messages for
   an interface/link that is down.  As long as the neighbor has not
   expired, we recommend processing those messages as usual.  If they
   are ignored, then the router should change the GENID for that
   interface when it comes back up, in order to get a full update.

4.2.  Moving from PORT to Datagram Mode

   There may be situations where an administrator decides to stop using
   PORT.  If PORT is disabled on a router interface, we start expiry
   timers with the respective neighbor holdtimes as the initial values.
   Similarly if we receive a Hello message without a PORT Capable option
   from a neighbor, we start expiry timers for all JP state we have for
   that particular neighbor.  The Transport connection should be shut
   down as soon as there are no more PIM neighborships using it.  That
   is, for the connection we have associated local and remote Connection
   IDs.  When there is no PIM neighbor with that particular remote
   connection ID on any interface where we announce the local connection
   ID, the connection should be shut down.

4.3.  On-demand versus Pre-configured Connections

   Transport connections could be established when they are needed or
   when a router interface to other PIM neighbors has come up.  The
   advantage of on-demand Transport connection establishment is the
   reduction of router resources.  Especially in the case where there is
   no need for n^2 connections on a network interface or MDT tunnel.
   The disadvantage is additional delay and queueing when a JP message
   needs to be sent and a Transport connection is not established yet.

   If a router interface has become operational and PIM neighbors are
   learned from Hello messages, at that time, Transport connections may
   be established.  The advantage is that a connection is ready to
   transport data by the time a JP messages needs to be sent.  The
   disadvantage is there can be more connections established than
   needed.  This can occur when there is a small set of RPF neighbors
   for the active distribution trees compared to the total number of
   neighbors.  Even when Transport connections are pre-established
   before they are needed, a connection can go down and an
   implementation will have to deal with an on-demand situation.

   Note that for TCP, it is the router with the lower Connection ID that
   decides whether to open a connection immediately, or on-demand.  The
   router with the higher Connection ID should only initiate a
   connection on-demand.  That is, if it needs to send a JP message and
   there is no currently established connection.

   Therefore, this specification recommends but does not mandate the use
   of on-demand Transport connection establishment.

4.4.  Possible Hello Suppression Considerations

   This specification indicates that a Transport connection cannot be
   established until a Hello message is received.  One reason for this
   is to determine if the PIM neighbor supports this specification and
   the other is to determine the remote address to use to establish the
   Transport connection.

   There are cases where it is desirable to suppress entirely the
   transmission of Hello messages.  In this case, it is outside the
   scope of this document on how to determine if the PIM neighbor
   supports this specification as well as an out-of-band (outside of the
   PIM protocol) method to determine the remote address to establish the
   Transport connection.

4.5.  Avoiding a Pair of Connections between Neighbors

   To ensure there are not two connections between a pair of PIM
   neighbors, the following set of rules must be followed.  Let A and B
   be two PIM neighbors where A's Connection ID is numerically smaller
   than B's Connection ID, and each is known to the other as having a
   potential PIM adjacency relationship.

   At node A:

   o  If there is already an established TCP connection to B, on the
      PIM-over-TCP port, then A MUST NOT attempt to establish a new
      connection to B. Rather it uses the established connection to send
      JPs to B. (This is independent of which node initiated the
      connection.)

   o  If A has initiated a connection to B, but the connection is still
      in the process of being established, then A MUST refuse any
      connection on the PIM-over-TCP port from B.

   o  At any time when A does not have a connection to B which is either
      established or in the process of being established, A MUST accept
      connections from B.

      JPs to A. (This is independent of which node initiated the
      connection.)

   o  If B has initiated a connection to A, but the connection is still
      in the process of being established, then if A initiates a
      connection too, B MUST accept the connection initiated by A and
      must release the connection which it (B) initiated.

5.  Common Header Definition

   It may be desirable for scaling purposes to allow JP messages from
   different PIM protocol instances to be sent over the same Transport
   connection.  Also, it may be desirable to have a set of JP messages
   for one address-family sent over a Transport connection that is
   established over a different address-family network layer.

   To be able to do this we need a common header that is inserted and
   parsed for each PIM JP message that is sent on a Transport
   connection.  This common header will provide both record boundary and
   demux points when sending over a stream protocol like Transport.

   Each JP message will have in front of it the following common header
   in Type/Length/Value format.  And multiple different TLV types can be
   sent over the same Transport connection.

   To make sure PIM JP messages are delivered as soon as the TCP
   transport layer receives the JP buffer, the TCP Push flag will be set
   in all outgoing JP messages sent over a TCP transport connection.

   PIM messages will be sent using destination TCP port number 8471.
   When using SCTP as the reliable transport, destination port number
   8471 will be used.  See Section 10 for IANA considerations.

   JP messages are error checked.  This includes a bad PIM checksum,
   illegal type fields, illegal addresses or a truncated message.  If
   any parsing errors occur in a JP message, it is skipped, and we
   proceed processing any following TLVs.

   The current list of defined TLVs are:

6.  Explicit Tracking

   A router needs to keep track of which PORT neighbors express interest
   in a route on a given interface.  For non-PORT neighbors, there is no
   change, one would usually just need to know if at least one non-PORT
   neighbor is interested.  For some link-types, e.g. point-to-point,
   tracking neighbors is no different than tracking interfaces.  It may
   also be possible for an implementation to treat different downstream
   neighbors as being on different logical interfaces, even if they are
   on the same physical link.  Exactly how this is implemented and for
   which link types, is left to the implementer.

   For (*,G) and (S,G) routes, the router starts forwarding traffic on
   an interface when a Join is received from a neighbor on such an
   interface.  When a non-PORT neighbor sends a Prune, there is
   generally a small delay to see if another non-PORT neighbor sends a
   Prune Override.  If there is no override, one should note that no
   non-PORT neighbor is interested.  If no PORT neighbors are
   interested, the interface can be removed from the oif-list.  When a
   PORT neighbor sends a Prune, one removes the join state for that
   neighbor.  If no other PORT or non-PORT neighbors are interested, the
   interface can be removed from the oif-list.  In this case there is no
   Prune Override, since the Prune was not visible to other neighbors.

   For (S,G,R) routes, the router needs to track Prune state on the
   shared tree.  It needs to know which PORT neighbors have sent prunes,
   and whether any non-PORT neighbors have sent prunes.  The latter is
   exactly like when not using PORT.  Normally one would forward a
   packet from a source S to a group G out on an interface if a
   (*,G)-join is received, but no (S,G,R)-prune.  With PORT one needs to
   do this check per PORT neighbor.  That is, the packet should be
   forwarded unless all PORT neighbors that have sent (*,G)-joins have
   also sent (S,G,R)-prunes and if a non-PORT neighbor has sent a
   (*,G)-join, whether there also is non-PORT (S,G,R)-prune state.

7.  Multiple Instances and Address-Family Support

   Multiple instances of the PIM protocol may be used to support
   multiple VPNs or within a VPN to support multiple address families.
   Multiple instances can cause a multiplier effect on the number of
   router resources consumed.  To be able to have an option to use
   router resources more efficiently, muxing JP messages over fewer
   Transport connections can be performed.

   There are two ways this can be accomplished, one using a common
   header format over a TCP connection and the other using multiple
   streams over a single SCTP connection.

   Using the Common Header format described previously in this
   specification, using different TLVs, both IPv4 and IPv6 based JP
   messages can be encoded within a Transport connection.  Likewise,
   within a TLV, multiple occurrences of JP messages can occur and are
   tagged with an instance-ID so multiple JP messages for different VPNs
   can use a single Transport connection.

   When using SCTP multi-streaming, the common header is still used to
   convey instance information but an SCTP association is used, on a
   per-VPN basis, to send data concurrently for multiple instances.
   When data is sent concurrently, head of line blocking, which can
   occur when using TCP, is avoided.

   This extension is applicable only to PIM-SM, PIM-SSM and Bidir-PIM.

9.  Security Considerations

   Transport connections can be authenticated using HMACs MD5 and SHA-1
   similar to use in BGP [RFC4271] and MSDP [RFC3618].

   When using SCTP as the transport protocol, [RFC4895] can be used, on
   a per SCTP association basis to authenticate PIM data.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This specification makes use of a TCP port number and a SCTP port
   number for the use of PIM-Over-Reliable-Transport that has been
   allocated by IANA.  It also makes use of IANA PIM Hello Options
   allocations that should be made permanent.  In addition, a registry
   for PORT message types is requested.  This document defines two PORT
   message types.  Type 1, IPv4 JP Message; and Type 2, IPv6 JP Message.
