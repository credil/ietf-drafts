Abstract

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for the downloading of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

   a Location-by-Reference (LbyR), points to a record on a location 
   server which tracks the geolocation of the endpoint.  Once 
   downloaded by an endpoint, this LbyR can be forwarded to another 
   entity, to be dereferenced if this entity wants to learn the 
   geolocation of the sender endpoint.

1.  Introduction

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for the downloading of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
   pointing to the geolocation record of an endpoint.  A client, for 
   example, can be a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA)
   [RFC3261] (i.e., a Phone).  This URI, called a 
   Location-by-Reference (LbyR), points to a record on a location 
   server [ID-LBYR-REQ] which tracks the geolocation of the endpoint 
   (through means not defined in this document).  The LbyR record 
   stores the Geolocation of a Location Target.  Once downloaded by an 
   endpoint (the target in this case), this LbyR can be forwarded to 
   another entity, using SIP as defined in [ID-SIP-LOC], to be 
   dereferenced if this second entity wants to learn the geolocation of
   the Location Target.  

   The act of dereferencing location is explained in [ID-SIP-CON], 
   which demonstrates how a possessor of a LbyR subscribes to a 
   Location Server to attain the location of the Target. If the 
   dereferencer has permission, defined in [ID-GEO-POL], the location 
   of the target will be returned to the Location Seeker.  The Location
   Server will grant permission to location inquires based on the rules
   established by a Rule Holder [RFC3693].  Therefore, the Location 
   Server has the ability to challenge any location seeker's request, 
   thus providing additive security properties to location revelation.  
   Option.

Internet-Draft      Geopriv DHCP Location-URI Option           Nov 2008 

   Endpoints will require their geographic location for a growing 
   number of services.  A popular use-case currently is for emergency 
   services, in which SIP requires its location to be placed in a SIP 
   INVITE request [ID-SIP-LOC] towards a public safety answering point 
   (PSAP), i.e., an emergency response center.  The reason for this is 
   twofold:

   o An emergency services SIP request must be routed/retargeted to the
     appropriate PSAP that is local to where the calling device is.

   o The first responders require the UA's location in order to know 
     where to be dispatched to render aid to the caller.

   Including location in the SIP request is the most efficient means of
   accomplishing both requirements above.

   There are other use-cases, such as calling the appropriate Pizza Hut
   without having to look up in a directory which store is closest.  A 
   UA knowing its location can call a main/national/international Pizza
   Hut number or address and let the UA's location tell Pizza Hut 
   enough information to have them route/retarget the SIP request to 
   the appropriate store within the Pizza Hut organization to deliver 
   the pizza to the caller's location.

   A problem exists within existing RFCs that provide location to the 
   UA ([RFC3825] and [RFC4776]) that type of location has to be updated
   every time a UA moves.  Not all UAs will move frequently, but some 
   will.  Refreshing location every time a UA moves does not scale in 
   certain networks/environments, such as IP based cellular networks, 
   enterprise networks or service provider networks with mobile 
   endpoints.  An 802.11 based access network is one example of this. 
   Constantly updating location to endpoints might not scale in mobile 
   (residential or enterprise or municipal) networks in which the UA is
   moving through more than one network attachment point, perhaps as a 
   person walks or drives with their UA down a neighborhood street or 
   apartment complex or a shopping center. 

   If the UA were provided a URI reference to retain and hand out when
   it wants or needs to convey its location (in a protocol other than 
   DHCP), a Location-URI reference that would not change as the UA's 
   location changes, scaling issues would be significantly reduced.  
   This delivery of an indirect location has the added benefit of not 
   using up valuable or limited bandwidth to the UA with the constant 
   updates.  It also relieves the UA from having to determine when it 
   has moved far enough to consider asking for a refresh of its 
   location.  Many endpoints will not have this ability, so relying on 
   it could prove fruitless.  Once the UA has a Location-URI, a service
   provider, however it Sights the Location Target, as described in RFC
   3693 [RFC3693], would merely update the actual location in the LIS 
   record, i.e., the URI the UA already points towards.  This document 
   does not define how this update is done, as it will not be done with
   DHCP.

Internet-Draft      Geopriv DHCP Location-URI Option           Nov 2008 


   In enterprise networks, if a known location is assigned to each 
   individual Ethernet port in the network, a device that attaches to 
   the network a wall-jack (directly associated with a specific 
   Ethernet Switch port) will be associated with a known location via a
   unique circuit-ID that's used by the RAIO Option defined in RFC 3046
   [RFC3046].  This assumes wall-jacks have an updated wiremap 
   database.  RFC 3825 and RFC 4776 would return an LCI value of 
   location.  This document specifies how a Location-URI is returned by
   DHCP.  Behind the DHCP server, in the backend of the network, via 
   the (logical entity of a) LIS has a PIDF-LO in each location record 
   a URI points to.  

   If an 802.11 Access Port (AP) is at a specific known location within
   this enterprise network, all wireless Ethernet devices attaching to 
   the network through this AP would be given the same location in 
   their respective location records because the DHCP server would know
   each device was attaching from a known location, in this case, the 
   same location.  This is assuming no 802.11 triangulation is 
   occurring, this would give a more precise location to be placed in 
   the location record (URI) of each device.

   This Option can be useful in WiMAX connected endpoints or IP 
   cellular endpoints.  The Location-URI Option can be configured as a 
   client if it is a router, such as a residential home gateway, with 
   the ability to communicate to downstream endpoints as a server. 

   The means of challenge by any given LIS can vary, and a policy 
   established by a rulemaker [RFC3693] for a Location Target as to 
   what type of challenge(s) are used, how strong a challenge is used 
   or how precise the location information is given to a requestor. All
   of this is outside the scope of this document (since this will not 
   be accomplished using DHCP).

   This document IANA registers the new DHC Option for a Location URI.


2.  DHC Location-URI Elements

   DHCP is a binary Protocol; URIs are alphanumeric (text) based.  
   There is one byte per URI character.

2.1.  Elements of the Location Configuration Information

   Code XXX:      The code for this DHCP option.

   Option Length: The length of this option variable.

   Valid-For:     The time, in seconds, this URI is to be considered 
                  Valid for dereferencing.

   Location-URI:  The Location-by-Reference URI for the client

   The <Valid-For> field indicates how long, in seconds, the client is 
   to consider this Location-URI valid before performing a refresh of 
   this Option, with a refreshed <Valid-For> value.  A refresh MAY be 
   done merely at the normal DHCP refresh rate, or necessitated by this
   timer, perhaps with the client just requesting this Option be 
   refreshed.

   It is RECOMMENDED when the counter associated with this <valid-for> 
   value has passed, the client perform a refresh of this Option.  For 
   example, if 600 was the initial value of the <valid-for> field, when
   300 seconds have passed, the Option SHOULD be refreshed.  


3. DHC Option Operation

   The [RFC3046] RAIO MUST be utilized to provide the appropriate 
   indication to the DHCP Server where this DISCOVER or REQUEST message
   came from, in order to supply the correct response.  That said, this
   Option SHOULD NOT be in a DISCOVER message, because there is zero 
   knowledge by the client of which Server will answer.  

   Caution SHOULD always be used involving the creation of large 
   Options, meaning that this Option MAY need to be in its own INFORM,

Internet-Draft      Geopriv DHCP Location-URI Option           Nov 2008 

   OPTION or ACK message.

   It is RECOMMENDED to avoid building URIs, with any parameters, 
   larger than what a single DHCP response can be.  However, if a 
   message is larger than 255 bytes, concatenation is allowed, per RFC 
   3396 [RFC3396].

   Per [RFC2131], subsequent Location-URI Options, which are 
   non-concatenated, overwrite the previous value.

   Location URIs MUST NOT reveal identity information of the user of 
   the device, since DHCP is a cleartext delivery protocol. For 
   example, Location URIs such as

      sips:34LKJH534663J54@example.com 

   should be done, providing no identity information, rather than a 
   Location-URI such as this

      sips:aliceisinatlanta@example.com

   This Option is for only communications between a DHCP client and a 
   DHCP server.  It can be solicited (requested) by the client, or it 
   can be pushed by the server without a request for it.  DHCP Options 
   not understood are ignored.  A DHCP server might or might not have 
   the location of a client, therefore direct knowledge of a 
   Location-URI within the server.  If a server does not have a 
   client's location, a communication path (or request) to a LIS would 
   be necessary.  

   The LIS function, which is logical, is what creates the LbyR.  The 
   coordination between the logical entity of a DHCP server and the 
   logical entity of a LIS as to which circuit-ID gets which 
   Location-URI is not done via DHCP, therefore it is not defined 
   here.  Further, any location revelation rules and policies a user 
   has regarding the treatment of their actual location, and who can 
   access (what precision of) their location will be done with other 
   than DHCP, and likely will be done before anything other than 
   default authentication and authorization permissions are used when a
   Location Seeker, as defined in RFC 3693, requests a for a Target's 
   location. 

   Differentiating clients is done via client identifiers.  Therefore, 
   in many implementations, each client can be assigned unique LbyRs, 
   though this is not mandatory.

   Any dereferencing of a client's Location-URI would not involve DHCP 
   either, but more likely by an application layer protocol such as 
   SIP, through a subscription to the Location-URI on the LIS. The LIS 
   would also handle all authentication and authorization of location 
   requests, which is also not performed with DHCP, therefore not 
   defined here.

Internet-Draft      Geopriv DHCP Location-URI Option           Nov 2008 

   In the case of residential gateways being DHCP servers, they usually
   perform as DHCP clients in a hierarchical fashion up into a service 
   provider's network DHCP server(s), or learn what information to 
   provide via DHCP to residential clients through a protocol such as 
   PPP.  In these cases, the Location-URI would likely indicate the 
   residence's civic address to all wired or wireless clients within 
   that residence.  This is not inconsistent with what's stated above.


3.1 Architectural Assumptions

   The following assumptions have been made for use of this URI Option 
   for a client to learn it's Location-URI (in no particular order):

   o  Any user control (what Geopriv calls a 'rulemaker') for the 
      parameters and profile options a Location-Object will have is out
      of scope of this document, but assumed to take place via an 
      external web interface between the user and the LIS (direct or 
      indirect).

   o  Any user attempting to gain access to the information at this URI
      will be challenged by the LIS, not the DHCP server for 
      credentials and permissions.


3.2 Harmful URIs and URLs

   There are, in fact, some types of URIs that are not good to receive,
   due to security concerns.  For example, any URLs that can have 
   scripts, such as "data:" URLs, and some "HTTP:" URLs that go to web 
   pages - that have scripts.  Therefore,

   o URIs received via this Option SHOULD NOT be sent to a 
     general-browser to connect to a web page, because they could have 
     harmful scripts.

   o This Option SHOULD NOT contain "data:" URLs, because they could 
     contain harmful scripts.

   Instead of listing all the types of URIs and URLs that can be 
   misused or potentially have harmful affects, Section 3.3 IANA 
   registers acceptable Location-URI schemes (or types).


3.3  Valid Location-URI Schemes or Types

   Therefore, this document specifies which URI types are acceptable as
   a Location-URI scheme (or type):

   1. sip:
   2. sips:
   3. pres:

Internet-Draft      Geopriv DHCP Location-URI Option           Nov 2008 

   These Location-URI types are IANA registered in section 4.2 of this 
   document.
4.  IANA Considerations

4.1  IANA Considerations for DHCP Option Numbering

   IANA is requested to assigned a DHCP option code of XXX for the 
   Location-URI option, defined in Section 2.0 of this document.

   Any additional Location-URI parameters to be defined for use via 
   this DHC Option MUST be done through a Standards Track RFC.


4.2 IANA Considerations for Acceptable Location-URI Types

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for acceptable Location 
   URI types.  

   The following 3 URI types are registered by this document:

   1. sip:
   2. sips:
   3. pres:

   Any additional Location-URI types to be defined for use via 
   this DHC Option MUST be done through a Standards Track RFC.


5.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this 
   Location-URI option, DHCP authentication in [RFC3118] SHOULD be used
   to protect the integrity of the DHCP options.  

   A real concern with RFC 3118 it is that not widely deployed because 
   it requires keys on both ends of a communication to work (i.e., in 
   the client and in the server).  Most implementations do not 
   accommodate this.

   DHCP is a broadcast initially (a client looking for a server), 
   unicast response (answer from a server) type of protocol.  It is not
   secure in a practical sense.  In today's infrastructures, it will be
   primarily used over a wired, switched Ethernet network, requiring 
   physical access to within a wire to gain access.  Further, within an
   802.11 wireless network, the 802.11 specs have layer 2 security 
   mechanisms in place to help prevent a Location-URI from being 
   learned by an unauthorized entity.

   That said, having the Location-URI does not mean this unauthorized 
   entity has the location of a client.  The Location-URI still needs 
   to be dereferenced to learn the location of the client.  This 
   dereferencing function, which is not done using DHCP, is done by

Internet-Draft      Geopriv DHCP Location-URI Option           Nov 2008 

   requesting the location record at a Location Information Server, or 
   LIS, which is a defined entity built to challenge each request it 
   receives based on a joint policy of what is called a rulemaker.  The
   rulemaker, as defined in RFC 3693, configures the authentication and
   authorization policies for the location revelation of a Target.  
   This includes giving out more or less precise location information 
   in an answer, therefore it can answer a bad-hat, but not allow it 
   from learning exactly where a user is.  The rulemaker, which is a 
   combination of the default rules set up by the location provider and
   those decided on by the user of the Target device.  Likely, the 
   rules the user wants will not be allowed to go past some limits 
   established by the location provider, i.e., the administrator of the
   LIS, for various capability or security reasons.

   Penetrating a LIS is supposed to be hard, and hopefully vendors that
   implement a LIS accomplish this goal.

   As to the concerns about the Location-URI itself, as stated in the 
   document here (in Section 3.), it must not have any user identifying
   information in the URI string itself.  The Location-URI also must be
   hard to guess that it belongs to a specific user.  There is some 
   debate as to whether this Location-URI need be a random alphanumeric
   string or just unique.  If the latter, there is some debate as to 
   the how we define unique. Is that through space as time, as RFC 3261
   defines a SIP Call-ID needs to be (meaning: never a duplicate, ever,
   by any device, ever)? Or is it unique to within a specific domain 
   for as long as it is actively assigned to a client (plus some 
   interval).

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an 
   uncontrolled network, one should consider the potential security 
   risks therein.
