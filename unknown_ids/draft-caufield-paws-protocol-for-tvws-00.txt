                Protocol to query a White Space Database
              draft-caufield-paws-protocol-for-tvws-00.txt

Abstract

   Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously
   used by television stations available for secondary use as a result
   of the switch from analog to digital.  The spectrum in such cases is
   still owned by the primary user to whom it is licensed.  However
   parts of the spectrum may be unused at a given location or time and
   hence can be made available for secondary use.  In order to use such
   spectrum a device has to query a database in order to obtain a list
   of available channels or spectrum at a given location and time.  This
   document specifies a protocol that can be used to query a white space
   database by a device.

1.  Introduction

   Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously
   used by television stations available for secondary use as a result
   of the switch from analog to digital.  The spectrum in such cases is
   still owned by the primary user to whom it is licensed.  However
   parts of the spectrum may be unused at a given location or time and
   hence can be made available for secondary use.  In order to use such
   spectrum a device has to query a database in order to obtain a list
   of available channels or spectrum at a given location and time.  This
   document specifies a protocol that can be used to query a white space
   database by a device.

   The problem statement, use cases and requirements for the use of
   white space spectrum and the associated protocol is captured in the
   document: [I-D.ietf-paws-problem-stmt-usecases-rqmts].


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document relies on the terminology specified in
   [I-D.ietf-paws-problem-stmt-usecases-rqmts].


3.  Background

   Provide some background material on the PAWS protocol.


4.  Problem Statement

   Capture the problem statement for the protocol without repeating what
   is stated in the PS I-D.


5.  The Protocol

   Specify the details of the protocol itself here.


6.  Query Parameters

   Specify in XML the parameters that need to be carried in the request/
   response protocol.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document will require actions on the part of IANA to assign
   values for the new messages and attributes.


8.  Security Considerations

   Protocol security and threats need to be specified here.
