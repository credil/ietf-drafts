         Cisco Systems' Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol
                          draft-nourse-scep-22

Abstract

   This document specifies the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol, a
   PKI communication protocol which leverages existing technology by
   using PKCS#7 and PKCS#10 over HTTP.  SCEP is the evolution of the
   enrollment protocol developed by VeriSign, Inc. for Cisco Systems,
   Inc. It now enjoys wide support in both client and CA
   implementations.

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Public key technology is widely available and increasingly widely
   deployed.  X.509 certificates serve as the basis for several
   standards-based security protocols in the IETF, such as IKE [RFC2409]
   and IKEv2 [RFC4306], and TLS [RFC4346].  When an X.509 certificate is
   issued by other than the certificate subject (a self-issued
   certificate), there typically is a need for a certificate management
   protocol.  Such a protocol enables a PKI client to request a
   certificate, certificate renewal, or certificate revocation from a
   certification authority.  Often there also is a need for protocols to
   request a certificate or certificate revocation status information,
   although these functions are often provided by distinct protocols,
   e.g.  CRLs [RFC4523] or OCSP [RFC2560] for X.509 certificates.

   This specification defines a protocol, SCEP, for certificate
   management and certificate and CRL queries in a closed environment.
   While widely deployed, this protocol omits some certificate
   management features, e.g. in-band certificate revocation
   transactions, which can significantly enhance the security achieved
   in a PKI.  The IETF protocol suite currently includes two certificate
   management protocols with more comprehensive functionality: CMP
   [RFC4210] and Certificate Management over CMS [RFC5272].
   Environments that do not require interoperability with SCEP
   implementations SHOULD use the above-mentioned, PKIX-standard
   certificate management protocols.  Even when interoperability with
   the installed base of SCEP implementations is required, implementers
   are encouraged to support one of these comprehensive standards track
   certificate management protocols in addition to the protocol defined
   in this specification.  This implementation strategy balances near-
   term requirements for interoperability with-longer term security
   goals.

   As a reflection of the history of SCEP implementations some of the
   operations described in this document are indicated as 'SHOULD' or
   'MAY' where a stricter protocol specification might have indicated a
   'MUST'.

   The protocol supports the following general operations:

   o  CA and RA public key distribution

   o  Certificate enrollment

   o  Certificate query

   o  CRL query

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   SCEP makes extensive use of PKCS#7 [RFC2315] and PKCS#10 [RFC2986].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  SCEP Overview

   This section provides a high level overview of the functionality of
   SCEP.

2.1.  SCEP Entities

   The entity types defined in SCEP are

   o  the Requester (Section 2.1.1) (e.g., IPSEC clients)

   o  the Server, which may be either a Certification Authority (CA)
      (Section 2.1.2) or a Registration Authority (RA) (Section 2.1.3)

2.1.1.  Requester

   The requester is sometimes called a "client" in this document.  It is
   the client of the SCEP exchange.

   The requester MAY submit SCEP messages for itself or it MAY submit
   SCEP messages on behalf of peers as described in Registration
   Authority (Section 2.1.3).  This section focuses on the requester
   that is obtaining certificates for its own use.

   Before a requester can start a PKI transaction, it MUST have at least
   one appropriate key pair (e.g.  RSA) for use when signing the SCEP
   pkiMessage (Section 3.1).

   The message types, being based on PKCS#7 [RFC2315] and PKCS#10
   [RFC2986] fully support algorithm agility but the requester has to
   use a key type that is supported by the server.  RSA is the only
   algorithm supported by current implementations.

   A requester MUST have the following information locally configured:

   1.  The Certification Authority IP address or fully qualified domain
       name





Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   2.  The Certification Authority HTTP CGI script path

   3.  The identifying information that is used for authentication of
       the Certification Authority in Section 4.1.1.  This information
       MAY be obtained from the user, or presented to the end user for
       manual authorization during the protocol exchange (e.g. the user
       indicates acceptance of a fingerprint via a user-interface
       element).

   The requester MUST have MESSAGE information configured if the
   Certification Authority requires it (see Section 5.1).

   The requester MAY maintain multiple independent configurations
   appropriate for multiple Certification Authorities.  Doing so does
   not effect the protocol operation and is not in scope of this
   document.

   Certificate requests for certificates whose purpose is a specific
   solution are encouraged to conform to the solution's profile, e.g.
   [RFC4945] Section 5 for IKE/IPsec certificates.

2.1.2.  Certification Authority

   An SCEP Certification Authority (CA) is the entity that signs client
   certificates.  The CAs name appears in the issuer field of resulting
   certificates.

   Before any PKI operations can occur, the SCEP CA server obtains a
   'CA' certificate that matches the profile in [RFC5280].  This MAY be
   a CA certificate that was issued by a higher level CA.

   The SCEP server CA certificate MUST be provided out-of-band to the
   SCEP requester.  The CA certificate fingerprint MAY be used to
   authenticate a CA Certificate distributed by the GetCACert response
   (Section 4.1.1).  The fingerprint is created by calculating a SHA-1,
   SHA-256, SHA-512, or MD5 hash on the whole CA certificate.

   The certification authority MUST either include a
   cRLDistributionPoint extension in every certificate it issues or
   answer CRL queries itself, in which case it SHOULD be online at all
   times.  The certification authority SHOULD either answer certificate
   queries or make certificates available via LDAP.

   A certification authority may enforce any arbitrary policies,
   including name uniqueness policies, and apply them to certification
   requests.  The certification authority MAY reject any request.  If
   the client has already been issued a certificate for this keypair the
   server MAY return the previously created certificate.  The requester



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   MUST NOT assume any of the fields in the certification request,
   except for the public key, will be the same in the certificate
   issued.

   If a client times out from polling for a pending request it can
   resynchronize by reissuing the original request with the original
   subject name, key, and transaction ID.  The CA SHOULD return the
   status of the original transaction, including the certificate if it
   was granted.  The CA SHOULD NOT create a new transaction unless the
   original certificate has been revoked, or the transaction arrives
   more than halfway through the validity period of the original
   certificate.

2.1.3.  Registration Authority

   An SCEP Registration Authority (RA) is an SCEP server that performs
   validation and authorization checks of the SCEP requester but
   forwards the certification requests to the CA.  The RAs name does not
   appear in the issuer field of resulting certificates.

   The RA MUST return the RA certificate, in addition to the CA
   certificate, in the GetCACert Response (see Section 5.2.1.1.2).  The
   existence of an RA certificate in this response indicates to the
   client that an RA is in use.  In order to securely communicate with
   an RA using SCEP Secure Message Objects (Section 3) the client MUST
   use the RA's keys instead of the CA's keys to sign the messages.

   In order to service certification requests the RA must pass the
   requests to the CA server for signing.  The RA MAY use SCEP to
   communicate with the CA, in which case the RA acts as both an SCEP
   server (between the client and the RA) and an SCEP requester (between
   the RA and the CA).  The RA MAY respond to client certificate
   requests with a PENDING response while communicating with the CA; for
   example if the CA must manually authorize a certification request and
   thus returns PENDING to the RA the RA may respond with PENDING to the
   client while polling the CA.

   Communication between the RA and the CA MAY be over other protocols
   such as Certificate Management over CMS [RFC5272].

2.2.  Requester authentication

   As with every protocol that uses public-key cryptography, the
   association between the public keys used in the protocol and the
   identities with which they are associated must be authenticated in a
   cryptographically secure manner.  This requirement is needed to
   prevent a "man-in-the-middle" attack, in which an adversary can
   manipulate the data as it travels between the protocol participants



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 8]

   and subvert the security of the protocol.

   The communication between the requester and the certification
   authority are secured using SCEP Secure Message Objects (Section 3)
   which specifies how PKCS#7 [RFC2315] is used to encrypt and sign the
   data.  In order to perform the signing operation the client uses an
   appropriate local certificate:

   1.  If the requesting system already has a certificate issued by the
       SCEP server, and the server supports renewal (see Appendix C),
       that certificate SHOULD be used.

   2.  If the requesting system has no certificate issued by the new CA,
       but has credentials from an alternate CA the certificate issued
       by the alternate CA MAY be used.  Policy settings on the new CA
       will determine if the request can be accepted or not.  This is
       useful when enrolling with a new administrative domain; by using
       a certificate from the old domain as credentials.

   3.  If the requester does not have an appropriate existing
       certificate, then a locally generated self-signed certificate
       MUST be used instead.  The self-signed certificate MUST use the
       same subject name as in the PKCS#10 request.

   During the certificate enrollment, the requester MUST use the
   selected certificate to sign the PKCS#7 [RFC2315] (see Section 3).
   The server CertResp uses this signing certificate when encrypting the
   response (see Section 3.2.2).

   When the certification authority creates the PKCS#7 [RFC2315]
   envelope on the issued certificate, it SHOULD use the public key,
   issuer name, and serial number conveyed in the above included
   certificate.  This will inform the end entity of which private key
   should be used to open the envelope.  Note that when a client enrolls
   for separate encryption and signature certificates, it MAY use the
   signature certificate to sign both requests, and then expect its
   signature key to be used to encrypt both responses.  In any case, the
   RecipientInfo on the envelope MUST reflect the key used to encrypt
   the request.

2.3.  Enrollment authorization

   There are two mechanisms for automated enrollment authorization.

   When the client uses a certificate which is not self-signed to sign
   SCEP messages the server MAY use this certificate to authenticate the
   client and determine the appropriate authorization.  In addition to
   the policy requirements implied by optional support of renewal, see



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   Appendix D, the SCEP server SHOULD implement appropriate logic to
   support client authentication and automated enrollment using existing
   client credentials that were issued by an alternate PKI hierarchy.
   The SCEP server MUST NOT attempt to authenticate a client based on a
   self-signed certificate.

   PKCS#10 [RFC2986] specifies a PKCS#9 [RFC2985] challengePassword
   attribute to be sent as part of the enrollment request.  SCEP
   optionally uses this challengePassword to allow for unauthenticated
   authorization of enrollment requests.  The PKCS#7 [RFC2315] envelope
   protects the privacy of the challenge password.

   When utilizing the challengePassword, the server distributes a shared
   secret to the requester which will uniquely associate the enrollment
   request with the requester.  The distribution of the secret must be
   private: only the end entity should know this secret.  The actual
   binding mechanism between the requester and the secret is subject to
   the server policy and implementation.

   A client that is performing certificate renewal as per Appendix D
   SHOULD send an empty challenge password (i.e. use the empty string as
   the challenge password) but MAY send the originally distributed
   challenge password in the challengePassword attribute.  In the former
   case the SCEP CA MUST authenticate the request based on the
   certificate used to sign the renewal request.  In the latter case the
   SCEP CA MAY use either the challengePassword or the previously issued
   certificate (or both) to authenticate the request.

   In the manual mode the requester's messages are placed in the PENDING
   state until the CA operator authorizes or rejects them.  Manual
   authorization is used when the client has only a self-signed
   certificate and/or a challengePassword is not available.  The SCEP
   server MAY either reject unauthorized certification requests or mark
   them for manual authorization according to server configuration.

   The requester generates a SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, or MD5
   'fingerprint' of the PKCS#10 [RFC2986] (before PKCS#7 [RFC2315]
   enveloping and signing).  This fingerprint is sent to the CA operator
   using an out-of-band method.  The CA operator MUST compared this
   fingerprint to a locally generated fingerprint based on the message
   received during the SCEP exchange.

   SCEP clients and CAs (or RAs, if appropriate) MUST support display of
   this fingerprint to the operator to enable this authorization method.
   The out-of-band distribution and comparison of fingerprints is not
   covered by this document.

2.4.  CA/RA Certificate Distribution

   If the CA and/or RA certificates have not previously been acquired by
   the requester in some other means, the requester MUST retrieve the
   CA/RA certificates before any PKI operation (Section 3) can be
   started.

   Since no public key has yet been exchanged between the requester and
   the CA/RA, the messages cannot be secured using PKCS#7 [RFC2315], and
   the data is instead transferred in the clear.

   If an RA is in use, a certificates-only PKCS#7 [RFC2315] SignedData
   with a certificate chain consisting of both RA and CA certificates is
   returned.  Otherwise the CA certificate itself is returned.  The
   transport protocol (Section 5) MUST indicate which one is returned.

   After the requester gets the CA certificate, it MUST authenticate the
   CA certificate by comparing the CA certificate fingerprint (see
   Section 2.1.2) with the locally configured, out-of-band distributed,
   identifying information.

   Since the optional RA certificates are signed by the CA there is no
   need to authenticate them against the out-of-band data.  Clients MUST
   verify the RA certificate signature before use during protocol
   exchanges.  Clients MUST verify the authorization of the RA
   certificates.  The authorization mechanism is specified by the CA
   administrator and is out of scope for this document.

   Because a long time can pass between queries from a requester to a
   CA/RA and because RA certificates can change at any time, it is
   recommended that a requester not store RA certificates.  Instead, the
   requester SHOULD retrieve the CA/RA certificates before each
   operation.

2.5.  Certificate Enrollment

   A requester starts an enrollment (Section 3.2.1) transaction by
   creating a certificate request using PKCS#10 [RFC2986] and sends it
   to the CA/RA enveloped using the PKCS#7 (Section 3).

   It is up to local CA policy (and CA implementation) as to whether a
   certificate is granted automatically, or whether it is manually
   granted by the administrator.  The challengePassword MAY be used to
   automatically authorize the request.

   If the CA/RA returns a CertRep (Section 3.2.2) message with status
   set to PENDING, the requester enters into polling mode by
   periodically sending a GetCertInitial (Section 3.2.3) PKI message to



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   the CA/RA, until the CA/RA operator completes the manual
   authentication (approving or denying the request).

   In general, the requester will send a single PKCSReq (Section 3.2.1)
   message, followed by 0 or more GetCertInitial (Section 3.2.3)
   messages, if polling mode is entered.

   In general, the CA/RA will send 0 or more CertRep (Section 3.2.2)
   messages with status set to PENDING, followed by a single CertRep
   (Section 3.2.2) with status set to either SUCCESS or FAILURE.

2.5.1.  Client State Transitions

   The requester state transitions during enrollment operation are
   indicated in Figure 1.
                         GetCertInitial

         |                          |          +---------------+
         |                          |           CertRep(SUCCESS)
         +--------------------------+
         CertRep(FAILURE),
         PKCSReq send-timeout,
         max-time/max-polls exceeded

                    Figure 1: State Transition Diagram

   Certificate enrollment starts at the state CERT-NONEXISTANT.

   Sending a PKCSReq message changes the state to CERT-REQ-PENDING.  If
   there is no response, or sending is not possible, the state reverts
   back to CERT-NONEXISTANT.

   Receiving a CertRep message with pkiStatus set to SUCCESS changes the
   state to CERT-ISSUED.

   Receiving a CertRep message with pkiStatus set to FAILURE changes the
   state to CERT-NONEXISTANT.

   If the server sends back a CertRep message with pkiStatus set to
   PENDING, the requester will keep polling by sending a GetCertInitial
   message to the server, until either a CertRep message with status set



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011              [Page 12]

   to SUCCESS or FAILURE is received, or the maximum number of polls has
   been exceeded.

   If the maximum number of polls has been exceeded or a CertRep message
   with pkiStatus set to FAILURE is received while in the CERT-REQ-
   PENDING state, the end entity will transition to the CERT-NONEXISTANT
   state, and the SCEP client can eventually initiate another enrollment
   request.  It is important to note that, as long as the requester does
   not change its subject name or keys, the same transaction ID will be
   used in the "new" transaction.  This is important because based on
   this transaction ID, the certification authority can recognize this
   as an existing transaction instead of a new one.

   A successful transaction in automatic mode:

       Receive issued certificate.

2.6.  Certificate Access

   A certificate query message is defined for clients to retrieve a copy
   of their own certificates from the CA.  It allows clients that do not
   store their certificate locally to obtain a copy when needed.  This
   functionality is not intended to provide a general purpose



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   certificate directory service.

   To query a certificate from the certification authority, a requester
   sends a request consisting of the certificate's issuer name and
   serial number.  This assumes that the requester has saved the issuer
   name and the serial number of the issued certificate from the
   previous enrollment transaction.  The transaction to query a
   certificate consists of one GetCert (Section 3.2.4) message and one
   CertRep (Section 3.2.2) message, as shown in Figure 4.
           REQUESTER                           CA SERVER
        GetCert: PKI certificate query msg
        -------------------------------> CertRep:  pkiStatus = SUCCESS
                                         certificate attached
                                         <-----------------------------
        Receive the certificate.

                       Figure 4: GetCert Transaction

2.7.  CRL Access

   SCEP clients request a CRL via one of two methods:

   1.  If the CA supports CRL Distribution Points [RFC5280] (Section
       4.2.1.13), then the CRL MUST be retrieved via the mechanism
       specified in the CDP.

   2.  If the CA does not support CDP's, a CRL query is composed by
       creating a GetCRL message consisting of the issuer name and
       serial number from a certificate within the scope of the CRL to
       be retrieved (e.g. from a certificate to be validated).

   The server SHOULD NOT support the GetCRL method because:

   o  it does not scale well due to the unnecessary cryptography (see,
      Section 8.8)

   o  it requires the CA to be a high-availability service

   o  only limited information to determine the CRL scope is provided
      (see [RFC5280] Section 5).

   The message is sent to the SCEP server in the same way as the other
   SCEP requests: The transaction to retrieve a CRL consists of one
   GetCRL PKI message and one CertRep PKI message, which contains only
   the CRL (no certificates), as shown in Figure 5.

   On receipt of this message, the SCEP server MAY use the
   IssuerAndSerial information to return an appropriate CRL.

2.8.  Certificate Revocation

   SCEP does not specify a method to request certificate revocation.

   In order to revoke a certificate, the requester must contact the CA
   server operator using a non-SCEP defined mechanism.  Although the
   PKCS#10 [RFC2986] challengePassword is used by SCEP for enrollment
   authorization (see Enrollment authorization (Section 2.3)) this does
   not inhibit the CA server from maintaining a record of the
   challengePassword to use during subsequent revocation operations as
   implied by [RFC2985].


3.  SCEP Secure Message Objects

   PKCS#7 [RFC2315] is a general enveloping mechanism that enables both
   signed and encrypted transmission of arbitrary data.

   All messages MUST be valid PKCS#7 [RFC2315] structures, unless
   otherwise noted.

   SCEP messages that require confidentiality use two layers of PKCS#7,
   as shown in Figure 6.  By applying both enveloping and signing
   transformations, the SCEP message is protected both for the integrity
   of its end-to-end transaction information and the confidentiality of
   its information portion.  The advantage of this technique over the
   conventional transaction message format is that the signed
   transaction type information and the status of the transaction can be
   determined prior to invoking security handling procedures specific to
   the information portion being processed.

   Some messages do not require enveloping, in which case the
   EnvelopedData in Figure 6 is omitted.

      pkcsPKIEnvelope (Section 3.1.2).

   When a particular SCEP message carries data, this data is carried in
   the messageData.

   Note: The remainder of this document will refer only to
   'messageData', but it is understood to always be encapsulated in the
   pkcsPKIEnvelope (Section 3.1.2).  The format of the data in the
   messageData is defined by the messageType attribute (see
   Section 3.1.1) of the SignedData.  If there is no messageData to be
   transmitted, the entire pkcsPKIEnvelope MUST be omitted.

3.1.  SCEP pkiMessage

   The basic building block of all secured SCEP messages is the SCEP
   pkiMessage.  It consists of an PKCS#7 signed-data content type, as
   defined in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section 9.  The following restrictions
   apply:

   o  version MUST be 1

   o  the contentType in contentInfo MUST be data ({pkcs-7 1}) as
      defined in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section 8.

   o  The signed content, if present (e.g.  FAILURE and PENDING CertRep
      messages will lack any signed content), MUST be a pkcsPKIEnvelope
      (Section 3.1.2), and must match the messageType attribute.

   o  The SignerInfo MUST contain a set of authenticatedAttributes (see
      PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section 9.2 as well as Section 3.1.1 in this
      document).  All messages MUST contain

      *  an SCEP transactionID attribute

      *  an SCEP messageType attribute

      *  an SCEP senderNonce attribute

      *  any attributes required by PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section 9.2

      If the message is a response, it MUST also include

      *  an SCEP pkiStatus attribute

      *  an SCEP recipientNonce attribute

3.1.1.  Signed Transaction Attributes

   The following transaction attributes are encoded as authenticated
   attributes, and are carried, as specified in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section
   9.2, in the SignerInfo for this signedData.

   Please refer to Appendix A for the OID definitions.

                          Transaction Attributes

   The attributes are detailed in the following sections.

3.1.1.1.  transactionID

   A PKI operation is a transaction consisting of the messages exchanged
   between a requester and the server.  The transaction identifier is a
   string generated by the client when starting a transaction.  The
   client MUST generate a unique string as the transaction identifier,
   which MUST be used for all PKI messages exchanged for a given
   enrollment, encoded as a PrintableString.

   The transactionID SHOULD be generated as a SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 or
   MD5 hash on the public key value for which the enrollment request is
   made.  This allows the SCEP client to automatically generate the same
   transactionID for any given keypair.  The SCEP protocol requires that
   transactionIDs be unique, so that subsequent polling queries can be
   matched with previous transactions.  When separate signing and
   encryption certificates are requested by the client, using distinct
   keypairs ensures that distinct transactionIDs are also used.

   When using the certificate query and CRL query messages defined in
   this protocol, the transactionID is required so that the requester
   can match the response message with the outstanding request message.
   When using LDAP to query the certificate and the CRL, the behavior is
   specified by the LDAP protocol.  For a non-enrollment message (for
   example GetCert and GetCRL), the transactionID SHOULD be a number
   unique to the client.

3.1.1.2.  messageType

   The messageType attribute specifies the type of operation performed
   by the transaction.  This attribute MUST be included in all PKI
   messages.  Currently, the following message types are defined:

   o  PKCSReq (19) -- PKCS#10 [RFC2986] certificate request

   o  CertRep (3) -- Response to certificate or CRL request

   o  GetCertInitial (20) -- Certificate polling in manual enrollment

   o  GetCert (21) -- Retrieve a certificate

   o  GetCRL (22) -- Retrieve a CRL

3.1.1.3.  pkiStatus

   All response messages MUST include transaction status information,
   which is defined as pkiStatus attribute:

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   o  SUCCESS (0) -- request granted

   o  FAILURE (2) -- request rejected.  When pkiStatus is FAILURE, the
      failInfo attribute, as defined in Section 3.1.1.4, MUST also be
      present.

   o  PENDING (3) -- request pending for manual approval

3.1.1.4.  failInfo

   The failInfo attribute MUST contain one of the following failure
   reasons:

   o  badAlg (0) -- Unrecognized or unsupported algorithm identifier

   o  badMessageCheck (1) -- integrity check failed

   o  badRequest (2) -- transaction not permitted or supported

   o  badTime (3) -- The signingTime attribute from the PKCS#7
      authenticatedAttributes was not sufficiently close to the system
      time (see Section 3.1.1.6).

   o  badCertId (4) -- No certificate could be identified matching the
      provided criteria

3.1.1.5.  senderNonce and recipientNonce

   The attributes of senderNonce and recipientNonce are a 16 byte random
   number generated for each transaction.  These are intended to prevent
   replay attacks.

   When a requester sends a PKI message to the server, a senderNonce
   MUST be included in the message.

   The recipient SHOULD copy the senderNonce into the recipientNonce of
   the reply as a proof of liveliness.

   The requester SHOULD verify that the recipientNonce of the reply
   matches the senderNonce it sent in the request.

3.1.1.6.  signingTime Attribute

   The signingTime attribute is defined in [RFC2985] Section 5.3.3, and
   is carried as specified in [RFC2315] Section 9.2.  This attribute is
   optional.

3.1.2.  SCEP pkcsPKIEnvelope

   The information portion of a SCEP message is carried inside an
   enveloped-data content type, as defined in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section
   10, with the following restrictions:

   o  version MUST be 0

   o  contentType in encryptedContentInfo MUST be data ({pkcs-7 1}) as
      defined in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section 8.

   o  encryptedContent MUST be the SCEP message being transported (see
      Section 4), and must match the messageType authenticated Attribute
      in the pkiMessage.

   The PKCS#7 [RFC2315] content-encryption key (see Section 10, step 2)
   is encrypted using the public key of the recipient of the message,
   i.e. the RA or the CA public key (if sent from the requester), or the
   requester public key (if sent as a reply to the requester).

3.2.  SCEP pkiMessage types

   All of the messages in this section are pkiMessages (Section 3.1),
   where the type of the message MUST be specified in the 'messageType'
   authenticated Attribute.  Each section defines a valid message type,
   the corresponding messageData formats, and mandatory authenticated
   attributes for that type.

3.2.1.  PKCSReq

   The messageData for this type consists of a DER-encoded PKCS#10
   Certification Request [RFC2986].  The certification request MAY
   contain any fields defined in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], and MUST contain at
   least the following items:

   o  the subject Distinguished Name

   o  the subject public key

   o  a challengePassword attribute.  The Challenge Password may be used
      to (out-of-band) authenticate the enrollment request itself, or in
      an out-of-band revocation request for the issued certificate.

   In addition to the authenticatedAttributes required for a valid
   PKCS#7 [RFC2315], this pkiMessage MUST include the following
   attributes:

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   o  a transactionID (Section 3.1.1.1) attribute

   o  a messageType (Section 3.1.1.2) attribute set to PKCSReq

   o  a senderNonce (Section 3.1.1.5) attribute

   The pkcsPKIEnvelope for this message type is protected using the
   public key of the recipient as detailed in Section 3.1.2, e.g. either
   the CA or RA public key.

3.2.2.  CertRep

   The messageData for this type consists of a DER-encoded degenerate
   certificates-only Signed-data (Section 3.3).  The exact content
   required for they reply depends on the type of request this message
   is a reply to.  They are detailed in Table 1 and in Section 4.

   In addition to the authenticatedAttributes required for a valid
   PKCS#7 [RFC2315], this pkiMessage MUST include the following
   attributes:

   o  the transactionID (Section 3.1.1.1) attribute copied from the
      request we are responding to

   o  a messageType (Section 3.1.1.2) attribute set to CertRep

   o  a senderNonce (Section 3.1.1.5) attribute

   o  a recipientNonce attribute (Section 3.1.1.5) copied from the
      senderNonce from the request we are responding to.

   o  a pkiStatus (Section 3.1.1.3) set to the status of the reply.

   The pkcsPKIEnvelope for this message type is protected using the
   public key of the recipient as detailed in Section 3.1.2.  For
   example if a self-signed certificate was used to send the original
   request then this self-signed certificate's public key is used to
   encrypt the content-encryption key of the SUCCESS response's
   pkcsPKIEnvelope.

3.2.2.1.  CertRep SUCCESS

   When the pkiStatus attribute is set to SUCCESS, the messageData for
   this message consists of a DER-encoded degenerate certificates-only
   Signed-data (Section 3.3).  The content of this degenerate
   certificates-only Signed-Data depends on what the original request
   was, as outlined in Table 1.

                          Table 1: CertRep Types

3.2.2.2.  CertRep FAILURE

   When the pkiStatus attribute is set to FAILURE, the reply MUST also
   contain a failInfo (Section 3.1.1.4) attribute set to the appropriate
   error condition describing the failure.  The pkcsPKIEnvelope
   (Section 3.1.2) MUST be omitted.

3.2.2.3.  CertRep PENDING

   When the pkiStatus attribute is set to PENDING, the pkcsPKIEnvelope
   (Section 3.1.2) MUST be omitted.

3.2.3.  GetCertInitial

   The messageData for this type consists of a DER-encoded
   IssuerAndSubject (Section 3.2.3.1).  The issuer is set to the
   issuerName from the certification authority from which we are issued
   certificates.  The Subject is set to the SubjectName we used when
   requesting the certificate.

   In addition to the authenticatedAttributes required for a valid
   PKCS#7 [RFC2315], this pkiMessage MUST include the following

   attributes:

   o  the same transactionID (Section 3.1.1.1) attribute from original
      PKCSReq message

   o  a messageType (Section 3.1.1.2) attribute set to GetCertInitial

   o  a senderNonce (Section 3.1.1.5) attribute

3.2.3.1.  IssuerAndSubject

   Similar to the IssuerAndSerial defined in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section
   6.7, we need to define an IssuerAndSubject ASN.1 type (Figure 7).

   The ASN.1 definition of the issuerAndSubject type is as follows:
   issuerAndSubject ::= SEQUENCE {
       issuer Name,
       subject Name
   }

                     Figure 7: IssuerAndSubject ASN.1

3.2.4.  GetCert

   The messageData for this type consists of a DER-encoded
   IssuerAndSerial as defined in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section 6.7 containing
   the "distinguished name of the certificate issuer and an issuer-
   specific certificate serial number" which uniquely identifies the
   certificate being requested.

   In addition to the authenticatedAttributes required for a valid
   PKCS#7 [RFC2315], this pkiMessage MUST include the following
   attributes:

   o  a transactionID (Section 3.1.1.1) attribute

   o  a messageType (Section 3.1.1.2) attribute set to GetCert

   o  a senderNonce (Section 3.1.1.5) attribute

   A self-signed certificate MAY be used in the signed envelope.  This
   enables the requester to request their own certificate if they were
   unable to store it previously.

3.2.5.  GetCRL

   The messageData for this type consists of a DER-encoded
   IssuerAndSerial as defined in PKCS#7 [RFC2315] Section 6.7 along with

   the issuer name and serial number from the certificate to be
   validated.

   In addition to the authenticatedAttributes required for a valid
   PKCS#7 [RFC2315], this pkiMessage MUST include the following
   attributes:

   o  a transactionID (Section 3.1.1.1) attribute

   o  a messageType (Section 3.1.1.2) attribute set to GetCRL

   o  a senderNonce (Section 3.1.1.5) attribute

3.3.  Degenerate certificates-only PKCS#7 Signed-data

   [RFC2315] Section 9 includes a degenerate case of the PKCS#7 Signed-
   data content type, in which there are no signers.  The use of such a
   degenerate case is to disseminate certificates and certificate-
   revocation lists.  For SCEP the content field of the ContentInfo
   value of a degenerate certificates-only Signed-Data MUST be omitted.

   When carrying certificates, the certificates are included in the
   'certificates' field of the Signed-Data.  When carrying a CRL, the
   CRL will be included in the 'crls' field of the Signed-Data.


4.  SCEP Transactions

   This section describes the SCEP Transactions, without explaining the
   transport.  The transport of each message is discussed in Section 5.
   Some of the transaction-requests have no data to send, i.e. the only
   data is the message-type itself (e.g. a GetCACert message has no
   additional data).  The use of such messages will become clearer in
   Section 5.

   In this section, each SCEP transaction is specified in terms of the
   complete messages exchanged during the transaction.

   The order of the transactions in this section is mirrored in
   Section 5.2 for better organization and readability.

4.1.  Get CA Certificate

   To get the CA certificate(s), the requester sends a GetCACert message
   to the server.  There is no request data associated with this message
   (see Section 5.2.1).

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


4.1.1.  Get CA Certificate Response Message Format

   The response depends on whether the responding server has RA
   certificates or only a single CA certificate.  The server MUST
   indicate which response it is sending via the transport protocol used
   (see Section 5.2.1).

   All returned certificates MUST conform to [RFC5280].

   A fingerprint is generated using the SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 or MD5 hash
   algorithm on the whole CA certificate received by the requester
   (regardless of the presence of RA certificates).  If the requester
   does not have a certificate path to a trust anchor certificate, this
   fingerprint may be used to verify the certificate, by some positive
   out-of-band means, such as a phone call or prior configuration.

4.1.1.1.  CA Certificate Response Message Format

   If the server is a certification authority and does not have any RA
   Certificates, the response consists of a single DER-encoded X.509 CA
   certificate.

4.1.1.2.  CA/RA Certificate Response Message Format

   If the server has RA Certificates, the response consists of a DER-
   encoded degenerate certificates-only Signed-data (Section 3.3)
   containing the CA certificate and RA certificates.

4.2.  Certificate Enrollment

   A PKCSReq (Section 3.2.1) message is used to perform a certificate
   enrollment transaction.

   The reply MUST be a CertRep (Section 3.2.2) message sent back from
   the server, indicating SUCCESS, FAILURE, or PENDING.

   Precondition: Both the requester and the certification authority have
   completed their initialization process.  The requester has already
   been configured with the CA/RA certificate.

   Postcondition: The requester recieves the certificate, the request is
   rejected, or the request is pending.  A pending response might
   indicate that manual authentication is necessary.

4.2.1.  Certificate Enrollment Response Message

   If the request is granted, a CertRep (Section 3.2.2) message with
   pkiStatus set to SUCCESS is returned.  The reply MUST also contain



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   the certificate (and MAY contain any other certificates needed by the
   requester).  The issued certificate MUST be the first in the list.

   If the request is rejected, a CertRep (Section 3.2.2) message with
   pkiStatus set to FAILURE is returned.  The reply MUST also contain a
   failInfo attribute.

   If the the CA is configured to manually authenticate the requester, a
   CertRep (Section 3.2.2) message with pkiStatus set to PENDING MAY be
   returned.  The CA MAY return a PENDING for other reasons.

4.3.  Poll for Requester Initial Certificate

   Triggered by a CertRep (Section 3.2.2) with pkiStatus set to PENDING,
   a requester will enter the polling state by periodically sending
   GetCertInitial (Section 3.2.3) to the server, until either the
   request is granted and the certificate is sent back, or the request
   is rejected, or the configured time limit for polling (or maximum
   number of polls) is exceeded.

   Since GetCertInitial is part of the enrollment, the messages
   exchanged during the polling period MUST carry the same transactionID
   attribute as the previous PKCSReq.  A server receiving a
   GetCertInitial for which it does not have a matching PKCSReq MUST
   ignore this request.

   Since at this time the certificate has not been issued, the requester
   can only use its own subject name (which was contained in the
   original PKCS#10 sent via PKCSReq) to identify the polled certificate
   request.  Since there can be multiple outstanding requests from one
   requester (for example, if different keys and different key-usages
   were used to request multiple certificates), the transaction ID must
   also be included, to disambiguate between multiple requests.

   PreCondition: The requester has received a CertRep with pkiStatus set
   to PENDING.

   PostCondition: The requester has either received a valid response,
   which could be either a valid certificate (pkiStatus = SUCCESS), or a
   FAILURE message, or the polling period times out.

4.3.1.  Polling Response Message Format

   The response messages for GetCertInitial are the same as in
   Section 4.2.1.

4.4.  Certificate Access

   A requester can query an issued certificate from the SCEP server, as
   long as the requester knows the issuer name and the issuer assigned
   certificate serial number.  This transaction is not intended to
   provide a generic certificate directory service.

   This transaction consists of one GetCert (Section 3.2.4) message sent
   to the server by a requester, and one CertRep (Section 3.2.2) message
   sent back from the server.

   PreCondition: The certification authority has issued the queried
   certificate and the issuer assigned serial number is known.

   PostCondition: Either the certificate is sent back or the request is
   rejected.

4.4.1.  Certificate Access Response Message Format

   In this case, the CertRep from the server is same as in
   Section 4.2.1, except that the server will only either grant the
   request (SUCCESS) or reject the request (FAILURE).

4.5.  CRL Access

   Clients MAY request a CRL from the SCEP server as described in
   Section 2.7.

   PreCondition: The certification authority certificate has been
   downloaded to the end entity.

   PostCondition: CRL sent back to the requester.

4.5.1.  CRL Access Response Message Format

   The CRL is sent back to the requester in a CertRep (Section 3.2.2)
   message.  The information portion of this message is a degenerate
   certificates-only Signed-data (Section 3.3) that contains only the
   most recent CRL in the crls field of the Signed-Data.

   The server MAY return any appropriate CRL.

4.6.  Get Next Certification Authority Certificate

   When a CA certificate is about to expire, clients need to retrieve
   the CA's next CA certificate (i.e. the Rollover Certificate).  This
   is done via the GetNextCACert message.  There is no request data
   associated with this message (see Section 5.2.6).

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


4.6.1.  Get Next CA Response Message Format

   The response consists of a SignedData PKCS#7 [RFC2315], signed by the
   current CA (or RA) signing key.

   Clients MUST validate the signature on the the SignedData PKCS#7
   [RFC2315] before accepting any of its contents.

   The content of the SignedData PKCS#7 [RFC2315] is a degenerate
   certificates-only Signed-data (Section 3.3) message containing the
   new CA certificate and any new RA certificates, as defined in
   Section 5.2.1.1.2, to be used when the current CA certificate
   expires.

   If the CA (or RA) does not have the Rollover certificate(s) it MUST
   reject the request.  It SHOULD also remove the GetNextCACert setting
   from the capabilities until it does have rollover certificates.

   If there are any RA certificates in this response, clients MUST check
   that these RA certificates are signed by the CA, and MUST check
   authorization of these RA certificates (see Section 2.1.3).


5.  SCEP Transport

   HTTP is used as the transport protocol for SCEP Message Objects.

5.1.  HTTP "GET" Message Format

   SCEP uses the HTTP "GET" messages to request information from the CA.
   The following defines the syntax of a HTTP GET message sent from a
   requester to a certification authority server:
   "GET" CGI-PATH CGI-PROG "?operation=" OPERATION "&message=" MESSAGE

   where:

   o  CGI-PATH defines the actual CGI path to invoke the CGI program
      that parses the request.

   o  CGI-PROG is set to be the string "pkiclient.exe".  This is
      intended to be the program that the CA will use to handle the SCEP
      transactions, though the CA may ignore CGI-PROG and use only the
      CGI-PATH.

   o  OPERATION depends on the SCEP transaction and is defined in the
      following sections.

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   o  MESSAGE depends on the SCEP transaction and is defined in the
      following sections.

   If the CA supports it, requests SHOULD be done via an HTTP POST.
   This is described in Appendix F.

5.1.1.  Response Message Format

   For each GET operation, the CA/RA server MUST return a Content-Type
   and appropriate response data, if any.

5.2.  SCEP HTTP Messages

   This section describes the OPERATION and MESSAGE values for SCEP
   exchanges.

5.2.1.  GetCACert

   The OPERATION MUST be set to "GetCACert".

   The MESSAGE MAY be omitted, or it MAY be a string that represents the
   certification authority issuer identifier.  A CA Administrator
   defined string allows for multiple CAs supported by one SCEP server.

5.2.1.1.  GetCACert Response

   The response for GetCACert is different between the case where the CA
   directly communicates with the requester during the enrollment, and
   the case where a RA exists and the requester communicates with the RA
   during the enrollment.

5.2.1.1.1.  CA Certificate Only Response

   The response will have a Content-Type of "application/
   x-x509-ca-cert".

   The body of this response consists of a DER-encoded X.509 CA
   certificate, as defined in Section 4.1.1.1.
   "Content-Type:application/x-x509-ca-cert\n\n"<DER-encoded X.509>

5.2.1.1.2.  CA and RA Certificates Response

   The response will have a Content-Type of "application/
   x-x509-ca-ra-cert".

   The body of this response consists of a DER-encoded degenerate
   certificates-only Signed-data (Section 3.3) containing both CA and RA
   certificates, as defined in Section 4.1.1.2.

5.2.2.  PKCSReq

   The OPERATION MUST be set to "PKIOperation".

   The MESSAGE consists of a base64-encoded DER-encoded PKCSReq SCEP
   message.

   An example PKIOperation request might look as follows:
 GET /cgi-bin/pkiclient.exe?operation=PKIOperation&message=MIAGCSqGSIb3D
 QEHA6CAMIACAQAxgDCBzAIBADB2MGIxETAPBgNVBAcTCE ......AAAAAA== HTTP/1.0

5.2.2.1.  PKCSReq Response

   The response will have a Content-Type of "application/x-pki-message".

   The body of this response consists of a DER-encoded CertRep SCEP
   message defined in Section 4.2.1.  The following is an example of the
   response:
   "Content-Type:application/x-pki-message\n\n"<DER-encoded CertRep msg>

5.2.3.  GetCertInitial

   The OPERATION MUST be set to "PKIOperation".

   The MESSAGE consists of a base64-encoded DER-encoded GetCertInitial
   SCEP message.

5.2.3.1.  GetCertInitial Response

   The body of this response consists of a DER-encoded CertRep SCEP
   message defined in Section 4.3.1.

5.2.4.  GetCert

   The OPERATION MUST be set to "PKIOperation".

   The MESSAGE consists of a base64-encoded DER-encoded GetCert SCEP
   message.

5.2.4.1.  GetCert Response

   The body of this response consists of a DER-encoded CertRep SCEP
   message defined in Section 4.4.1.

   message.

5.2.5.1.  GetCRL Response

   The body of this response consists of a DER-encoded CertRep SCEP
   message defined in Section 4.5.1.

5.2.6.  GetNextCACert

   The OPERATION MUST be set to "GetNextCACert".

   The MESSAGE MAY be ommitted, or it MAY be a string that represents
   the certification authority issuer identifier, if such has been set
   by the CA Administrator.

5.2.6.1.  GetNextCACert Response

   The response will have a Content-Type of "application/
   x-x509-next-ca-cert".

   The body of this response consists of a SignedData PKCS#7 [RFC2315],
   as defined in Section 4.6.1.  (This is similar to the GetCert
   response but does not include any of the attributes defined in

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security goals of SCEP are that no adversary can:

   o  subvert the public key/identity binding from that intended,

   o  discover the identity information in the enrollment requests and
      issued certificates,

   o  cause the revocation of certificates with any non-negligible
      probability.

   Here an adversary is any entity other than the requester and the CA
   (and optionally the RA) participating in the protocol.  The adversary
   is computationally limited, but that can manipulate data during
   transmission (that is, can act as a man-in-the-middle).  The precise
   meaning of 'computationally limited' depends on the implementer's
   choice of one-way hash functions and cryptographic algorithms.  The
   mandatory to implement algorithms are RSA, DES and MD5.  Depending on
   the CA capabilities, Triple-DES MAY be used instead of DES, and
   SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512 MAY be used instead of MD5 (see
   Appendix C).

   The first and second goals are met through the use of PKCS#7
   [RFC2315] and PKCS#10 [RFC2986] encryption and digital signatures
   using authenticated public keys.  The CA's public key is
   authenticated via the checking of the CA fingerprint, as specified in
   Section 2.1.2, and the SCEP client's public key is authenticated
   through the manual authentication or pre-shared secret
   authentication, as specified in Section 2.2.  The third goal is met
   through the use of a challenge password for revocation, which is
   chosen by the SCEP client and communicated to the CA protected by the
   PKCS#7 [RFC2315] encryptedData, as specified in Section 2.8.

   The motivation of the first security goal is straightforward.  The
   motivation for the second security goal is to protect the identity
   information in the enrollment requests and issued certificates.
   Subsequent protocols can use the certificate in ways that either
   expose the identity information, or protect it, depending on the
   security requirements of those protocols.  The motivation for the
   third security goal is to protect the SCEP clients from denial of
   service attacks.

8.1.  General Security

   Common key-management considerations such as keeping private keys
   truly private and using adequate lengths for symmetric and asymmetric
   keys must be followed in order to maintain the security of this
   protocol.

   This is especially true for CA keys, which, when compromised,
   compromise the security of all relying parties.

8.2.  Use of the CA keypair

   A CA key pair is generally meant for (and is usually flagged as)
   certificate signing ("keyCertSign") exclusively, rather than data
   signing ("digitalSignature") or data encryption
   ("dataEnchipherment").  The SCEP protocol, however, uses the CA
   private key to both encrypt and sign PKCS#7 [RFC2315] transport
   messages.  This is generally considered undesirable, as it widens the
   possibility of an implementation weakness, and provides

   o  another place that the private key must be used (and hence is
      slightly more vulnerable to exposure),

   o  another place where a side channel attack (say, timing or power
      analysis) might be used,

   o  another place that the attacker might somehow insert his own text,
      and get it signed by the private key.

   While the CA key pair can be generated with the data encryption and
   data signing flags set, this is operationally not encouraged.  It
   would make using the key as a PKCS#7 [RFC2315] transport key 'legal',
   but the discussion from the previous paragraph still applies.

   A solution is to use RA keys to secure the SCEP transport (i.e.
   message signing and encrypting), which allows the CA keys to be used
   only for their intended purpose of certificate signing.

   An RA can be implemented in two ways: physically separate or
   implicit.  In the implicit case, the CA simply creates an extra key
   pair.  A physically separate RA allows the CA to be inside the secure
   network, not accessible to hackers at all.

8.3.  ChallengePassword

   The challengePassword sent in the PKCS#10 enrollment request is
   signed and encrypted by way of being encapsulated in a pkiMessage.
   When saved by the CA, care should be taken to protect this password.



Pritikin, et al.        Expires September 8, 2011              [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                    SCEP                        March 2011


   If the challengePassword is used to automatically authenticate an
   enrollment request, it is recommended that some form of one-time
   password be used to minimize damage in the event the data is
   compromised.

8.4.  transactionID

   A well-written CA/RA SHOULD NOT rely on the transactionID to be
   correct or as specified in this document.  Requesters with buggy
   software might add additional undetected duplicate requests to the
   CA's queue (or worse).  A well-written CA/RA should never assume the
   data from a requester is well-formed.

8.5.  Nonces and Replay

   In order to detect replay attacks, both sides need to maintain state
   information sufficient to detect an unexpected nonce value.

   Since existing implementations do not copy the senderNonce from a
   CertRep into subsequent GetCertinitial requests, the server will
   never see its own nonce reflected back to it.  The transactionID can
   be used to link together the GetCertInitial and PKCSReq messages.

8.6.  Key Usage Issues

   Key pairs may be intended for particular purposes, such as encryption
   only or signing only.  The usage of any associated certificate can be
   restricted by adding key usage and extended key usage attributes to
   the PKCS#10 [RFC2986].  If key usage is not present, the public key
   is assumed to be a general purpose key that may be used for all
   purposes.

   When building a pkiMessage, clients MUST have a certificate to sign
   the PKCS#7 [RFC2315] signed-data (because PKCS#7 [RFC2315] requires
   it).  Clients MUST either use an existing certificate, or create a
   self-signed certificate (see Section 2.3).  If the certificate has a
   key usage extension in it, then both the SCEP client and SCEP server
   MUST ignore the key usage for the duration of the transaction (the
   key will be used for signing during the creation of the PKCSReq
   message, and for encryption during the creation of the CertRep
   message).

8.7.  GetCACaps Issues

   The GetCACaps response is not signed.  This allows an attacker to use
   downgrade attacks (as well as "upgrade attacks") on the cryptographic
   capabilities of the CA.

8.8.  Unnecessary cryptography

   Some of the SCEP exchanges use signing and encryption operations that
   are not necessary.  In particular the GetCert and GetCRL exchanges
   are encrypted and signed in both directions.  The information
   requested is public and thus signing the requests is of questionable
   value but also CRLs and Certificates, i.e. the respective responses,
   are already signed by the CA and can be verified by the recipient
   without requiring additional signing and encryption.

   This may affect performance and scalability of the CA and could be
   used as an attack vector on the CA (though not an anonymous one).
   The use of CDPs is recommended for CRL access, as well as other ways
   of retrieving certificates (LDAP, direct HTTP access, etc.).

8.9.  GetNextCACert

   Servers implementing early versions of the SCEP draft might return an
   unsigned GetNextCACert response by erroneously mirroring the
   (unsigned) functionality of GetCACert.  Client receiving such
   responses MUST ignored them.

   GetNextCACert depends on a 'flag moment' at which every client in the
   PKI infrastructure switches from the current CA certificate (and
   client certificate) to the new CA certificate and client
   certificates.  Proper monitoring of the network infrastructure can
   ensure that this will proceed as expected but any errors in
   processing or implementation can result in a failure of the PKI
   infrastructure.

Appendix B.  SCEP State Transitions

   SCEP state transitions are indexed by the transactionID attribute.
   The design goal is to ensure the synchronization between the CA and
   the requester under various error situations.

   Each enrollment transaction is uniquely associated with a transaction
   identifier (carried in the transactionID signed attribute (see
   Section 3.1.1.1).  Because the enrollment transaction could be
   interrupted by various errors, including network connection errors or
   client reboot, the SCEP client generates a transaction identifier by
   calculating a hash on the public key value for which the enrollment
   is requested.  The requester generates the transaction identifier
   which is included in PKCSReq.  If the CA returns a response of
   PENDING, the requester will poll by periodically sending out
   GetCertInitial with the same transaction identifier until either a
   response other than PENDING is obtained, or the configured maximum
   time has elapsed.  This mechanism retains the same transaction
   identifier throughout the enrollment transaction.

   If the client times out or the client reboots, the client
   administrator will start another enrollment transaction with the same
   key pair.  The second enrollment will have the same transaction
   identifier.  At the server side, instead of accepting the PKCSReq as
   a new enrollment request, it can respond as if another GetCertInitial
   message had been sent with that transaction ID.  The second PKCSReq
   should be taken as a resynchronization message to allow the
   enrollment to resume as the same transaction.

   The following gives several examples of client to CA transactions.

   Client actions are indicated in the left column, CA actions are
   indicated in the right column.  A blank action signifies that no
   message was received.

   The first transaction, for example, would read like this:

   "Client Sends PKCSReq message with transaction ID 1 to the CA.  The
   CA signs the certificate and constructs a CertRep Message containing
   the signed certificate with a transaction ID 1.  The client receives
   the message and installs the certificate locally."

Appendix C.  CA Capabilities

C.1.  GetCACaps HTTP Message Format

   "GET" CGI-PATH CGI-PROG "?operation=GetCACaps" "&message=" CA-IDENT

   This message requests capabilities from CA.  The response is a list
   of text capabilities, as defined in Appendix C.2.  CA servers SHOULD
   support the GetCACaps message and MUST support it when they support
   certificate renewal using the method described in Appendix D.

C.2.  CA Capabilities Response Format

   The response for a GetCACaps message is a list of CA capabilities, in
   plain text, separated by <LF> characters, as follows (quotation marks
   are NOT sent):

   +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+
   | Keyword            | Description                                  |

   | "GetNextCACert"    | CA Supports the GetNextCACert message.       |
   | "POSTPKIOperation" | PKIOPeration messages may be sent via HTTP   |
   |                    | POST.                                        |

   | "SHA-256"          | CA Supports the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.   |
   | "SHA-1"            | CA Supports the SHA-1 hashing algorithm.     |

   | "DES3"             | CA Supports the triple-DES encryption        |
   |                    | algorithm.                                   |
   +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+

   The client SHOULD use SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512 in preference to MD5
   hashing if it is supported by the CA.

   The server MUST use the texual case specified here, but clients
   SHOULD ignore the textual case when processing this message.  A
   client MUST be able to accept and ignore any unknown keywords that
   might be sent back by a CA.

   If the CA supports none of the above capabilities the SCEP server
   SHOULD return an empty message.  A server MAY simply return an HTTP
   Error.  A client that receives an empty message or an HTTP error
   SHOULD interpret the response as if none of the requested
   capabilities are supported by the CA.

   The Content-type of the reply SHOULD be "text/plain".  Clients SHOULD
   ignore the Content-type, as older server implementations of SCEP may
   send various Content-types.

   Example:
   GET /cgi-bin/pkiclient.exe?operation=GetCACaps&message=myca

   might return:
   GetNextCACert<LF>POSTPKIOperation

   This means that the CA supports the GetNextCACert message and allows
   PKIOperation messages (PKCSreq, GetCert, GetCertInitial, ...) to be
   sent using HTTP POST.


Appendix D.  Client Certificate Renewal

   An enrollment request that occurs more than halfway through the
   validity period of an existing certificate for the same subject name
   and key usage MAY be interpreted as a re-enrollment or renewal
   request and be accepted.  A new certificate with new validity dates
   can be issued, even though the old one is still valid, if the CA
   policy permits.  The server MAY automatically revoke the old client
   certificate.  Clients MUST use GetCACaps (see Appendix C) to
   determine if the CA supports renewal.  Clients MUST support servers
   that do not implement renewal, or that reject renewal requests.

   To renew a client certificate, the client uses the PKCSreq message
   and signs it with the existing client certificate.  The client SHOULD
   use a new keypair when requesting a new certificate.  The client MAY

   request a new certicate using the old keypair.


Appendix E.  CA Key Rollover

   When the CA certificate expires all certificates that have been
   signed by it are no longer valid.  CA key rollover provides a
   mechanism by which the server MAY distribute a new CA certificate
   which is valid in the future; when the current certificate has
   expired.  Clients MUST use GetCACaps (see Appendix C) to determine if
   the CA supports GetNextCACert.

   To obtain the new CA certificate prior to the expiration of the
   current one, the client uses the GetNextCACert message.

   To obtain a new client certificate signed by the new CA certificate,
   use the new CA or RA certificate in the PKCSreq message envelope.

   Clients MUST store the not-yet-valid CA certificate, and any not-yet-
   valid client certificates obitained, until such time that they are
   valid.  At which point clients switch over to using the newly valid
   certificates.

   Example:

GetNextCACert           ---------->
                        <---------- New CA certificate

PKCSReq*                ----------> CA Signs certificate with NEW key
Client Stores Cert      <---------- CertRep - Certificate issued
for installation when               from NEW CA certificate and key pair
existing cert expires.

*enveloped for new CA or RA cert and key pair.  The CA will use the
envelope to determine which key and certificate to use to issue the
client certificate.


Appendix F.  PKIOperation via HTTP POST Message

   If the remote CA supports it, any of the PKCS#7 [RFC2315]-encoded
   SCEP messages may be sent via HTTP POST instead of HTTP GET.  This is
   allowed for any SCEP message except GetCACert, GetNextCACert, or
   GetCACaps.  In this form of the message, Base 64 encoding is not
   used.

                            General POST Syntax

   The client can verify that the CA supports SCEP messages via POST by
   looking for the "POSTPKIOperation" capability (See Appendix C).
