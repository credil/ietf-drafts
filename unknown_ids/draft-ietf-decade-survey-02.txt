Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


1.  Introduction

   DECADE (DECoupled Application Data Enroute) is an architecture that
   provides applications with access to in-network storage.

   A major motivation for DECADE is the substantial increase on capacity
   and reduction in cost offered by storage systems.  In particular,
   over the last decade, capacity of solid-state storage has increased
   100-fold, while cost dropped to $50/GB; capacity of magnetic storage
   devices has increased 100-fold, while cost dropped to $0.50/GB.

   High-capacity and low-cost in-network storage devices introduce
   substantial opportunities.  One example of in-network storage is
   content caches supporting Web and P2P content.  Different from
   existing content caches whose control fully reside at the owners of
   the caching devices, DECADE also allows applications to control
   access to their allocated in-network storage, as well as the
   resources consumed while accessing that storage (bandwidth,
   connections, storage space).  While designed in the context of P2P
   applications, it may be useful to other applications as well.  This
   document provides details on deployed and experimental in-network
   storage solutions, and evaluates their suitability for DECADE.

   We note that the techniques presented in this section are only
   representative of the research in this area.  Rather than trying to
   enumerate an exhaustive list, we have chosen some typical techniques
   that lead to derivative works.


2.  Survey Overview

2.1.  Terminology and Concepts

   This document uses terms defined in [1].

2.2.  Historical Context

   In-network storage has been used previously in numerous scenarios to
   reducing network traffic and enable more efficient content
   distribution.  This section presents a brief history of content
   distribution techniques and illustrates how DECADE relates to past
   approaches.  Systems have been developed with particular use cases in
   mind.  Thus, this survey is not meant to point out shortcomings of
   existing solutions, but rather to indicate where certain capabilities
   required in DECADE [2] are not provided by existing systems.

   In the early stage of Internet development, most Web content was
   stored at a central server and clients requested Web content from the



Alimi, et al.             Expires June 18, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


   central server.  In this architecture, the central server was
   required to provide a large amount of bandwidth.  Web browsing is
   still a primary activity on today's Internet.  As more and more users
   access Web content, a central server can become overloaded.  The use
   of web caches is one technique to reduce load on a central server.
   Web caches store frequently-requested content, and provide bandwidth
   for serving the content to clients.

   The ongoing growth of broadband technology in the worldwide market
   has been driven by the hunger of customers for new multimedia
   services as well as Web content.  In particular, the use of audio and
   video streaming formats has become common for delivery of rich
   information to the public - both residential and business.

   To overcome this challenge of massive multimedia consumption, only
   installing more Web cache will not be enough.  Moving content closer
   to the consumer results in greater network efficiency, improved QoS,
   and lower latency, while facilitating personalization of content
   through broadband content applications.  In these edge technologies,
   CDN is a representative technique.  Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
   is based on a large-scale distributed network of servers located
   closer to the edges of the Internet for efficient delivery of digital
   content including various forms of multimedia content.

   Although CDN is an effective means of information access and
   delivery, there are two barriers to making CDN a more common service:
   cost and replication integrity.  Deploying a CDN for publicly
   available content is expensive.  It requires administrative control
   over nodes with large storage capacity at geographically dispersed
   locations with adequate connectivity.  CDN can be scalable, but due
   to this administrative and cost overhead, not rapidly deployable for
   the common user.

   The emergence and maturity of Peer to Peer (P2P) has allowed
   improvements to many network applications.  P2P allows the use of
   client resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth, for
   serving content.  This can reduce the amount of resources required by
   a content provider.  Multimedia content delivery using various peer-
   to-peer or peer-assisted frameworks has been shown to greatly reduce
   the dependence on CDN and central content servers.  However,
   popularity of P2P applications has resulted in increased traffic on
   ISP networks.

   DECADE aims to provide a standard protocol allowing P2P applications
   (including Content Providers) to make use of in-network storage to
   reduce the traffic burden on ISP networks, while enabling P2P
   applications to control access to content they have placed in in-
   network storage.

3.  In-network Storage System Components

   Before surveying individual technologies, we describe the basic
   components of in-network storage systems used to evaluate them in the
   context of DECADE.  For consistency and to easy comparison, we use
   the same model to evaluate each storage technology in this document.

   Note that the network protocol(s) used by a storage system are also
   an important part of the design.  We omit details of particular
   protocol choices in the current version of this document.

3.1.  Data Access Interface

   A set of operations are available to a user for accessing data in the
   in-network storage.  Solutions typically allow both read and write,
   though the mechanisms for doing so can differ drastically.

3.2.  Data Management Operations

   Storage systems may provide users the ability to manage stored
   content.  For example, operations such as delete and move can be
   provided to users.  In this survey, we focus on data management
   operations that are provided to client users and omit those provided
   to system administrators.

3.3.  Data Search Capability

   Some storage systems may provide the capability to search or
   enumerate content that has been stored.  In this survey, we focus on
   search capabilities that are provided to client users and omit those
   provided to system administrators.

3.4.  Access Control Authorization

   A user or some other entity defines the access policies for the in-
   network storage.  The in-network storage system then checks the
   authorization of a client before it stores or retrieves content.  We
   define three types of access control authorization: public-
   unrestricted, public-restricted, and private.

   Public-unrestricted refers to content on an in-network storage system
   that is widely available to everyone (i.e. without restrictions).  An
   analogy is accessing www.Wikipedia.org on the Internet, or anonymous
   access to FTP sites.

   Public-restricted refers to content on an in-network storage system
   that is generally available to the public but which is restricted by
   certain criteria (e.g. country or network), but which does not

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


   require any confidential credentials from the client.  An analogy is
   some content (e.g. on line TV show episode) on the Internet that can
   only be viewable in selected countries (i.e. white/black lists or
   black-outs).

   Private refers to content on an in-network storage system that is
   only made available to one or more clients presenting the required
   confidential credentials (e.g. password or key).  This content is not
   available to anyone without the proper confidential access
   credentials.

3.5.  Resource Control Interface

   This is the interface through which users manage the resources on in-
   network storage that can be used by other peers, e.g., the bandwidth
   or connections.  The storage system may also allow users to indicate
   a time for which resources are granted.

3.6.  Discovery Mechanism

   Users use the discovery mechanism to find location of in-network
   storage, find access interface or resource control interface or other
   interfaces of in-network storage.

3.7.  Storage Mode

   The data managed by the in-network storage could be of various types.
   Example storage modes are file-based, object-based, or block-based.


4.  In-Network Storage Systems

   This section surveys in-network storage systems using the methodology
   defined above.  The survey includes some systems that are widely
   deployed today, some systems that are just being deployed, and some
   experimental/futuristic systems.  The survey covers both traditional
   client-server architectures and P2P architecutres.  The surveyed
   systems are listed in alphabetical order.  Also, for each system, a
   brief explanation is given of the relevance to DECADE.

4.1.  Amazon S3

   Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) [3] provides an online storage
   service using web (HTTP) interfaces.  Users create buckets, and each
   bucket can contain stored objects.  Users are provided an interface
   through which they can manage their buckets.  Amazon S3 is popular
   backend storage for other services.  Other related storage services
   is the Blob Service provided by Windows Azure [4], and the Google

   Storage for Developers [5].

4.1.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   Very widely used (deployed) example of in-network storage.  Amazon
   leases the storage to third party companies for disparate services.
   In particular, Amazon S3 has a rich model for authorization (using
   signed queries) to integrate with a wide variety of use cases.  A
   focus for Amazon S3 is scalability.  Particular simplifications that
   were made are the absence of a general, hierarchichal namespace and
   the inability to update contents of existing data.

4.1.2.  Data Access Interface

   Users can read, and write objects.

4.1.3.  Data Management Operations

   Users can delete previously-stored objects.

4.1.4.  Data Search Capability

   Users can list contents of buckets to find objects matching desired
   criteria.

4.1.5.  Access Control Authorization

   All methods of access control are supported: public-unrestricted,
   public-restricted and private.

   For example, access to stored objects can be restricted by owner, a
   list of other Amazon Web Service users, all Amazon Web Service Users,
   or open to all users (anonymous access).  Another option is for the
   owner to generate and sign a query (e.g., a query to read an object)
   that can be used by any user until an owner-defined expiration time.

4.1.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

4.1.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   Users are provided a well-known DNS name (either a default provided
   by Amazon, or one customized by a particular user).  Users accessing
   S3 storage use DNS to discover an IP address where S3 requests can be
   sent.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


4.1.8.  Storage Mode

   Object-based, with the extension that objects can be organized into
   user-defined buckets.

4.2.  BranchCache

   BranchCache [6] is a feature integrated into Windows (Windows 7 and
   Windows Server 2008R2) that aims to optimize enterprise branch office
   file access over the WAN links.  The main goals are to reduce WAN
   link utilization and improve application responsiveness by caching
   and sharing content within a branch while still maintaining end-to-
   end security.  BranchCache allows files retrieved from the web
   servers and file servers located in headquarters or datacenters to be
   cached in remote branch offices, and shared among users in the same
   branch accessing the same content.  BranchCache operates
   transparently by instrumenting the HTTP and SMB components of the
   networking stack.  It provides two modes of operation: Distributed
   Cache and Hosted Cache.

   In both modes, a client always contacts a BranchCache-enabled content
   server first to get the content identifiers for local search.  If the
   content is cached locally, the client then retrieves the content
   within the branch.  Otherwise, the client will go back to the
   original content server to request the content.  The two modes differ
   in how the content is shared.

   In the Hosted Cache mode, a locally provisioned server acts as a
   cache for files retrieved from the servers.  After getting the
   content identifiers, the client first consults the cache for the
   desired file.  If it is not present in the cache, the client
   retrieves it from the content server and sends it to the cache for
   storage.

   In the Distributed Cache mode, a client first queries other clients
   in the same network using the Web Services Discovery multicast
   protocol.  As in the Hosted Cache mode, the client retrieves the file
   from the content server it is not available locally.  After
   retrieving the file (either from another client or the content
   server), the client stores the file locally.

   The original content server always authorizes requests from clients.
   Cached content is encrypted, and clients can only decrypt the data
   using keys derived from metadata returned by the content server.  In
   addition to instrumenting the networking stack at clients, content
   servers must also support BranchCache.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


4.2.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   BranchCache is an example of an in-network storage system primarily
   targeted at enterprise networks.  It supports both a P2P like mode
   (Distributed Cache) as well as a client-server mode (Hosted Cache).
   Integration into the Microsoft OS will ensure wide distribution of
   this in-network storage technology.

4.2.2.  Data Access Interface

   Clients transparently retrieve (read) data from a cache (other
   clients or a Hosted Cache) since it operates by instrumenting the
   networking stack.  In Hosted Cache mode, clients write data to the
   Hosted Cache once it is retrieved from the content server.

4.2.3.  Data Management Operations

   Not provided.

4.2.4.  Data Search Capability

   Not provided.

4.2.5.  Access Control Authorization

   Access control method is private.  For example, transferred content
   is encrypted, and can only be decrypted by keys derived from data
   received from the original content server.  Though data may be
   transferred to unauthorized clients, end-to-end security is
   maintained by only allowing authorized clients to decrypt the data.

4.2.6.  Resource Control Interface

   The storage capacity of caches on the clients and Hosted Caches are
   configurable by system administrators.  The Hosted Cache further
   allows configuration of the maximum number of simultaneous client
   accesses.  In the Distributed Caching mode, exponential back-off and
   throttling mechanisms are utilized to prevent reply storms of popular
   content requests.  The client will also spread data block access
   among multiple serving clients that have the content (complete or
   partial) to improve latency and provide some load balancing.

4.2.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   The Distributed Cache mode uses multicast for discovery of other
   clients and content within a local network.  Currently, the Hosted
   Cache mode uses policy provisioning or manual configuration of the
   server used as the Hosted Cache.

4.2.8.  Storage Mode

   Object-based.

4.3.  Cache-and-Forward Architecture

   Cache-and-Forward (CNF) [7] is an architecture for content delivery
   services for the future Internet.  In this architecture, storage can
   be exploited at nodes within the network, either directly at routers
   or deployed nearby the routers.  CNF is based on the concept of
   store-and-forward routers with large storage, providing for
   opportunistic delivery to occasionally disconnected mobile users and
   for in-network caching of content.  The proposed CNF protocol uses
   reliable hop-by-hop transfer of large data files between CNF routers
   in place of an end-to-end transport protocol like TCP.

4.3.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   An example of an experimental in-network storage sysem that would
   require storage space on (or near) a large number of routers in the
   Internet if it was deployed.  As the name of the system implies, it
   would provide short term caching and not long term network storage.

4.3.2.  Data Access Interface

   Users implicitly store content at Cache-and-forward routers by
   requesting files.  End hosts read content from in-network storage by
   submitting queries for content.

4.3.3.  Data Management Operations

   Not provided.

4.3.4.  Data Search Capability

   Not provided.

4.3.5.  Access Control Authorization

   Access control method is public-restricted (to any client which is
   part of the cache-and-forward network).

4.3.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


4.3.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   A query including a location-independent content ID is sent to the
   network, and routed to a Cache-and-forward router, which handles
   retrieval of the data and forwarding to the end host.

4.3.8.  Storage Mode

   Object-based (with objects representing individual files).  The
   architecture proposes to cache large files at storage within the
   network, though files could be made to represent smaller chunks of
   larger files.

4.4.  CDN

   A Content Delivery Network (CDN) provides services that improve
   network performance by maximizing bandwidth, improving accessibility
   and maintaining correctness through content replication.  They offer
   fast and reliable applications and services by distributing content
   to cache or edge servers located close to users.  See [8] for an
   additional taxonomy and survey.

   A CDN has some combination of content-delivery, request-routing,
   distribution and accounting infrastructure.  The content-delivery
   infrastructure consists of a set of edge servers (also called
   surrogates) that deliver copies of content to end-users.  The
   request-routing infrastructure is responsible to directing client
   request to appropriate edge servers.  It also interacts with the
   distribution infrastructure to keep an up-to-date view of the content
   stored in the CDN caches.  The distribution infrastructure moves
   content from the origin server to the CDN edge servers and ensures
   consistency of content in the caches.  The accounting infrastructure
   maintains logs of client accesses and records the usage of the CDN
   servers.  This information is used for traffic reporting and usage-
   based billing.

   In practice, CDN typically host static content including images,
   video, media clips, advertisements, and other embedded objects for
   dynamic Web content.  A focus for CDNs is the ability to publish and
   deliver content to end-users in a reliable and timely manner.  A CDN
   focuses on building its network infrastructure to provide the
   following services and functionalities: storage and management of
   content; distribution of content among surrogates; cache management;
   delivery of static, dynamic and streaming content; backup and
   disaster recovery solutions; and monitoring, performance measurement
   and reporting.

   Examples of existing CDNs are Akamai, Limelight, and CloudFront.

   The following description uses the term Content Provider to refer to
   the entity purchasing CDN service, and the term Client to refer to
   the subscriber requesting content via the CDN from the Content
   Provider.

4.4.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   Very widely used (deployed) example of in-network storage for
   multimedia content.  The existance and operation of the storage is
   totally transparent to the end user.  CDNs typically require a strong
   business relationship between the content providers and content
   distributors and often the business relationship extends to the ISPs.

4.4.2.  Data Access Interface

   CDN is typically an internal closed system, and CDN just provide read
   (retrieve) access interface to clients but they don't provide write
   (store) access interface to clients.  Content provider can access to
   network edge servers and store content to them, or edge servers
   retrieve content from content provider, but client nodes just can
   retrieve content from edge servers.

4.4.3.  Data Management Operations

   Content Provider can manage the data distributed in different cache
   nodes, such as moving one hot data from one cache node to another
   cache node, or deleting one rarely-accessed data in one cache node,
   but client user nodes have no right to perform these operations.

4.4.4.  Data Search Capability

   Content provider can search or enumerate what data each cache node
   hold, but client user nodes have no right to perform these
   operations.

4.4.5.  Access Control Authorization

   All methods of access control are supported: public-unrestricted,
   public-restricted and private.  Some CDN edge servers will allow
   usage of HTTP basic authentication with the origin server,
   restrictions by IP address, or they can use a token-based technique
   to allow the origin server to apply its own authorization criteria.

4.4.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

4.4.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   Content providers can directly find internal CDN cache nodes to store
   content, since they typically have an explicit business relationship.
   Clients can locate CDN nodes through DNS or other redirection
   mechanism.

4.4.8.  Storage Mode

   A file-based storage mode is typically used.  In most cases, CDN
   cache nodes cache the entire file from content provider, and
   sometimes they also can only cache some objects, such as file prefix
   or file suffix.

4.5.  Delay-Tolerant Network

   The Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) [9] is an evolution of an
   architecture originally designed for the Interplanetary Internet.
   The Interplanetary Internet is a communication system envisioned to
   provide Internet-like services across interplanetary distances in
   support of deep space exploration.  The DTN architecture can be
   utilized in various operational environments characterized by severe
   communication disruptions, disconnections and high-delays (e.g. a
   month long loss of connectivity between two planetary networks
   because of high solar radiation due to sun spots).  The DTN
   architecture is thus suitable for environments including deep space
   networks, sensor-based networks, certain satellite networks and
   underwater acoustic networks.

   A key aspect of the DTN is a store and forward overlay layer called
   the "Bundle Protocol" or "Bundle Layer" that exists between the
   transport and application layers [10].  The Bundle Layer forms a
   logical overlay that employs persistent storage to help combat long
   term network interruptions by providing a store and forwarding
   service.  While traditional IP networks are also based on store and
   forward principles, the amount of time of a packet being kept in
   "storage" at a traditional IP router is typically in the order of
   milli-seconds (or less).  In contrast, the DTN architecture assumes
   that most Bundle Layer nodes will use some form of persistent storage
   (e.g. hard disk, flash memory, etc.) for DTN packets because of the
   nature of the DTN enviroment.

4.5.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   An example of an experimental in-network storage system that would
   require fundamental changes to the Internet protocols.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


4.5.2.  Data Access Interface

   Users implicitly cause content to be stored (until successfully
   forwarded) at Bundle Layer nodes by iniating/terminating any
   transaction that traverses the DTN.

4.5.3.  Data Management Operations

   Users can implicitly cause deletion of content stored at Bundle Layer
   nodes via a "Time To Live" type parameter that the user can control
   (for transactions originating from the user).

4.5.4.  Data Search Capability

   Not applicable.

4.5.5.  Access Control Authorization

   Access control method is public-restricted (to any client which is
   part of the DTN) or private.

4.5.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

4.5.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) approach is used as the basis of
   the addressing scheme for DTN transactions (and subsequent store and
   forward routing through the DTN network).

4.5.8.  Storage Mode

   DTN applications send data to the Bundle Layer which then breaks the
   data into segments.  These segments are then routed through the DTN
   network, and stored in Bundle Layer nodes as required (before being
   forwarded).

4.6.  Named Data Networking

   Named Data Networking (NDN) [11] is a research initiative which
   proposes to move to a new model of addressing and routing for the
   Internet.  NDN uses "named data" based routing and forwarding, to
   replace the current IP address based model.  NDN also uses named
   based data caching in the routers.

   Each NDN Data packet will be assigned a content name and will be
   cryptographically signed.  Data delivery is driven by the requesting



Alimi, et al.             Expires June 18, 2011                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


   end.  Routers disseminate name based prefix announcements by using
   routing protocols like Intermediate System to Intermediate System
   (IS-IS) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  The requester will send
   out an "Interest" packet which identifies the name of the data that
   it wants.  Routers that receive this Interest packet will remember
   the interface it came from and will then forward it on a named-based
   routing protocol.  Once an Interest packet reaches a node that has
   the desired data, a named Data packet is sent back, which carries
   both the name and content of the data, along with a digital signature
   of the producer.  This named Data packet is then forwarded back to
   the original requester on the reverse path of the Interest packet
   [12].

   A key aspect of NDN is that router have the capability to cache the
   named data.  If a request for the same data (i.e. same name) comes to
   the router, then the NDN router will forward the named data stored
   locally to fulfill the request.  Current communication theory is
   based on the capacity of a point-to-point channel (i.e.  Shannon's
   law).  The proponents of NDN believe that the network can be designed
   naturally matching data delivery characteristics instead of
   communication between endpoints because data delivery has become the
   primary use of the network.

4.6.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   An example of an experimental in-network storage sysem that would
   require storage space on a large number of routers in the Internet.
   Named Data packets would be kept in storage in the NDN routers and
   provided to new requesters of the same data.

4.6.2.  Data Access Interface

   Users implicitly store content at NDN routers by requesting content
   (named Data packets) from the network.  Subsequent requests by
   different users for the same content will cause the named Data
   packets to be read from the NDN routers in-network storage.

4.6.3.  Data Management Operations

   Users do not have the direct ability to delete content stored in the
   NDN routers.  However, there will be some type of "Time To Live"
   parameter associated with the named Data packets though this has not
   yet been specified.

4.6.4.  Data Search Capability

   Not applicable.

4.6.5.  Access Control Authorization

   All methods of access control are supported: public-unrestricted,
   public-restricted and private.

   The basic security mechanism in NDN is for the sender to digitally
   sign the content (named Data packet) that it sends.  It is envisioned
   that a complete access control system can be built on top of this
   though this has not yet been specified.

4.6.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

4.6.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   Names are used as the basis of the addressing and discovery scheme
   for NDN (and subsequent store and forward routing through the NDN
   network).  NDN names are assumed to be hierarchical and to be able to
   be deterministically constructed.  This is still an active area of
   research.

4.6.8.  Storage Mode

   NDN sends named Data packets through the network.  These Data packets
   are routed through the NDN network, and stored in NDN routers.

4.7.  Network of Information

   Similar to NDN (see Section 4.6), Network of Information (NetInf)
   [13] is another information centric approach in which the named data
   objects are the basic component of the networking architecture.
   NetInf is thus moving away from today's host centric networking
   architecture where the nodes in the network are the primary objects.
   In today's network the information objects are named relative to the
   hosts they are stored on (e.g.
   http://123.345.678.90/informaionobject.txt).

   The NetInf naming and security framework builds the foundation for an
   information-centric security model that integrates security deeply
   into the architecture.  In this model, trust is based on the
   information itself.  Information objects are given a unique name with
   cryptographic properties.  Together with additional metadata, the
   name can be used to verify the data integrity as well as several
   other security properties, like self-certification, name persistency,
   and owner authentication and identification.  The approach also gives
   some benefits over the security model in today's host-centric
   networks, as it minimizes the need for trust in the infrastructure,



Alimi, et al.             Expires June 18, 2011                [Page 16]

   including the hosts providing the data, the channel, or the
   resolution service.

   In NetInf the information objects are published into the network.
   They are registered with a Name Resolution Service (NRS).  The NRS is
   also used to register network locators that can be ued to retrieve
   data objects that represent the published information objects (IO).
   When a receiver wants to retrieve an IO the request for the IO is
   resolved by the NRS into a set of locators.  These locators are then
   used to retrieve a copy of the data object from the "best" available
   source(s).  NetInf is open to use any type of underlying transport
   networks.  The locators can thus be a heterogeneous set, e.g.  IPv4,
   IPv6, MAC, etc.

   NetInf will make extensive use of caching of information objects in
   the network and will provide network functionality that is similar to
   what overlay solutions like Content Distribution Networks (CDN) and
   p2p distribution networks (e.g.  BitTorrent) provide today.

4.7.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   An example of an experimental information centric network
   architecture that will require storage space for storage and caching
   of information objects on a large number of NetInf nodes in the
   Internet.

4.7.2.  Data Access Interface

   Users will publish information objects (IO) with specific IDs into
   the network.  When users wishes to retrieve an IO they will use the
   ID make a request for the IO.  ID is resolved by the NRS and the IO
   is delivered from a nearby in-network storage location.

4.7.3.  Data Management Operations

   Users do not have the direct ability to delete content stored in the
   NetInf nodes.  However, there can be some type of "Time To Live"
   parameter associated with the information objects though this has not
   yet been specified.

4.7.4.  Data Search Capability

   Not provided.

4.7.5.  Access Control Authorization

   All methods of access control are supported: public-unrestricted,

   NetInf is for the publisher to digitally sign the content of the
   information object that it publish.  It is envisioned that a complete
   access control system can be built on top of this though this has not
   yet been specified.

4.7.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

4.7.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   NetInf IDs are used for naming and accessing information objects.
   The IDs are resolved by the NRS into locators that are used for
   routing and transport of data through the transport networks.  This
   is still an active area of research.

4.7.8.  Storage Mode

   From an application perspective NetInf can be used for publishing
   entire files or chunks of files.  NetInf is agnostic to the
   application perspective and treats everything as information objects.

4.8.  Network Traffic Redundancy Elimination

   Redundancy Elimination (RE) (e.g., [14]) is used for identifying and
   removing repeated content from network transfers.  This technique has
   been proposed to improve network performance in many types of
   networks, such as ISP backbones and enterprise access links.  One
   example of redundancy elimination proposal is SmartRE, proposed by
   Anand et al., which focuses on network-wide redundancy elimination.
   In packet-level redundancy elimination, forwarding elements are
   equipped with additional storage which can be used to cache data from
   forwarded packets.  Upstream routers may replace packet data with a
   fingerprint that tells a downstream router how to decode and
   reconstruct the packet based on cached data.

4.8.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   An example of an experimental in-network storage sysem that would
   require a large amount of associated packet processing at routers if
   it was ever deployed.

4.8.2.  Data Access Interface

   Redundancy-elimination are typically transparent to the user.
   Writing into the storage is done by transferring data that has not
   already been cached.  Storage is read when users transmit data
   identical to previously-transmitted data.

4.8.5.  Access Control Authorization

   Access control method is public-restricted (to any client which is
   part of the RE nework).  Note that the content provider still retains
   control over which peers receive the requested data.  The returned
   data is simple "compressed" as it is transferred within the network.

4.8.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.  The content provider still retains control over the
   rate at which packets are sent to a peer.  The packet size within the
   network may be reduced.

4.8.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   No discovery mechanism is necessary.  Routers can use redundancy-
   elimination without the users' knowledge.

4.8.8.  Storage Mode

   Object-based, with "objects" being data from packets transmitted
   within the network.

4.9.  OceanStore

   OceanStore [15] is a storage platform developed at UC Berkeley that
   provides globally-distributed storage.  OceanStore implements a model
   where multiple storage providers can pool resources together.  Thus,
   a major focus is on resiliency and self-organization and self-
   maintenance.

   The protocol is resilient to some storage nodes being compromised by
   utilizing Byzantine agreement and erasure codes to store data at
   primary replicas.

4.9.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   An example of an experimental in-network storage sysem that provides
   a high degree of network resilience to failure scenarios.

4.9.8.  Storage Mode

   Object-based, though interfaces have been provided for NFS and HTTP.

4.10.  Photo Sharing

   There are a growing number of popular on line Photo Sharing (storing)
   systems.  For example, the Kodak Gallery system [16] serves over 60
   million users and stores billions of images [17].  Other well known
   examples of Photo Sharing systems include Flickr [18] and ImageShack
   [19].  Also there are a number of popular blogging services, such as
   Tumblr [20], which specialize in also sharing large numbers of photos
   and other mulitmedia content (e.g. video, text, audio, etc.) as part
   of their service.  All these in-network storage systems utilize both
   free and paid subscription models.

   Most Photo Sharing systems are traditional client-server
   architecture.  However, a minority of systems also offer a P2P mode
   of operation.  The client-server architecture traditionally is based
   on HTTP with a browser client and a web server.

   Access control method is typically either private or public-
   unrestricted.

4.10.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   Usually by manually logging on to a central web page for the service
   and entering the appropriate information to access the desired
   information.

4.10.8.  Storage Mode

   Photos are usually stored as files.  They can then be organized into
   meta-structures (e.g. albums, galleries, etc.) using sophisticated
   web photo album generators.

4.11.  P2P Cache

   Caching of P2P traffic is a useful approach to reduce P2P network
   traffic, because objects in P2P systems are mostly immutable and the
   traffic is highly repetitive.  In addition, making use of P2P caches
   do not require changes to P2P protocols and can be deployed
   transparently from clients.



Alimi, et al.             Expires June 18, 2011                [Page 21]

   P2P caches operate similarly to web caches, in that they temporarily
   store frequently-requested content.  Requests for content already
   stored in the cache can be served from local storage instead of
   requiring the data to be transmitted over expensive network links.

   Two types of P2P caches exist: non-transparent P2P caches and
   transparent P2P caches.  A non-transparent cache appears as a super
   peer; it explicitly peers with other P2P clients.  For a transparent
   cache, once a P2P cache is established, the network will
   transparently redirect P2P traffic to the cache, which either serves
   the file directly or passes the request on to a remote P2P user and
   simultaneously caches that data.  Transparency is typically
   implemented using deep packet inspection (DPI).  DPI products
   identify and pass P2P packets to the P2P caching system so it can
   cache the traffic and accelerate it.

   To enable operation with existing P2P software, P2P caches directly
   support P2P application protocols.  A large number of P2P protocols
   are used by P2P software, and hence are supported by caches, leading
   to higher complexity.  Additionally, these protocols evolve over
   time, and new protocols are introduced.

   systems.  The existance and operation of the storage is totally
   transparent to the end user.

4.11.2.1.  Data Access Interface

   Data Access Interface allows P2P content to be cached (stored) and
   supplied (retrieved) locally such that network traffic is reduced,
   but it is transparent to P2P users, and P2P users implicitly use the
   data-access interface (in the form of their native P2P application
   protocol) to store or retrieve content.

4.11.3.6.  Discovery Mechanism

   Other P2P users can find these cache nodes through overlay routing
   mechanism, just looking to them as normal neighbor nodes.

4.11.3.7.  Storage Mode

   Object-based.  Chunks (typically, the unit of transfer amongst P2P
   clients) of content are stored in the cache.

4.12.  Usenet

   Usenet is a distributed Internet based discussion (message) system.
   The Usenet messages are arranged as a set of "newsgroups" that are
   classified hierarchically by subject.  Usenet information is
   distributed and stored among a large conglomeration of servers that
   store and forward messages to one another in so called news feeds.
   Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local
   news server typically operated by an ISP.  This local server
   communicates with other servers and exchanges articles with them.  In
   this fashion, the message is copied from server to server and
   eventually reaches every server in the network [21].

   Traditional Usenet as described above operates as a P2P network
   between the servers, and in a client-server architecture between the
   user and their local news server.  The user requires a Usenet client
   to be installed on their computer and a Usenet server account
   (through their ISP).  However, with the rise of web browsers the
   Usenet architecture is evolving to be web based.  The most popular
   example of this is Google Groups where Google hosts all the
   newsgroups and client access is via a standard HTTP based web browser
   [22].

4.12.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   A historically very important and widely used (deployed) example of
   in-network storage in the Internet.  The use of this system is
   rapidly declining but efforts have been made to preserve the stored
   content for historical purposes.

   Users can read and post (store) messages.

4.12.3.  Data Management Operations

   Users sometimes have limited ability to delete messages that they
   previously posted.

4.12.4.  Data Search Capability

   Traditionally, users could manually search through the newsgroups as
   they are classified hierarchically by subject.  In the newer web
   based systems there is also automatic search capability based on key
   word matches.

4.12.5.  Access Control Authorization

   Access control method is either public-unrestricted or private (to
   members of that newsgroup).

4.12.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

4.12.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   Usually by manually logging on to the Usenet account.

4.12.8.  Storage Mode

   Messages are usually stored as files which are then organized
   hierarchically by subject into newsgroups.

4.13.  Web Cache

   Web cache [23] is a well-built technology since the late 1990s, which
   has been widely deployed by many ISPs to reduce bandwidth consumption
   and web access latency.  A web cache can cache the web documents
   (e.g., HTML pages, images) between server and client to reduce
   bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag.  A web cache server
   is typically shared by many clients, and stores copies of documents
   passing through it; subsequent requests may be satisfied from the
   cache if certain conditions are met.

   Another form of cache is a client-side cache, typically implemented
   in web browsers.  A client side cache can keep a local copy of all
   pages recently displayed by browser, and when the user returns to one
   of these web pages, the local cached copy is reused.

   A related protocol for P2P applications to use web cache is HPTP
   (HTTP based Peer to Peer) [24].  It proposes to share chunks of P2P

   files/streams using HTTP protocol with cache-control headers.

4.13.1.  Applicability to DECADE

   Very widely used (deployed) example of in-network storage for the key
   Internet application of Web browsing.  The existance and operation of
   the storage is transparent to the end user in most cases.  The
   content caching time is controlled by Time To Live parameters
   associated with the original content.  The principle of web caching
   is to speed up web page reading by using (the same) content
   previously requested by a preceding user to service a new user.

4.13.2.  Data Access Interface

   Users explicitly read from a web cache by making requests, but they
   cannot explicitly write data into it.  Data is implicitly stored into
   the web cache by requesting content that not already cached and meets
   policy restrictions of the cache provider.

4.13.3.  Data Management Operations

   Not provided.

4.13.4.  Data Search Capability

   Not provided.

4.13.5.  Access Control Authorization

   Access control method is public-unrestricted for stored content.  It
   is important to note that if content is authenticated or encrypted
   (e.g.  HTTPS, SSL) it will not be cached.  Also if the content is
   flagged as private (vs public) at the HTTP level by the origin server
   it will not be cached.

4.13.6.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

4.13.7.  Discovery Mechanism

   Web Caches can be transparently deployed between Web Server and Web
   Clients, employing DPI for discovery.  Alternatively, web caches
   could be explicitly discovered by clients using techniques such as
   DNS or manual configuration.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


4.13.8.  Storage Mode

   Object based.  Web content is keyed within the cache by HTTP Request
   fields, such as Method, URI, and Headers.

4.14.  Observations Regarding In-Network Storage Systems

   The majority of the surveyed systems were designed for client-server
   architectures and do not support P2P. However, there are some
   important exceptions, especially for some of the newer technologies
   such as BranchCache and P2P Cache which do support a P2P mode.

   The P2P cache systems are interesting since they do not require
   changes to P2P applications themselves.  However, this is also a
   limitation in that they are required to support each application
   protocol.

   Many of the surveyed systems were designed for caching as opposed to
   long term network storage.  Thus during DECADE protocol design it
   should be carefully considered if a caching mode should be supported
   in addition to a network storage mode.  There is typically a trade-
   off between providing a caching mode and long-term (and usually also
   reliable) storage with regards to some performance metrics.

   Today, most in-network storage systems follow some variant of the
   authorization model of public-unrestricted, public-restricted, and
   private.  For DECADE, we may need to evolve the authorization model
   to support a resource owner (e.g. end user) authorization, in
   addition to the network authorization.


5.  Storage And Other Related Protocols

   This section surveys existing storage and other related protocols, as
   well as comments on the usage of these protocols to satisfy DECADE's
   use cases.  The surveyed protocols are listed alphabetically.

5.1.  iSCSI

   Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a set of protocols enabling
   communication with storage devices such as disk drives and tapes;
   internet SCSI (iSCSI) [25] is a protocol enabling SCSI commands to be
   sent over TCP.  As in SCSI, iSCSI allows an Initiator to send
   commands to a Target.  These commands operate on the device level as
   opposed to individual data objects stored on the device.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


5.1.1.  Data Access Interface

   Read and write commands indicate which data is to be read or written
   by specifying the offset (using Logical Block Addressing) into the
   storage device.  The size of data to be read or written is an
   additional parameter in the command.

5.1.2.  Data Management Operations

   Since commands operate at the device level, management operations are
   different than with traditional file systems.  Management commands
   for SCSI/iSCSI including explicit device control such as starting and
   stopping the device and formatting the device.

5.1.3.  Data Search Capability

   SCSI/iSCSI does not provide the ability to search for particular data
   within a device.  Note that such capabilities can be implemented
   outside of iSCSI.

5.1.4.  Access Control Authorization

   With respect to access to devices, the access control method is
   private. iSCSI uses CHAP [26] to authenticate initiators and targets
   when accessing storage devices.  However, since SCSI/iSCSI operates
   at the device level, neither authentication nor authorization are
   provided for individual data objects.  Note that such capabilities
   can be implemented outside of iSCSI.

5.1.5.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

5.1.6.  Discovery Mechanism

   Manual configuration may be used.  An alternative is the internet
   Storage Name Service (iSNS) [27] provides the ability to discover
   available storage resources.

5.1.7.  Storage Mode

   Block-based.  SCSI/iSCSI provides an Initiator block-level access to
   the storage device.

5.2.  HTTP

   HTTP [28] is a key protocol for the World Wide Web. It is a stateless
   client-server protocol that allows applications to be designed using



Alimi, et al.             Expires June 18, 2011                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


   the Representational State Transfer (REST) model.  HTTP is often
   associated with downloading (reading) content from web servers to web
   browsers, but it also has support for uploading (writing) of content
   to web servers.  It has been used as the underlying protocol for
   other protocols such as WebDAV.

   HTTP is used in some of the most popular in-network storage systems
   surveyed previously including CDNs, Photo Sharing, and Web Cache.
   Usage of HTTP by a storage protocol implies that no extra SW is
   required in the client (i.e. web based client) as all standard Web
   browsers are based on HTTP.

5.2.1.  Data Access Interface

   Basic read and write operations are supported (using HTTP GET, PUT
   and POST methods).

5.2.2.  Data Management Operations

   Not provided.

5.2.3.  Data Search Capability

   Not provided

5.2.4.  Access Control Authorization

   All methods of access control are supported: public-unrestricted,
   public-restricted and private.

   The great majority of web pages are public-unrestricted in terms of
   reading but do not allow any uploading of content (i.e. are not in-
   storage systems).  In-storage systems range from private or public-
   unrestricted for Photo Sharing described in Section 4.10.5 to public-
   unrestricted for Web Caching described in Section 4.13.5.

5.2.5.  Resource Control Interface

   Not provided.

5.2.6.  Discovery Mechanism

   Manual configuration is typically used.  Clients address HTTP servers
   by providing a hostname.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


5.2.7.  Storage Mode

   File-based storage (a non-collection resource can typically be
   thought of as a "file").  Files may be organized into collections,
   which typically map on to the HTTP Path hierarchy.

5.2.8.  Comments

   HTTP is based on a client-server architecture and thus is not
   directly applicable for the DECADE focus on P2P. Also, HTTP offers
   only a rudimentary toolset for storage operations compared to some of
   the other storage protocols.

5.3.  NFS

   The Network File System is designed to allow users to access files
   over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed.
   NFS is typically used in local area network or enterprise settings,
   though changes made in later versions of NFS make it easier to
   operate over the Internet.

5.3.1.  Data Access Interface

   Traditional file-system operations such as read, write, and update
   (overwrite) are provided.  Locking is provided to support concurrent
   access by multiple clients.

5.3.2.  Data Management Operations

   Traditional file-system operations such as move and delete are
   provided.

5.3.3.  Data Search Capability

   User has the ability to list contents of directories to find
   filenames matching desired criteria.

5.3.4.  Access Control Authorization

   All methods of access control are supported: public-unrestricted,
   public-restricted and private.  For example, files and directories
   can be protected using read, write, and execute permissions for the
   files owner, group, and the public (others).  Also, NFSv4.1 has a
   rich ACL model allowing a list of Access Control Entries (ACEs) to be
   configured for each file or directory.  The ACEs can specify per-user
   read/write access to file data, file/directory attributes, creation/
   deletion of files in a directory, etc.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


5.3.5.  Resource Control Interface

   While disk space quotas can be configured, it typically limits the
   total amount of storage allocated to a particular user.  User control
   of bandwidth and connections used by remote peers is not provided.

5.3.6.  Discovery Mechanism

   Manual configuration is typically used.  Clients address NFS servers
   by providing a hostname and a directory that should be mounted.

5.3.7.  Storage Mode

   File-based storage, allowing files to be organized into directories.

5.3.8.  Comments

   The efficiency and scalability of the NFS access control method is a
   concern in the context of DECADE.  In particular, Section 6.2.1 of
   [29] states that:

       Only ACEs that have a "who" that matches the requester
       are considered.

   Thus, in the context of DECADE, to specify per-peer access control
   policies for an object, a client would need to explicitly configure
   the ACL for the object for each individual peer.  A concern with this
   approach is scalability when a client's peers may change frequently
   and ACLs for many small objects need to be updated constantly during
   participation in a swarm.

   Note that NFS v4.1's usage of RPCSEC_GSS provides support for
   multiple security mechanisms.  Kerberos V5 is required, but others
   such as X.509 Certificates are also supported by way of GSS-API.
   Note, however, that NFSv4.1's usage of such security mechanisms is
   limited to linking a requesting user to a particular account
   maintained by the NFS server.

5.4.  OAuth

   OAuth [30] is a protocol that richens the traditional client-server
   authentication model for web resources.  In particular, OAuth
   distinguishes the "client" from the "resource owner", thus enabling a
   resource owner to authorize a particular client for access (e.g., for
   a particular lifetime) to private resources.

   We include OAuth in this survey so that its authentication model can
   be evaluated in the context of DECADE.  OAuth itself, however, is not

   a a network storage protocol.

5.4.1.  Data Access Interface

   Not applicable.

5.4.2.  Data Management Operations

   Not applicable.

5.4.3.  Data Search Capability

   Not applicable.

5.4.4.  Access Control Authorization

   Not applicable.  While similar in spirit to the WebDAV ticketing
   extensions [31], OAuth instead uses the following process: (1) a
   client constructs a delegation request, (2) the client forwards the
   request to the resource owner for authorization, (3) the resource
   owner authorizes the request, and finally (4) a callback is made to
   the client indicating that its request has been authorized.

   Once the process is complete, the client has a set of token
   credentials that grant it access to the protected resource.  The
   token credentials may have an expiration time, and they can also be
   revoked by the resource owner at any time.

5.4.5.  Resource Control Interface

   Not applicable.

5.4.6.  Discovery Mechanism

   Not applicable.

5.4.7.  Storage Mode

   Not applicable.

5.4.8.  Comments

   The ticketing mechanism requires server involvement and the
   discussion relating to WebDAV's proposed ticketing mechanism (see
   Section 5.5.8) applies here as well.

5.5.  WebDAV

   WebDAV [32] is a protocol designed for Web content authoring.  It is
   developed as an extension to HTTP described in Section 5.2, meaning
   it can be simpler to integrate into existing software.  WebDAV
   supports traditional operations for reading/writing from storage, as
   well as other constructs such as locking and collections which are
   important when multiple users collaborate to author or edit a set of
   documents.

5.5.1.  Data Access Interface

   Traditional read and write operations are supported (using HTTP GET
   and PUT methods, respectively).  Locking is provided to ease
   concurrent access by multiple clients.

5.5.2.  Data Management Operations

   WebDAV supports traditional file-system operations such as move,
   delete and copy.  Objects are organized into collections, and these
   operations can also be performed on collections.  WebDAV also allows
   objects to have user-defined properties.

5.5.3.  Data Search Capability

   User has the ability to list contents of collections to find objects
   matching desired criteria.  A SEARCH extension [33] has also been
   specified allowing listing of objects matching client-defined
   criteria.

5.5.4.  Access Control Authorization

   All methods of access control are supported: public-unrestricted,
   public-restricted and private.

   For example, an ACL extension [34] is provided for WebDAV.  ACLs
   allow both user- and group-based access control policies (relating to
   reading, writing, properties, locking, etc) to be defined for objects
   and collections.

   A ticketing extension [31] has also been proposed, but has not
   progressed passed an Internet Draft.  This extension allows a client
   to request the WebDAV server to create a "ticket" (e.g., for reading
   an object) that can be distributed to other clients.  Tickets may be
   given expiration times, or may only allow for a fixed number of uses.
   The proposed extension requires the server to generate tickets and
   maintain state for outstanding tickets.

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


5.5.5.  Resource Control Interface

   An extension [35] allows disk space quotas to be configured for
   Collections.  The extension also allows WebDAV clients to query
   current disk space usage.  User control of bandwidth and connections
   used by remote peers is not provided.

5.5.6.  Discovery Mechanism

   Manual configuration is typically used.  Clients address WebDAV
   servers by providing a hostname.

5.5.7.  Storage Mode

   File-based storage (a non-collection resource can typically be
   thought of as a "file").  Files may be organized into collections,
   which typically map on to the HTTP Path hierarchy.

5.5.8.  Comments

   The efficiency and scalability of the WebDAV access control method is
   a concern in the context of DECADE, for similar reasons as stated in
   Section 5.3.8 for NFS.  The proposed WebDAV ticketing extension
   partially alleviates this concern, but the particular technique may
   need further evaluation before being applied to DECADE.  In
   particular, since DECADE clients may continuously upload/download a
   large number of small-size objects, and a single DECADE server may
   need to scale to many concurrent DECADE clients, requiring the server
   to maintain ticket state and generate tickets may not be the best
   design choice.  Server-generated tickets can also increase latency
   for data transport operations depending on the message flow used by
   DECADE.

5.6.  Observations Regarding Storage and Related Protocols

   All of the surveyed protocols were primarily designed for client-
   server architectures and not for P2P. However, it is conceivable that
   some of the protocols could be adapted to work in a P2P architecture.

   Several popular in-network storage systems today use HTTP as their
   key protocol even though it is not classicaly considered as a storage
   protocol.  HTTP is a stateless protocol that is used to design
   RESTful applications.  HTTP is a well supported and widely
   implemented protocol which can provide important insights for DECADE.

   The majority of the surveyed protocols do not support low latency
   access for applications such as live streaming.  This was one of the
   key general requirements for DECADE.



Alimi, et al.             Expires June 18, 2011                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft                DECADE Survey                December 2010


   The majority of the surveyed protocols do not support any form of
   resource control interface.  Resource control is required for users
   to manage the resources on in-network storage that can be used by
   other peers, e.g., the bandwidth or connections.  Resource control is
   a key capability required for DECADE.

   Nearly all surveyed protocols did however support the following
   capabilites which are required for DECADE: user ability to read/write
   content; some form of access control; some form of error indication;
   and ability to traverse firewalls and NATs.


6.  Conclusions

   Though there have been many successful in-network storage systems,
   they have been designed for use cases different from those defined in
   DECADE.  For example, many of the surveyed in-network storage systems
   and protocols were desgined for client-server architectures and not
   P2P. No surveyed system or protocol has the functionality and
   features to fully meet the set of requirements defined for DECADE.
   DECADE aims to provide a standard protocol for P2P applications and
   content provider to access and control in-network storage, resulting
   in increased network efficiency while retaining control over content
   shared with peers.  Additionally, defining a standard protocol can
   reduce complexity of in-network storage since multiple P2P
   application protocols no longer need to be implemented by in-network
   storage systems.


7.  Security Considerations

   This draft is a survey of existing in-network storage systems, and
   does not introduce any security considerations beyond those of the
   surveyed systems.
