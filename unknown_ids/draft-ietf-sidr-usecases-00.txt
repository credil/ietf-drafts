Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and interpretations          June 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document provides suggested use cases, directions, and
   interpretations for organizations and relying parties when creating
   or encountering RPKI object scenarios in the public RPKI in relation
   to the Internet routing system.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], "A Profile
   for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates" [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs]
   "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], "A
   Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)"
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format], "Validation of Route Origination in BGP
   using the Resource Certificate PKI" [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation],

1.2.  Definitions

   The following definitions are in use in this document.

   Autonomous System - A network under a single technical administration
   that presents a consistent picture of what destinations are reachable
   through it.

   Autonomous System Number (ASN) - An officially registered number
   representing an autonomous system.

   Prefix - A network address and an integer that specifies the length
   of a mask to be applied to the address to represent a set of
   numerically adjacent addresses.

   Route - A prefix and a sequence of one or more autonomous system
   numbers.

   Origin AS - The Autonomous System, designated by an ASN, which
   originates a route.  Seen as the "First" ASN in a route

   Specific route - A route that has a longer prefix than an aggregate.

   Aggregate route - A more general route in the presence of a specific
   route.

   Covering Aggregate - A route that covers one or more specific routes.

   Multi-homed - An Autonomous System that is connected, and announces
   routes, to one or more Autonomous Systems

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and interpretations          June 2010


   Resource - Internet (IP) addresses or Autonomous System Number.

   Allocation - The set of resources provided to an entity or
   organization for its use.

   Sub-allocation - The set of a resources subordinate to an allocation
   assigned to another entity or organization.

   Transit Provider - An Autonomous System that carries traffic that
   neither originates nor is the destination of that traffic.

   Upstream - See "Transit Provider".

   Child - A Sub-allocation that has resulted from an Allocation

   Parent - An allocation from which the subject prefix is a Child

   Grandchild - A Sub-allocation from or more previous Sub-allocations.

   Grandparent - The allocation from which the prefix is a Grandchild.

   Update prefix - The prefix seen in a routing update

   ROA prefix - The prefix described in a ROA

   Covering Prefix - The ROA Prefix is an exact match or a less specific
   when compared to the update prefix.

   No relevant ROA - No ROA exists that has a covering prefix for the
   update prefix.

   No other relevant ROA - No other ROA (besides any that is(are)
   already cited) that has a covering prefix for the update prefix

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Overview

2.1.  General interpretation of RPKI object semantics

   It is important that in the interpretation of relying parties (RP),
   or relying party routing software, that a 'make before break' stance
   is applied.  This means that a RP should implement a routing decision



Manderson, et al.       Expires December 23, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and interpretations          June 2010


   process where a routing update ("route") is assumed to be intended
   unless proven otherwise by the existence of a valid RPKI object.  For
   all of the cases in this document it is assumed that RPKI objects
   validate (or otherwise) in accordance with [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs],
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation] unless otherwise
   stated.

   While many of the examples provided here illustrate organizations
   using their own autonomous system numbers to originate routes, it
   should be recognised that a prefix holder need not necessarily be the
   holder of the autonomous system number used for the route
   origination.


3.  Origination Use Cases

   This section deals with the various use cases where an orgnaistion
   has Internet resources and will announce routes to the Internet.  It
   is based on operational observations of the existing routing system.

3.1.  Single Announcement

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   192.168.2.0/24.  It wishes to announce the /24 prefix from ASN 64496
   such that relying parties interpret the route as intended.

   The desired announcement (and organization) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   | Organization |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 192.168.2.0/24  | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.2.  Aggregate with a More Specific

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  It wishes to announce the more specific prefix
   10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496 as well as the aggregate route such that
   relying parties interpret the routes as intended.

   The desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   | Organization |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.3.  Aggregate with a More Specific from a Different ASN

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496 and ASN 64499) has been
   allocated the prefix 10.1.0.0/16.  It wishes to announce the more
   specific prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64499 as well as the aggregate
   route from ASN 64496 such that relying parties interpret the routes
   as intended.

   The desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64499     |  Org A      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.4.  Sub-allocation to a Multi-homed Customer

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16, it wishes to announce the more specific prefix
   10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496.  It has further delegated 10.1.16.0/20 to
   a customer (Org B with ASN 64511) who is multi-homed and will
   originate the prefix route from ASN 64511.  ASN 64496 will also
   announce the aggregate route such that relying parties interpret the
   routes as intended.

   The desirable announcements (and organization) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.16.0/20    | AS64511     |  Org B      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing parties would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.5.  Restriction of a New Allocation

   An organization has recently been allocated the prefix 10.1.0.0/16.
   Its network deployment is not yet ready to announce the prefix and
   wishes to restrict all possible announcements of 10.1.0.0/16 and more
   specifics in routing using RPKI.

   The following announcements would be considered undesirable:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      | 10.1.17.0/24    | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.6.  Restriction of New ASN

   An organization has recently been allocated an additional 4 byte ASN
   65551.  Its network deployment is not yet ready to use this ASN and
   wishes to restrict all possible uses of ASN 65551 using RPKI.

   The following announcements would be considered undesirable:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | ANY             | AS65551     |  ANY        |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.7.  Restriction of a Part of an Allocation

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  Its network topology permits the announcement of
   10.1.0.0/17 and the /16 aggregate.  However it wishes to restrict any
   possible announcement of 10.1.128.0/17 or more specifics of that /17
   using RPKI.

   The desired announcements would be:

   The issuing party would create the following RPKI objects: TBC

3.8.  Restriction of Prefix Length

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16, it wishes to announce the aggregate and any or all more
   specific prefixes up to and including a maximum length of /20, but
   never any more specific than a /20.

   Examples of the desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/17     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      |     ...         | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.128.0/20   | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The following announcements would be considered undesirable:

3.9.  Restriction of Sub-allocation Prefix Length

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16, it sub-allocates several /20 prefixes to its multi-homed
   customers Org B with ASN 65551, and Org C with ASN 64499.  It wishes
   to restrict those customers from advertising any corresponding routes
   more specific than a /22.

   The desired announcements would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |

4.  Adjacency Use Cases

   Issues regarding validation of adjacency, or path validation, are
   currently out of scope of the SIDR-WG charter.  The use cases is this
   section are listed here as a reminder that the work goes beyond
   origination and at the stage when origination has been addressed by
   the WG, a re-charter to encompass adjacency will allow consideration
   of these use cases.

4.1.  Multi-homed

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  Its upstreams transit providers are Transit A with ASN
   65551 and Transit B ASN 64499.  The organization announces the /16
   aggregate.  It permits that ASN 65551 and ASN 64499 may further pass
   on the aggregate route to their peers or upstreams.

   The following announcements and paths would be desired:

   10.1.0.0/16.  Its two upstreams are Transit X with ASN 65551 and
   Transit Y with ASN 64499.  The organization (ASN 64496) peers with a
   third AS, Peer Z with ASN 64511.  Org A announces the more specific
   10.1.0.0/24 and the /16 aggregate.  It wishes that only ASNs 65551
   and 64499 may announce the aggregate and more specifics to their
   upstreams.  ASN 64511, the peer, may not further announce (pass on,

7.  Relying Party Use Cases

7.1.  ROA Expiry or receipt of a CRL covering a ROA

   In the cases which follow, the terms "expired ROA" or "revoked ROA"
   are shorthand, and describe the appropriate revocation or expiry of
   EE or Resource Certificates that causes a relying party to consider
   the corresponding ROA to be viewed as expired or revoked.

7.1.1.  ROA of Parent Prefix is Revoked

   A certificate revocation list (CRL) is received which reveals that
   the ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/16; maxLength 24 with ASN64496
   is revoked.  Further, a prefix route exists in the Internet routing
   system for 10.1.4.0/24 originated from ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.2.  ROA of Prefix Revoked

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   A counter example: If there was simultaneously a valid ROA containing
   the (less specific) prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with ASN64496.
   (see Section 7.1.4)

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.3.  ROA of Grandparent Prefix Revoked while that of Parent Prefix
        Prevails

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   (Clarification: ROA for less specific grandparent prefix 10.1.0.0/16
   was withdrawn)

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.4.  ROA of Prefix Revoked while that of Parent Prefix Prevails

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   (Clarification: Perhaps the revocation of ROA for prefix 10.1.4.0/24
   was initiated just to eliminate redundancy)

7.1.5.  Expiry of ROA of Parent Prefix

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.6.  Expiry of ROA of Prefix

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

7.1.7.  Expiry of ROA of Grandparent Prefix while ROA of Parent Prefix
        Prevails

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   (Clarification: ROA for less specific grandparent prefix 10.1.0.0/16
   has expired.)

7.1.8.  Expiry of ROA of Prefix while ROA of Parent Prefix Prevails

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: TBC

   (Clarification: Perhaps the expiry of the ROA for prefix 10.1.4.0/24
   was meant to eliminate redundancy.)

7.2.  Prefix, Origin Validation use cases

   These use cases try to systematically enumerate the situations a
   relying party may encounter while receiving a BGP update and making
   use of ROA information to interpret the validity of the prefix-origin
   information in the update.  We enumerate the situations or scenarios
   but do not make a final recommendation on any RPKI interpretation.
   For work on development of prefix-origin validation algorithms, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation] and [I-D.pmohapat-sidr-pfx-validate].

7.2.1.  Covering ROA Prefix, Maxlength Satisfied, and AS Match

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxlength = 20, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/17, Origin = AS64496}

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: This is a straight forward prefix-origin validation use
   case; it follows from the primary intention of creation of ROA by a
   resource owner.

7.2.2.  Covering ROA Prefix, Maxlength Exceeded, and AS Match

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxlength = 20, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/22, Origin = AS64496}

   No other relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case the maxlength specified in the ROA is exceeded
   by the update prefix.

7.2.3.  Covering ROA Prefix, Maxlength Satisfied, and AS Mismatch:

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxlength = 24, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.88.0/24, Origin = AS65551}

   No other relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case an AS other than the one specified in the ROA
   is originating an update.  This may be a prefix or subprefix hijack
   situation.

7.2.4.  Covering ROA Prefix, Maxlength Exceeded, and AS Mismatch

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxlength = 22, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.88.0/24, Origin = AS65551}

   No other relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case the maxlength specified in the ROA is exceeded
   by the update prefix, and also an AS other than the one specified in
   the ROA is originating the update.  This may be a subprefix hijack
   situation.

7.2.5.  Covering ROA Prefix Not Found

   Update has {240.1.1.0/24, Origin = AS65551}

   No relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case there is no relevant ROA that has a covering
   prefix for the update prefix.  It could be a case of prefix or
   subprefix hijack situation, but this announcement does not contradict
   any existing ROA.  During partial deployment, there would be some
   legitimate prefix-origin announcements for which ROAs may not have
   been issued yet.

7.2.6.  Covering ROA Prefix Not Found but ROAs Exist for a Covering Set
        of More Specifics

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.64.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.128.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.192.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/16, Origin = AS64496}

   No relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case the update prefix is an aggregate, and it turns
   out that there exit ROAs for more specifics which, if combined, can
   help support validation of the announced prefix-origin pair.  But it
   is very hard in general to breakup an announced prefix into
   constituent more specifics and check for ROA coverage for those more
   specifics.

7.2.7.  Update has an AS Set as Origin and ROAs Exist for a Covering Set
        of More Specifics

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.64.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64497}

   ROA: {10.1.128.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64498}

   ROA: {10.1.192.0/18, maxlength = 20, AS64499}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/16, Origin = [AS64496, AS64497, AS64498,
   AS64497]}

   No relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: An extremely small percentage (~0.1%) of eBGP updates are
   seen to have AS set in them as origin; this is known as proxy
   aggregation.  In this case the aggregate of the prefixes in the ROAs
   is a covering prefix for the update prefix.  The ASs in each of the
   contributing ROAs together form a set that matches the AS set in the
   update.  But it is very hard in general to breakup an announced
   prefix into constituent more specifics and check for ROA coverage for
   those more specifics.

7.2.8.  Update has AS set, Aggregator AS Absent, and Covering ROA Prefix
        Not Found

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: Normally an update that has an AS set should contain an
   Aggregator attribute, but sometimes anomalously the aggregator AS
   attribute may be missing.  Normally one may expect to find a ROA
   which has a covering prefix and matches the Aggregator AS in the
   update.  But in this case, Aggregator AS is absent and also no
   covering ROA prefix is found.

7.2.9.  Update has AS set, Aggregator AS Absent, and Covering ROA Prefix

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case, a covering ROA prefix is found but Aggregator
   AS is absent.  This would appear to be a prefix or subprefix hijack
   situation.

7.2.10.  Update has AS set, Aggregator AS Present, and Covering ROA
         Prefix Not Found

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case, Aggregator AS is present but a covering ROA
   prefix is not found.

7.2.11.  Update has AS set, Aggregator AS Present, Covering ROA Prefix,
         and AS Mismatch

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case, Aggregator AS is present and a covering ROA
   prefix is found, but the AS in the ROA does not match the Aggregator
   AS.  This would appear to be a prefix or subprefix hijack situation.

7.2.12.  Update has AS set, Aggregator AS Present, Covering ROA Prefix,
         and AS Match

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: TBC

   Comment: In this case, Aggregator AS is present, a covering ROA
   prefix is found, and also the AS in the ROA matches the Aggregator
   AS.
