 Session Matching Update for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
                draft-ietf-simple-msrp-sessmatch-01.txt

Abstract

   This document updates the session matching procedure defined in
   section 7.3 of RFC 4975, so that an MSRP UA only uses the session-id
   part of the MSRP URI in order to perform the consistency checks.  The
   update allows intermediaries (ALGs) to modify the address information
   in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, without the need for the
   intermediaries to terminate and do the correlating modifications in
   the associated MSRP messages.

1.  Introduction

   MSRP [RFC4975] is designed to use MSRP relays [RFC4976] as a means
   for NAT traversal and policy enforcement.

   Many networks in which MSRP usage is emerging also contain generic
   ALGs, which might control media relays and perform tasks such as
   performance monitoring, lawful intercept, address domain bridging,
   interconnect SLA policy enforcement, etc.  An example here is the
   Interconnect Border Control Function (IBCF) [3GPP TS23.228] defined
   by 3GPP, which controls a media relay that handles all types of SIP
   session media (voice, video, MSRP, etc).

   Due to the fact that MSRP UAs check consistency between address
   information in the MSRP messages and in the SDP a=path attribute,
   this forces the IBCF/media relay to act as an SDP aware MSRP B2BUA,
   whereas for basically all other UDP and TCP transported based media
   sessions it can acts as an SDP aware Relay- NAPT - which is much
   simpler than having to act as an MSRP B2BUA.

   In order to use general NAT traversal methods and ALGs, this document
   updates the session matching procedures defined in section 7.3 of
   [RFC4975], so that MSRP endpoints only use the session-id part when
   they compare the MSRP URI in the SDP a=path attribute with the
   corresponding MSRP URI in MSRP messages.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability statement

   This document updates section 7.3 (Receiving Requests) of [RFC4975].
   An MSRP UA MUST implement the procedures defined in this document in
   order to interwork with remote MSRP UAs in a network where
   intermediaries might modify the address information in the MSRP URI
   of the SDP a=path attribute.

4.1.  General

   This section defines the updated text for section 7.3 (Receiving
   Requests) of [RFC4975].

4.2.  RFC4975: 7.3 Receiving Requests

   The receiving endpoint MUST first check the URI in the To-Path to
   make sure the request belongs to an existing session.  When the
   request is received, the To-Path will have exactly one URI, of which
   the session-id part MUST map to an existing session that is
   associated with the connection on which the request arrived.  The
   session-id part is compared as case sensitive, as specified in
   Section 6.1 (point 4) of [RFC4975].  If this is not true, then the
   receiver MUST generate a 481 error and ignore the request.  Note that
   if the Failure-Report header field had a value of "no", then no error
   report would be sent.


5.  Security Considerations

   Due to the change of the session matching procedure, MSRP endpoints
   can only check that the session-id part of the MSRP URI carried in
   the MSRP messages matches the session-id which was provided in the
   associated SDP a=path attribute.  Differing from [RFC4975], the host/
   domain part of the MSRP URI is thus not checked.  However, since a
   man-in-the-middle would in any case be able to modify the domain
   information in both the SDP and the MSRP messages, this does not
   introduce any new security risk.

   Even if MSRP entities do not use the MSRP URI domain part to perform
   session matching, if the domain information is different in the SDP
   a=path attribute and the associated MSRP messages the MSRP entities
   might be able to determine whether one or more intermediaries have
   been inserted in the message path.  With the current session matching
   procedures, intermediaries would have to modify both the domain part
   of the MSRP URI both in the SDP a=path attribute and the associated
   MSRP messages, which means that MSRP entities cannot compare the
   domain information in order to determine whether intermediaries have
   been inserted in the message path.

   When intermediaries are used, MSRP endpoints which uses security
   mechanisms might not be able to determine whether security is
   provided end-to-end.  However, that issue is generic to all types of
   media.
