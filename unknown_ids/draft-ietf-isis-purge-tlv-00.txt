             Purge Originator Identification TLV for IS-IS
                      draft-ietf-isis-purge-tlv-00

Abstract

   At present an IS-IS purge does not contain any information
   identifying the Intermediate System (IS) that generates the purge.
   This makes it difficult to locate the source IS.

   To address this issue, this document defines a TLV to be added to
   purges to record the system ID of the IS generating it.  Since normal
   LSP flooding does not change LSP contents, this TLV should propagate
   with the purge.

Internet-Draft     Purge Originator Identification TLV        April 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS [ISO 10589] routing protocol has been widely used in large-
   scale IP networks because of its strong scalability and fast
   convergence.

   The IS-IS protocol floods purges throughout an area, regardless of
   which IS initiated the purge.  If a network operator would like to
   investigate the cause of the purge, it is difficult to determine the
   origin of the purge.  At present the IS-IS protocol has no mechanism
   to locate the originator of a purge.  To address this problem, this
   document defines a TLV to be added to purges to record the system ID
   of the IS generating the purge.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Cases to Generate Purge Packet

   In IS-IS there are three legitimate reasons for an IS to generate a
   purge:

   1.  An IS purges its own LSP.

   2.  A LSP owned by another IS ages out.

   3.  A new DIS is elected.

   Field experience has observed serveral other circumstances where an
   IS can improperly generate a purge:

   1.  An implementation misunderstanding [ISO 10589] or predating TC1
       generates a purge when it receives a corrupted LSP.

   2.  An implementation with bugs tries to purge one of its LSPs and
       makes a truly egregious mistake.

   3.  An implementation fails to retain the LSP header after purging
       while flooding is still in progress.

Internet-Draft     Purge Originator Identification TLV        April 2010


4.  The Purge Originator Identification TLV

   This document defines a TLV to be included in purges.  This TLV
   carries the system ID of the IS generating the purge.

   This allows ISs receiving purges to log the system ID of the
   originator.  This makes it much easier for the network administrator
   to locate the origin of the purge and thus the cause of the purge.
   Similarly, this TLV is helpful to developers in lab situations.

   The Purge Originator Identification TLV is defined as:

   CODE - XX (to be assigned)

   LENGTH - total length of the value field.

   VALUE - System ID of the Intermediate System that initiated the
   purge.


5.  Security Considerations

   If the proposed TLV is used in conjunction with IS-IS authentication
   mechanisms [RFC5304][RFC5310], the purge LSP is constructed by
   removing the original contents of the LSP, leaving only the LSP
   header, adding the Purge Originator Identification TLV and then
   adding the IS-IS authentication TLV.  This document amends the
   behavior specified in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310].


6.  IANA Considerations

   RFC EDITOR NOTE: This section to be removed upon publication.

   This document requests that IANA assign a code point for this TLV
   from the IS-IS 'TLV Codepoints Registry'.
