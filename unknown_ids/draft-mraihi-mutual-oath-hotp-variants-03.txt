 Abstract  
     
    This document describes the OATH algorithm for challenge-response 
    authentication and signatures. This algorithm is based on the HOTP 
    algorithm [RFC4226] that was introduced by OATH (initiative for 
    Open AuTHentication) [OATH] and submitted as an individual draft to 
    the IETF last year.

   1. Introduction 
  
    OATH has identified several use cases and scenarios that require an 
    asynchronous variant to accommodate users who do not want to 
    maintain a synchronized authentication system. The commonly 
    accepted method for this is to use a challenge-response scheme. 
     
    Such challenge response mode of authentication is widely adopted in 
    the industry. Several vendors already offer software applications 
    and hardware devices implementing challenge-response - but each of 
    those uses vendor-specific proprietary algorithms. For the benefits 
    of users we need a standardized challenge-response algorithm to 
    allow multi-sourcing of token purchases and validation systems to 
    facilitate the democratization of strong authentication.

    Additionally, this specification can also be used to create 
    symmetric key based digital signatures. Such systems are variants 
    of challenge-response mode where the data to be signed becomes the 
    challenge. 
     
  
   2. Requirements Terminology 
     
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
    [RFC2119]. 
     
   3. Algorithm Requirements 
     
    This section presents the main requirements that drove this 
    algorithm design. A lot of emphasis was placed on flexibility and 
    usability, under the constraints and specificity of the HOTP 
    algorithm and hardware token capabilities. 
     
    R1 - The algorithm MUST support asynchronous challenge-response 
    based authentication. 
     
    R2 - The algorithm MUST be capable of supporting symmetric key 
    based digital signatures. Essentially this is a variation of 
    challenge-response where the challenge is derived from the data 
    that needs to be signed. 
     
    R3 - The algorithm MUST be capable of supporting server-
    authentication, whereby the user can verify that he/she is talking 
    to a valid server. 
     
    R4 - The algorithm SHOULD use HOTP [RFC4226] as a key building 
    block.   
     
    R5 - The length and format for the input challenge SHOULD be 
    configurable. 
     
    R6 - The output length and format for the response SHOULD be 
    configurable. 
     
    R7 - The challenge MAY be generated with integrity checking (e.g., 
    parity bits). This will allow tokens with pin pads to perform 
    simple error checking if the user enters the value into a token. 
     
    R8 - There MUST be a fixed randomly generated secret (key) for each 
    token/soft token that is shared between the token and the 
    authentication server.

    R9 - The algorithm MUST enable additional data attributes such as a 
    counter, a time function or session information to be included in 
    the computation. These data inputs MAY be used individually or all 
    together. 
     
     
   4. OCRA Background 
     
    OATH introduced the HOTP algorithm as a first open, freely 
    available building block toward hardening authentication for end-
    users in a variety of applications. One-time passwords are very 
    efficient at solving specific security issues thanks to the dynamic 
    nature of OTP computations. 
     
    After carefully analyzing different use cases, OATH came to the 
    conclusion that providing for extensions to the HOTP algorithms was 
    important. A very natural extension is to introduce a challenge 
    mode for computing HOTP values based on random questions. Equally 
    beneficial, being able to perform mutual authentication between two 
    parties, or short-signature computation for authenticating 
    transaction was also identified as critical for improving the 
    security of e-commerce applications. 
     
    This section summarizes the HOTP algorithm and then, formally 
    introduces the OCRA algorithm. 
     
    4.1  HOTP Algorithm 
     
    The HOTP algorithm, as defined in [RFC4226] is based on an 
    increasing counter value and a static symmetric key known only to 
    the prover and verifier parties. 
     
    As a reminder: 
     
                    HOTP(K,C) = Truncate(HMAC-SHA1(K,C)) 
     
    Where Truncate represents the function that converts an HMAC-SHA-1 
    value into an HOTP value. 
     
    The Key (K), the Counter (C) and Data values are hashed high-order 
    byte first. The HOTP values generated by the HOTP generator are 
    treated as big endian. 
     
    We refer the reader to [RFC4226] for the full description and 
    further details on the rationale and security analysis of HOTP. 
  
    The present draft describes the different variants based on similar 
    constructions as HOTP.

    4.2  OCRA Algorithm 
     
    In a nutshell, OCRA is a generalization of HOTP with variable data 
    inputs not solely based on an incremented counter and secret key 
    values. 
     
                    OCRA = CryptoFunction(K, DataInput) 
     
    Where: 
     
    - K: a shared secret key known to both parties; 
    - CryptoFunction: this is the function performing the OCRA 
    computation from the secret key K and DataInput material; 
    CryptoFunction is described in details in section 5.2; 
    - DataInput: a structure that contains the concatenation of the 
    various input data values. Defined in details in section 5.1. 
  
   5. Definition of OCRA 
     
    The definition of OCRA requires a cryptographic function, a key K 
    and a set of DataInput parameters. This section introduces these 
    definitions and default value recommended for all the parameters. 
     
    We denote L as the byte-length of the CryptoFunction output. For 
    instance, if CryptoFunction was SHA-1, then L = 20. 
     
    We denote B as the byte-length of the blocks manipulated by the 
    core function internally. For instance if CryptoFunction was HMAC-
    SHA-1, then B = 64 since SHA-1 manipulates 64-byte blocks. 
     
    We denote t as the byte-length of the truncation output. For 
    instance, if t = 6, then the output of the truncation is a 6-byte 
    value. 
     
    All the values are processed high-order bit first. 
     
    5.1 DataInput Parameters 
     
    This structure is the concatenation of all the parameters used in 
    the computation of the OCRA values, save for the secret key K. 
     
    DataInput = {Q | C | P | S | T} where: 
       . Q is the list of (concatenated) challenge question(s) 
         generated by the verifier(s);the questions SHOULD be L-byte 
         values and MUST be at least t-byte values; 
       . C is a 8-byte counter value, and MUST be synchronized between 
         all parties;

       . P is a SHA1-hashed of PIN/password that is known to all 
         parties during the execution of the algorithm; 
       . S is a string that contains information about the current 
         session; 
       . T is a timestamp value, UTC formatted. 
      
    When computing a response, the concatenation order is always the 
    following: 
     
                  OTHER-PARTY-GENERATED-CHALLENGE-QUESTION 
                     YOUR-GENERATED-CHALLENGE-QUESTION 
                         C, P, S and then T values. 
     
    If a value is empty (i.e. a certain input is not used in the 
    computation) then the value is simply not represented in the 
    string. 
     
    5.2 CryptoFunction 
     
    The default CryptoFunction is HOTP-SHA1-6, i.e. the default mode of 
    computation for OCRA is HOTP with the default 6-digit dynamic 
    truncation and a combination of DataInput values as the message to 
    compute the HMAC-SHA1 digest. 
     
    We define the HOTP family of functions as an extension to HOTP: 
    - HOTP-H-t: these are the different possible truncated versions of 
      HOTP, using the dynamic truncation method for extracting an HOTP 
      value from the HMAC output; 
    - We will denote HOTP-H-t as the realization of an HOTP function 
      that uses an HMAC function with the hash function H, and the 
      dynamic truncation as described in [RFC 4226] to extract a t-byte 
      value; 
    - t=0 means that no truncation is performed and the full HMAC value 
      is used for authentication purpose. 
     
     
    We list the following preferred modes of computation, where * 
    denotes the default CryptoFunction: 
       . HOTP-SHA1-4: HOTP with SHA-1 as the hash function for HMAC 
          and a dynamic truncation to a 4-digit value; this mode is not 
          recommended in the general case but can be useful when a very 
          short authentication code is needed by an application; 
       . *HOTP-SHA1-6: HOTP with SHA-1 as the hash function for HMAC 
          and a dynamic truncation to a 6-digit value; 
       . HOTP-SHA256-6: HOTP with SHA-1 as the hash function for HMAC 
          and a dynamic truncation to a 6-digit value; 
       . HOTP-SHA512-6: HOTP with SHA-1 as the hash function for HMAC 
          and a dynamic truncation to a 6-digit value;

   6. The OCRASuite 
     
    The following values define the OcraSuite codes used in the 
    description of modes of operation for OCRA algorithm. 
     
    An OCRASuite defines an OCRA suite of operations as supported in 
    the present draft and is represented as follows: 
     
                     Algorithm-CryptoFunction-DataInput 
     
    Algorithm: 
    Description: Indicates the OCRA algorithm (possibly authenticated) 
    Values: String MUST contains OCRA and optionally, the OCRA computed 
    value of the string 
     
    CryptoFunction: 
    Description: Indicated the function used to compute OCRA values 
    Values: As described in previous section; other values COULD be 
    added in the future 
     
    DataInput: 
    Description: List of valid inputs for the computation; [] indicates 
    a value is optional. 
    Values: 
    Q | [C | P | S | T]: Challenge-Response computation 
    C | [P]: Response-only (OTP) computation  
    Q | [C | P | T]: Plain Signature computation 
     
     
    Example of possible values: OCRA-HOTP-SHA512-8-C-P-Q means OCRA 
    algorithm with HMAC-SHA512 function, truncated to an 8-digit value, 
    using the counter, hash of the PIN/Password and a random challenge 
    as parameter, the other party MUST check the value received before 
    computing and sending his response.

   7. Algorithm Modes for Authentication 
     
    In this section we describe the typical modes in which the above 
    defined computation can be used for authentication.  
    
    7.1. One way Challenge-Response  
     
    A challenge/response is a security mechanism in which the verifier 
    presents a question (challenge) to the prover who must provide a 
    valid answer (response) to be authenticated. 
     
    To use this algorithm for a one-way challenge-response, the 
    verifier will communicate a challenge value (typically randomly 
    generated) to the prover. The prover will use the challenge in the 
    computation as described above. The prover then communicates the 
    response to the verifier to authenticate.  
     
    Therefore in this mode, the typical data inputs will be: 
     
    Q - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the verifier.  
    C - Counter, optional. 
    P - Hashed version of PIN/password, optional. 
    S - Session information, optional 
    T - Timestamp, optional. 
     
    The picture below shows the messages that are exchanged between the 
    client (prover) and the server (verifier) to complete a one-way 
    challenge-response authentication.  
     
    We assume that the client and server have a pre-shared key K that 
    is used for the computation. 
     
     CLIENT                                     SERVER 
    (PROVER)                                  (VERIFIER) 
      |                                           | 
      |    Verifier sends challenge to prover     | 
      |    Challenge = Q                          | 
      |<------------------------------------------| 
      |                                           | 
      |    Prover Computes Response               | 
      |    R = OCRA(K, {Q| [C | P | S | T]})      | 
      |    Response = R                           | 
      |------------------------------------------>| 
      |                                           | 
      |    Verifier Validates Response            | 
      |    Response = OK                          | 
      |<------------------------------------------|

    7.2. Response Only (OTP) Mode 
     
    Response Only mode is a variation of one-way challenge-response 
    where the challenge is implicitly derived.  
     
    In order to implicitly derive the challenge, the verifier and the 
    prover need to maintain a moving factor that is synchronized. 
    Commonly used moving factors include a counter, time or combination 
    of both.  
     
    To use this algorithm, the prover will use the implicit challenge 
    in the computation as described above. The prover then communicates 
    the response to the verifier to authenticate.  
     
    Therefore in this mode, the data inputs will be:  
     
    C - Counter mandatory. 
    P - Hashed version of PIN/password, optional. 
     
    The picture below shows the messages that are exchanged between the 
    client (prover) and the server (verifier) to complete a response 
    only authentication.  
     
    We assume that the client and server have a pre-shared key K that 
    is used for the computation.

    7.3. Mutual Challenge-Response 
     
    Mutual challenge-response is a variation of one-way challenge-
    response where both the client and server and mutually authenticate 
    each other.  
     
    To use this algorithm, the client will first send a random client-
    challenge to the server. The server computes the server-response 
    and sends it to the client along with a server-challenge. 
     
    The client will first verify the server-response to authenticate 
    that it is talking to a valid server. It will then compute the 
    client-response and send it to the server to authenticate. The 
    server verifies the client-response to complete the two-way 
    authentication process. 
     
    In this mode there are two computations: client-response and 
    server-response. There are two separate challenge questions, 
    generated by both parties. We denote these challenge questions Q1 
    and Q2. 
     
     
    Typical data inputs for server-response computation will be: 
    Q1 - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the client. 
    Q2 - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the server.  
    C  - Counter, optional. 
    S  - Session information, optional. 
    T  - Timestamp, optional. 
     
     
    Typical data inputs for client-response computation will be:  
    Q2 - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the server.  
    Q1 - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the client. 
    C  - Counter, optional. 
    P  - Hashed version of PIN/password, optional. 
    S  - Session information, optional. 
    T  - Timestamp, optional. 
     
     
    The following picture shows the messages that are exchanged between 
    the client and the server to complete a two-way mutual challenge-
    response authentication.  
     
    We assume that the client and server have a pre-shared key K that 
    is used for the computation.

   8. Algorithm Modes for Signature 
    
    In this section we describe the typical modes in which the above 
    defined computation can be used for digital signatures.  
     
    8.1  Plain Signature 
     
    To use this algorithm in plain signature mode, the server will 
    communicate a signature-challenge value to the client (signer). The 
    signature-challenge is either the data to be signed or derived from 
    the data to be signed using a hash function, for example.  
     
    The client will use the signature-challenge in the computation as 
    described above. The client then communicates the signature value 
    (response) to the server to authenticate.  
     
    Therefore in this mode, the data inputs will be: 
  
    Q - Signature-challenge, mandatory, supplied by the server.  
    C - Counter, optional. 
    P - Hashed version of PIN/password, optional. 
    T - Timestamp, optional.

    The picture below shows the messages that are exchanged between the 
    client (prover) and the server (verifier) to complete a plain 
    signature operation.  
     
    We assume that the client and server have a pre-shared key K that 
    is used for the computation. 
     
     CLIENT                                     SERVER

      |    Challenge = Q                          | 
      |<------------------------------------------|

      |    Client Computes Response               | 
      |    SIGN = OCRA(K, Q | [C | P | T])        | 
      |    Response = SIGN                        | 
      |------------------------------------------>| 
      |                                           | 
      |    Verifier Validates Response            | 
      |    Response = OK                          | 
      |<------------------------------------------| 
      |                                           | 
     
     
    8.2  Signature with Server Authentication 
    
    This mode is a variation of the plain signature mode where the 
    client can first authenticate that it is talking to a valid server 
    before creating a digital signature.  
     
    To use this algorithm, the client will first send a random client-
    challenge to the server. The server computes the server-response 
    and sends it to the client along with a signature-challenge. The 
    client will first verify the server-response to authenticate that 
    it is talking to a valid server. It will then compute the signature 
    and send it to the server.  
     
    In this mode there are two computations: client-signature and 
    server-response. 
     
    Typical data inputs for server-response computation will be: 
    Q - Challenge question, mandatory, supplied by the client.  
    C - Counter, optional. 
    T - Timestamp, optional. 
     
    Typical data inputs for client-signature computation will be:  
    Q - Signature-challenge, mandatory, supplied by the server.

   9. Security Considerations 
     
    Any algorithm is only as secure as the application and the 
    authentication protocols that implement it. Therefore, this section 
    discusses the critical security requirements that our choice of 
    algorithm imposes on the authentication protocol and validation 
    software.

    9.1 Security Analysis of the OCRA algorithm 
     
    The security and strength of this algorithm depends on the 
    properties of the underlying building block HOTP, which is a 
    construction based on HMAC [RFC2104] using SHA-1 as the hash 
    function. 
     
    The conclusion of the security analysis detailed in [RFC4226] is 
    that, for all practical purposes, the outputs of the dynamic 
    truncation on distinct counter inputs are uniformly and 
    independently distributed strings. 
     
    The analysis demonstrates that the best possible attack against the 
    HOTP function is the brute force attack. 
     
    9.2 Implementation Considerations 
     
    In the authentication mode, the client MUST support two-factor 
    authentication, i.e., the communication and verification of 
    something you know (secret code such as a Password, Pass phrase, 
    PIN code, etc.) and something you have (token).  The secret code is 
    known only to the user and usually entered with the Response value 
    for authentication purpose (two-factor authentication). 
    Alternatively, instead of sending something you know to the server, 
    the client may use a hash of the Password or PIN code in the 
    computation itself, thus implicitly enabling two-factor 
    authentication.   
     
    The keys for HOTP can be of any length equal or longer than L 
    bytes. Keys longer than L bytes are acceptable; they are first 
    hashed using the supported hash function, e.g. SHA-1, to become 
    usable. Nevertheless, the extra length would not significantly 
    increase the cryptographic strength of OCRA, provided the 
    randomness of the original key material is sufficient. 
     
    Keys need to be chosen at random or using a cryptographically 
    strong pseudo-random generator properly seeded with a random value. 
    We RECOMMEND following the recommendations in [RFC1750] for all 
    pseudo-random and random generations. The pseudo-random numbers 
    used for generating the keys SHOULD successfully pass the 
    randomness test specified in [CN]. 
     
    The keys MUST be embedded in a tamper resistance device or securely 
    implemented in a software application. Additionally, by embedding 
    the keys in a hardware device, you also have the advantage of 
    improving the flexibility (mobility).

    The challenge value MUST be randomly generated for each use of the 
    authentication protocol and SHALL NOT be re-used. We RECOMMEND 
    following the recommendations in [RFC1750] for all pseudo-random 
    and random generations. 
     
    All the communications SHOULD take place over a secure channel e.g. 
    SSL/TLS, IPsec connections. 
  
    The OCRA algorithm when used in mutual authentication mode or in 
    signature with server authentication mode SHOULD use dual key mode 
    -  i.e. there are two keys that are shared between the client and 
    the server. One shared key is used to generate the server response 
    on the server side and to verify it on the client side. The other 
    key is used to create the response or signature on the client side 
    and to verify the same on the server side.  
     
    We recommend that implementations MAY use the session information, 
    S as an additional input in the computation. For example, S could 
    be the session identifier from the TLS session. This will enable 
    you to counter certain types of man-in-the-middle attacks. However, 
    this will introduce the additional dependency that first of all the 
    prover needs to have access to the session identifier to compute 
    the response and the verifier will need access to the session 
    identifier to verify the response.  
  
   10. IANA Considerations 
    
    This document has no actions for IANA. 
    
   11. Conclusion 
     
    This draft introduced several variants of HOTP for challenge-
    response based authentication and short signature-like 
    computations. 
     
    The algorithm identifier AI provides for an easy integration and 
    support of different flavors within an authentication and 
    validation system. 
     
    Finally, OCRA should enable cross-authentication both in connected 
    and off-line modes, with the support of different response sizes 
    and mode of operations.

    Mennes and Stu Vaeth for their comments and suggestions to improve
