    <abstract>
      <t>
        Various IPv6 transition strategies require the introduction of large
        -scale NATs (e.g. AFTR, NAT64) to share the limited supply of IPv4 
        addresses available in the network until transition is complete. There
        has recently been debate over how to manage the sharing of ports between 
        different subscribers sharing the same IPv4 address. One factor in the 
        discussion is the operational requirement to log the assignment of 
        transport addresses to subscribers. It has been argued that dynamic 
        assignment of individual ports between subscribers requires the 
        generation of an excessive volume of logs. This document suggests a way 
        to achieve dynamic port sharing while keeping log volumes low.
      </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        During the IPv6 transition period, some large-scale NAT devices may
       be introduced, e.g. DS-Lite AFTR, NAT64. When a NAT device needs to
       set up a new connection for the user behind the NAT, it needs to create a
       new mapping entry for the new connection, which will contain source IP
       address, source port, converted source IP address, converted source port,
       protocol(TCP/UDP), etc. If the connection is ICMP, a  mapping entry may include
       source IP address, couverted source IP address, source identifier, converted
       source identifier, etc
      </t>

      <t>
    	For the purpose of troubleshooting, and also required by regulations,
        operators must keep logs of network NAT mapping entries for a period of 
        time, e.g. 6 months or one year <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues"/>, 
        so the NAT device needs to generate logs for mapping entries in addition 
        to other information. A traditional method is to generate a log for each 
        mapping entry. When a connection expires, the mapping entry will be deleted, 
        and the corresponding log is stored locally or sent to a log storage server.
      </t>
   


      <t>
        Some high performance NAT devices may need to create a large amount of
        new sessions per second. If logs are generated for each mapping entry, the
        log traffic could reach tens of megabytes per second or more, which would
        be a problem for log generation, transmission and storage.
      </t>
   


      <t>
        To reduce the cost of log storage, <xref target="I-D.nishitani-cgn"/> proposes 
        to fix the port range for each user/CPE, and only one log will be generated for 
        each user. But this would significantly reduce the number of subscribers that 
        could share a public IP address, as discussed in
        <xref target="I-D.softwire-dual-stack-lite"/>.

    <section anchor="proposal" title="A Suggested Solution">

      <t>   
        We propose a solution that allows dynamic sharing of port ranges
        between users while minimizing the number of logs that have to be 
        generated. Briefly, ports are allocated to the user in blocks. Logs 
        are generated only when blocks are allocated or deallocated. This 
        provides the necessary traceability while reducing log generation 
        by a factor equal to the block size, as compared with fully dynamic 
        port allocation.
      </t>

      <t> 
        Here is how the proposal would work in greater detail. When the user
        sends out the first packet, a port resource pool is allocated for the 
        user, e.g. assign ports 2000~2300 of a public IP address to the user's 
        resource pool. Only one log should be generated for this port block. 
        When the NAT needs to set up a new mapping entry for the user, it can 
        use a port in the user's resource pool and the corresponding public IP 
        address. If the user needs more port resources, the NAT can allocate 
        another port block, ports 3000~3050, to the user's resource pool. 
        Again , just one log needs to be generated for this port block.
        A log may contain the following information: source IP address, converted
        source IP address, port range, start time, end time, and some other necessary
        information.   
      </t>

      <t> 
        There is an alternative way of allocating port blocks <xref target="I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign"/>. 
        The ports in a block do not have to be continuous, due to security
        concerns; the port numbers could be worked out using some random algorithm 
        along with some initial parameters. When generating a log message, these 
        parameters instead of the port range would be included in the log.  
      </t>

      <t> 
        If some port block is not used for some configurable time, e.g. TBD minutes, 
        after initial allocation or after the mapping timer has expired 
        for every port in the block, the NAT can remove the port block from 
        the user's resource pool, and make it available for other users. The 
        deallocation is logged when it occurs.
      </t>
   
      <t>
        This solution can reduce the number of logs significantly and also make
        good use of the public IP address resource.
      </t>

      <t>
        In some case <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues"/>, 
        a server may not record the source port of a connection, and NAT device 
        needs to record the destination IP address of a connection. In such 
        a case, the suggested solution is not applicable. But a reasonable solution 
        is still for the server to record the source port.
