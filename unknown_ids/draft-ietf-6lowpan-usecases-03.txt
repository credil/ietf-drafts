Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Low power and lossy networks (LLNs) is the term commonly used to
   refer to networks made of highly constrained nodes (limited CPU,
   memory, power) interconnected by a variety of "lossy" links (low
   power radio links or powerline communication (PLC)) characterized by
   low speed and relatively unstable.  A particular instantiation of LLN
   is LoWPANs: LoWPANs are inexpensive, low-performance, wireless
   communication networks, and are formed by devices complying with the
   IEEE 802.15.4 standard [5].  Their typical characteristics can be
   summarized as follows:

   o  Low power: depending on country regulations and used frequency
      band, the maximum transmit power levels can be up to 1000 mW [5].
      However, typical wireless radios for LoWPANs are battery-operated
      and consume between 10 mW and 20 mW [9].

   o  Short range: the Personal Operating Space (POS) defined by IEEE
      802.15.4 implies a range of 10 meters.  For real implementations,
      the range of LoWPAN radios is typically measured in tens of
      meters, but can go far beyond that in line-of-sight situations
      [9].

   o  Low bit rate: the IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines a maximum over-
      the-air rate of 250 kb/s, as well as lower data rates of 40 kb/s
      and 20 kb/s for each of the currently defined physical layers (2.4
      GHz, 915 MHz and 868 MHz, respectively).

   o  Small memory capacity: common RAM sizes for LoWPAN devices consist
      of a few kilobytes, such as 4 KB.

   o  Limited processing capability: current LoWPAN nodes usually have
      8-bit processors with clock rates around 10 MHz.

   As any other LLNs, LoWPANs do not necessarily comprise of sensor
   nodes only, but may also consist of actuators.  For instance, in an
   agricultural environment, sensor nodes might detect low soil humidity
   and then send commands to activate the sprinkler system.

   After defining common terminology in Section 2 and describing the
   characteristics of LoWPANs in Section 3, this document provides a
   list of use cases and market domains that may benefit and motivate
   the work currently done in the 6LoWPAN WG.

1.1.  Basic network configuration

   A LoWPAN network can be seen as a network of small star-networks,
   each consisting of a single LoWPAN node connected to zero or more

   nodes, or a network with mesh topology as shown in Figure 1.  It is
   noted that it is out of scope of this document to define how mesh
   topologies could be obtained and maintained.

      Note: The IEEE 802.15.4 standard distinguishes between two types
      of nodes, reduced-function devices (RFDs) and full-function
      devices (FFDs).  This document uses the term, LoWPAN node, which
      includes both type of devices.  The two device types have
      different capabilities, so that the capability requirements of a
      LoWPAN node must be considered to choose the type of devices.
      Through their inability to transmit MAC layer beacons, RFDs can
      only communicate with FFDs in a resulting "master/slave" star
      topology.  FFDs are able to communicate with peer FFDs and with
      RFDs in the aforementioned relation.  FFDs can therefore assume
      arbitrary network topologies, such as multi-hop meshes.

                  Figure 1: Examples of LoWPAN topologies

   Communication to corresponding nodes outside of the LoWPAN is
   becoming increasingly important.  The intermediate LoWPAN nodes act
   as packet forwarders or LoWPAN routers and connect the entire LoWPAN
   in a multi-hop fashion.  Edge Routers are used to interconnect a
   LoWPAN to other networks, or to form an Extended LoWPAN by connecting
   multiple LoWPANs.  Before LoWPAN nodes obtain their IPv6 addresses
   and the network is configured, each LoWPAN executes a link-layer
   configuration using a single coordinator who is responsible for link-
   layer short address allocation.  However, this link-layer coordinator
   function is out of the scope of this document.

   A LoWPAN can be configured as Mesh Under or Route Over (see
   Terminology section Section 2).  In a Mesh Under configuration, the
   link-local scope reaches to the boundaries of the LoWPAN and all
   nodes in a LoWPAN are included in the scope.  Multihop transmission
   is achieved by Mesh Under forwarding at the link layer or in an
   Adaptation layer (see Figure 1).  In a Route Over configuration,
   Multihop transmission is achieved using IP routing (see Figure 1).
   More information about Mesh Under and Route Over is in 6LoWPAN ND [6]
   and 6LoWPAN Routing Requirements [8].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "IPv6 over Low-Power  Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions,  Problem Statement, and
   Goals" [3], and " Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   Networks" [4].

   Readers would benefit from reading 6LoWPAN ND [6], 6LoWPAN header
   compression [7], and 6LoWPAN Routing Requirements [8] for the details
   of the each 6LoWPAN work.

   This specification makes extensive use of the same terminology
   defined in 6LoWPAN ND [6] unless otherwise redefined below.

   This document defines an additional terms:

   LC(local-coordinator) node

      A logical functional entity that performs the special role of
      coordinating its child nodes for local data aggregation, status
      management of local nodes, etc.  Thus, the local coordinator node
      does not need to coincide with a link-layer PAN coordinator and
      there may be multiple instance in a LoWPAN.

3.  Design Space

   Inspired by [10], this section describes the potential dimensions
   that could be used to describe the design space of wireless sensor
   networks in the context of the 6LoWPAN Working Group.  The design
   space is already limited by the unique characteristics of a LoWPAN
   (e.g., low-power, short range, low-bit rate) as described in [3].
   The possible dimensions for scenario categorization used in this
   document are described as follows:

   o  Deployment: LoWPAN nodes can be scattered randomly or they may be
      deployed in an organized manner in a LoWPAN.  The deployment can
      occur at once, or as an iterative process.  The selected type of
      deployment has an impact on node density and location.  This
      feature affects how to organize (manually or automatically) the
      LoWPAN and how to allocate addresses in the network.

   o  Network Size: The network size takes into account nodes that
      provide the intended network capability.  The number of nodes
      involved in a LoWPAN could be small (10 nodes), moderate (several
      100s), or large (over a 1000).

   o  Power Source: The power source of nodes, whether the nodes are
      battery-powered or mains-powered, influences the network design.
      A hybrid solution is also possible where only part of the network
      is mains-powered.

   o  Connectivity: Nodes within a LoWPAN are considered "always
      connected" when there is a network connection between any two
      given nodes.  However, due to external factors (e.g., extreme
      environment, mobility) or programmed disconnections (e.g.,
      sleeping mode), the network connectivity can be from
      "intermittent" (i.e., regular disconnection because of nodes in
      sleep mode) to "sporadic" (i.e., almost always disconnected
      network).

   o  Multi-hop communication: The multi-hop communication factor
      highlights the number of hops that has to be traversed to reach
      the edge of the network or a destination node within it.  A single
      hop may be needed for simple star-topologies or a multi-hop
      communication scheme for more elaborate topologies, such as meshes
      or trees.  From previous work by academia and industry on LoWPANs,
      various routing mechanisms have been introduced, such as data-
      centric, event-driven, address-centric, localization-based,
      geographical routing, etc.  This document does not make use of
      such a fine granularity but rather uses topologies and single/
      multi-hop communication.

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   o  Traffic Pattern: several traffic patterns may be overused in
      LoWPANs.  To name a few, Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP), Multi-Point-
      to-Point (MP2P) and Point-to-Point (P2P).

   o  Security Level: LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and
      require high-level security support where the availability,
      integrity, and confidentiality of the information are primordial.
      This high level of security may be needed in case of structural
      monitoring of key infrastructure or health monitoring of patients.

   o  Mobility: Inherent to the wireless characteristics of LoWPANs,
      LoWPAN nodes could move or be moved around.  Mobility can be an
      induced factor (e.g., sensors in an automobile), hence not
      predictable, or a controlled characteristic (e.g., pre-planned
      movement in a supply chain).

   o  Quality of Service (QoS): for mission-critical applications,
      support of QoS is mandatory in resource-constrained LoWPANs.

4.  Application Scenarios

   This section lists a fundamental set of LoWPAN application scenarios
   in terms of system design.  A complete list of practical use cases is
   not the objective of this document.

4.1.  Industrial Monitoring

   LoWPAN applications for industrial monitoring can be associated with
   a broad range of methods to increase productivity, energy efficiency,
   and safety of industrial operations in engineering facilities and
   manufacturing plants.  Many companies currently use time-consuming
   and expensive manual monitoring to predict failures and to schedule
   maintenance or replacements in order to avoid costly manufacturing
   downtime.  LoWPANs can be inexpensively installed and provide more
   frequent and more reliable data.  The deployment of LoWPANs can
   reduce equipment downtime and eliminate manual equipment monitoring
   that is costy to be carried out.  Additionally, data analysis
   functionality can be placed into the network, eliminating the need
   for manual data transfer and analysis.

   Industrial monitoring can be largely split into the following
   application fields:

   o  Process Monitoring and Control: combining advanced energy metering
      and sub-metering technologies with wireless sensor networking in
      order to optimize factory operations, reduce peak demand,
      ultimately lower costs for energy, avoid machine downtimes, and
      increase operation safety.

      A plant's monitoring boundary often does not cover the entire
      facility but only those areas considered critical to the process.
      Easy to install wireless connectivity extends this line to include
      peripheral areas and process measurements that were previously
      infeasible or impractical to reach with wired connections.

   o  Machine Surveillance: ensuring product quality and efficient and
      safe equipment operation.  Critical equipment parameters such as
      vibration, temperature, and electrical signature are analyzed for
      abnormalities that are suggestive of impending equipment failure
      (see Section 4.2).

   o  Supply Chain Management and Asset Tracking: with the retail
      industry being legally responsible for the quality of sold goods,
      early detection of inadequate storage conditions with respect to
      temperature will reduce risk and cost to remove products from the
      sales channel.  Examples include container shipping, product
      identification, cargo monitoring, distribution and logistics.

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   o  Storage Monitoring: sensor systems designed to prevent releases of
      regulated substances to ground water, surface water and soil.
      This application field may also include theft/tampering prevention
      systems for storage facilities or other infrastructure, such as
      pipelines.

4.1.1.  A Use Case and its Requirements

   Example: Storage Monitoring + Partical Supply chain (Hospital Storage
   Rooms)

   In a hospital, maintenance of the right temperature in storage rooms
   is very critical.  Red blood cells need to be stored at 2 to 6
   degrees Celsius, blood platelets at 20 to 24 C, and blood plasma
   below -18 C. For anti-cancer medicine, maintaining a humidity of 45%
   to 55% is required.  Storage rooms have temperature sensors and
   humidity sensors every 25m to 100m, based on the floor plan and the
   location of shelves, as indoor obstacles distort the radio signals.
   At each blood pack a sensor tag can be installed to track the
   temperature during delivery.  A LoWPAN node is installed in each
   container of a set of blood packs.  In this case, highly dense
   networks must be managed.

   All nodes are statically deployed and manually configured with either
   a single- or multi-hop connection.  Different types of LoWPAN nodes
   are configured based on the service and network requirements.

   All LoWPAN nodes do not move unless the blood packs or a container of
   blood packs is moved.  Moving nodes get connected by logical
   attachment to a new LoWPAN.  The network configuration and
   forwarding/routing tables are not changed in the storage room unless
   node failure occurs.  When containers of blood packs are transmitted
   to other place of the hospital or by ambulance, the LoWPAN nodes on
   the containers associate to a new LoWPAN, and forwarding/routing
   tables are changed.

   This type of application works based on both periodic and event-
   driven notifications.  Periodic data is used for monitoring the
   temperature and humidity in the storage rooms.  The data over or
   under a pre-defined threshold is meaningful to report.  Blood cannot
   be used if it is exposed to the wrong environment for about 30
   minutes.  Thus, event-driven data sensed on abnormal occurrences is
   time-critical and requires secure and reliable transmission.  Due to
   the time-critical sensing data, reliable and secure data transmission
   is highly important.

   LoWPANs must be provided with low installation and management costs,
   and for the case of transmission of boold containers, precise

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   location tracking of containers are important.  The Hospital network
   manager or staffs can be provided with an early warning of possible
   chain ruptures, for example by using conveniently accessing
   comprehensive on-line reports and data management systems.

   Dominant parameters in industrial monitoring scenarios:

   o  Deployment: pre-planned, manually attached

   o  Mobility: no (except for the asset tracking case)

   o  Network Size: medium to large size, high node density

   o  Power Source: most of the time battery-operated

   o  Security Level: business-critical.  Secure and reliable
      transmission must be guaranteed.  An extra key mechanism can be
      used.

   o  Multi-hop communication: single- to multi-hop.  Forwarding/Routing
      tables are merely changed after configuration, except in the asset
      tracking case.  Node failure or indoor obstacles will cause the
      changes.  Reliability must be supported for the changes

   o  Connectivity: always on for crucial processes, otherwise
      intermittent

   o  QoS: important for time-critical event-driven data

   o  Traffic Pattern: P2P (actuator control), MP2P (data collection)

   o  Other Issues: Sensor network management, location tracking, real-
      time early warning

4.1.2.  6LoWPAN Applicability

   The network configuration of the above use-case can differ
   substantially by system design.  As illustrated in Figure 4, the
   simplest way is to build up a star topology inside of one storage
   room, and connect the storage rooms with one link.  Each LoWPAN node
   reaches the Edge Router (ER) by pre-defined routing/forwarding
   mechanism. the Local Coordinator nodes (LCs) play role in aggregation
   of the sensed data at each storage room and transmit the data.  It is
   noted that the LoWPAN LC is a logical entity so that one can be
   implemented together with an LoWPAN Edge Router or a LoWPAN Node.  In
   case that the sensed data from an individual node is important, such
   as urgent event-driven data, it will not be accumulated (and further
   delayed) by the LoWPAN LCs but immediately relayed.  In Mesh under,

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   link-layer addresses in mesh-header defined in RFC 4944 [4] are used
   for transmission, and in Route Over, IP forwarding is used.

   Based on the layout and size of the storage room, the LoWPAN can be
   configured in mesh topology as shown in Figure 5.  More than one
   LoWPAN LCs can be installed in a storage room, and LCs collect data
   as relay points to transmitting the sensed data toward the LoWPAN
   ERs.  LoWPAN Nodes need to build a multi-hop connection to reach the
   LCs and ER by ether Mesh Under or Route Over.  In Mesh Under, more
   than one LCs can be installed in the LoWPAN and the nodes play role
   in transmission multi-point traffic (multicast) by unicast method,
   not only role in data collection.  In Route Over, LoWPAN Routers will
   handle multicast traffic to their LoWPAN links.

   Each LoWPAN node configures its link-local address and may get a
   prefix from its default router by an 6LoWPAN ND procedure [6].
   Inside of the storage room, each node does not need to get a globally
   unique IPv6 address.  However, containers can be moved inside or
   outside of the hospital, so that globally unique addresses may be
   needed depending on the purpose of the system and service.  Address
   auto-configuration is explained in Chapter 6 of RFC 4944 [4].  When
   the system is only used within a link-local scope, 16-bit addresses
   can be utilized, but 64-bit addresses are recommended for globally
   unique addressing.

   Packets are compressed by 6LoWPAN header compression mechanism [7].
   The data volume is usually not so big in this case, but it is
   sensitive for delay.  Data aggregators can be installed for each
   storage room, or just one data aggregator can collect all data.  To
   make a light transmission, UDP (encapsulated in 6LoWPAN header or as
   it is) will be chosen, but secure transmission and security mechanism
   should be added.  To increase security, MAC layer mechanisms and/or
   additional security mechanisms can be used.

   Because a failure of a LoWPAN node can critically affect the storage
   of the blood packs, network management is important in this use-case.
   SNMP-lite or other mechanism SHOULD be provided for the management.

   When a container is moved out from the storage room, and connected to
   the other hospital system (if the hospital buildings are fully or
   partly covered with 6LoWPANs), it should rebind to a new parent node
   and a new LoWPAN. 6LoWPAN ND [6] will support this procedure.  In
   case that it is moved by an ambulance, it will be connected to an
   edge router in the vehicle.  LoWPANs must be provided with low
   installation and management costs, providing benefits such as reduced
   inventory, and precise location tracking of containers, and mobile
   equipment (moving beds at the hospital or ambulances).

4.2.  Structural Monitoring

   Intelligent monitoring in facility management can make safety checks
   and periodic monitoring of the architecture status highly efficient.
   Mains-powered nodes can be included in the design phase of a
   construction or battery-equipped nodes can be added afterwards.  All
   nodes are static and manually deployed.  Some data is not critical
   for security protection (such as normal room temperature), but event-
   driven emergency data MUST be handled in very critical manner.

4.2.1.  A Use Case and its Requirements

   Example: Bridge Safety Monitoring

   A 1000m long bridge with 10 pillars is described.  Each pillar and
   the bridge body contain 5 sensors to measure the water level, and 5
   vibration sensors are used to monitor its structural health.  The
   LoWPAN nodes are deployed to have 100m line-of-sight distance from
   each other.  All nodes are placed statically and manually configured
   with a single-hop connection to the local coordinator.  All LoWPAN
   nodes do not move while the service is provided.  The network
   configuration and forwarding/routing tables are changed only in case
   of node failure.  Except from the pillars, there are no special
   obstacles of attenuation to the node signals, but careful
   configuration is needed to prevent signal interference between LoWPAN



Kim, et al.             Expires January 10, 2010               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   nodes.

   The network configuration and routing tables are changed only in case
   of node failure.  On the top part of each pillar, an
   "infrastructured" sink node is placed to collect the sensed data.
   The sink nodes of each pillar become data gathering point of the
   LoWPAN hosts at the pillar as local coordinators.

   This use case can be extended to medium or large size sensor networks
   to monitor a building or for instance the safety status of highways
   and tunnels.  Larger networks of the same kind still have similar
   characteristics such as static nodes, manual deployment, and mostly
   star (or multi-level of star) topologies (see Figure 6), but
   dependent on the blue print of the structure, mesh topologies will be
   built with mains-powered relay points.  Periodic and event-driven
   real-time data gathering is performed and the emergency event-driven
   data MUST be delivered without delay.

   Dominant parameters in structural monitoring applications:

   o  Deployment: static, organized, pre-planned

   o  Mobility: none

   o  Network Size: small (dozens of nodes) to large

   o  Power Source: mains-powered nodes are mixed with battery powered
      (mains-power nodes will be used for coordinators or relays)

   o  Security Level: safety-critical.  Secure transmission must be
      guaranteed.  Only authenticated users should be able to access and
      handle the data.  Lightweight key mechanisms is recommended to be
      used.

   o  Multi-hop communication: star-topology (potentially hierarchical)
      In case of hierarchical case, reorganization of routing tree may
      be the issue.  However, forwarding/routing table may merely be
      changed after configuration.  Node failure or indoor obstacles
      will cause the changes.

   o  Connectivity: always connected or intermittent by sleeping mode
      scheduling.

   o  QoS: Emergency notification (fire, over-threshold vibrations,
      water level, etc) is required to have priority of delivery and
      must be transmitted in a highly reliable manner.

   o  Traffic Pattern: MP2P (data collection), P2P (localized querying)

   o  Other Issues: accurate sensing and reliable transmission are
      important.  In addition, sensor status reports may be needed to
      maintain a reliable monitoring system.

4.2.2.  6LoWPAN Applicability

   The network configuration of this use case can be very simple, but
   there are many extended use-cases for more complex structures.  The
   example bridge monitoring case may be the simplest case.  Dependent
   on the bridge size, the network will be configured by multiple stars
   or a mesh topology.

   Each LoWPAN node configures its link-local address and may get a
   prefix from its default router by an 6LoWPAN ND procedure [6].  Each
   pillar may have one local coordinator node(LC) for data collection
   from each pillar.  Each node does not need to get a globally unique
   IPv6 address, as the main communication is from/to the LCs of each
   pillar.  In this manner, this system is likely to be built as a stub
   network, so that 16-bit addresses can be utilized, but 64-bit
   addresses are recommended for the new header format [7].  Globally
   unique addresses MAY be allocated depending on the purpose of the
   system.

   The LoWPAN Nodes are installed on the place after manual optimization
   of their location.  Static data paths to the data gathering points
   can be set in the commissioning phase.  If the network does not use a
   Route Over mechanism, the 6LoWPAN mesh-header described in RFC 4944
   [4] may be used for static data forwarding, unless other mesh under
   mechanisms are provided.

   A logical entity of data gathering can be implemented in each LC.
   Communication schedules must be set up between leaf nodes and their
   LC to efficiently gather the different types of sensed data.  Each
   data packet may include meta-information about its data, or the type
   of sensors could be encoded in its address during the address
   allocation.  The data gathering entity can be programmed to trigger
   actuators installed in the infrastructure, when a certain threshold
   value has been reached.  This type of application works based on both
   periodic and event-driven notifications.  The data over or under a
   pre-defined threshold is meaningful to report.  Event-driven data
   sensed on abnormal occurrences is time-critical and requires secure
   and reliable transmission.  For energy conservation, all nodes may
   have periodic and long sleep modes but wake up on certain events.

   Packets are compressed by 6LoWPAN header compression mechanism [7].
   Due to the safety-critical data of the structure, authentication and

   security are important issues here.  Only authenticated users should
   be allowed to access the data.  Additional security should be
   provided at the LoWPAN ER for restricting the access from outside of
   the LoWPAN.  The LoWPAN ER may take charge of authentication of
   LoWPAN nodes.  Reliable and secure data transmission SHOULD be
   guaranteed.

4.3.  Healthcare

   LoWPANs are envisioned to be heavily used in healthcare environments.
   They have a big potential to ease the deployment of new services by
   getting rid of cumbersome wires and simplify patient care in
   hospitals and for home care.  In healthcare environments, delayed or
   lost information may be a matter of life or death.

   Various systems, ranging from simple wearable remote controls for
   tele-assistance or intermediate systems with wearable sensor nodes
   monitoring various metrics to more complex systems for studying life
   dynamics, can be supported by LoWPANs.  In the latter category, a
   large amount of data from various LoWPAN Nodes can be collected:
   movement pattern observation, checks that medicaments have been
   taken, object tracking, and more.  An example of such a deployment is
   described in [11] using the concept of Personal Networks.

4.3.1.  A Use Case and its Requirements

   Example: Healthcare at Home by Tele-Assistance

   An old citizen who lives alone wears one to few wearable LoWPAN Nodes
   to measure heartbeat, pulse rate, etc.  Dozens of LoWPAN Nodes are
   densely installed at home for movement detection.  A LoWPAN ER at
   home will send the sensed information to a connected healthcare
   center.  Portable base stations with LCDs may be used to check the
   data at home, as well.  The different roles of devices have different
   duty-cycles, which affect node management.

   Multipath interference may often occur due to the patients' mobility
   at home, where there are many walls and obstacles.  Even during
   sleeping, the change of the body position may affect the radio
   propagation.

   Data is gathered both periodically and event-driven.  In this
   application, event-driven data can be very time-critical.  Thus,
   real-time and reliable transmission must be guaranteed.

   Privacy also becomes an issue in this case, as the sensed data is
   very personal.  In addition, different data will be provided to the
   hospital system from what is given to a patient's family members.
   Role-based access control is needed to support such services, thus
   support of authorization and authentication is important.

   Dominant parameters in healthcare applications:

   o  Deployment: pre-planned

   o  Mobility: moderate (patient's mobility)

   o  Network Size: small, high node density

   o  Power Source: hybrid

   o  Security Level: Data privacy and security must be provided.
      Encryption is required.  Role based access control is required to
      be support by proper authentication mechanism

   o  Multi-hop communicaton: multi-hop for homecare devices, star
      topology on patients body.  Multipath interference due to walls
      and obstacles at home must be considered.

   o  Connectivity: always on

   o  QoS: high level of support (life and death implication), role-
      based

   o  Traffic Pattern: MP2P/P2MP (data collection), P2P (local
      diagnostic)

   o  Other issues: Plug-and-play configuration is required for mainly
      non-technical end-users.  Real-time data acquisition and analysis
      are important.  Efficient data management is needed for various
      devices which have different duty-cycles, and for role-based data
      control.  Reliability and robustness of the network are also
      essential.

4.3.2.  6LoWPAN Applicability

   In this use case, the local network size is rather small (less than
   10s of nodes).  The home care system is statically configured with
   multi-hop paths and the patient's body network can be built as a star
   topology.  The LoWPAN Edge Router(ER) at home is the sink node in the
   routing path from sources on the patient's body.  A plug-and-play
   configuration is required.  Each home system node will get a link-
   local IPv6 address according to the auto-configuration described in
   RFC 4944 [4].  As the communication of the system is limited to a
   home environment, both 16-bit and 64-bit can be used for IPv6 link-
   local addresses.  However, 64-bit address is recommended to perform
   the 6LoWPAN ND [6] and new header format in [7].  An example topology
   is provided in Figure 8.

   Multi-hop communication can be achieved by either Mesh Under or Route
   Over mechanisms.  In case the Mesh Under mechanism is implemented,
   the LoWPAN ER becomes the only router of the home network, and ND is
   done as 6LoWPAN ND [6] describes.  When Route Over routing mechanism
   is used, the routers deployed in the home environment will form a
   mesh of IPv6 links.  In Mesh Under, more than one LCs can be
   installed in the LoWPAN and the nodes play role in transmission
   multi-point traffic (multicast) to unicast method.  In Route Over,
   LoWPAN Routers will handle multicast traffic to their LoWPAN Link.

   The patient's body network can be simply configured as a star
   topology with a LC dealing with data aggregation and dynamic network
   attachment when the patient moves around at home.  As multipath
   interference may often occur due to the patients' mobility at home,
   the deployment of LoWPAN nodes and transmission paths should be well
   considered.  At home, some nodes can be installed with power-
   affluence status, and those LoWPAN Nodes can be used for relaying
   points or data aggregation points.

   The sensed information should be maintained with the identification
   of the patient no matter if the patient visits the connected hospital
   or stays at home.  If the patient's LoWPAN uses globally unique IPv6
   address, the address can be used for the identification, however, the
   home system itself does not require globally unique IPv6 address but
   could be run with link-local IPv6 address.  In this case, the
   hospital LoWPAN needs to operate additional identification system.

   The connection between the LoWPAN ER at home and the ER at Hospital
   must be reliable and secure, as the data is privacy-critical.  To
   achieve this, additional policy for security is recommended between
   the two LoWPAN.

4.4.  Connected Home

   The "Connected" Home or "Smart" home is with no doubt an area where
   LoWPANs can be used to support an increasing number of services:

   o  Home safety/security

   o  Home Automation and Control

   o  Healthcare (see above section)

   o  Smart appliances and home entertainment systems

   In home environments LoWPAN networks typically comprise a few dozen
   and probably in the near future a few hundreds of nodes of various
   nature: sensors, actuators and connected objects.

4.4.1.  A Use Case and its Requirements

   Example: Home Automation

   The home automation and control system LoWPAN offers a wide range of
   services: local or remote access from the Internet (via a secured
   edge router) to monitor the home (temperature, humidity, activation
   of remote video surveillance, status of the doors (locked or open),
   ...) but also for home control (activate the air conditioning/
   heating, door locks, sprinkler systems, ...).  Fairly sophisticated
   systems can also optimize the level of energy consumption thanks to a
   wide range of input from various sensors connected to the LoWPAN:
   light sensors, presence detection, temperature, ... in order to
   control electric window shades, chillers, air flow control, air



Kim, et al.             Expires January 10, 2010               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   conditioning and heating with the objective to optimize energy
   consumption.

   With the emergence of "Smart Grid" applications, the LoWPAN may also
   have direct interactions with the Grid itself via the Internet of the
   Grid network to report the amount of KWatts that could be load shed
   (Home to Grid) and to receive dynamic load shedding information if/
   when required (Grid to home): this application is also referred to as
   Demand-Response application.  Another service known as Demand Side
   Management (DSM) could be provided by utilities to monitor and report
   to the user its energy consumption with a fine granularity (on a per
   device basis).  Other inputs such as dynamic pricing can also be
   received by the user from the utility that can then turn on and off
   some appliances according to its local policy in order to reduce its
   energy bill.

   In terms of home safety and security, the LoWPAN is made of motion-
   and audio-sensors, sensors at doors and windows, and video cameras to
   which additional sensors can be added for safety (gas, water, CO,
   Radon, smoke detection).  The LoWPAN typically comprises a few dozen
   of nodes forming an ad-hoc network with multi-hop routing since the
   nodes may not be in direct range.  It is worth mentioning that the
   number of devices tends to grow considering the number of new
   applications for the home.  In its most simple form, all nodes are
   static and communicate with a central control module but more
   sophisticated scenarios may also involve inter-device communication.
   For example, a motion/presence sensor may send a multicast message to
   a group of lights to be switched on, or a video camera will be
   activated sending a video stream to a gateway that can be received on
   a cell phone.

   Ergonomics in Connected Homes is a key and the LoWPAN must be self-
   managed and easy to install.  Traffic patterns may greatly vary
   depending on the applicability and so does the level of reliability
   and QoS expected from the LoWPAN.  Humidity sensing is typically not
   critical and requires no immediate action whereas tele-assistance or
   gas leak detection is critical and requires a high degree of
   reliability.  Furthermore, although some actions may not involve
   critical data, still the response time and network delays must be on
   the order of a few hundreds of milliseconds to preserve the user
   experience (e.g. use a remote control to switch a light on).  A
   minority of nodes are mobile (with slow motion).  With the emergence
   of energy related applications it becomes crucial to preserve data
   confidentiality.  Connected Home LoWPAN usually do not require multi-
   topology or QoS routing and fairly simple QoS mechanisms must be
   supported by the LoWPAN (the number of Class of Services is usually
   limited).

   Dominant parameters for home automation applications:

   o  Deployment: multi-hop topologies

   o  Mobility: some degree of mobility

   o  Network Size: medium number of nodes, potentially high density

   o  Power Source: mix of battery and AC powered devices

   o  Security Level: authentication and encryption required

   o  Multi-hop communication: no requirement for multi-topology or QoS
      routing

   o  Connectivity: intermittent (usage-dependent sleep modes)

   o  QoS: support of limited QoS (small number of Class of Service)

   o  Traffic Pattern: P2P (inter-device), P2MP and MP2P (polling)

4.4.2.  6LoWPAN Applicability

   In the home automation use case, the network topology is made of a
   mix a battery operated and main powered nodes that both communication
   with each other and to outside of the LoWPAN via the LoWPAN ERs.
   That being said it is expected that most LoPWAN nodes will
   communicate with a LC that will process the data and will communicate
   with outside after potential data processing, filtering, etc.

   In home network, installation and management must as extremely simple
   for the user.

   Link local IPv6 addresses can be used by nodes with no external
   communication whereas globally unique IPv6 address will be required
   for the node requiring communication with node outside of the LoWPAN.
   Even in the case of nodes that do not need to communicate with the
   outside world, it is recommended to make use of 64-bit addresses to
   handle new compression header (see [7]).

   In some scenarios, the traffic will be sent to a LC for processing
   that may in turn decide of local actions (switch a light on, ...).
   In other scenarios, all devices will send their data to the LCs that
   may also act as the ER for data processing and potential relay of
   data to outside of the LoWPAN.  For the sake of illustration, some of
   the data may be processed to trigger local action (e.g. switch off an
   appliance), simply store and sent once enough data has been
   accumulated (e.g. energy consumption for the past 6 hours for a set
   of appliances) or could trigger an alarm immediately sent to a
   datacenter (e.g. gas leak detection).

   Although in the majority of cases nodes within the LoPWAN will be in
   direct range, some nodes will reach the ER/LC with a 2-3 hops path
   using Mesh Under or very likely a Route Over solution (with the
   emergence of several low power media such as low power PLC) in which
   case LoWPAN routers will be deployed in the home to interconnect the
   various IPv6 links.

   The home LoWPAN must be able to provide extremely reliable
   communication in support of some specific application (e.g. fire, gas
   leak detection, health monitoring) whereas other application may not
   be critical at all (e.g humidity monitoring).  Similarly some
   information may require the use of security mechanisms for
   authentication, confidentiality).


4.5.  Vehicle Telematics

   LoWPANs play an important role in intelligent transportation systems.
   Incorporated in roads, vehicles, and traffic signals, they contribute
   to the improvement of safety of transporting systems.  Through
   traffic or air-quality monitoring, they increase the possibilities in
   terms of traffic flow optimization and help reducing road congestion.

4.5.1.  A Use Case and its Requirements

   Example: Telematics

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   As shown in Figure 10, scattered LoWPAN Nodes are included in roads
   during their construction for motion monitoring.  When a car passes
   over of these nodes, the possibility is then given to track the
   trajectory and velocity of cars for safety purposes.  The lifetime of
   the LoWPAN Nodes incorporated into roads is expected to be as long as
   the life time of the roads (10 years).  Multihop communication is
   possible between LoWPAN Nodes, and the network should be able to cope
   with the deterioration over time of the node density due to power
   failures.  Sink nodes placed at the road side are mains-powered,
   LoWPAN Nodes in the roads run on battery.  Power savings schemes
   might intermittently disconnect the nodes.  A rough estimate of 4
   nodes per square meter is needed.  Other applications may involve
   car-to-car communication for increased road safety.

   Dominant parameters in vehicle telematics applications:

   o  Deployment: scattered, pre-planned

   o  Mobility: none (road infrastructure), high(vehicle)

   o  Network Size: large (road infrastructure), small (vehicle)

   o  Power Source: mostly battery powered

   o  Security Level: low

   o  Multi-hop communication: multi-hop, especially ad-hoc

   o  Connectivity: intermittent

   o  QoS: support of limited QoS

   o  Traffic Pattern: mostly Point-to-Point (P2P), Point-to-Multi-Point
      (P2MP)

4.5.2.  6LoWPAN Applicability

   For this use case, the network topology includes fixed LoWPAN Edge
   Routers that are mains-powered and have a connection to a gateway in
   order to reach the transportation control center.  These LoWPAN ERs
   are logically combined with LC nodes as data sinks for a number of
   LoWPAN Nodes inserted in the tarmac of the road.

   In contrast to the LoWPAN ERs, the LoWPAN Nodes can generally operate
   with link-local IPv6 addresses as no direct access from outside the
   LoWPAN is established to the LoWPAN Nodes.  Based on the purpose of
   the service, globally unique IPv6 address can be allocated during the
   network setup procedure described in RFC 4944 [4] and 6LoWPAN ND [6].

   In Infrastructure LoWPANs, each ER is connected by a backbone link
   and additional registration procedures may be required for management
   of multiple LoWPANs.  Details of this registration is described in
   6LoWPAN ND .

   In this topology, a LoWPAN with one LoWPAN ER forms a fixed network
   and the LoWPAN Nodes are installed by manual optimization of their
   location.  Static data paths to the data gathering point can be set
   in the commissioning phase.  If the network does not use a Route Over
   mechanism, the 6LoWPAN mesh under forwarding is used.  Forwarding/
   Routing tables are not changed unless a node failure occurs.

4.6.  Agricultural Monitoring

   Accurate temporal and spatial monitoring can significantly increase
   agricultural productivity.  Due to natural limitations, such as a
   farmers' inability to check the crop at all times of day or
   inadequate measurement tools, luck often plays a too large role in
   the success of harvests.  Using a network of strategically placed
   sensors, indicators such as temperature, humidity, soil condition,
   can be automatically monitored without labor intensive field
   measurements.  For example, sensor networks could provide precise
   information about crops in real time, enabling businesses to reduce
   water, energy, and pesticide usage and enhancing environment
   protection.  The sensing data can be used to find optimal
   environments for the plants.  In addition, the data on the planting
   condition can be saved by sensor tags, which can be used in supply
   chain management.

4.6.1.  A Use Case and its Requirements

   Example: Automated Vineyard




Kim, et al.             Expires January 10, 2010               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   In a vineyard with medium to large geographical size, a number of 50
   to 100 LC nodes are manually deployed in order to provide full signal
   coverage over the study area.  An additional number of 100 to 1000
   leaf nodes with (possibly heterogeneous) specialized sensors (i.e.,
   humidity, temperature, soil condition, sunlight) are attached to the
   LCs in local wireless star topologies, periodically reporting
   measurements to the associated LoWPAN LCs.  For example, in a 20-acre
   vineyard with 8 parcels of land, 10 LoWPAN Nodes are placed within
   each parcel to provide readings on temperature and soil moisture.
   The LoWPAN Nodes are able to support a multi-hop forwarding/routing
   scheme to enable data forwarding to a sink node at the edge of the
   vineyard.  Each of the 8 parcels contains one data aggregator to
   collect the sensed data.  Ten intermediate nodes are used to connect
   the sink nodes to the main gateway.

   Localization is important for geographical routing, for pinning down
   where an event occurred, and for combining gathered data with their
   actual position.  Using manual deployment, device addresses can be
   used.  For randomly deployed nodes, a localization algorithm needs to
   be applied.

   There might be various types of sensor devices deployed in a single
   LoWPAN, each providing raw data with different semantics.  Thus, an
   additional method is required to correctly interpret sensor readings.
   Each data packet may include meta-information about its data, or a
   type of a sensor could be encoded in its address during address
   allocation.

   Dominant parameters in agricultural monitoring:

   o  Deployment: pre-planned

      The nodes are installed outdoors or in a greenhouse with high
      exposure to water, soil, dust, in dynamic environments of moving
      people and machinery, with growing crop and foliage.  LoWPAN nodes
      can be deployed in a pre-defined manner, considering the harsh
      environment.

   o  Mobility: all static

   o  Network Size: medium to large, low to medium density

   o  Power Source: all nodes are battery-powered, except the sink

   o  Security Level: business-critical.  Light-weight security or a
      global key management can be used depending on the business
      purpose.

Internet-Draft       6LoWPAN Design and Applications           July 2009


   o  Mutli-hop communication: mesh topology with local star
      connections.  Forwarding/Routing table is merely changed after
      configuration.  Node failure or indoor obstacles will cause the
      changes.

   o  Connectivity: intermittent (many sleeping nodes)

   o  QoS: not critical

   o  Traffic Pattern: Mainly MP2P/P2MP.  P2P for Gateway communication
      or actuator triggering.

   o  Other issues: Time synchronization among sensors are required, but
      the traffic interval may not be frequent (e.g. once in 30 minutes
      to 1 hour).

4.6.2.  6LoWPAN Applicability

   The network configuration in this use case might, in the most simple
   case, look like illustrated in Figure 11.  This static scenario
   consists of one or more fixed LoWPAN ER that are mains-powered and
   have a high-bandwidth connection to a gateway via a backbone link,
   which might be placed in a control center, or connect to the
   Internet.  The LoWPAN ERs are strategically located at the border of
   vineyard parcels, acting as data sinks.  A number of LC nodes are
   placed along a row of plants with individual LoWPAN Hosts spread
   around them.

   While the LoWPAN ERs implement the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol
   (RFC 4861), the LoWPAN Nodes operate a more energy-considering ND
   described in [6], which includes basic bootstrapping and address
   assignment.  Link-local addresses are used for communication within
   the network.  Each LoWPAN ER can have predefined forward management
   information, if necessary.

   The intermediate nodes must implement a multi-hop forwarding/routing
   protocol (Mesh Under or Route Over) and they are responsible to
   transmit the measured data at the LoWPAN hosts to the LoWPAN ERs.  In
   this simplest case, the LoWPAN Routers (not edge routers) or Mesh
   nodes can build static forwarding/routing paths, and all end-nodes
   can be placed in one radio hop distance from its forwarder.  Packets
   are forwarded to each router or mesh node and relayed to the LoWPAN
   ER.

   LoWPAN nodes may send event-driven notifications when readings exceed
   certain thresholds, such as low soil humidity; which may
   automatically trigger a water sprinkler in the local environment.
   For increased energy efficiency, all LoWPAN Nodes are in periodic

   sleep state.  However, the LoWPAN LCs need to be aware of sudden
   events from the leaf nodes.  Their sleep periods should therefore be
   set to shorter intervals.  Communication schedules must be set up
   between master and leaf nodes, and global time synchronization is
   needed to account for clock drift.

   Also, the result of data collection may activate actuators.  Context-
   awareness, node identification and data collection on the application
   level are necessary.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements are differ by use-cases.  For example, industry
   monitoring an structure monitoring applications are safety-critical.
   Secure transmission must be guaranteed, and only authenticated users
   should be able to access and handle the data.  Lightweight key
   mechanisms can be used.  In health care system, data privacy is an
   important issue.  Encryption is required, and role based access
   control is required to be support by proper authentication mechanism.
