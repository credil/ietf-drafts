Abstract 

       This draft specifies a fault management mechanism for MPLS 
       Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP). The 
       proposed mechanism is based on a generic way of notifying a 
       Maintenance End Point (MEP) or Maintenance Intermediate Point 
       (MIP) of a fault on an MPLS-TP LSP using new type of MPLS 
       Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) messages.

1. Introduction 

  In traditional transport networks, circuits such as T1 lines are 
  provisioned on multiple switches. When a fault happens on any link or 
  node on the path of such a transport circuit, alarms are generated 
  which may in turn activate a backup circuit. MPLS-TP LSP emulating 
  traditional transport circuits need to provide the same Fault 
  Management (FM) capability. In this document, an MPLS-TP LSP means 
  either an MPLS transport LSP or an MPLS Pseudowire (PW). 
   
  This document specifies an MPLS-TP Fault Management mechanism based 
  on a new type of MPLS-OAM packets called "MPLS-OAM Fault Management 
  (FM)" packets. Upon receiving an MPLS OAM FM message: 

     1. A MIP/MEP activates the backup MPLS-TP LSP (if available) rather 
       than waiting for notification from other fault detection 
       mechanism such as Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). 

     2. A MEP sends MPLS-OAM Connection Verification (CV) Message 
       described in [2] to verify the new end-to-end path of the MPLS-
       TP LSP. 

   The proposed mechanism is based on a set of new TLVs which can be 
   transported using one of the following two methods: 

       1. Using in-band MPLS OAM messages which are forwarded as MPLS 
          packets (non-IP based).

Internet-Draft    draft-boutros-mpls-tp-fault-01.txt         March 2009 
    

       2. Using in-band LSP-Ping extensions defined in [3] where IP/UDP 
          packets are used (IP-based). The LSP-Ping messages are sent 
          using the codepoint defined in [4]. 

   Method (1) and (2) are referred to as "Non-IP option" and "LSP-Ping 
   option" respectively in the rest of the document. 

   Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

2. Terminology 

   ACH: Associated Channel Header 

   CV: Connection Verification 

   FM: Fault Management 

   LSR: Label Switching Router 

   MEP: Maintenance End Point 

   MIP: Maintenance Intermediate Point 

   MPLS-OAM: MPLS Operations, Administration and Maintenance 

   MPLS-TP: MPLS Transport Profile 

   NMS: Network Management System 

   PM: Performance Monitoring 

   TTL: Time To Live 

   TLV: Type Length Value 

3. MPLS-TP Fault Mechanism 

   For the Non-IP option, the proposed mechanism uses a new code points 
   in the Associated Channel Header (ACH) described in [5]. 

 
 
Boutros               Expires September 9, 2009                [Page 3] 
    
Internet-Draft    draft-boutros-mpls-tp-fault-01.txt         March 2009 
    

   The LSP-Ping option will be in compliance to specifications [3],[4], 
   and [8]. 

   Also, the proposed mechanism requires a new message type as described 
   below, and uses the LSPI and address TLVs defined in [6]. 

4. MPLS-OAM Fault Message 

4.1. In-band Message Identification 

   In the in-band option, under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-TP LSP, the   
   ACH with "MPLS-TP Fault" code point indicates that the message is   
   an MPLS OAM Fault message.

   reserved values are both set to 0 as specified in [1].  MPLS-TP   
   Fault code point = 0xHH. [HH to be assigned by IANA from the PW   
   Associated Channel Type registry.]

   Operation        Description 
   ---------        ------------- 
        0x01        Fault added and local repair activated.  
        0x02        Fault added with no local repair.  
        0x03        Fault removed.  
    

   Sender's Handle 
   The Sender's Handle is filled in by the sender. There are no 
   semantics associated with this handle. 

   Message Length 
   The total length of any included TLVs. 

   Message ID 
   The Message ID is set by the sender and is incremented everytime the 
   sender sends a new message. The receiver MUST include the Message ID 
   in it needs to send a Fault response message back to the sender. 

   Return code 

        Value   Meaning 
        -----   ------- 
          0     Fault Code 
          1     Success

   Cause code for return code = Success or Failure 

   Value   Meaning 
   -----   ------- 
      1    Fail to match MPLS-TP LSP ID 
      2    Malformed Fault message received 
      3    One or more of the TLVs is/are unknown 
      4    Authentication failed 
    

   The fault return code is used in both Downstream fault and upstream 
   fault message types. The other return codes are used in the Fault 
   response messages. 

  Downstream and Upstream fault messages MUST contain a source and a 
  destination address TLVs defined in [6] filled with Source and 
  destination addresses of the two LSRs associated with the fault 
  segment, and LSPI TLV defined in [6] filled with the ID of the MPLS-
  TP LSP. A fault message can optionally include an Authentication TLV 
  specified in [7]. 

  The receiver MEP or MIP may send a Fault response to the sender MEP 
  or MIP using an MPLS Fault response message, the fault response MUST 
  contain a source address TLV defined in [6] filled with the sender 
  address, and LSPI TLV defined in [6] filled with the ID of the MPLS-
  TP LSP. 

    

5. Operation 

   Scenario-1 Link Failure detected by only one node: 

   LSR-1 <-> LSR-2 <- X -> LSR-3 <-> LSR-4 

               |             | 

                --- LSR-5 --- 

   There is an MPLS-TP LSP spanning LSR-1, LSR-2, LSR-3, and LSR-4. LSR-
   1 and LSR-4 act as MEPs and LSR-2 and LSR-3 act as a MIP. 
   Furthermore, the segment between LSR-2 and LSR-3 is protected by 
   another MPLS-TP LSP as shown above. 

 
 
Boutros               Expires September 9, 2009                [Page 7] 
    
Internet-Draft    draft-boutros-mpls-tp-fault-01.txt         March 2009 
    

   Assume that there is a fault on segment between LSR-2 and LSR-3, it 
   was detected only by LSR-2. 

   The proposed scheme operates as follows: 

  1. Upon detecting failure, LSR-2 activates the backup MPLS-TP LSP that 
     protects the failure, and sends MPLS-OAM FM messages to LSR-1 
     (upstream) and LSR-5 (downstream via backup MPLS-TP LSP). The MPLS-
     OAM FM message has an indication that local repair is active on 
     LSR-2. 

  2. MPLS-OAM FM message arrives at LSR-5 which simply forwards it to 
     downstream over the backup MPLS-TP LSP. 

  3. MPLS-OAM FM message arrives at LSR-3, and since backup MPLS-TP LSP 
     exists on LSR-3, the backup is activated. The MPLS-OAM FM message 
     is forwarded downstream. 

  4. Upon receiving MPLS-OAM FM messages, LSR-1 and LSR-4 send MPLS-OAM 
     CV message to verify the new end-to-end path. 

    

   Scenario-2 Link Failure detected by both nodes adjacent to the 
   failure: 

   LSR-1 <-> LSR-2 <- X -> LSR-3 <-> LSR-4 

               |              | 

                ---- LSR-5 --- 

   This example is similar to the first one except that both LSR-2 and 
   LSR-3 detect the failure. 

   The proposed scheme operates as follows: 

  1. Upon detecting failure, LSR-2 activates the backup MPLS-TP LSP that 
     protects the failure, and sends MPLS-OAM FM messages to LSR-1 
     (upstream) and LSR-5 (downstream via backup MPLS-TP LSP). The MPLS-
     OAM FM message has an indication that local repair is active on 
     LSR-2. Also, since LSR-3 also detects the failure, it also 
     activates the backup MPLS-TP LSP and sends an MPLS-OAM FM message 
     upstream and downstream. The MPLS-OAM FM message has an indication 
     that local repair is active on LSR-3 as well.

  2. MPLS-OAM FM messages arrive at LSR-5 which simply forwards it to 
     upstream and downstream over the backup MPLS-TP LSP. 

  3. MPLS-OAM FM message arrives at LSR-3 and LSR-2. Since the failure 
     is already known to LSR-3 and LSR-2, the MPLS-OAM FM message is 
     discarded.  

  4. Upon receiving MPLS-OAM FM messages, LSR-1 and LSR-4 send MPLS-OAM 
     CV message to verify the new end-to-end path.  

  Proposed Solution: Fault Removal 

   LSR-1 <-> LSR-2 <-> LSR-3 <-> LSR-4 

              |           | 

               -- LSR-5 -- 

  Assuming LSR-2 detects fault removal proposed solution operates as 
  follows: 

  1. LSR-2 activates the primary MPLS-TP LSP back and sends MPLS-OAM FM 
     messages to LSR-1 (upstream) and LSR-3 (downstream via primary 
     MPLS-TP LSP). The MPLS-OAM FM message has an indication that the 
     specified fault is removed on LSR-2.  

  2. MPLS-OAM FM message arrives at LSR-3. LSR-3 activates the primary 
     MPLS-TP LSP back, and forwards the MPLS-OAM FM message downstream 
     to LSR-4.  

  3. Upon receiving MPLS-OAM FM messages, LSR-1 and LSR-4 send MPLS-OAM 
     CV message to verify the new end-to-end path.  

   A MEP or MIP in response to the MPLS-OAM Fault Management message may 
   send a Fault response message with return code = (1) success and 
   cause code = 0 or return code = (2) failure and a cause code as 
   follow: 

     1. if LSP ID cannot be matched, it sends a response with cause code 
        1 back to the sender MEP or MIP. 

     2. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with the cause 
        code 2 back to to the sender MEP or MIP. 

     3. if any of the TLV is not known, it sends a response with cause 
        code 3 back to to the sender MEP or MIP. It may also include the 
        unknown TLVs.

Internet-Draft    draft-boutros-mpls-tp-fault-01.txt         March 2009 
    

     4. if message authentication fails, it sends a response with the 
        cause code 4 back to to the sender MEP or MIP. 

   Note that MPLS TTL value is set to 255 in the response message. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations for the authentication TLV need further 
   study. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   To be added.

Intellectual Property Statement 

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
   might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has 
   made any independent effort to identify any such rights. 

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF 
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or 
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or 
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or 
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR 
   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr. 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement 
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document.  Please 
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org. 

   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or 
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are 
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into 
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions 
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions 
   is that published by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of 
   these Legal Provisions that are published by third parties, including

   those that are translated into other languages, should not be 
   considered to be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions. 

   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the UETF Standards 
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of 
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the 
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms, 
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the 
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect and 
   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such 
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
