		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in <xref target="RFC3748"/>,
				provides support for multiple authentication methods.  EAP over PPP	<xref target="RFC3748"/>
				is typically 		
				deployed with leased lines or
				modem connections.  <xref target="IEEE.802-1X.2004"/>
				defines EAP over IEEE 802 local area
				networks (EAPOL).
				<vspace blankLines="1" /> 
				Since its initial development, a number of weaknesses in the EAP framework have
				become apparent.  These include lack of support for:
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				<list>
					<t>Identity protection</t>
					<t>Protected method negotiation</t>
					<t>Protected notification messages</t>
					<t>Protected termination messages</t>
					<t>Sequences of EAP methods</t>
					<t>Fragmentation and reassembly</t>
					<t>Exchange of arbitrary parameters in a secure channel</t>
					<t>Optimized re-authentication</t>
				</list>
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				In addition, some EAP methods lack the following features:
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				<list>
					<t>Mutual authentication</t>
					<t>Resistance to dictionary attacks</t>
					<t>Adequate key generation</t>
				</list>
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				By wrapping the EAP protocol within TLS, TEAM addresses deficiencies in EAP or EAP 
				methods.  Benefits of TEAM include:
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="Identity protection">
					<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						By encrypting the identity exchange, and allowing client identity
						to be provided after negotiation of the TLS channel, TEAM
						provides for identity protection.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Dictionary attack resistance">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						By conducting the EAP conversation within a TLS channel, TEAM
						protects EAP methods that might be subject to an offline dictionary
						attack were they to be conducted in the clear.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Protected negotiation">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						Since within TEAM, the EAP conversation is authenticated,
						integrity and replay protected on a per-packet basis, the EAP
						method negotiation that occurs within TEAM is protected, as are
						error messages sent within the TLS channel (TLS alerts or EAP
						Notification packets).  EAP negotiation outside of TEAM is not protected.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Header protection">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						Within TEAM, TLS provides per-packet encryption, authentication,
						integrity and replay protection for the EAP conversation. As a
						result, the Type-Data field within TEAM (including the EAP header
						of the EAP method within TEAM) is protected against modification.
						However, the EAP header of TEAM  itself is not protected against
						modification, including the Code, Identifier and Type fields.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Protected termination">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						By sending success/failure indications within the TLS channel,
						TEAM provides support for protected termination of the EAP
						conversation.  This prevents an attacker from carrying out denial
						of service attacks by spoofing EAP Failure messages, or fooling the
						EAP peer into accepting a rogue NAS, by spoofing EAP Success messages.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Fragmentation and Reassembly">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						Since EAP does not include support for fragmentation and
						reassembly, individual methods need to include this capability.  By
						including support for fragmentation and reassembly within TEAM,
						methods leveraging TEAM do not need to support this on their own.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Fast reconnect">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						Where EAP is used for authentication in wireless networks, the
						authentication latency is a concern.  As a result, it is valuable
						to be able to do a quick re-authentication on roaming between
						access points. TEAM supports this capability by leveraging the
						TLS session resumption facility, and any EAP method running under
						TEAM can take advantage of it.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Standard key establishment">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						In order to provide keying material for a wide range of link layer
						ciphersuites, EAP methods need to provide keying material.  Key
						derivation is complex.  TEAM provides for key establishment by
						relying on the widely implemented and well-reviewed TLS <xref target="RFC4346"/>
						key derivation mechanism.  TEAM provides keying material for any
						EAP method running within it.  
<!--						
						If EAP methods will also be deployed
						without external protection (e.g. TEAM or IPSec), then the EAP
						methods should follow the guidelines in <xref target="MITM-A-P"/>
						to prevent the
						man-in-the-middle attacks.
-->
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Sequencing of multiple EAP methods">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						In order to enhance security, TEAM implementations may choose to
						provide multi-factor authentication that validates different
						identities (for example user and machine identities) and/or uses
						different credentials of the same or different identities of the
						peer (e.g.  user password and machine cert).  TEAM provides a
						standard way to chain different types of authentication mechanisms
						supporting different types of credentials.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Protected exchange of arbitrary parameters">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuples provide a way to exchange arbitrary
						information between peer and EAP server within a secure channel.
						This information can include signaling parameters for the EAP protocol,
						provisioning parameters, media specific and environment specific
						data, and authorization parameters.  The advantage of using TEAM
						TLVs is that every EAP method does not have to be modified.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Credential provisioning">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						TEAM supports provisioning of certificate trust anchors by the
						server using TLVs and can be extended to support provisioning of other peer credentials.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Optimized for light weight devices">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						In order to support peers that may not support certificate
						ciphersuites, and may not support provisioning of certificate trust
						anchors, TEAM enables negotiation of other TLS ciphersuites.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t hangText="Server unauthenticated tunnel provisioning mode">
						<vspace blankLines="0"/>
						In some cases,  the peer may only support password credentials and
						may not be provisioned with a certificate trust anchor.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						In server unauthenticated tunnel provisioning mode, a TEAM peer
						can authenticate using a password, in order to be provisioned with
						a pre-shared key and other credentials that can be used for
						subsequent authentication.  In server unauthenticated tunnel
						provisioning mode the TEAM peer only confirms possession of the
						private key corresponding to the public key contained within the
						server certificate, but does not otherwise validate the server
						certificate.  As a result, it is possible for an attacker to act as
						a man-in-the-middle during the initial exchange in order to perform
						an offline dictionary attack, based on capture of the password-
						based authentication exchange.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						In TEAM, implementation of server unauthenticated tunnel
						provisioning mode is optional and due to the security
						vulnerabilities introduced by this mode, it is not recommended for
						use with peers that support certificate validation and provisioning
						of certificate trust anchors.

				TEAM is comprised of a two-part conversation:
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>

						protected by the TLS session or a protected error (TLS alert).
					</t>
				</list>
				<vspace blankLines="1"/>
				In the following sections, we discuss the TEAM operational model, its support for EAP method 	
				sequencing and provide an overview of each of the parts of the TEAM conversation.
			</t>
			<section title="Operational Model">
				<t>
					In EAP, the EAP server may be implemented either within a Network
					Access Server (NAS) or on a backend authentication server.  Where the
					EAP server resides on a NAS, the NAS is required to implement the
					desired EAP methods, and therefore needs to be upgraded to support
					each new EAP method.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					One of the goals of EAP is to enable development of new
					authentication methods without requiring deployment of new code on
					the Network Access Server (NAS).  Where a backend authentication
					server is deployed, the NAS acts as a "passthrough" and need not
					understand specific EAP methods.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					This allows new EAP methods to be deployed on the EAP peer and
					backend authentication server, without the need to upgrade code
					residing on the NAS.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					<xref target="fig1"/>
					illustrates the relationship between the EAP peer, NAS and EAP
					server.  As shown in the figure, the EAP conversation occurs
					between the EAP peer and EAP server, "passing through" the NAS.  In
					order for the conversation to proceed in the case where the NAS and
					EAP server reside on separate machines, the NAS and EAP server need
					to establish trust beforehand.

					In TEAM, the conversation between the EAP peer and the EAP server
					is encrypted, authenticated, integrity and replay protected within a
					TLS channel.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					As a result, where the NAS acts as a "passthrough" it does not have
					knowledge of the TLS master secret derived between the peer and the
					EAP server.  In order to provide keying material for link-layer
					ciphersuites, the NAS obtains the master session key, which is
					derived from a one-way function of the TLS master secret as well as
					keying material provided by EAP methods protected within a TLS
					channel.  This enables the NAS and EAP peer to subsequently derive
					transient session keys suitable for encrypting, authenticating and
					integrity protecting session data.  However, the NAS cannot decrypt
					the TEAM conversation or spoof session resumption, since this
					requires knowledge of the TLS master secret.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Sequences">
				<t>
					EAP <xref target="RFC3748"/>
					prohibits use of multiple authentication methods within
					a single EAP conversation, except when tunneled methods such as
					TEAM are used.  This restriction was imposed in order to limit
					vulnerabilities to man-in-the-middle attacks as well as to ensure
					compatibility with existing EAP implementations.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Within TEAM these concerns are addressed since TEAM includes
					support for cryptographic binding to address man-in-the-middle
					attacks, as well as version negotiation so as to enable backward
					compatibility with future versions of the protocol.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Within this document, the term "sequence" refers to a series of EAP
					authentication methods run in sequence or TLV exchanges before or
					after EAP methods.  The methods need not be distinct - for example,
					EAP-TLS could be run initially with machine credentials followed by
					the same protocol authenticating with user credentials.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					TEAM supports initiating additional EAP method(s) after a
					successful or a failed EAP method.  The result of failure of a EAP
					method does not always imply a failure of the overall authentication.
					The overall result of authentication depends on the policy at EAP
					server and the peer.  For example, successful authentication might
					require a successful machine authentication followed by a successful
					user authentication.  Alternatively, if machine authentication fails,
					then user authentication can be attempted.  TEAM does not support
					initiating multiple EAP methods simultaneously.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="TEAM Phase 1" anchor="T-P-1">
				<section title="Initial identity exchange" anchor="I-I-E">
					<t>
						The TEAM conversation typically begins with an optional identity
						exchange.  The authenticator will typically send an EAP-
						Request/Identity packet to the peer, and the peer will respond with
						an EAP-Response/Identity packet to the authenticator.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The initial identity exchange is used primarily to route the EAP
						conversation to the EAP server.  Since the initial identity exchange
						is in the clear, the peer MAY decide to place a routing realm instead
						of its real name in the EAP-Response/Identity.  The real identity of
						the peer can be established later, during Phase 2.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the EAP server is known in advance (such as when all users
						authenticate against the same backend server infrastructure and
						roaming is not supported), or if the identity is otherwise determined
						(such as from the dialing phone number or client MAC address), then
						the EAP-Request/Response-identity exchange MAY be omitted.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Once the optional initial Identity Request/Response exchange is
						completed, while nominally the EAP conversation occurs between the
						authenticator and the peer, the authenticator MAY act as a
						passthrough device, with the EAP packets received from the peer being
						encapsulated for transmission to a backend authentication server.
						However, TEAM does not require a backend authentication server; if
						the authenticator implements TEAM, then it can authenticate local

				<section title="TLS Session Establishment" anchor="T-S-E">
					<t>
						In this section, the protocol is described.  While this section will often describe
						negotiation of a certificate-based ciphersuite within TLS, TEAM supports negotiation
						of other ciphersuites (for example, ciphersuites that do not use
						certificates) or extensions.  However, the  conversation may slightly
						differ if other TLS ciphersuites or extensions are used.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Once having received the peer's Identity, and determined that TEAM
						authentication is to occur, the EAP server MUST respond with a
						TEAM/Start packet, which is an EAP-Request packet with EAP-Type=TEAM,
						the Start (S) bit set, the TEAM version as specified in <xref target="V-N"/>,
						and optionally, the Server-Identifier TLV (<xref target="S-I-TLV"/>).
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Assuming that the peer supports TEAM, the TEAM conversation will then
						begin, with the peer sending an EAP-Response packet with EAP-
						Type=TEAM.  The Type-Data field of the EAP-Response Packet will
						encapsulate one or more TLS records containing the TLS handshake
						messages.  As defined in <xref target="RFC4346"/>,
						the TLS handshake is used to
						negotiate parameters and cryptographic keys and may take several
						roundtrips between the TLS client and server.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The version offered by the TLS client and server MUST be TLS v1.0 or
						later.  TEAM implementations need not necessarily support all TLS
						ciphersuites listed in <xref target="RFC4346"/>.
						Not all TLS ciphersuites are
						supported by available TLS tool kits and licenses may be required in
						some cases.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						To ensure interoperability, TEAMv2 peers and servers MUST support the
						TLS v1.1 <xref target="RFC4346"/>
						mandatory-to-implement ciphersuite:
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						<list>
							<t>TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA</t>
						</list>
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						In addition, TEAM servers SHOULD support and be able to negotiate
						all of the following TLS ciphersuites:
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						<list>
							<t>TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA</t>
							<t>TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5</t>
							<t>TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA</t>
							<t>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA</t>
						</list>
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						In addition, TEAM peers SHOULD support at least one of the
						following TLS ciphersuites:
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						<list>
							<t>TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA</t>
							<t>TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5</t>

							<t>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA</t>
						</list>
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						TLS as described in <xref target="RFC4346"/>
						supports compression as well as ciphersuite negotiation.  Therefore during the TEAM Phase 1
						conversation the TEAM endpoints MAY request or negotiate TLS
						compression.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the full TLS handshake is performed, then the first payload of
						TEAM Phase 2 MAY be sent along with finished handshake message to
						reduce number of round trips.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Since after the TLS session is established, another complete EAP
						negotiation will occur and the peer will authenticate using a
						secondary mechanism, with TEAM the client need not authenticate as
						part of TLS session establishment.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Note that since TLS client certificates are sent in the clear, if
						identity protection is required, then it is possible for the TLS
						authentication to be re-negotiated after the first server
						authentication.  Alternatively, if identity protection is required,
						then it is possible to perform certificate authentication using a EAP
						method (for example: EAP-TLS <xref target="RFC5216"/>) 
						within the TLS session during TEAM Phase 2.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						To accomplish this, the server will typically not request a
						certificate in the server_hello, then after the server_finished
						message is sent, and before TEAM Phase 2 begins, the server MAY send a TLS
						hello_request.  This allows the client to perform client
						authentication by sending a client_hello if it wants to, or send a
						no_renegotiation alert to the server indicating that it wants to
						continue with TEAM Phase 2 instead.  Assuming that the client permits
						renegotiation by sending a client_hello, then the server will respond
						with server_hello, a certificate and certificate_request messages.
						The client replies with certificate, client_key_exchange and
						certificate_verify messages.  Since this re-negotiation occurs within
						the encrypted TLS channel, it does not reveal client certificate details.
					</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Session Resumption" anchor="S-R">
					<t>
						The purpose of the sessionId within the TLS protocol and the Server-
						Identifier TLV in TEAM is to allow for improved efficiency in the
						case where a client repeatedly attempts to authenticate to an EAP
						server within a short period of time.  This capability is
						particularly useful for support of wireless roaming.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						In order to help the peer choose a sessionID that belongs to the
						specific server, the EAP server MAY send an identifier (Server-
						Identifier TLV) that the peer can use as a hint.  The Server-
						Identifier TLV MAY be sent in the first TEAM packet from the EAP
						server to the peer.  In order to detect modification of the Server-
						Identifier TLV, the Server-Identifier TLV is included in calculation
						of the compound MAC.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						It is left up to the peer whether to attempt to continue a previous
						session, thus shortening the TEAM Phase 1 conversation.  Typically the
						peer's decision will be made based on the time elapsed since the
						previous authentication attempt to that EAP server.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Based on the sessionId chosen by the peer, and the time elapsed since
						the previous authentication, the EAP server will decide whether to
						allow the continuation, or whether to choose a new session.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the EAP server is resuming a previously established session, then
						it MUST include only a TLS change_cipher_spec message and a TLS
						finished handshake message after the server_hello message.  The
						finished message contains the EAP server's authentication response to
						the peer.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the preceding server_hello message sent by the EAP server in the
						preceding EAP-Request packet indicated the resumption of a previous
						session, then the peer MUST send only the change_cipher_spec and
						finished handshake messages.  The finished message contains the
						peer's authentication response to the EAP server. The latter contains
						the EAP server's authentication response to the peer. The peer will
						verify the hash in order to authenticate the EAP server.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If authentication fails, then the peer and EAP-server MUST follow the
						error handling behavior specified in <xref target="E-H"/>
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Even if the session is successfully resumed with the same EAP server,
						the peer and EAP server MUST NOT assume that either will skip inner
						EAP methods.  The peer may have roamed to a network which may use the
						same EAP server, but may require conformance with a different
						authentication policy, and therefore may require inner EAP
						authentication methods.					
					</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Version Negotiation" anchor="V-N">
					<t>
						TEAM packets contain a three bit version field, which enables TEAM
						implementations to be backward compatible with previous versions of
						the protocol.  This specification documents version1 of the TEAM
						protocol; implementations of this specification MUST use a version
						field set to 1.  Version negotiation proceeds as follows:
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						<list style="numbers">
							<t>
								In the first EAP-Request sent with EAP-Type=TEAM, the EAP server
								MUST set the version field to the highest supported version number.
								<vspace blankLines="1"/>
							</t>
							<t>
								If the EAP peer supports that version of the protocol, it MUST
								respond with an EAP-Response of EAP-Type=TEAM, and the version
								number proposed by the EAP server.
								<vspace blankLines="1"/>
							</t>
							<t>
								If the EAP peer does not support that version, it responds with an
								EAP-Response of EAP-Type=TEAM and the highest supported version number.
								<vspace blankLines="1"/>
							</t>
							<t>
								If the TEAM server does not support the version number proposed by
								the TEAM peer, it either starts a different EAP type or terminates
								the conversation by sending an EAP-Failure, depending on the server policy.
								<vspace blankLines="1"/>
							</t>
						</list>
						The version negotiation procedure guarantees that the EAP peer and
						server will agree to the latest version supported by both parties.
						If version negotiation fails, then use of TEAM will not be possible,
						and another mutually acceptable EAP method will need to be negotiated
						if authentication is to proceed.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The TEAM version field is not protected by TLS and therefore can be
						modified in transit.  In order to detect modification of the TEAM
						version which could occur as part of a "downgrade" attack,  the peer
						and EAP server check if the version it sent during negotiation is
						same as the version claimed to be received by the other party.  Each
						party uses the Crypto-Binding TLV (<xref target="Cryp-B-TLV"/>)
						to inform the other party of the
						version number it received during the TEAM version negotiation.  The
						receiver of the Crypto-Binding TLV must verify that the version in
						the Crypto-Binding TLV matches the version it sent during TEAM
						version negotiation.

			<section title="TEAM Phase 2" anchor="T-P-2">
				<t>
					The second part of the TEAMv2 conversation typically consists of a
					complete EAP conversation occurring within the TLS session negotiated
					in TEAM Phase 1, ending with protected termination using the Result
					TLV.  TEAM Phase 2 will occur only if establishment of a new TLS
					session in Phase 1 is successful or a TLS session is successfully
					resumed in Phase 1.  In cases where a new TLS session is established
					in TEAMv2 Phase 1, the first payload of the Phase 2 conversation MAY be
					sent by the EAP server along with the finished message to save a
					round-trip.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Phase 2 SHOULD NOT occur if the EAP Server authenticates
					unsuccessfully, and MUST NOT occur if establishment of the TLS
					session in Phase 1 was not successful or a TLS fatal error has been
					sent terminating the conversation.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Since all packets sent within the TEAM Phase 2 conversation occur
					after TLS session establishment, they are protected using the
					negotiated TLS ciphersuite.  All EAP packets of the EAP conversation
					in Phase 2 including the EAP header of the inner EAP method are
					protected using the negotiated TLS ciphersuite.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Phase 2 may not always include a EAP conversation within the TLS
					session, referred to in this document as inner EAP methods.  However,
					Phase 2 MUST always end with either protected termination or protected
					error termination (e.g. TLS alert).
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Within Phase 2, protected EAP conversation and protected termination
					packets are always carried within TLVs.  There are TLVs defined for
					specific purposes such as carrying EAP-authentication messages and
					carrying cryptographic binding information.  New TLVs may be developed for other
					purposes.
				</t>
				<section title="Protected Conversation" anchor="P-C">
					<t>
						Phase 2 of the TEAM conversation typically begins with the EAP
						server sending an optional EAP-Request/Identity packet to the peer,
						protected by the TLS ciphersuite negotiated in Phase 1 of TEAM.  The
						peer responds with an EAP-Response/Identity packet to the EAP server,
						containing the peer's userId.  Since this Identity Request/Response
						exchange is protected by the ciphersuite negotiated in TLS, it is not
						vulnerable to snooping or packet modification attacks.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						After the TLS session-protected Identity exchange, the EAP server
						will then select authentication method(s) for the peer, and will send
						an EAP-Request with the Type field set to the initial method.  As
						described in <xref target="RFC3748"/>,
						the peer can NAK the suggested EAP method,
						suggesting an alternative.  Since the NAK will be sent within the TLS
						channel, it is protected from snooping or packet modification.  As a
						result, an attacker snooping on the exchange will be unable to inject
						NAKs in order to "negotiate down" the authentication method.  An
						attacker will also not be able to determine which EAP method was
						negotiated.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The EAP conversation within the TLS protected session may involve a
						sequence of zero or more EAP authentication methods; it completes
						with the protected termination described in <xref target="P-T"/>
						Several TLVs may be included in each Request and Response.  EAP packets are
						always encapsulated within EAP Payload TLVs.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						In a typical EAP conversation, the result of the conversation is
						communicated by sending EAP Success or EAP Failure packets after the
						EAP method is complete.  The EAP Success or Failure packet is
						considered the last packet of the EAP conversation; and therefore
						cannot be used when sequences need to be supported.  Hence, instead
						of using the EAP Success or EAP Failure packet, both peer and EAP
						server MUST use the Intermediate-Result TLV (<xref target="I-R-TLV"/>)
						to communicate the result.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						In a typical EAP conversation, the EAP Success or EAP Failure is
						considered the last packet of the EAP conversation.  Within TEAM,
						the EAP server can start another EAP method after success or failure
						of the previous EAP method inside the protected session.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						 In a sequence of more than one EAP authentication method, to make
						sure the same parties are involved in tunnel establishment and
						successful completion of previous inner EAP methods, before
						completing negotiation of the next EAP method, both peer and EAP
						server MUST use crypto binding (Crypto-Binding TLV).
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>						
						The Intermediate-Result TLV is used to indicate the result of a
						individual successful EAP method, and the Result TLV (<xref target="R-TLV"/>)
						is used to indicate result of the entire TEAM conversation.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The Intermediate-Result and Crypto-Binding TLVs MUST be sent after
						each EAP method that was successful.  If the EAP method failed, or if
						the EAP method negotiation did not complete, then an Intermediate-
						Result TLV MAY be included, and the Crypto-Binding TLV MUST NOT be
						included.  An exception is that the Crypto-Binding TLV MUST be sent
						along with a protected success/failure indication (see
						<xref target="P-T"/>).
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If these TLVs are not sent after a successful EAP method, it should
						be considered a tunnel compromise error by peer and EAP server,
						resulting in the termination of the conversation (as described in <xref target="E-H"/>).
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						A subsequent EAP conversation can be started after both TLVs are
						exchanged in a TLV packet.  Alternatively, if a subsequent EAP
						conversation is being attempted, then in order to reduce round trips,
						both TLVs SHOULD be sent with the EAP-Payload of the first EAP packet
						of the next EAP conversation (for example, EAP- Identity or EAP
						packet of the EAP method).  Alternatively, if the next packet is the
						protected success/failure packet, then in order to reduce round
						trips, both TLVs MUST be sent with the protected success/failure packet.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the EAP server sends a valid Crypto-Binding TLV to the peer, the
						peer MUST respond with a Crypto-Binding TLV.  If the Crypto-Binding
						TLV is invalid, it should be considered a tunnel compromise error by
						the peer.  If the peer does not respond with a TLV packet containing
						the Crypto-Binding TLV, it MUST be considered a tunnel compromise
						error by the EAP server.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Within a TEAM part 2 conversation, a peer MAY request the trusted
						root of  a server certificate using a Server-Trusted-Root TLV (<xref target="S-T-R-TLV"/>), and
						the EAP server MAY respond with a Server-Trusted-Root TLV to the
						peer.  The Server-Trusted-Root TLV can be exchanged in regular
						authentication mode or server unauthenticated tunnel provisioning
						mode.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						After the peer has determined that it has successfully authenticated
						the EAP server and determined that the tunnel and inner EAP methods
						were between the same peer and EAP server by validating the Crypto-Binding TLV, 
						it MAY send one or more Server-Trusted-Root TLVs (marked
						as optional) to request the trusted root of server certificate from
						the EAP server. The peer may receive a response, but is not required
						to use the trusted root received from the EAP server.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the EAP server has determined that it has successfully
						authenticated the peer and determined that the tunnel and inner EAP
						methods were between the same peer and EAP server by validating the

				<section title="Protected Termination" anchor="P-T">
					<t>
						Phase 2 of the TEAM conversation is completed by the exchange of
						success/failure indications (Result TLV) within a TLV packet
						protected by the TLS session.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						Even if Crypto-Binding TLVs have been exchanged in previous
						conversations, the Crypto-Binding TLV MUST be included in both
						protected success/failure (Result TLV) indications.  If the TLVs are
						not included, or if the TLVs are invalid, it should be considered a
						tunnel compromise error, and the peer and EAP server MUST follow the
						rules described in <xref target="E-H"/>
						to abort the conversation.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The Result TLV is sent within the TLS channel.  The TEAM client then
						replies with a Result TLV.  The conversation concludes with the TEAM
						server sending a cleartext success/failure indication.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The only outcome which should be considered as successful
						authentication is when a Result TLV of Status=Success is answered by
						the peer with a Result TLV of Status=Success.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						The combinations (Result TLV=Failure, Result TLV=Success), (Result
						TLV=Failure, Result TLV=Failure), (no TLVs exchange or no protected
						success or failure) should be considered an authentication failure by
						both the peer and EAP server.  Once the peer and EAP server consider
						that authentiation has failed, these are the last packets inside the
						protected tunnel.  These combinations are considered an
						authentication failure regardless of whether a cleartext EAP Success
						or EAP Failure packet is subsequently sent.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the EAP server wants authentication to fail, it sends the TLV
						response with Result TLV=Failure.  If the EAP server sends a failure,
						the peer MUST respond with Result TLV=Failure and the Crypto-Binding
						TLV, without any other mandatory TLVs.  The Crypto-Binding TLV is
						calculated using the key derivation formula in Section 2.5; if for
						some reason one or more inner EAP method MSKs were not derived, then
						these MSKs are assumed to be null.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the EAP server has sent the success indication (Result
						TLV=Success), the peer is allowed to refuse to accept a Success
						message from the EAP server since the client's policy may require
						completion of certain EAP methods or the client may require
						credentials.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						If the EAP server has sent a success indication (Result TLV=success),
						and the peer wants authentication to fail, it sends the TLV response
						with Result TLV=Failure and Crypto-Binding TLV.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
						After the EAP-server returns success, if the peer wants to request
						the EAP server to continue conversation, it sends a Result
						TLV=Success along with a Request-Action TLV with the appropriate
						action (e.g. Negotiate-EAP, or Process-TLV).  If the Request-Action
						TLV is set to mandatory, then the EAP server MUST process the action,
						or return status=failure, closing the conversation inside the tunnel.
						If the Request-Action TLV is set to optional, then the EAP server can
						ignore the TLV and return Result TLV=Success again, closing the

				<section title="Provisioning of Credentials" anchor="P-O-C">

					<section title="Provisioning Inside a Server Authenticated TLS Tunnel" anchor="P-I-S-A-T">
						<t>
							After regular authentication in TEAM Phase 2, the peer and EAP
							server can use the Server-Trusted-Root TLV to request and provision
							peer credentials.  The provisioning payload is exchanged after the

							authenticated each other (either thru TLS handshake and/or inner

							<vspace blankLines="1"/>
							After the peer has determined that it has successfully

					<section title="Provisioning Inside a Server Unauthenticated TLS Tunnel" anchor="P-I-S-U-T">
						<t>
							In some cases, the peer may lack the credentials necessary to authenticate the
							server in the TLS handshake.  At the same time, bootstrapping the
							information to the peer out of band may be prohibitive from a
							deployment cost perspective.  It can rely on the inner EAP method
							using existing credentials to authenticate the server.  This
							provisioning mode provides ease of deployment at the cost of
							introducing man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities.  As a result,
							implementation of the server unauthenticated tunnel provisioning
							mode is OPTIONAL.
							<vspace blankLines="1"/>
							In this provisioning mode, as part of TEAM Phase 1, if the peer
							does not authenticate, or does not successfully authenticate the
							EAP server during TLS negotiation, it can decide to go into server
							unauthenticated tunnel provisioning mode.  While this section
							describes negotiation of a certificate-based ciphersuite within
							TLS, TEAM supports negotiation of other ciphersuites (for
							example, ciphersuites that do not use certificates such as
							anonymous DH) or extensions.  However, the conversation may
							slightly differ if other TLS ciphersuites or extensions are used.
							For example, in a certificate based TLS handshake, the peer
							verifies that the EAP server possesses the private key
							corresponding to the public key contained in the certificate
							presented by the EAP server.  However, the peer does not verify
							whether the certificate presented by the server chains to a
							provisioned trust anchor, as the peer may not be configured with a
							certificate trust anchor required to validate the server
							certificate.  If the peer cannot verify that the server possesses
							the corresponding private key, or if the certificate presented by
							the server is unacceptable for any reason other than the lack of an
							appropriate trust anchor, the peer MUST NOT use this provisioning
							mode.  Assuming that the server demonstrates possession of the
							private key, the peer continues with establishment of the tunnel
							(TEAM Phase 2).  As a result, it is possible that the TLS channel
							(TEAM Phase 2) may be terminated by an attacker.
							<vspace blankLines="1"/>
							The TEAM Phase 2 conversation is unchanged in this mode, except
							that the peer will only accept an EAP method supporting mutual
							authentication and key derivation that is compatible with its
							initial credentials (such as a password-based EAP method).  The
							peer then uses the Crypto-Binding TLV to validate that the same
							server terminates both the TLS channel and the successfully
							completed EAP method, thereby verifying that the exchange was not
							subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.  Assuming that the Crypto-
							Binding TLV exchange is successful, the peer will request and the

					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					However, note that in order to protect against reassembly lockup and
					denial of service attacks, it may be desirable for an implementation
					to set a maximum size for one such group of TLS messages.  Since a
					typical certificate chain is rarely longer than a few thousand
					octets, and no other field is likely to be anywhere near as long, a
					reasonable choice of maximum acceptable message length might be 64 KB.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					If this value is chosen, then fragmentation can be handled via the
					multilink PPP fragmentation mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC1990"/>.
					this is desirable, EAP methods are used in other applications such as 
					<xref target="IEEE.802-11.2007"/>
					and there may be cases in which multilink or the MRRU LCP
					option cannot be negotiated.  As a result, a TEAM implementation
					MUST provide its own support for fragmentation and reassembly.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Since EAP is an ACK-NAK protocol, fragmentation support can be added
					in a simple manner.  In EAP, fragments that are lost or damaged in
					transit will be retransmitted, and since sequencing information is
					provided by the Identifier field in EAP, there is no need for a
					fragment offset field as is provided in IPv4.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					TEAM fragmentation support is provided through addition of flag
					bits within the EAP-Response and EAP-Request packets, as well as a
					TLV Message Length field of four octets.  Flags include the Length
					included (L), More fragments (M), and TEAM Start (S) bits.  The L
					flag is set to indicate the presence of the four octet TLV Message
					Length field, and MUST be set only for the first fragment of a
					fragmented TLV message or set of messages.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					The TLV Message Length field in the TEAM header is not protected,
					and hence can be modified by a attacker.  The TLS record length in
					the TLS data is protected.  Hence, if the TLV Message length received
					in the first packet (with L bit set) is greater or less than the
					total size of TLS messages received including multiple fragments,
					then the TLV message length should be ignored.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					In order to protect against reassembly lockup and denial of service
					attacks, it may be desirable for an implementation to set a maximum
					size for a single group of Outer-TLV messages.  Since a typical
					certificate chain is rarely longer than a few thousand octets, and no
					other field is likely to be anywhere near as long, a reasonable
					choice of maximum acceptable message length for all the Outer-TLVs in
					a group of messages might be 64 KB.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					The M flag is set on all but the last fragment.  The S flag is set
					only within the TEAM start message sent from the EAP server to the
					peer.  The TLV Message Length field is four octets, and provides the
					total length of the TLV message or set of messages that is being
					fragmented; this simplifies buffer allocation.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					When a peer receives an EAP-Request packet with the M bit set, it
					MUST respond with an EAP-Response with EAP-Type=TEAM and no data.
					This serves as a fragment ACK.  The EAP server MUST wait until it
					receives the EAP-Response before sending another fragment.  In order
					to prevent errors in processing of fragments, the EAP server MUST
					increment the Identifier field for each fragment contained within an
					EAP-Request, and the peer MUST include this Identifier value in the
					fragment ACK contained within the EAP-Response.  Retransmitted
					fragments will contain the same Identifier value.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					Similarly, when the EAP server receives an EAP-Response with the M
					bit set, it MUST respond with an EAP-Request with EAP-Type=TEAM and
					no TLS data. This serves as a fragment ACK.  The EAP peer MUST wait
					until it receives the EAP-Request before sending another fragment.
					In order to prevent errors in the processing of fragments, the EAP
					server MUST increment the Identifier value for each fragment ACK
					contained within an EAP-Request, and the peer MUST include this
					Identifier value in the subsequent fragment contained within an EAP-
					Response.

					TEAM packets may include TLVs both inside and outside the TLS
					tunnel.  The term "Outer TLVs" is used to refer to optional TLVs
					outside the TLS tunnel, which are only allowed in the first two
					messages in the TEAM protocol.  That is the first EAP server to
					peer message and first peer to EAP server message.  If the message is
					fragmented, the whole set of messages is counted as one message. The
					term "Inner TLVs" is used to refer to TLVs sent within the TLS
					tunnel.
					<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					In TEAM Phase 1, Outer TLVs are used to help establishing the TLS
					tunnel, but no Inner TLVs are used.  Therefore the layering of TEAM Phase 1 is as follows:
