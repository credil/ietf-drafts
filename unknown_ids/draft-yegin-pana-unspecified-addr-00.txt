Internet-Draft     PANA with IPv4 Unspecified Address         March 2010


1.  Introduction

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
   [RFC5191] as a UDP-based protocol operates with the assumption that
   the PANA client (PaC) is already configured with an IP address.
   Private IPv4, globally-routable IPv4 [RFC1918] or IPv6, IPv4 or IPv6
   link-local are the types of addresses that can be configured by PaCs
   prior to running PANA [RFC5193].

   In case the PaC and the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) are on the
   same IP subnet, PaC can run PANA with the PAA prior to configuring an
   IP address.

   This document defines an extension of PANA to allow the PaC to use
   IPv4 unspecified address (0.0.0.0) until it gets authenticated/
   authorized; and configures an IP address afterwards (possibly using
   DHCP).  Such a feature is already available in Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344]
   where MN can use unspecified IPv4 address with Mobile IP protocol
   until it is assigned a home address, and also DHCP [RFC2131].

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Details

   Figure 1 is an example call flow that illustrates use of unspecified
   IPv4 address with the PaC during PANA authentication.  Note that
   there can be other ways for combining DHCP and PANA call flows.

    Figure 1: Example Call Flow for PANA with IPv4 Unspecified Address

   Step 1: The PaC initiates PANA by sending a broadcasted PCI.

   The source IPv4 address of the PCI is set to 0.0.0.0.  The
   destination IPv4 address is set to 255.255.255.255.

   Step 2: The PAA responds with a PAR message which has its source IPv4
   address set to the PAA's IP address, and the destination IPv4 address
   is set to 255.255.255.255.  If the PAA is capable of retrieving the
   PaC's L2 address from incoming PCI, then the PAR is L2-unicasted
   using that L2 address.  Otherwise, the PAR message will be L2-
   broadcasted.

   The PaC discovers the PAA's IPv4 address when it receives the PAR
   message.

Internet-Draft     PANA with IPv4 Unspecified Address         March 2010


   Step 3: The PaC sends the PAN message to the PAA's newly discovered
   IPv4 address.

   Steps 4-7: PANA and RADIUS carrying out the selected EAP method.

   Steps 8-11: Now that the PaC is authenticated, it proceeds to
   configuring service IP address using DHCPv4.  As soon as the new IPv4
   address is confirmed by the DHCPACK, the PaC can stop using the
   unspecified address.

   Step 12: The PaC can transmit and receive IP data packets using its
   IP address.

   A PAA implementation may not be capable of retrieving the PaC's L2
   address from L2 header of the incoming PANA messages, or be able to
   send a L2-unicast even if it could retrieve the address.  In such a
   case, the PAA sends PANA messages as L2-broadcast.  In order to
   prevent other PaCs from processing the messages destined for a
   specific PaC, each PaC is required to supply its own L2 address as a
   payload AVP to PCI and expect it to be echoed back by the PAA in the
   initial PAR.  PAC-L2-ADDR AVP is defined for this purpose.

   [TBD: Or, alternatively a randomly-generated token can be carried
   instead of the L2 address.  It serves the same purpose.]

   Note that any message beyond Step 2 would include the PAA-assigned
   and PaC-acknowledged PANA Session Id, hence use of PAC-L2-ADDR AVP is
   not needed for those messages.


3.  PaC Behavior

   A PaC shall use unspecified address as its source IP address until it
   configures another IP address.  The PaC shall send a PCI that carries
   its L2 address in the PAC-L2-ADDR AVP.  The PaC shall not include
   PAC-L2-ADDR AVP in any other message.

   The PaC shall silently drop any PAR that carries a PAC-L2-ADDR AVP
   whose L2 address payload does not match the L2 address on the
   receiving interface of the PaC.

   Any legacy PaC that does not implement this specification would
   automatically drop the incoming PAR that carries the PAC-L2-ADDR AVP
   as this is an unrecognized AVP.  This is the standard behavior
   defined in [RFC5191].

Internet-Draft     PANA with IPv4 Unspecified Address         March 2010


4.  PAA Behavior

   If a PAA receives a PCI whose source IP address is unspecified but
   that does not carry a PAC-L2-ADDR AVP, then it shall drop the PCI.
   The PAA shall drop any message with PAC-L2-ADDR AVP if the message
   type is other than PCI.  When the PAA is capable of retrieving the
   source L2 address of the incoming packets, if the address retrieved
   does not match the address in the PAC-L2-ADDR AVP payload, then the
   PAA shall drop the packet.

   When the PAA needs to send a packet to a PaC that is using an
   unspecified IP address, then the PAA shall set the destination IP
   address to 255.255.255.255.  The PAA should set the destination L2
   address to the source L2 address retrieved from the incoming PaC
   packet, when possible; otherwise set to L2 broadcast address.  If
   this is the very first PAR message in PANA session, then the PAA
   shall include a PAC-L2-ADDR AVP with the payload set to the L2
   address of the PaC.  The PAA shall not include PAC-L2-ADDR AVP in any
   other PANA message, as an already-assigned PANA Session Id serves the
   need.

   The PAA shall set the 'I' (IP Reconfiguration) bit of PAR messages in
   authentication and authorization phase so that the PaC proceeds to IP
   address configuration.


5.  AVP Definition

   This document defines one new AVP as described below.

5.1.  PAC-L2-ADDR AVP

   The PAC-L2-ADDR AVP (AVP Code TBD) contains a link-layer address of
   the PaC.  The first two octets represents the AddressType, which
   contains an Address Family defined in [IANAADFAM].  Address families
   other than that are defined for link-layer MUST NOT be used for this
   AVP.  The remaining octets encode the address value.  The length of
   the address value is determined by the AddressType.  The AddressType
   is used to discriminate the content and format of the remaining
   octets for the address value.


6.  Message Size Considerations

   Since IP fragmentation for IP packets using unspecified address is
   prohibited, link-layer MTU needs to be no less than the IP packet
   size carrying the largest PANA message in the case where EAP message
   size is the same as the minimum EAP MTU size (i.e., 1020 octets



Yegin & Ohba            Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     PANA with IPv4 Unspecified Address         March 2010


   [RFC3748]).  Such a PANA message is the very first PANA-Auth-Request
   message in Authentication and Authorization phase carrying the
   following AVPs.

   o  An EAP-Payload AVP that carries an EAP-Request of size being equal
      to the minimum EAP MTU size.  The size of such an AVP is 1020 + 8
      = 1028 octets.

   o  A Nonce AVP that carries the largest nonce of size 256 octets.
      The size of such an AVP is 256 + 8 = 264 octets.

   o  An Integrity-Algorithm AVP (12 octets)

   o  A PRF-Algorithm AVP (12 octets)

   o  A PAC-L2-ADDR AVP (L2_ADDR_LEN + 10 octets) where L2_ADDR_LEN
      represents the length of the link-layer address in octets.  For
      example, L2_ADDR_LEN = 6 for IEEE 802 MAC address.

   In this case, the PANA message size including PANA header (16
   octets), UDP header (8 octets) and IPv4 header (20 octets) is 1028 +
   264 + 12 + 12 + L2_ADDR_LEN + 10 + 16 + 8 + 20 = (1370 + L2_ADDR_LEN)
   octets.  Therefore, the link-layer MTU size for IP packets MUST be no
   less than (1370 + L2_ADDR_LEN) octets when unspecified IPv4 address
   is used for PANA.  Note that Ethernet (MTU = 1500 octets) meets this
   requirement.

   PANA as an EAP lower-layer reports the EAP MTU to the EAP layer, so
   that EAP methods can perform appropriate fragmentation [RFC3748].
   The EAP MTU is calculated as follows:

   EAP_MTU = L2_MTU - (350 + L2_ADDR_LEN)

   In the above formula, the value of (350 + L2_ADDR_LEN) is the PANA
   overhead (IP and PANA headers, and PANA AVPs except for the EAP-
   Payload AVP payload).


7.  Security Considerations

   When the PAA is not capable of L2-unicasting PANA messages to the
   target PaC, other nodes on the same subnet can receive those
   messages.  This may pose a risk if there is any confidential data
   exposed in the messages.  Typically no such exposure exists as PANA,
   EAP, an EAP methods are defined in a way they can also be used in
   wireless networks where snooping is always a possibility.

8.  IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 5.1 and following the new IANA allocation
   policy on PANA message [I-D.arkko-pana-iana], a new AVP Code for PAC-
   L2-ADDR AVP needs to be assigned by IANA.
