A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the
establishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or
IPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6 or
UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal. The control protocol (TSP) is
used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A
mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6
networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT or on IPv6
only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel
servers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP protocol within
the model of the tunnel broker model.

      <t>
This document first describes the TSP framework, the protocol details,
and the different profiles used. It then describes the applicability
of TSP in different environments, some of which were described in the
v6ops scenario documents.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

</t>
  </section>
   <section title="Description of the TSP framework">
    <t>
Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) is a signaling protocol to setup tunnel
parameters between two tunnel end-points. TSP is implemented as a tiny
client code in the requesting tunnel end-point.  The other end-point
is the server that will setup the tunnel service. TSP uses XML <xref
target="W3C.REC-xml-20040204" /> basic messaging over TCP or UDP.
The use of XML gives extensibility and easy option processing.
</t>
<t>
TSP negotiates tunnel parameters between the two tunnel
end-points. Parameters that are always negociated are:
</t>
<t>
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
authentication of the users, using any kind of authentication
mechanism (through SASL <xref target="RFC4422" />) including
anonymous

<t>
  IP address assignment for the tunnel endpoints
</t>
        <t>
DNS registration of the IP end point address (AAAA)
</t>
  </list>
<t>
  Other tunnel parameters that may be negotiated are:
</t>
  <list style="symbols">
<t>
Tunnel keep-alive
</t>
<t>
IPv6 prefix assignment when the client is a router
</t>
        <t>
DNS delegation of the inverse tree, based on the IPv6 prefix assigned
</t>
        <t>
Routing protocols
</t>
   
      </list>
</t>
      <t>
The tunnel encapsulation can be explicitly specified by the client, or
can be determined during the TSP exchange by the broker. The latter is used to
detect the presence of NAT in the path and select IPv6 over UDP-IPv4
encapsulation.
</t>
<t>
The TSP connection can be established between two nodes, where each
node can control a tunnel end-point.  
</t>
    <t>
The nodes involved in the framework are:

<list style="numbers">
    <t>the TSP client</t>
    <t>client tunnel end-point</t>
    <t>the TSP server</t>
    <t>server tunnel end-point</t>

  </list>

1,3 and 4 form the tunnel broker model <xref target="RFC3053" />,
where 3 is the tunnel broker and 4 is the tunnel server (<xref
target="Broker_Model" />). The tunnel broker may control one or many
tunnel servers. </t>
<t>
In its simplest model, one node is the client configured as a tunnel
end-point (1 and 2 on same node), and the second node is the server
configured as the other tunnel end-point (3 and 4 on same node). This
model is shown in
<xref target="Server_Model"/>

<t>
From the point of view of an operating system, TSP is implemented as a
client application which is able to configure network parameters of
the operating system.
</t>
<section title="NAT Discovery">
  <t>
TSP is also used to discover if a NAT is in the path. In this
discovery mode, the client sends a TSP message over UDP, containing
its tunnel request information (such as its source IPv4 address) to
the TSP server. The TSP server compares the IPv4 source address of the
packet with the address in the TSP message. If they differ, one or
many IPv4 NAT is in the path.
</t>
  <t>
If an IPv4 NAT is discovered, then IPv6 over UDP-IPv4 tunnel encapsulation is
selected. Once the TSP signaling is done, the tunnel is established over the
same UDP channel used for TSP, so the same NAT address-port mapping is used
for both the TSP session and the IPv6 traffic.  If no IPv4 NAT is detected in
the path by the TSP server, then IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation is used.
</t>
        <t>A keep-alive mechanism is also included to keep the NAT
mapping active.</t>

<t>The IPv4 NAT discovery builds the most effective tunnel for all
cases, including in a dynamic situation where the client moves.
</t>
      </section>
             <section title="Any encapsulation">
        <t>
TSP is used to negotiate IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels, IPv6 over UDP-IPv4
tunnels and IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels.  IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels are used
in the Dual Stack Transition Mechanism (DSTM) together with TSP <xref
target="I-D.bound-dstm-exp"/>.
</t>
      </section>
  <section title="Mobility">
        <t>
When a node moves to a different IP network (i.e. change of its IPv4
address when doing IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation), the TSP client
reconnects automatically to the broker to re-establish the tunnel
(keep-alive mechanism). On the IPv6 layer, if the client uses user
authentication, the same IPv6 address and prefix are kept and
re-established, even if the IPv4 address or tunnel encapsulation type
changes.
</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Advantages of TSP">
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
Tunnels established by TSP are static tunnels, which are more secure
than automated tunnels (<xref target="RFC3964" />). No 3rd party relay
required.
          </t>
<t>
Stability of the IP address and prefix, enabling applications needing
stable address to be deployed and used. For example, when tunneling
IPv6, there is no dependency on the underlying IPv4 address.
</t>
          <t>
Prefix assignment supported. Can use provider address space.
</t>
          <t>
Signaling protocol flexible and extensible (XML, SASL)
          </t>
          <t>
One solution to many encapsulation techniques: v6 in v4, v4 in v6, v6
over UDP over v4. Can be extended to other encapsulation types, such
as v6 in v6.
</t>
          <t>
Discovery of IPv4 NAT in the path, establishing the most optimized
tunnelling technique depending on the discovery.

  The Tunnel Setup Protocol is initiated from a client node to a
  tunnel broker. The Tunnel Setup Protocol has three phases:
</t>
<t>  
  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Authentication phase:">
      The Authentication phase is when the tunnel broker/server
      advertises its capability to a tunnel client and when a tunnel
      client authenticate to the broker/server.
    </t>
    <t hangText="Command phase:">
      The command phase is where the client requests or updates a
      tunnel.
    </t>
    <t hangText="Response phase:">
      The response phase is where the tunnel client receives the
      request response from the tunnel broker/server, and the client
      accepts or rejects the tunnel offered.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
For each command sent by a Tunnel Client there is an expected response
by the server.
</t>

<t>
After the response phase is completed, a tunnel is established as
requested by the client. If requested, periodic keep-alive packets can
be sent from the client to the server.

  The TSP client builds its UDP packet as described above and sends it

  values for the sequence number and timestamp MUST be sent back to
  the client. The TSP client can use the timestamp to determine the
  retransmission timeout (current time minus the packet
  timestamp). The client SHOULD retransmit the packet when the
  retransmission timeout is reached. The retransmitted packet MUST use
  the same sequence number as the original packet so that the server
  can detect duplicate packets. The client SHOULD use exponential
  backoff when retransmitting packets to avoid network congestion.

Tunnel types must be registered with IANA and their profiles are defined in
<xref target="IANA"/>. Authentication is done using <xref

registered SASL mechanism. Description of such mechanisms is not in the scope
of this document.

The tunnel client can then choose to close the session if none of the
capabilities fits its needs. If the tunnel client chooses to continue,
it authenticates to the server using one of the advertised mechanism
using SASL. If the authentication fails, the server sends an error
message and closes the session.

  authentication where the tunnel client requests an anonymous
  authentication which is not supported by the server.

  The example in <xref target="command_response_sequence" /> shows a
  client requesting an anonymous v6udpv4 tunnel, indicating that a
  keep-alive packet will be sent every 30 seconds. The tunnel broker
  responds with the tunnel parameters and indicates its acceptance of
  the keepalive period (<xref target="keepalive" />). Finally, the
  client sends an accept message to the server.
</t>
<t>
  Once the accept message has been sent, the server and client
  configure their tunnel endpoint based on the negotiated tunnel
  parameters.
</t>

<section title="Tunnel establishment">
<section title="IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels">  
  <t>
    Once the TSP signaling is completed, a tunnel can be established
    on the tunnel server and client node. If a v6v4 tunnel has been
    negotiated, then an IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel <xref target="RFC4213"
    /> is established using the operating system tunneling
    interface. On the client node, this is accomplished by the TSP
    client calling the appropriate OS commands or system calls.
  </t>
</section>
<section title="IPv6-over-UDP tunnels" anchor="v6udpv4_establishment">
<t>
  If a v6udpv4 tunnel is configured, the same source/destination
  address and port used during the TSP signaling are used to configure
  the v6udpv4 tunnel. If a NAT is in the path between the TSP client
  and tunnel broker, the TSP signaling session will have created a UDP
  state in the NAT. By reusing the same UDP socket parameters to
  transport IPv6, the traffic will flow across the NAT using the same
  state.

<figure anchor="IPv6_over_UDP" title="IPv6 transport over UDP">

                +------+-----------+--------+
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
  <t>
    At any time, a client may re-establish a TSP signaling
    session. The client disconnects the current tunnel and starts a
    new TSP signaling session as described in <xref
    target="udpv4_signaling" />.  If a NAT is present and the new TSP
    session uses the same UDP mapping in the NAT as for the tunnel,
    the tunnel broker will need to disconnect the client tunnel before
    the client can establish a new TSP session.
  </t>
</section>

</section>
<section title="Tunnel Keep-alive" anchor="keepalive">
  <t>
    A TSP client may select to send periodic keep-alive messages to
    the server in order to maintain its tunnel connectivity. This
    allows the client to detect network changes and enable automatic
    tunnel re-establishment. In the case of IPv6-over-UDP tunnels,
    periodic keep-alive can help refresh the connection state in a NAT
    if such device is in the tunnel path.
  </t>
  <t>
    For IPv6-over-IPv4 and IPv6-over-UDP tunnels, the keep-alive
    message is an ICMPv6 echo request <xref target="RFC4443"/> sent
    from the client to the tunnel server. The IPv6 destination address
    of the echo message MUST be the address from the 'keepalive'
    element sent in the tunnel response during the TSP signaling
    (<xref target="cmd_response_phase" />). The echo message is sent
    over the configured tunnel.
  </t>
  <t>
    The tunnel server responds to the ICMPv6 echo requests and can
    keep track of which tunnel is active. Any client traffic can also
    be used to verify if the tunnel is active. This can be used by the
    broker to disconnect tunnels that are no longer in use.
  </t>
  <t>
  The broker can send a different keep-alive interval from the value
  specified in the client request. The client MUST conform to the
  broker specified keep-alive interval. The client SHOULD apply a
  random "jitter" value to avoid synchronization of keep-alive
  messages from many clients to the server <xref target="FJ93"/>. This
  is achieved by using an interval value in the range of [0.75T -
  T], where T is the keep-alive interval specified by the server.

</t>

<section title="XML Messaging">
<t>
  This section describes the XML messaging used in the TSP signaling
  during the command and response phase. The XML elements and
  attributes are listed in the DTD (<xref target="DTD_section"/>).

  <section title="Tunnel">
    <t>
      The client and server use the tunnel token with an action
      attribute. Valid actions for this profile are : 'create',
      'delete', 'info', 'accept' and 'reject'.
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="create:">
  action used to request a new tunnel or update an existing
  tunnel. Sent by the tunnel client.
</t>
<t hangText="delete:">
  action used to remove an existing tunnel from the server. Sent by
  the tunnel client.
</t>
<t hangText="info:">
  action used to request current properties of an existing
  tunnel. This action is also used by the tunnel broker to send tunnel
  parameters following a client 'create' action.
</t>
<t hangText="accept:">
  action used by the client to acknowledge the server that the tunnel
  parameters are accepted. The client will establish a tunnel.

  The tunnel 'lifetime' attribute is set by the tunnel broker and
  specifies the lifetime of the tunnel in minutes. The lifetime is an
  administratively set value. When a tunnel lifetime is expired, it is
  disconnected on the tunnel server.
</t>
    <t>
      The 'tunnel' message contains three elements:

  </section>
  <section title="Client Element">
    <t>
      The client element contains 3 sub-elements: 'address', 'router'
      and 'keepalive'. These elements are used to describe the client
      request and will be used by the server to create the appropriate
      tunnel. The client element is the only element sent by a client.
    </t>
    <t>
      The 'address' element is used to identify the client IP endpoint
      of the tunnel. When tunneling over IPv4, the client MUST send
      only its IPv4 address to the server. When tunneling over IPv6,
      the client MUST only send its IPv6 address to the server.
    </t>
    <t>
      The broker then returns the assigned IPv6 or IPv4 address
      endpoint and domain name inside the 'client' element when the
      tunnel is created or updated. If supported by the broker, the
      'client' element MAY contain the registered DNS name for the
      address endpoint assigned to the client.
    </t>
    <t>
      Optionally a client MAY send a 'router' element to ask for
      a prefix delegation.
    </t>
    <t>
      Optionally, a client MAY send a 'keepalive' element which
      contains the keep-alive time interval requested by the client.

  </section>
  <section title="Server Element">
    <t>
      The 'server' element contains 2 elements: 'address' and
      'router'. These elements are used to describe the server's
      tunnel endpoint. The 'address' element is used to provide both
      IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the server's tunnel endpoint, while
      the 'router' element provides information for the routing method
      chosen by the client.
    </t>

When a client is capable of both IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv6 over UDP over
IPv4 encapsulation, it can request the broker, by using the "v6anyv4"
tunnel mode, to determine if it is behind a NAT and to send the
appropriate tunnel encapsulation mode as part of the response. The
client can also explicitly request an IPv6 over UDP over IPv4 tunnel
by specifying "v6udpv4" in its request.

<section title="Applicability of TSP in Different Networks">
<t>
This section describes the applicability of TSP in different networks.
</t>
<section title="Provider Networks with Enterprise Customers">
<t>
In a provider network where IPv4 is dominant, a tunnelled
infrastructure can be used to provide IPv6 services to the enterprise
customers, before a full IPv6 native infrastructure is built.  In
order to start deploying in a controlled manner and to give enterprise
customers a prefix, the TSP framework is used.  The TSP server can be
in the core, in the aggregation points or in the PoPs to offer the
service to the customers. IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation can be used. If
the customers are behind an IPv4 NAT, then IPv6 over UDP-IPv4
encapsulation can be used.  TSP can be used in combination of other
techniques.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Provider Networks with Home/Small Office Customers">
<t>
In a provider network where IPv4 is dominant, a tunnelled
infrastructure can be used to provider IPv6 services to the home/small
office customers, before a full IPv6 native infrastructure is built.
The small networks such as Home/Small offices have a non-upgradable
gateway with NAT. TSP with NAT traversal is used to offer IPv6
connectivity and a prefix to the internal network.
</t>
<t>
Automation of the prefix assignment and DNS delegation, done by TSP,
is a very important feature for a provider in order to substantially
decrease support costs. The provider can use the same AAA database
that is used to authenticate the IPv4 broadband users.  Customers can
deploy home IPv6 networks without any intervention of the provider
support people.
</t>
<t>
With the NAT discovery function of TSP, providers can use the same TSP
infrastructure for both NAT and non-NAT parts of the network.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Enterprise Networks">
<t>
In an enterprise network where IPv4 is dominant, a tunnelled
infrastructure can be used to provider IPv6 services to the IPv6
islands (hosts or networks) inside the enterprise, before a full IPv6
native infrastructure is built <xref target="RFC4057" />. TSP can be
used to give IPv6 connectivity, prefix and routing for the
islands. This gives to the enterprise a full control deployment of
IPv6 while maintaining automation and permanence of the IPv6
assignments to the islands.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Wireless Networks">
<t>
In a wireless network where IPv4 is dominant, hosts and networks move
and change IPv4 address. TSP enables the automatic re-establishment of
the tunnel when the IPv4 address change.
</t>
<t>
In a wireless network where IPv6 is dominant, hosts and networks
move. TSP enables the automatic re-establishment of the IPv4 over IPv6
tunnel.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Unmanaged networks">
<t>
An unmanaged network is where no network manager or staff is available
to configure network devices <xref target="RFC3904" />.  TSP is
particularly useful in this context where automation of all necessary
information for the IPv6 connectivity is handled by TSP: tunnel
end-points parameters, prefix assignment, dns delegation, routing.
</t>
<t>
An unmanaged network may be behind a NAT, maybe not. With the NAT
discovery function, TSP works automatically in both cases.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Mobile Hosts and Mobile Networks">
<t>
Mobile hosts are common and used. Laptops moving from wireless, wired
in office, home, ... are examples. They often have IPv4 connectivity,
but not necessarily IPv6. TSP framework enables the mobile hosts to
have IPv6 connectivity wherever they are, by having the TSP client
send updated information of the new environment to the TSP server,
when a change occurs. Together with NAT discovery and traversal, the
mobile host can be always IPv6 connected wherever it is.
</t>
<t>
Mobile here means only the change of IPv4 address. Mobile-IP mechanisms
and fast hand-off take care of additional constraints in mobile
environments.
</t>
<t>
Mobile networks share the applicability of the mobile hosts. Moreover,
in the TSP framework, they also keep their prefix assignment and can
control the routing. NAT discovery can also be used.
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="IANA">
<t>
A tunnel type registry should be setup by IANA. The following strings
are defined in this document:
</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>"v6v4" for IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation (using IPv4 protocol 41)</t>
<t>"v6udpv4" for IPv6 in UDP in IPv4 encapsulation</t>
<t>"v6anyv4" for IPv6 in IPv4 or IPv6 in UDP in IPv4 encapsulation</t>
<t>"v4v6" for IPv4 in IPv6 encapsulation.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Registration of a new tunnel type can be obtained on a first come
first served policy <xref target="RFC2434" />. A new registration
should provide a point of contact, the tunnel type string, and a brief
description on the applicability.
</t>
<t>IANA assigned 3653 as the TSP port number.</t>

</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
Authentication of the TSP session uses the SASL <xref target="RFC4422"
/> framework, where the authentication mechanism is negotiated between
the client and the server. The framework uses the level of
authentication needed for securing the session, based on the policies.
</t>
<t>
Static tunnels are created when the TSP negotiation is
terminated. Static tunnels are not open gateways and exhibit less
security issues than automated tunnels. Static IPv6 in IPv4 tunnels
security considerations are described in <xref target="RFC4213" />.
</t>
<t>
  In order to help ensure that the traffic is traceable to its correct
  source network, a tunnel server implementation should allow ingress
  filtering on the user tunnel <xref target="RFC3704" />.
</t>

<t>
A customer A behind a NAT can use a large number of (private) IPv4
addresses and/or source ports and request multiple v6udpv4
tunnels. That would quickly saturate the tunnel server capacity. The
tunnel broker implementation should offer a way to throttle and limit
the number of tunnel established to the same IPv4 address.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Conclusion">
<t>
The Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) is applicable in many environments,
such as: providers, enterprises, wireless, unmanaged networks, mobile
hosts and networks. TSP gives the two tunnel end-points the ability
to negotiate tunnel parameters, as well as prefix assignment, dns
delegation and routing in an authenticated session. It also provides
IPv4 NAT discovery function by using the most effective encapsulation.
It also supports the IPv4 mobility of the nodes.
</t>

<abstract>
<t>
   Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and
   other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and
   deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a
   new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication
   algorithm for IPSec).  To insure that such quantities have consistent
   values and interpretations in different implementations, their
   assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF
   protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA).
</t>
<t>
   In order for the IANA to manage a given name space prudently, it
   needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can
   be assigned. If the IANA is expected to play a role in the management
   of a name space, the IANA must be given clear and concise
   instructions describing that role.  This document discusses issues
   that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning
   values to a name space and provides guidelines to document authors on
   the specific text that must be included in documents that place
   demands on the IANA.

<section title="Error codes">

<t>
Error codes are sent as a numeric value followed by a text message
describing the code, similar to SMTP. The codes are sent from the
broker to the client. The currently defined error codes are showned
below. Upon receiving an error, the client will display the
appropriate message to the user.
</t>

<t>
New error messages may be defined in the future. For interoperability
purpose, the error code range to use should be from 300 to 599.
</t>

<t>
The reply code 200 is used to inform the client that an action
successfully completed. For example, this reply code is used in
response to an authentication request and a tunnel creation request.
</t>
<t>
  The server may redirect the client to another broker. The details on
  how these brokers are knowned or discovered is beyond the scope of
  this document. When a list of tunnel brokers follows the error code
  as a referal service, then 1000 is added to the error code.
