1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the algorithm identifiers and specifies 
   parameters for the message digest algorithms SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-
   384, and SHA-512 for use with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) 
   [RFC3852].  The message digest algorithms are defined in [RFC3874] 
   and [SHA2].  If an implementation chooses to support one of the 
   algorithms discussed in this document, then the implementation MUST 
   do so as described in this document. 

   This document does not define new identifiers; they are taken from 
   [RFC3874] and [RFC4055].  Additionally, the parameters follow the 
   conventions specified therein.  Therefore, there is no ASN.1 module 
   included in this document. 

   Note that [RFC4231] specifies the conventions for use of for the 
   message authentication code (MAC) algorithms: HMAC with SHA-224, HMAC 
   with SHA-256, HMAC with SHA-384, and HMAC with SHA-512. 

2. SHA2 Message Digest Algorithms 

   Digest algorithm identifiers are located in the SignedData 
   digestAlgorithms field, the SignerInfo digestAlgorithm field, the 
   DigestedData digestAlgorithm field, and the AuthenticatedData 
   digestAlgorithm field.

   Digest values are located in the DigestedData digest field and the 
   Message Digest authenticated attribute.  In addition, digest values 
   are input to signature algorithms. 

   In CMS, the digest algorithm identifiers use the AlgorithmIdentifier 
   syntax, which is included here for convenience: 

     AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  { 
       algorithm   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
       parameters  ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  } 

   The algorithm field is discussed in Sections 2.1-2.4 for each message 
   digest algorithm. 

   The following addresses the parameters field: 

   There are two possible encodings for the SHA AlgorithmIdentifier 
   parameters field.  The two alternatives arise from the fact that when 
   the 1988 syntax for AlgorithmIdentifier was translated into the 1997 
   syntax, the OPTIONAL associated with the AlgorithmIdentifier 
   parameters got lost.  Later the OPTIONAL was recovered via a defect 
   report, but by then many people thought that algorithm parameters 
   were mandatory.  Because of this history some implementations encode 
   parameters as a NULL element and others omit them entirely.  The 
   correct encoding is to omit the parameters field; however, 
   implementations MUST also handle a SHA AlgorithmIdentifier parameters 
   field which contains a NULL. 

   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameters field is OPTIONAL.  If present, 
   the parameters field MUST contain a NULL.  Implementations MUST 
   accept SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.  
   Implementations MUST accept SHA2 AlgorithmIdentifiers with NULL 
   parameters.  Implementations SHOULD generate SHA2 
   AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters. 

2.1. SHA-224 

   The SHA-224 message digest algorithm is defined in [RFC3874].  The 
   algorithm identifier for SHA-224 is: 

     id-sha224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 4 } 

   The parameters are as specified in Section 2.

2.2. SHA-256 

   The SHA-256 message digest algorithm is defined in [SHA2].  The 
   algorithm identifier for SHA-256 is: 

    id-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
        joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 1 } 

   The parameters are as specified in Section 2. 

2.3. SHA-384 

   The SHA-384 message digest algorithm is defined in [SHA2].  The 
   algorithm identifier for SHA-384 is: 

     id-sha384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 2 } 

   The parameters are as specified in Section 2. 

2.4. SHA-512 

   The SHA-256 message digest algorithm is defined in [SHA2].  The 
   algorithm identifier for SHA-512 is: 

     id-sha512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
       joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) 3 } 

   The parameters are as specified in Section 2. 

3. Security Considerations 

   No new security considerations are added to those already documented 
   in [RFC3370], [RFC3874], and [RFC4055]. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
