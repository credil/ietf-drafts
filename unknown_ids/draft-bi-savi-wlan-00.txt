                         draft-bi-savi-wlan-00.txt 

Abstract 

   This document describes a source address validation solution for WLAN 
   enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms. This mechanism snoops 
   NDP and DHCP to bind IP address with MAC address, and relies on the 
   security of MAC address guaranteed by 802.11i or other mechanisms to 
   filter IP spoofing packets. It can work in the special situations 
   described in the charter of SAVI workgroup, such as multiple MAC 
   addresses on one interface. This document describes three different 
   deployment scenarios, with solutions for migration of mapping entries 
   when hosts move from one access point to another.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes a mechanism to perform per packet IP source 
   address validation in WLAN. This mechanism performs ND snooping or 
   DHCP snooping to bind allocated IP address with authenticated MAC 
   address. Static addresses are bound to the MAC addresses of 
   corresponding stations manually. Then the mechanism can check 
   validity of source IP address in local packets according to the 
   binding association. The security of MAC address is assured by 
   802.11i or other mechanisms, thus the binding association is secure.  

   The situation that one interfaces with multiple MAC addresses is a 
   special case mentioned in the charter of SAVI. And this situation is 
   the only special case that challenges MAC-IP binding. The mechanism 
   to handle this situation is specified in the document. 

   There are three deployment scenarios specified in this document. The 
   mechanism is deployed on different devices in different scenarios. 
   The deployment detail is described in the document. 

   When hosts move from one access point to another, the migration of 
   mapping entries may be triggered according to the specific mobility 
   scenario. The mechanism to handle host mobility is specified in the 
   document according to different deployment scenarios.

3.1. Data Structures 

3.1.1. IP-MAC Mapping Table 

   This table maps IP addresses to corresponding MAC addresses. IP 
   address is the index of the table. One IP address can only have one 
   corresponding MAC address, while different IP addresses can be mapped 
   to the same MAC address.  

   This table is used in control process. Before creating new IP-MAC 
   bindings, this table must first be consulted in case of conflict in 
   binding entries. This table must be synchronized with the MAC-IP 
   table specified in Section 3.1.2. 

   The address allocated by DHCP has a limited lifetime, so the related 
   entry has a limited lifetime, too. According to [RFC4862], stateless 
   address also has a limited lifetime, the stations set this lifetime 
   by itself.  

3.1.2. MAC-IP Mapping Table 

   This table maps MAC addresses to corresponding IP addresses. MAC 
   address is the index of the table. It is a one-to-many mapping table, 
   which means a MAC address can be mapped to multiple IP addresses. 
   Though multiple MAC addresses may exist on one interface, these MAC 
   addresses must be mapped to different IP addresses. 

   This table is used for filtering and we will specify the details in 
   Section 4. This table must be synchronized with the IP-MAC table 
   specified in Section 3.1.1. 

3.2. Pre-conditions for binding 

   In the binding based mechanism, the security of IP address is based 
   on the security of the binding anchor. In WLAN, a number of security 
   mechanisms on link layer make MAC address a strong enough binding 
   anchor, for instance, 802.11i, WAPI, WEP.  

   If MAC address has no protection, attackers can spoof MAC address to 
   succeed in validation. However, in general cases, if MAC address is 
   not protected, more serious attack can be launched than IP spoofing 
   attack.  

3.3. Binding IP addresses to MAC addresses 

   All the static IP-MAC address pairs are configured into the IP-MAC 
   Mapping Table with the mechanism enabled.

   An individual procedure handles binding DHCP addresses to MAC 
   addresses. This procedure snoops the DHCP address assignment 
   procedure between attached hosts and DHCP server. DHCP snooping in 
   WLAN is the same as wired network. 

   An individual procedure handles binding stateless addresses to MAC 
   addresses. This procedure snoops Duplicate Address Detection 
   procedure. ND snooping in WLAN is the same as wired network. 

3.4. Clear Binding 

   Three kinds of events will trigger clearing binding:  

   1. The lifetime of an IP address in one entry has expired.  This IP 
   entry MUST be cleared.  

   2. A station leaves this access point. The entries for all the 
   related MAC addresses MUST be deleted.  

   3. A DHCP RELEASE message is received from the owner of corresponding 
   IP address. This IP entry MUST be deleted. 

4. Source Address Validation 

   This section describes on source address validation procedure on 
   packet. In this procedure, all the frames are assumed to have passed 
   the verifications of 802.11i or other security mechanisms.   

   This procedure has the following steps:  

   1. Extract the IP source and MAC source from the frame. Lookup the 
   MAC address in the MAC-IP Mapping Table and check if the MAC-IP pair 
   exists. If yes, forward the packet. Or else go to next step.  

   2. Lookup the IP address in the IP-MAC Mapping Table and check if the 
   IP address exists. If no, insert a new entry into the IP-MAC Mapping 
   Table and forward the packet. If yes, check whether The MAC address 
   in the entry is the same as that in the frame. If yes, forward the 
   packet. Else drop the packet.  

5. Deployment Scenarios 

   This section specifies three deployment scenarios including two under 
   centralized WLAN and one under autonomous WLAN. The deployment 
   details and solutions for host mobility between access points are 
   described respectively in each scenario.

5.1. Centralized WLAN 

   Centralized WLAN is comprised of FIT Access Points (AP) and Access 
   Controllers (AC). In this scenario, this document proposes the 
   following two deployment solutions. 

5.1.1. Filter on AP 

   In this scenario, AC will maintain the IP-MAC Mapping Table in the 
   control plane, while AP will maintain the MAC-IP Mapping Table in the 
   data plane for filtering. Packet filtering will be performed on each 
   AP as specified in Section 4. 

5.1.1.1. Candidate Binding 

   AP executes the procedure specified in Section 3.3. Candidate binding 
   is generated after snooping procedure. Candidate binding must be 
   confirmed by AC to be valid. 

   After a candidate binding is generated, AP will notify AC the binding 
   and AC determines whether the binding is valid. The validity of a 
   candidate binding is determined by whether the binding violates any 
   existing binding in the IP-MAC Mapping Table. If an address is not 
   suitable for a host to use, AC will notify AP. If the candidate 
   binding is valid, AC will add an entry into the IP-MAC Mapping Table 
   and notify AP, and then AP will also add an entry into the local MAC-
   IP Mapping Table.  

5.1.1.2. CAPWAP Extension 

   CAPWAP is used to communicate between AP and AC. A new CAPWAP 
   protocol message element is introduced here, it extends the [CAPWAP]. 
   The station's IP message element is used by the AC and WTP(AP) to 
   intercommunicate Station's IP address.  

   The station's IP message element MAY be sent by the WTP. When WTP 
   knows station's IP, it can report all the station's IP addresses to 
   AC by this message, and give its suggestion of the IP's state and 
   lifetime.  

   The station's IP message element MAY be sent by the AC, after AC 
   check this message of the station by some mechanism, and reply the 
   same format message to inform WTP which IP is valid and its state and 
   lifetime.

   of address state (now, it only one value 1 for valid, and it can 
   extended in further), and 32-bit value lifetime (second). 

   IPv6 flag: An 8-bit value representing the sub-field's type is IPv6 
   address, whose value is 3. 

   Length: The length of the IPv6 Address field. 

   IPv6 Address: The station's IPv6 address. There may exist many 
   entries, and each entry is comprised of one IPv6 address, 8-bit value 
   of address state (now, it only one value 1 for valid, and it can 
   extended in further), and 32-bit value lifetime (second). 

5.1.1.3. Mobility Solution 

   When a host moves from one AP to another AP, layer-2 association will 
   happen before IP packet transfer. Home AP will delete the binding 
   when mobile host is disconnected, and foreign AP will immediately 
   request the bound addresses with the associated MAC from AC. After AC 
   tells AP the addresses should be bound, the binding migration is 
   completed. 

   In WLAN, a host can move from an AC to another AC while keeping using 
   the same IP address. To be compatible with such scenario, ACs must 
   communicate to perform the binding migration. 

   TBD 

5.1.2. Filter on AC 

   In this scenario, AC will maintain both MAC-IP and IP-MAC Mapping 
   Table and perform the packet filtering. So, all the packets must go 
   through AC before forwarding. AC executes the procedure specified in 
   Section 3.3. 

   Mobility in one AC will not trigger any binding migration. Mobility 
   between different ACs will trigger binding migration and the 
   procedure is the same as that in Section 5.1.1.3. 

5.2. Autonomous WLAN 

   Autonomous WLAN is comprised of FAT Access Points. In this scenario, 
   FAT AP will maintain both MAC-IP and IP-MAC Mapping Table and perform 
   the packet filtering, and executes the procedure specified in Section 
   3.3.

   Mobility between different FAT APs will trigger binding migration and 
   the procedure is the same as that in Section 5.1.1.3. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security of address allocation methods matters the security of 
   this mechanism. Thus it is necessary to improve the security of 
   stateless auto-configuration and DHCP firstly.  

7. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA Consideration currently.  

8. Conclusions 

   This solution can satisfy the requirements of SAVI charter in WLAN 
   enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms.
