Internet-Draft     An IETF URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth          Aug 2011


1.  Introduction

   Various extensions and companion specifications to The OAuth 2.0
   Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] utilize URIs to identify
   the extension in use or other relevant context.  This document
   creates and registers an IETF URN Sub-namespace, as documented in RFC
   3553 [RFC3553], for use with such specifications.  The new 'oauth'
   sub-namespace look like urn:ietf:params:oauth and OAuth relevant
   parameters will be established underneath it.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Registration Template

   If the registrant wishes to have a URI assigned, then a URN of the
   form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<class>:<id> will be assigned where
   <class> is the category of the parameters being registered and <id>
   is a unique id generated by the IANA based on any means the IANA
   deems necessary to maintain uniqueness and persistence.  NOTE: in
   order for a URN of this type to be assigned, the item being
   registered MUST be documented in a RFC.  The RFC 3553 [RFC3553] URN
   registration template is found in the IANA consideration section of
   this document.

   The registration procedure for new entries to the requires a request
   in the form of the following template:

   URN:
      The token URI that identifies the registered component.  If the
      registrant is requesting that the IANA assign a URI then this
      field should be specified as "please assign".

   Common Name:
      The name by which the functionality being registered is generally
      referred.

   Registrant Contact:
      The individual/organization that is the registration contact for
      the component being registered.  Ideally, this will be the name
      and pertinent physical and network contact information.  In the
      case of IETF developed standards, the Registrant will be the IESG.

   Description:
      Information about the registered functionality.


4.  Security Considerations

   None not already inherent to using URNs as discussed in RFC 3553
   [RFC3553].


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  IETF URN Sub-namespace Registration urn:ietf:params:oauth

   Per RFC 3553 [RFC3553], IANA is requested to establish the following
   registry.  New entries to the registry are Specification Required.

   o  Registry name: urn:ietf:params:oauth

   o  Specification: Section 3 of this document contains the registry
      specification.

   o  Repository: To be assigned according to the guidelines found
      above.

   o  Index value: The class name


Appendix A.  Document History

   [[ to be removed by RFC editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   draft-ietf-oauth-urn-sub-ns-00

   o  change doc name from draft-campbell-oauth-urn-sub-ns to
      draft-ietf-oauth-urn-sub-ns per
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg07384.html

   draft-campbell-oauth-urn-sub-ns-01

   o  minor editorial changes
