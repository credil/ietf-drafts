  XML2RFC offers an include feature described in the XML2RFC README
  file.  That syntax, however, contradicts the DTD requirements to
  have <reference> elements within the <references> element, so an 
  XML parser is likely to find your XML file invalid.  It may be
  possible that XML2RFC will change their DTD so that the XML file
  remains valid when their style of include is used.

  In the meantime therefore, we use an alternative valid-XML approach
  to includes, which unfortunately require that define your includes
  at the beginning of the file. Since the biggest benefit of includes
  is for references, this requires that your references be defined in
  ENTITY clauses here before being "included" and cited elsewhere in
  the file.

      In particular it defines objects for managing functions related
      to a 6LoWPAN entity.</t>

      <!--[TODO]: describe what functionality will be managed using this MIB 
module. It can be good to mention the protocol being managed, and whether

<!--    <note title="Foreword to template users">
      <t>This template helps authors write the surrounding text needed in a
      MIB module document, but does not provide a template for writing the MIB
      module itself.</t>

      <t>For updated information on MIB module guidelines and templates, see
      <xref target="RFC4181"></xref> and http://www.ops.ietf.org/.</t>

      <t>For information on writing internet drafts or RFCs, see
      http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt and RFC2223(bis), and look
      at http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html for issues to note when writing
      drafts.</t>

      <t>This template is not meant to be a conclusive list of everything
      needed to write MIB module documents, but to summarize the often-needed
      basic features to get a document containing a MIB module started. An
      important purpose of the template is to aid authors in developing a
      document that is laid out in a manner consistent with other documents
      containing MIB modules. Documents submitted for advancement to the
      standards track typically require review by a MIB Doctor. This template
      standardizes the layout and naming of sections, includes the appropriate
      boilerplate text, and facilitates the development of tools to automate
      the checking of MIB module documents, to speed the WG and IESG review
      processes.</t>

      <t>An XML template is also available. For information on XML2RFC, see
      RFC2629 <xref target="RFC2629"></xref>,
      http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/html/rfc2629.html and "bis":
      http://xml.resource.org/authoring/draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html. Also
      see http://xml.resource.org/authoring/README.html for 'rfc' option
      strings. The benefit of using the XML version of the template is that
      comments in the XML describe how to fill in each section of the
      template, and then XML2RFC will generate the actual internet-draft with
      your information. XML2RFC automatically handles much of the boilerplate,
      references, and idnits issues for you.</t>

      <section title="IPv6 over Wireless PAN (6LoWPAN)"> 

   <t>Low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs) comprise devices that conform to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard by the IEEE [IEEE802.15.4].  IEEE 802.15.4 devices are characterized by short range, low bit rate, low power and low cost.  Many of the devices employing IEEE 802.15.4 radios will be limited in their computational power, memory, and/or energy availability. </t> 
   <t>This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used to monitor and control 6LoWPAN entities.</t>

    <!-- Design Principles  -->

    <!--
        <t>This section is here to remind authors of the Design Principles
         for MIB modules.</t>

        <t>To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering
        practice, an explicit attempt should be made to keep this MIB module
        as simple as possible.  This can be accomplished by applying the
        following criteria to objects proposed for inclusion:</t>
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Start with a small set of essential objects and add only
            as objects are needed.
          </t>
          <t>
            Require objects be essential for either fault or
            performance or configuration management.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.
          </t>
          <t>
            Limit the total number of objects.
          </t>
          <t>
            Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
            this or other MIB modules. The complexity of deriving values
            should be done by the managament station, not the agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily
            instrumented.  The guideline that has been followed in previous
            MIB modules is one counter per critical section per layer.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider the requirements of a small footprint system, such 
            as a set-top box as well as the expanded functionality beneficial 
            to a large foootprint system. To the degree possible, costs 
            associated with advanced functionality should be borne only 
            by the systems implementing such functionality, and the overhead 
            of advanced functionality should minimally impact systems which 
            do not implement the advanced functionality.</t>

      <!-- [TODO]: The narrative part MUST include a section that specifies 
the relationship (if any) of the MIB modules contained in this document
to other standards, particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  

If the MIB modules defined by the specification import definitions
from other MIB modules (except for those defined in the SMIv2
documents [RFC2578] [RFC2579] [RFC2580]) or are always implemented in
conjunction with other MIB modules, then those facts must be noted in
the narrataive section, as must any special interpretations of objects
in other MIB modules.  Note that citations may NOT be put into the MIB 
module portions of the document, but documents used for Imported items are 
Normative references, so the citations must exist in the narrative section 
of the document. For example, some modules are always implemented in 
conjunction with the IF-MIB [RFC2863] and are REQUIRED to document how 
certain objects in the IF-MIB are used.  In addition, media-specific 
MIB modules that rely on the ifStackTable [RFC2863] and the ifInvStackTable 
[RFC2864] to maintain information regarding configuration and multiplexing 
of interface sublayers MUST contain a description of the layering model.
-->

      <t>Some management objects defined in other MIB modules are applicable to an entity implementing this MIB. In particular, it is assumed that an entity implementing the 6LoWPAN-MIB module will also implement the 'system' group of the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"></xref> and the 'interfaces' group of the IF-MIB <xref target="RFC2863"></xref>. The description of how certain objects in the IF-MIB are used is TBD.</t>

      <section title="Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB">
        <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB <xref target="RFC3418"></xref> is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a whole. The 'system' group provides identification of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The 6LoWPAN-MIB does not duplicate those objects.</t>
      </section>

      <!--<section title="Relationship to the IF-MIB">-->
        <!--[TODO]   This section is included as an example; If the 
MIB module is not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section 
should be removed.-->
<!--
        <t>The Interface MIB <xref target="RFC2863"></xref> requires that any
        MIB module which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific
        areas within the Interface MIB. These areas were intentionally left
        vague in the Interface MIB to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby
        precluding management of certain media-types.</t>

        <t>Section 4 of <xref target="RFC2863"></xref> enumerates several
        areas which a media-specific MIB must clarify. The implementor is
        referred to <xref target="RFC2863"></xref> in order to understand the
        general intent of these areas.</t>
      </section>
-->
     <section title="MIB modules required for IMPORTS">
        <!-- [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, 
but any module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned 
in a REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited someplace 
within the narrative sections. If there are imported items in the MIB module, 
such as Textual Conventions, that are not already cited, they can be cited 
in text here. Since relationships to other MIB modules should be described 
in the narrative text, this section is typically used to cite modules from which 
Textual Conventions are imported. -->

                        coordinator(0) indicates that the device is a 
                        PAN Coordinator which is the primary controller
                        of the PAN. It MAY initiate the synchronization 
                        of the entire 6LoWPAN by transmitting beacons.
                        6LoWPAN Router(1)  A LoWPAN node that forwards
                        datagrams between arbitrary source- destination
                        pairs using a single 6LoWPAN interface 
                        performing IP routing on that interface.
                        6LoWPAN Mesh Node (2) A LoWPAN node that 
                        forwards data between arbitrary source- 
                        destination pairs using link addresses (and 
                        thus only exist in Mesh Under LoWPANs).
                        6LoWPAN Host(3) indicates a node that only 
                        sources or sinks IPv6 datagrams.

                        wishes the coordinator to allocate a short 
                        address as a result of the association

                        allocated to the device and returned through 
                        the association response command. In this

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <!-- Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST 
contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to those
   modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
   template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).
   Remember that the objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, 
but rather to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then
   state/document the result of this evaluation.
-->

      <t></t>

      <!--[TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, 
      please include this boilerplate paragraph. -->
      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The vulnerabilities for lowpanAckTimeout object will be discussed in the next version of the draft</t>
          <t>The vulnerabilities for lowpanBroadcastRetries object will be discussed in the next version of the draft</t>

        </list></t>

      <!--[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include this boilerplate paragraph.-->

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. The vulnerabilities will be discussed in next versions on this draft</t>

      <!--[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the 
information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs should 
not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost certainly 
require justification during IESG review.-->

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

      <!-- In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in  
http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is 
submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA 
Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary 
depending what actions are required of the IANA.

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
