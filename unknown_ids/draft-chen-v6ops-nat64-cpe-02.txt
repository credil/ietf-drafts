Internet-Draft                  NAT64-CPE                      July 2011


1.  Introduction

   With fast developments of global Internet, the demands for IP address
   are rapidly increasing at present.This year, IANA announced that the
   global free pool of IPv4 depleted on 3 February.  IPv6 is the only
   real option on the table.  Operators have to accelerate the process
   of deploying IPv6 networks in order to address IP address
   strains.IPv6 deployment normally involves a step-wise approach where
   parts of the network should properly updated gradually.  As IPv6
   deployment progresses it may be simpler for operators and ICP/ISP to
   employ NAT64[RFC6146] functionalities at edge of IPv4 and IPv6
   networks, since a significant part of network will still stay in IPv4
   for long time.  Especially, NAT64 could facilitate large ICP/ISP IPv6
   transition process by eliminating upgrations of tremendous legacy
   IPv4 servers.  Therefore, it's quite popular to deploy NAT64 at the
   front of IDC to shift the entire service to be IPv6-enable.

   Depending on different usage, NAT64 could be deployed on either CGN
   side, or CPE side.  NAT64-CPE would give residential service
   opportunities to be accessed by remote subscribers going through IPv6
   networks.  In this usage, the NAT64-CPE may not need cooperate with
   DNS64[RFC6147] any more, whereby this mechanism allows an IPv6-only
   client (i.e. either a host with only IPv6 stack, or a host with both
   IPv4 and IPv6 stack, but only with IPv6 connectivity or a host
   running an IPv6 only application) to initiate communications to an
   IPv4-only residential service server.

   The document has summarized NAT64 usages on different modes.
   Considering the existing deployment approaches, the memo has proposed
   different operational requirements for each particular NAT64-mode.


2.  NAT64-CGN Mode

2.1.  Usage Overviews

   Figure 1 illustrates NAT64-CGN mode usage where an IPv6-only host
   would like to initiate communications with an IPv4-only server
   through NAT64 deployed at an edge of carried IPv4/IPv6 networks.  The
   NAT64 mechanism allow IPv6-only host to access IPv4 resources and
   IPv6 resources simultaneously.

                     Figure 1: NAT64-CGN Mode Usage

   Therein, NAT64 would perform protocol translation mechanism and
   address translation mechanism.  Protocol translation from an IPv4
   packet header to an IPv6 packet header and vice versa is performed
   according to the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm [RFC6145].  Address
   translation maps IPv6 transport addresses to IPv4 transport addresses
   and vice versa.

   DNS64 is a logical function that synthesizes DNS resource records
   (e.g., AAAA records containing IPv6 addresses) from DNS resource
   records actually contained in the DNS (e.g., A records containing
   IPv4 addresses).

2.2.  NAT64-CGN Mode Operations

   The following has described the operational process of NAT64-CGN.

   o  Step1: IPv6-only host performs an AAAA DNS query to DNS64 for the
      IPv6 address of the Pv4-only sever.

   o  Step2: DNS64 could not find the IPv6 address of the IPv4-only
      sever.  So it tries to get the IPv4 address of the Pv4-only sever
      by sending A DNS query to DNS4.

   o  Step3: DNS4 return the A record to the DNS64.

   o  Step4: DNS64 map the IPv4 address to IPv6 address and send a
      synthetic AAAA record which is translated from A record to IPv6-
      only host.

   o  Step5: IPv6-only host send the IPv6 packet to the NAT64.  NAT64
      translates the IPv6 packet to IPv4 packet and send it to IPv4-only
      server.

2.3.  NAT64-CGN Mode Requirements

   According to above description for NAT64-CGN, the NAT64-CGN
   requirements are listed as following.

   NAT64-CGN-R1: Each NAT64 device MUST have at least one unicast IPv6
   prefix assigned to it, denoted Pref64::/n.

   NAT64-CGN-R2:A NAT64 MUST have one or more unicast IPv4 addresses
   assigned to it.

   NAT64-CGN-R3:Irrespective of the transport protocol used, the NAT64
   MUST silently discard all incoming IPv6 packets containing a source
   address that contains the Pref64::/n.

   NAT64-CGN-R4:The NAT64 MUST only process incoming IPv6 packets that
   contain a destination address that contains Pref64::/n.  Likewise,
   the NAT64 MUST only process incoming IPv4 packets that contain a
   destination address that belongs to the IPv4 pool assigned to the
   NAT64.

   NAT64-CGN-R5:NAT64 MUST support the algorithm for generating IPv6
   representations of IPv4 addresses defined in RFC6052 as Address
   Translation Algorithms.

   NAT64-CGN-R6:For incoming packets carrying TCP or UDP fragments with
   a non-zero checksum, NAT64 MAY elect to queue the fragments as they
   arrive and translate all fragments at the same time.

   NAT64-CGN-R7: For incoming IPv4 packets carrying UDP packets with a
   zero checksum, if the NAT64 has enough resources, the NAT64 MUST
   reassemble the packets and MUST calculate the checksum.  If the NAT64
   does not have enough resources, then it MUST silently discard the
   packets.

   NAT64-CGN-R8: The NAT64 MAY require that the UDP, TCP, or ICMP header
   be completely contained within the fragment that contains fragment
   offset equal to zero.

   NAT64-CGN-R9:The NAT64 MUST limit the amount of resources devoted to
   the storage of fragmented packets in order to protect from DoS
   attacks.

   NAT64-CGN-R10:The NAT64 MUST make fragmentation process when MTU of

   incoming IPv4 traffic exceed maximum MTU on IPv6 side.

   NAT64-CGN-R11:The NAT64 MAY let hosts and applications know IPv6
   prefix used by the NAT64 and DNS64 so as to hosts have knowledge
   whether synthetic IPv6 address is targeted.

   NAT64-CGN-R12:The NAT64 MAY decouple with DNS64 in order to establish
   communication with IPv4-only servers.

   NAT64-CGN-R13:The NAT64 MAY take load-balancing functionalities
   incorporating with DNS64.


3.  NAT64-CPE Mode

3.1.  Usage Overviews

   Residential servers are usually going beyond the operator's
   management.  They may not able to IPv6-enable due to limitations of
   application supporting.  In this case, ISP is still assigning private
   IPv4 address to servers.  However, The nature of private IPv4 would
   block the end-to-end bi-directional communications.  On the other
   hand, IPv6 will bring end-to-end benefits to operators.  NAT64-CPE
   mode could let IPv6 users to access such IPv6-disable services in
   residential areas.

   Figure 2 illustrates a network usage where an IPv6-only client
   attached to a dual-stack network, but the destination server is
   running on a private site where there is NAT64-CPE numbered with
   public IPv6 addresses and private IPv4 addresses.  DNS server is
   located in dual stack Internet for naming-resolving.

                   Figure 2: NAT64-CPE Mode Usage

   This scenario appears in ISP network quite popular.  As the
   instances, visitors go through distant network to take care of family
   affairs, like monitoring house security via residential camera,
   manipulating household appliances remotely prior to comeback home.

3.2.  NAT64-CPE Mode Operations

   The operational process of NAT64-CPE operation involves CPE, DNS and
   addressing mechanism.  This section illustrates different parts of
   functionalities.

   For NAT64-CPE operations, two kinds of functions would take on.
   First, it will perform the functionalities that normal CPE does
   except NAT44 forwarding, like assigning private IPv4 address to their
   attached residential servers.  Additionally, CPE will allocate
   private IPv4 address to the servers depending on the server MAC
   address.  Therefore, the server could always get constant private
   IPv4 address.  Second, CPE should carry NAT64 functionalities without
   integrating DNS64.  According to normative handing, NAT64-CPE
   translates in-coming IPv6 destination address by striping NAT64 IPv6-
   prefix and maintains a IPv4 pool for translating IPv6 sources
   address.  Therein, the NAT64 IPv6 prefix will be NSP specified in
   IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators.  And, ISP will reserve
   distinct NSP for each CPE.  In order to maintain address mapping
   between inner IP address and outer IP address, PCP [PCP] could be
   adopted.

   For DNS configuration, each residential services should be
   represented by FQDN format so as to users could easily remember and
   understand.  The corresponding naming resource record should be
   stored as AAAA.  The record's IPv6 address is synthesized by NAT64
   prefix and private IPv4 address.  The IPv6 format is compliant with
   assembling IPv6 address in DNS64.The deployed DNS just follow regular
   DNS handling.  There is no demands for performing DNS64 process.

3.3.  NAT64-CPE Mode Requirements

   The following lists requirements for NAT64-CPE operations.

   NAT64-CPE-R1: NAT64-CPE SHOULD be decoupled with DNS64.

   NAT64-CPE-R2: NAT64-CPE SHOULD be capable of port forwarding.  PCP,
   UPnP and NAT-PMP are RECOMMENDED to be deployed along with NAT64-CPE.

   NAT64-CPE-R3: Network-Specific Prefix SHOULD be assigned to each
   NAT64-CPE for constructing ipv4-converted ipv6 addresses.

Internet-Draft                  NAT64-CPE                      July 2011


   NAT64-CPE-R4: Each residential server SHOULD be represented by FQDN
   and stored as AAAA record along with ipv4-converted ipv6 address in
   DNS server.  Dynamic updates in the domain name system MAY be
   applicable to reflect address renumbering of residential servers.

   NAT64-CPE-R5: NAT64-CPE SHOULD follow WAN side configuration
   described in RFC6204[RFC6204].

   NAT64-CPE-R6: When a residential server is attached to the LAN
   interface, NAT64-CPE SHOULD allocate private IPv4 addresses to the
   server depending on the server MAC address.


4.  Security Considerations

   Essentially, there are strong demands to have thorough security
   mechanism to prevent privacy invasion in NAT64-CPE scenario.  The
   detailed considerations need to be further identified.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
