    <abstract>
      <t>This document attempts to provide a list of the common Frequently
      Asked Questions (FAQs) that IETF meeting attendees often ask regarding
      travel logisitics and local information. It is intended to assist those
      who are willing to provide local information, so that if they wish to
      pre-populate answers to some or all of these questions either in the
      IETF Wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have a reasonably complete
      list of ideas to draw from. It is not meant as a list of required
      information that the host or secretariat needs to provide, merely as a
      guideline.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IETF attendees come from all over the world. The typical IETF meeting
      has representatives from in excess of 50 countries. As such, it is quite
      likely that a large portion of the participants in any given IETF are
      newcomers to the specific location where it is being held. It is also
      possible that this is their first trip to the country or region. As
      such, they are going to have questions regarding their own personal
      travel needs and logistics that may only be answerable by someone who
      has either been to the area before, someone who lives there, and/or
      someone who speaks the local language.</t>

      <t>While the IETF, its secretariat, and any local host organizations
      responsible for the logistics of making IETF meetings happen are not
      travel agencies, there is a set of information that most travelers wish
      to have while they are planning their trip. This document attempts to
      cover the most commonly asked questions and categories for information.
      This document is not intended to provide answers to these questions for
      every possible location in which IETF meetings may be held. Rather, it
      is intended to provide a set of FAQs for use by the hosts and others who
      have experience with the area where the event is being held, so that the
      questions and answers can be handled more efficiently than waiting until
      someone sends an email to the XXattendees@ietf.org list in the days
      leading up to the meeting.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Why is this document necessary?">
      <t>In reading this document, one may ask, "why would such a
      technologically advanced and internet-savvy organization need such help?
      Isn't that why search engines exist?" And the answer is that yes, we can
      sometimes find what we're looking for with search engines, but that
      results in hundreds of people spending their time searching, which is
      not very efficient. In addition, despite the widely held belief that if
      it is published on the Internet, it therefore must be true, sometimes
      the information that is available is either inaccurate, incomplete, or
      out of date, so it may well be less reliable than firsthand info from
      someone that has been there. Also, no matter how good online translation
      is getting, some of the most informative sites may be difficult for
      non-native speakers to navigate and find information - navigation
      buttons, graphics, and other active content are typically not
      machine-translatable, and non-native speakers may not realize when
      machine translation is inaccurate in a critical way.</t>

      <t>For some past IETF meetings, the hosting organization has set up a
      special website, usually containing "IETF" and the number of the meeting
      (e.g. <xref target="STOCKHOLM">ietf75.se </xref>, <xref
      target="PHILLY">ietf71.comcast.net</xref>, etc). This has been a source
      of much additional information about the location, and is always quite
      helpful. If the host decides to set up a site like this, the hope is
      that this document will provide guidance as to the sorts of information
      with which to populate such a site. However, it is by no means a
      requirement that the host set up an external website. Further, not every
      IETF meeting has a local host, or even a host at all. In these cases,
      the need for the same set of information is not lessened, but the IETF
      will be more reliant on the willingness of those with experience in the
      area where the meeting will be held to share the benefit of that
      experience with others. The IETF has provided a hosted <xref
      target="WIKI">Wiki</xref> which can simply be populated with the same
      sorts of information. This has the added benefit of having a single
      location where additional information can be provided by experienced
      travelers, locals, and host representatives alike. In the case where the
      IETF-hosted wiki is to be used, this document may serve as a framework
      of categories that could be pre-built when the site-specific page is set
      up, so that others can begin populating the information.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="simple_list" title="Helpful information">
      <t>There are a number of general categories of information listed below.
      Some of it is necessary for travel, the rest can be considered
      nice-to-have at best. All of it has come from actual frequently asked
      questions from the attendees mailing lists.</t>

      <t>Much of this information may already be available in another form
      online. Simply pointing to information already available in other
      locations is quite appropriate, but some validation and vetting of the
      provided information is greatly helpful so that information provided
      acheives the goal of avoiding outdated or inaccurate information.</t>
