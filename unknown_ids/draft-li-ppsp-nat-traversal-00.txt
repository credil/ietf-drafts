Internet-Draft             PPSP NAT traversal               October 2010


1.  Introduction

   NAT is widely deployed in the Internet.  Three NAT traversal
   solutions have been proposed in [I-D.gu-ppsp-peer-protocol].
   However, these solutions either require introducing RELOAD protocol
   or require server(e.g. tracker) to relay.  This document proposes
   another NAT traversal solution using ICE [RFC5245] for PPSP.  This
   solution doesn't require introducing RELOAD protocol, and doesn't
   increase much workload on tracker.  This document discusses both
   signal and media traversal of NAT.  To use ICE with PPSP, this
   document proposes some modifications to ICE and some requirements on
   PPSP.  First, capable PPSP peers function as STUN [RFC5389] or relay
   servers, and PPSP protocol is used to discover them.  Second, PPSP
   protocol is used to convey candidate addresses.  Third, in addition
   to STUN message, PPSP message is proposed as an option to test
   connectivity.  Fourth, as an option, proxy peer is proposed to relay
   PPSP messages.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   We use the terminology and definitions from "Problem Statement of P2P
   Streaming Protocol" [I-D.zhang-ppsp-problem-statement] and ICE
   [RFC5245] and extensively in this document.  Other terms used in this
   document are defined below.

   STUN peer.  A STUN peer is a peer functioning as a STUN server and
   providing STUN services to other peers.

   Relay peer.  A relay peer is a peer providing relay service to other
   peers.  The relay service may be provided in PPSP layer or TURN layer
   or both.

   TURN peer.  A TURN peer is a relay peer providing relay service in
   TURN [RFC5766] layer.  In another word, a TURN peer is a peer
   functioning as a TURN server and providing TURN services to other
   peers.

   Proxy peer.  A proxy peer is a relay peer providing relay service in
   PPSP layer.  In another word, a proxy peer is a peer functioning as a
   proxy server and providing PPSP proxy services to other peers.
   Unlike TURN peer, proxy peer only relays PPSP messages.

   Proxy candidate.  As the defined in ICE, a candidate is a transport
   address, which is potential for communication.  A peer's proxy
   candidate is the address of a proxy peer serving for the peer.
   Through a peer's proxy candidate, the peer can be contacted.

3.  Reference Model

   In the PPSP architecture, there are two kinds of nodes: tracker and
   peer.  As shown in figure 1, this document introduces some special
   peers: STUN peer, relay peer, TURN peer and proxy peer.  STUN peers
   act as STUN servers and provide STUN services to other peers, while
   relay peers act as relay servers and provide relay services to other
   peers.  Relay service can be provided in two layers: TURN layer and
   PPSP layer.  If relay service is provided in TURN layer, relayed
   messages are encapsulated in TURN packets.  The relay peer providing
   relay service in TURN layer is called TURN peer.  If relay service is
   provided in PPSP layer, only PPSP messages can be relayed.  The relay
   peer providing PPSP relay service in PPSP layer is called proxy peer.

                      Figure 1: PPSP reference model

   PPSP protocol is used to discover STUN/relay peer.  Capable peer
   reports its STUN/relay ability to tracker when connecting to the P2P
   streaming system and tracker maintains the STUN/relay peer list.
   Then a peer can query STUN/relay peer list from tracker when needed.
   Additionally, peers MAY exchange STUN/relay server peer list.

   PPSP protocol is used to convey candidate addresses.  Each peer

   gathers its candidate addresses and reports them to tracker.  Peer
   can discover other peers' candidate addresses from the peer list
   obtained from tracker or other peers.  Two peers can exchange ICE
   parameters including candidate addresses in offer/answer model
   directly or via a third-party proxy peer.

4.  NAT traversal solution

4.1.  PPSP signal traversal

   The process of PPSP signal traversal is shown in Figure 2.  As shown
   in Figure 2, the process of a peer (peer A) establishing PPSP
   connection to another peer (peer B) includes following seven steps
   (step 5 to step 7 is optional). 1, both peer A and B gather their
   candidates, and report their candidates to tracker when joining
   swarm. 2, peer A gets peer list from tracker or other peer(s) and
   learns peer A's candidates from peer list. 3, peer A does one-
   direction ICE or PPSP connectivity checks from peer A to peer B. 4,
   peer A chooses candidate pair based the result of one-direction ICE
   or PPSP connectivity checks. 5, peer B and peer A exchange ICE
   parameters with PPSP messages. 6, peer A and B performs two-direction
   ICE connectivity checks or one-direction ICE connectivity checks from
   peer B to peer A. 7, peer A or peer B chooses candidate pair.

   After step 4, peer A has established a communication path to peer B.
   But the communication path may not be the optimal one, because the
   path is discovered based on one-direction connectivity checks from
   peer A to peer B. So step 5 to step 7 is used to find a better
   communication path.  Step 5 to step 7 a standard ICE process.  This
   ICE process is optional because the best communication path may have
   been found or may not be necessary.

   Following sections will describe the key steps of PPSP signal
   traversal in details.

4.1.1.  Gathering Candidates

   Every peer MUST gather candidates for communication.  As the defined
   in ICE, a candidate is a transport address, which is potential for
   communication.  ICE defines host candidate, reflexive candidate and
   relayed candidate.  This document defines one more candidate type
   called proxy candidate.  Proxy candidate is obtained from proxy peer.
   A proxy peer is a PPSP peer with public accessibility, which can
   relay PPSP messages to peers associated with it.  To be accessible, a
   peer behind NAT MAY establish association with at least one proxy
   peer.  Establishing association can use PPSP Connect message or a new
   defined message.

Internet-Draft             PPSP NAT traversal               October 2010


   Every peer MUST gather its candidates according to its accessibility
   and the type of connectivity check.  Proxy candidate is used for the
   connectivity check in PPSP layer.  Relayed candidate is used for the
   connectivity check in ICE layer.  Host candidate and reflexive
   candidate can be used for the connectivity check in both ICE layer
   and PPSP layer.

4.1.2.  Conveying Candidates

   Candidates are conveyed by PPSP messages.  When joining a swarm, a
   peer puts its candidates and peer ID in the JOIN message sent to
   tracker.  Peer list in the PPSP message contains each peer's
   candidates and peer ID in the list.

4.1.3.  One-direction Connectivity Checks

   Because peer A doesn't know peer B's candidates, the connectivity
   checks are one-direction checks.  The one-direction connectivity
   checks can be performed in ICE layer or PPSP layer.  This document
   leaves the layer of connectivity checks as an open issue for the WG
   to discuss.

   If the connectivity checks are performed in ICE layer, ICE
   connectivity check is used with some modifications to STUN/TURN
   authentication.

   ICE uses STUN binding request and response to check connectivity.
   Standard ICE [RFC5245] uses offer/answer exchange to exchange STUN
   username fragment and password.  In standard ICE [RFC5245], the
   username part of STUN credential is formed by concatenating a
   username fragment from each ICE agent, separated by a colon.
   However, there is no offer/answer exchange for the one-direction
   connectivity checks here.  A possible solution is to put STUN
   username and password in peer list.  Then in the example shown in
   Figure 2, peer A can extract peer B's STUN username and password from
   peer list.

   According to standard ICE [RFC5245], before certain connectivity
   checks, an ICE agent MUST create permissions in its TURN server for
   the IP addresses learned from its peer in the offer/answer exchange.
   However, in the example shown in figure 2, peer B can't create
   permissions because peer B doesn't know peer A's IP addresses due to
   the absence of offer/answer exchange.  To address this issue, it
   needs a new TURN authentication method or another way to create
   permissions in peer B's TURN server.

   If the connectivity checks are performed in PPSP layer, PPSP message
   is used to test connectivity.  This document proposes to define a

Internet-Draft             PPSP NAT traversal               October 2010


   PPSP message called PING for connectivity check.  Connectivity check
   in PPSP layer can use PPSP's own authentication method.

4.1.4.  Using ICE to optimize connection

   After step 4, connection between peer A and peer B is established
   based on one-direction connectivity checks.  Because the checks are
   one-direction, the established connection may not be optimal.  A
   better connection may be established by performing a standard ICE
   with two-direction connectivity checks or one-direction connectivity
   checks of reverse direction.  This document proposes to define new
   PPSP messages called Attach for candidates exchanging.

4.2.  PPSP media traversal

   This document proposes to use ICE for media traversal.  The way to
   use ICE here is almost the same as the way defined in [RFC5245].  In
   ICE as defined by [RFC5245], SDP is used to carry the ICE parameters.
   This document proposes to define a PPSP message called MediaAttach
   for exchanging the ICE parameters including candidates and
   authentication data.

   The use of MediaAttach with ICE for NAT traversal is shown in Figure
   3 and Figure 4.  As shown in these figures, a peer (say peer B) wants
   to establish media connection to another peer (say peer A).  Peer A
   and peer B already have established PPSP signal connection directly
   or via a third-party peer (the method to establish signal connection
   please refers to the above section).  So peer A can send a PPSP
   MediaAttach request to peer B directly or via a third peer.  Then
   Peer B responses to peer A with MediaAttach response message.
   Through MediaAttach request and response, peer A and peer B exchange
   ICE parameters.  After that, the following NAT traversal process
   complies with standard ICE [RFC5245].
