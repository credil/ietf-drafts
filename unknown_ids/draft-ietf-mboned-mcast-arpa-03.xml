<abstract>
  <t>This document proposes to migrate the MCAST.NET domain into the ARPA
    top level domain, which is dedicated to infrastructure support.  It
    also provides a maintenance policy for the new MCAST.ARPA domain, 
    related registrations in IN-ADDR.ARPA and describes the migration 
    process.  This document updates RFC 5771 and forms part of BCP 51.
  </t>

<section title='Introduction'>

  <t>This document describes the migration strategy from the MCAST.NET 
    domain to MCAST.ARPA, which MUST contains DNS names for a subset 
    of the multicast groups assigned by the IANA. It also specifies a
    maintenance policy for the MCAST.ARPA domain.
  </t>

</section>
  
<section title="Terminology">
    
    <t>
      
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
      "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
      interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      
    </t>
    
</section>

<section title='The ARPA top level domain'>
<t><xref target='RFC3172'/> designates the ARPA top level domain as
"Address and Routing Parameters Area" to be used for infrastructure
applications.</t>
<t>The MCAST.NET second level domain fulfills the criteria set out in section
2.1 of <xref target='RFC3172'/>. However, there is no standards track
document explicitly designating this domain to a multicast group name to
multicast group address mapping.</t>
<t>The assignment of IPv4 multicast addresses is governed by BCP51 <xref target='RFC5771'/>. 
  IPv6 multicast address assignment is dealt with in <xref target='RFC3307'/> and section 2.7 of  <xref target='RFC4291'/>.</t>
</section>

<section title='Current Use'>
<t>Currently the zone MCAST.NET reflects the contents of parts the IANA
IPv4 multicast address registry. However, some names are missing from the DNS zone
and some names used differ from the description that appears in the
registry file. Entries in the IPv6 multicast address registry are not reflected
in the MCAST.NET zone.</t>
<t>With few exceptions, only multicast group addresses from 224.0.0/24 and
224.0.1/24 are listed in MCAST.NET. Addresses outside 224/8 do not appear
at all.</t>
</section>

<section title='Registration Policy'>

  <t>Names within MCAST.ARPA will consist of one additional label and MUST
  adhere to the hostname syntax requirements of <xref target='RFC1123'/>.
  These names MUST own a single A RR, a single AAAA RR, or both.
  Addresses will be in the IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address space and recorded 
  in the registry.</t>

  <section title='Names and Addresses eligible for Registration in MCAST.ARPA'>

  <t>Only IANA multicast address registrations are eligible for being listed
  in MCAST.ARPA.</t>
  <t>For IPv4, only multicast groups from 224.0.0/24 (Local Network Control
     Block) and 224.0.1/24 (Internetwork Control Block) will have names
     assigned.</t>
    <t>For IPv6, only multicast groups from FF01::/16 (Node-Local Scope 
      Multicast Addresses) and FF02::/16 (Link-Local Scope Multicast 
      Addresses) will have names assigned.</t>
  </section>

  <section title='Subdomains of MCAST.ARPA'>

  <t>The namespace under MCAST.ARPA is considered flat, i.e., all direct
  descendants of MCAST.ARPA are leaves in the DNS tree.  Future extensions
  might want to define subdomains that serve special purposes.
  Any such designation needs IETF consensus <xref target='RFC5226'/>.</t>
  </section>

  <section title='Corresponding Reverse Mapping'>

  <t>The DNS Reverse Mapping for those multicast groups that appear as
  addresses in MCAST.ARPA MUST remain consistent with the forward
  namespace.</t>

    <section title='Reverse Mapping for 224/4'>

    <t>A single DNS PTR record will be entered at the corresponding
    owner within the 224.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain that points to the multicast
    group name within MCAST.ARPA.</t>
      
      <t>The zones 225.IN-ADDR.ARPA through 239.IN-ADDR.ARPA will be delegated
        but MUST remain empty except for necessary infrastructure RRs.  The one
        exception is 233.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  A mechanism for the delegation of
        reverse mapping for GLOP space <xref target='RFC3180'/> will be specified 
        and documented on the IANA web site.</t>
    
    </section>

    <section title='Reverse Mapping for ff00::/8'>

    <t>Directions for this will be published as a separate document.</t>
    </section>

  </section>

</section>

<section title='Migration Issues'>

<t>As described below, the current content of the MCAST.NET zone MUST be 
  brought in line with the multicast address registry.
</t>
<t>Since legacy systems are likely to use MCAST.NET for quite some time, there needs
to be a mapping/forwarding solution to answer those queries in a useful
manner without discouraging migration.</t>

<t>RFCs mentioning MCAST.NET are <xref target='RFC3261'/>
and <xref target='RFC3678'/>.</t>

<t>An updated multicast address architecture appears in
<xref target='RFC6308'/>.</t>

<section title='Migration Strategies'>
<t>After the move, several options are available for the future handling of
MCAST.NET.</t>
<t>[[The working group needs to choose one of the options.]]</t>
  <section title='Freeze'>
  <t>The current MCAST.NET zone could be frozen, so that no additions, deletions
  or changes to the content (apart from those necessary for maintenance,
  e.g. SOA and NS RRs) would be performed. New registrations would only
  be available in MCAST.ARPA, so this could be an incentive for querying
  clients to alter their behavior as well.</t>
  </section>
  <section title='Removing Registrations from MCAST.NET while maintaining operational stability'>
    <t>MCAST.NET will only see deletions but even after the last record 
      has been deleted, the domain MUST be kept registered by the IANA.
      and should be operated in parallel using a DNAME RR, as described
      in <xref target='RFC2672'/>.
    </t>
  </section>
</section>
</section>

<section title='Security Considerations'>
<t>The usual Security Considerations for the DNS <xref target='RFC3833'/> apply.</t>

<t>The MCAST.ARPA., MCAST.NET., and the Reverse mapping zones mentioned
in this document MUST be DNSSEC signed by the IANA under direction from
the IAB.</t>

<t>There is no security problem associated with the migration itself.</t>

<t>{This section needs more work.}</t>
</section>

<section title='IANA Considerations'>
	<t>This document amends <xref target='RFC5771'/> to add a mandatory
	entry in the MCAST.ARPA domain and a corresponding reverse
	mapping entry, with relevant DNS names published in the registry. 
	The officially registered multicast group name is made subject to 
	DNS hostname syntax rules.</t>
