 Internet-Draft        A fast LSP-alert Mechanism      February 2010



 Abstract

    There are applications (e.g. fault-management, OAM) that need to
    alert LSRs along an LSP path. TTL expiry and GAL are currently
    defined mechanisms. An invocation of such a mechanism alerts a
    single LSR. When multiple LSRs along the LSP need to be alerted,
    multiple messages may have to be generated. Also, messages may
    have to be processed and forwarded hop-by-hop by the control
    plane. In fault recovery scenarios where multiple LSRs need to
    be alerted this increases the recovery time and hence the
    traffic loss. This document defines a simple and fast mechanism
    that allows all the LSRs along a LSP to be alerted with a single
    message.

 1. Introduction

    [RFC5586] defines a Generic Associated Channel (G-Ach) that can
    be used for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
    functions. The label encoding/processing rules defined in
    [RFC3032] along with the G-Ach defined in [RFC5586] can be used
    to deliver an alert message to a LSR along the LSP. Certain
    applications require a message to be delivered to multiple LSRs
    along the LSP. In such a case multiple messages have to be
    generated (one per LSR). Alternatively, the message could be
    received and forwarded hop-by-hop by an LSR. If this forwarding
    is based on an address formatted in the ACH TLVs or the G-Ach
    message, then the forwarding may have to be done in the slow
    path (control plane). In fault recovery scenarios this increases

    increases traffic loss. This document defines a simple and fast
    mechanism to alert multiple LSRs along a LSP.

 3. Packet Format

    This document uses a reserved bit of the ACH defined in
    [RFC5586]. This bit is henceforth referred to as the `Fast LSP
    Alert bit' or FLA-bit for short. The 16th bit is defined as the
    FLA-bit and the resultant ACH is shown below

 4. Packet processing

    This section describes the rules for origination, receiving and
    forwarding the packet with FLA-bit set. It is also illustrated
    via an example in Section 4.3.  below.

 4.1. Origination

    When a LSR has a message that has to be delivered (using G-Ach)
    to multiple LSRs along the LSP, it generates a packet by setting
    the FLA-bit in the ACH. In the outer Label (i.e., LSP label) the
    TTL is set to 1 and S-bit is 0. The GAL should have TTL set to
    the number of LSRs along the LSP that need to be alerted. If the
    number of LSRs is not known apriori, then the TTL must be set to
    255. The GAL's S-bit must be set to 1.

 4.2. Receiving and Forwarding

    When a LSR receives a packet with LSP label's TTL=1 it is
    identified as an alert packet. Since S=0, the next label in the
    label stack (in this case the GAL) is processed. If the GAL's
    TTL is 0, the packet is dropped. Else, the packet is treated as
    an alert packet for the local LSR. In addition, if the FLA-bit
    is set, the GAL's TTL is decremented by 1. If the LSR is not a
    terminating LSR of the LSP and the decremented GAL TTL is > 0, a
    copy of the packet is forwarded to the next LSR along the LSP.
    The forwarding should follow the same rules as for any data
    packet of that LSP. The notable difference is that the LSP
    label's TTL is set to 1 and the GAL TTL is lesser by 1 (compared
    to the GAL's TTL in the incoming packet). If the LSR is the
    termination point for the LSP then the packet is not forwarded.

    L1-4 are LSRs and an LSP (LSP1) is routed along L1->L2->L3->L4.
    L1 needs to send a message (on G-Ach) that has to be delivered
    to LSRs (L2, L3, L4) along the LSP. It generates the message in
    the G-Ach with FLA-bit set. In this example the GAL TTL is set
    to 255. The packet as it traverses the LSP is shown in Figure 2.
    Each of the LSRs along the LSP delivers the packet locally as an
    alert packet and also sends a copy of the packet (with the GAL
    TTL decremented) along the LSP.

 5. Addressing in ACH TLVs and G-Ach Message

    The mechanism described in this document is independent of any
    addressing scheme of the ACH TLVs or the G-Ach message. Since
    the same message is delivered as an alert packet to multiple
    LSRs, any address that indicates where this message must be
    processed, must be chosen such that it is accepted by each of
    those LSRs for local processing. This document borrows on the

    requirements in [RFC4379] and places the following requirements
    on addressing:

      1. The likelihood that this alert message is delivered to a
         user of the service should be kept to an absolute minimum.

      2. The alert message must not be forwarded further based on
         the address in the ACH TLVs or the G-Ach message.

    For `Channel Type' IPv4, an address from the 127/8 range should
    be used. For `Channel Type' IPv6 an address from the same range
    embedded in as IPv4-mapped IPv6 address should be used.

    For additional `Channel Types', addresses that satisfy the above
    stated requirements should be used.

 6. Applicability to LSP types

    The mechanism described in this document is applicable to point-
    to-point as well as point-to-multipoint TE tunnels.
    Applicability to other types of LSPs is for further study.

 7. Security Considerations

    The security considerations in [RFC5586] are applicable. An
    additional consideration is loops. That is prevented using the
    GAL TTL.

 8. IANA Considerations

    IANA should allocate a reserved bit in the ACH as the FLA-bit.
