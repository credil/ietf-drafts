Internet-Draft    GMPLS Signaling Ext for evolutive OTN        July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends
   MPLS from supporting Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and
   switching to include support of four new classes of interfaces and
   switching: Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM),
   Lambda Switch (LSC), and Fiber-Switch (FSC) Capable.  A functional
   description of the extensions to MPLS signaling that are needed to
   support these new classes of interfaces and switching is provided in
   [RFC3471].  [RFC3473] describes the RSVP-TE-specific formats and
   mechanisms needed to support all four classes of interfaces.
   [RFC4328] describes the technology details that are specific to G.709
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) as defined in ITU-T G.709
   recommendation [ITUT-G709].

   This document extends the concepts presented in [RFC4328] with the
   technology details introduced by ITU-T G.709 Amendment 3 and G.sup43
   supplement.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Open Issues
      - G.sup43 signal types (e.g.  ODU3e1, ODU3e2) are proprietary
      signals.  Should IETF address also this kind of signals?
      - Update interworking section
      - Include contents from draft-zhang


4.  GMPLS Extensions for G.709 amendment 3 - Overview

   G.709 amendment 3 and G.sup43 introduce new signal types in the two
   layers constituting the digital transport hierarchy:

   - Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk):
      .  OTU4

   - Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk):
      .  ODU0
      .  ODU2e
      .  ODU3e1
      .  ODU3e2
      .  ODU4

Internet-Draft    GMPLS Signaling Ext for evolutive OTN        July 2009


      .  ODUflex

   It also adds a new 1,25 Gbps Tributary Slot (TS) granularity for both
   the new and the old ODUk signals.

   [ITUT-G709-AMD3] introduces ODU4 mapping into OTU4 (and its related
   100Gbps optical channel), and new ODUk multiplexing.  It refers to
   the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, and flex) into an ODUk
   (k > j) signal, in particular:

   o  ODU0 into ODU1 multiplexing
   o  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex into ODU2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS
      granularity)
   o  ODUflex into ODU2 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity)
   o  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex, ODU2 and ODU2e into ODU3 multiplexing (with
      1.25Gbps TS granularity)
   o  ODU2e and ODUflex into ODU3 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS
      granularity)
   o  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, ODU2e, ODUflex into ODU4 multiplexing
      (with 1.25Gbps TS granularity)
   o  ODU2e into ODU3e1 multiplexing (with 2,5Gbps TS granularity)
   o  ODU2e into ODU3e2 multiplexing (with 1,25Gbps TS granularity)

   GMPLS signaling extensions for G.709 support have been described in
   [RFC4328] extending the Generalized Label Request, the Generalized
   Label and Traffic Parameters.  This document further extends GMPLS
   signaling in order to support G.709 Amendment3 and provides some
   considerations on the interworking of G.709 and G.709 Amendment3
   control planes.

   ODUflex should be for further study (e.g., Control of ODUflex
   resizing).


5.  GMPLS Extensions for G.Sup43

   G.Sup43 introduces two new types of signal: ODU3e1 and ODU3e2.  These
   extension are not normative with respect the ITU-T standardization
   process.  IETF needs to decide if these non normative ITU-T
   extensions need to be included in the scope of IETF works.  In the
   rest of this ID we will highlight what is normative and what is not
   with respect to ITU-T process.  What is referred to G.Sup43 will be
   indicated with [NN] tag in the text.


6.  Generalized Label Request

   The Generalized Label Request as defined in [RFC3471], includes a

   common part (i.e. used for any switching technology) and a technology
   dependent part (i.e. the traffic parameters).  Both parts have been
   extended by [RFC4328] in order to accommodate GMPLS signaling to the
   G.709 transport plane recommendation (see [ITUT-G709]).

   All these extensions are still valid for G.709 Amendment 3 transport
   plane recommendation and only the technology dependent part is
   further extended to accommodate GMPLS signaling to the new signals
   introduced by G.709 Amendment 3 and by G.Sup43.

6.1.  G.709 Traffic Parameters

   The G.709 traffic parameters are defined as follows in [RFC4328]
   Section 3.2:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Signal Type  |   Reserved    |              NMC              |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              NVC              |        Multiplier (MT)        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           Reserved                            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

             Generalized label request and traffic parameters

   In this frame, NMC stands for Number of Multiplexed Components, NVC
   for Number of Virtual Components and MT for Multiplier.  Each of
   these fields is tailored to support G.709 LSP requests.

   The RSVP-TE encoding of the G.709 traffic-parameters is detailed in
   [RFC4328] Section 6.  [ITUT-G709-AMD3] defines new signals and
   Digital Path layer multiplexing combinations, therefore, the Signal
   Type and Number of Multiplexed Components fields need to be extended.

6.1.1.  Signal Type (ST)

   This field (8 bits) indicates the type of G.709 Elementary Signal
   that comprises the requested LSP.  Since [ITUT-G709-AMD3] defines new
   ODUk and OCh layers, additional Signal Type code-points for G.709
   Amendment 3 are defined to enlarge the existing ST code-point defined
   in [RFC4328].

   Values from 0 to 8 are defined in [RFC4328].  The size of OPU2 and
   OPU3 tributary slots as defined in [RFC4328] is 2.5G. Other new
   Signal Types are extended for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43.

           19     ODUflex /*The size of OPU2/OPU3/OPU4 TS is 2.5G */ [NN]
           20-255 Reserved (for future use)


                            Signal Type values

   The same rules defined in [RFC4328] are still valid for the new
   signals:
   o  if the LSP Encoding Type value is the G.709 Digital Path layer
      then the valid values are the ODUk signals (k = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3,
      3e1, 3e2, 4, flex@1.25, flex@2.5)
   o  if the LSP Encoding Type value is the G.709 Optical Channel layer
      then the valid values are the OCh at 2.5, 10, 40 or 100 Gbps

6.1.2.  Number of Multiplexed Components (NMC)

   The NMC field (16 bits) indicates the number of ODU tributary slots
   used by an ODUj when multiplexed into an ODUk (k >= j) for the
   requested LSP.  [ITUT-G709-AMD3] and [G.sup43] define new
   multiplexing cases for ODUk, therefore new ST, NMC combinations needs
   to be introduced in addition to those defined in [RFC4328] Section
   3.2.2: The following list illustrates the possible values for the NMC
   field:

   The Generalized Label value space for Digital Paths and Optical
   Channels based on [ITUT-G709] specification is defined in [RFC4328]



Ceccarelli, et al.      Expires January 28, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    GMPLS Signaling Ext for evolutive OTN        July 2009


   Section 4.1.  This section describes the Generalized Label values
   space for new Digital Paths and Optical Channels and for Digital Path
   layer multiplexing combinations introduced in [ITUT-G709-AMD3].  If
   one of those is to be signaled, then the new Generalized Label format
   MUST be used, otherwise the [RFC4328] format MUST be used.

7.1.  ODUk Label Space

   At the Digital Path layer (i.e.  ODUk layers), G.709, G.709 Amendment
   3 and G.sup43 define seven different client payload bit rates.  An
   Optical Data Unit (ODU) frame has been defined for each of these bit
   rates.  ODUk refers to the frame at bit rate k, where k =0 (for 1.25
   Gpbs), k = 1 (for 2.5 Gbps), 2 (for 10 Gbps), 2e for (10.25 Gbps), 3
   (for 40 Gbps), 4 (for 100 Gbps) or flex (for 1.25*ts Gbps and
   2,5*ts).

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk, the G.709 label
   space supports the sub-levels of ODUk multiplexing.  ODUk
   multiplexing refers to multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 3e1,
   3e2 and flex) into an ODUk (k > j).

   More precisely, ODUj into ODUk multiplexing (k > j) is defined when
   an ODUj is multiplexed into an ODUk Tributary Unit Group (i.e. an
   ODTUG constituted by ODU tributary slots) which is mapped into an
   OPUk.  The resulting OPUk is mapped into an ODUk and the ODUk is
   mapped into an OTUk.  Tributary slot granularity may be at 2.5 Gbps
   or 1.25 Gbps depending on the different multiplexing functions.

   Therefore, the label space structure is a tree whose root is an OTUk
   signal and leaves the ODUj signals (k >= j) that can be transported
   via the tributary slots and switched between these slots.  A G.709
   Digital Path layer label defined in [RFC4328] and a G.709 amendment
   3/G.sup43 Digital Path Layer label identify the exact position of a
   particular ODUj signal in an ODUk multiplexing structure.

   The G.709 amendment3/G.sup43 Digital Path Layer label or ODUk amd3/
   G.sup43 label has the following format:


       0                   1                   2                   3

   characterizes the ODUk label space.  The value space for the t1, t2,
   t3 and t4 fields is defined as follows:

          t1 value MUST be set to 0 and ignored).
   2.  t2 (5-bit):

          further sub-divided.

7.2.  Label Distribution Rules

   Label distribution rules are defined in [RFC4328] Section 4.2.


8.  RSVP-TE Signaling Protocol Extensions

   RSVP-TE will reuse the protocol extensions defined in [RFC4328]
   Section 6. and does not need to be further extended.

   When a amendment 3 aware node receives a Generalized Label Request it
   can infer the label format from the ST, NMC pair.  Instead when a non
   amendment 3 aware node receives a Generalized Label Request for a
   signals introduced in [ITUT-G709-AMD3], it will not support the
   requested Signal Type, NMC values.  Then the receiver node MUST
   generate a PathErr message with a "Traffic Control Error/Service
   unsupported" indication (see [RFC2205]) as specified in [RFC4328].

9.  Interworking Considerations

   Equipments supporting a 1.25G TS structure for OPU2 or OPU3 MUST be
   backward compatible with equipments which support only the 2.5G TS
   structure.  This section highlights some considerations on
   interworking between G.709 and new OTN equipments.  Following figure
   is a interworking example between G.709 and G.709 Amendment3/G.sup43.

        4*2.5G TS   32*1.25G TS  80*1.25G TS  16*2.5G TS   8*1.25G TS

          \|/          \|/         \|/         \|/          \|/

   +----+      +----+      +----+      +----+       +----+       +----+

   Interworking can probably be accomplished by requiring the new
   equipment to support the G.709 payload mappings onto link that are
   attached to another equipment.  One approach that may satisfy this is
   to represent the capacity of a link in terms of the number of
   timeslots and the time slot bandwidth.  This can be reflected in the
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor.  In the this scenario,
   node DXC2, DXC4 and DXC5 should have the interworking capability.

   With the introduction of many new Lower Order ODU bit rates, TE links
   should be represented by means of either their bandwidth or their
   number of tributary slots, the bandwidth per tributary slot and the
   set of client ODU signals supported.  Traffic Engineering Database
   (TED) should be composed of the following TE link for this scenario.

                  Max LSP Bandwidth  Minimum LSP Bandwidth
      OTU2(DXC1-DXC2)     ODU2 (10G)       ODU1 (2.5G)
      OTU2(DXC5-DXC6)     ODU2 (10G)       ODU0 (1.25G)
      OTU3(DXC2-DXC3)     ODU3 (40G)       ODU1 (1.25G)
      OTU3(DXC4-DXC5)     ODU3 (40G)       ODU1 (2.5G)
      OTU4(DXC3-DXC4)     ODU4 (100G)      ODU0 (1.25G)

   When we need to setup a ODU1 (2.5G) LSP between DXC1 and DXC6, the
   path computation entity may compute a DXC1-DXC2-DXC3- DXC4-DXC5-DXC6
   route by the ODU1 bandwidth request in an G.709 network.
   1.  In the case of one end-to-end session, the setup of a end-to-end
       connection must be based on the section "Backward Compatibility
       Considerations" in this document.  The Traffic Parameters have to
       be changed in DXC2, DXC4, and DXC5.

   2.  The end-to-end connection also can be setuped with multiple
       segment session (i.e., ODU1 LSP1, ODU1 LSP2, ODU1 LSP3, ODU1
       LSP4).

   +----+      +----+      +----+      +----+       +----+       +----+

    |<-ODU1 LSP1->|<-----ODU1 LSP2------>|<-ODU1 LSP3->|<-ODU1 LSP4->|

       During setup of each segment lsp, tributary slot size should be
       known to the control plane.  One approach that may satisfy this
       is based on the Signal Type in the Traffic Parameters.  Signal
       Type and NMC in each segment LSP don't need to be changed any
       more.  Following is the value of Signal Type for different
       segment LSP.

              Value     Type
   ODU1 LSP1  1         ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps is not further sub-divided)
   ODU1 LSP2  11        ODU1 /*The size of OPUk TS is 1.25G*/
   ODU1 LSP3  1         ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps is not further sub-divided)
   ODU1 LSP4  11        ODU1 /*The size of OPUk TS is 1.25G*/

       editor note: If the segment LSP can be created and prepaired for
       stitching by signaling, the end-to-end connection is stitched to
       several segment LSPs (i.e., ODU1 LSP1, ODU1 LSP2, ODU1 LSP3, ODU1
       LSP4).  The traffic parameters of this end-to-end session is TBD.


10.  Backward Compatibility Considerations

   Equipment supporting a 1.25G TS structure for OPU2 or OPU3 MUST be
   backward compatible with equipment which supports only the 2.5G TS
   structure.  Also, the extension defined in this document is backward
   compatible with [RFC4328] for ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3.  So the extension



Ceccarelli, et al.      Expires January 28, 2010               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    GMPLS Signaling Ext for evolutive OTN        July 2009


   defined in this document is a supplement and extension of [RFC4328].

   In terms of G.709 Amendment3, a one-byte payload type signal is
   defined in the PSI[0] byte of the payload structure identifier to
   indicate the composition of the OPUk signal.  The code points can
   differentiate whether the ODU multiplex structure supports 2.5G
   tributary slots or 1.25G tributary slots.  Also, in order to be
   backward compatible with [RFC4328] for ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3, it needs
   the Signal Type charactering the ODU multiplex structure to
   differentiate the size of tributary slots and the Generalized Label
   format.

   When a downstream (upstream) node receives Path (Resv) message in
   which Signal Type (i.e., ODU1, ODU2 or ODU3) characters ODU multiplex
   structure supporting 2.5G tributary slots, it must identify the
   Generalized Label format based on [RFC4328].

   When a downstream (upstream) node receives Path (Resv) message in
   which Signal Type (i.e., ODU1, ODU2 or ODU3) characters ODU multiplex
   structure supporting 1.25G tributary slots, it must identify the
   Generalized Label format based on this document.

   In other words a signal type defined in G.709 MUST be signaled by
   means of the label defined in [RFC4328], while a signal type defined
   in G.709 amendment 3 or G.sup43 MUST be signaled using the label
   defined in this document.

   Following is a example of backward compatibility for ODU1, ODU2 and
   ODU3.  For instance, we need to setup a ODU1 (2.5G bandwidth) LSP
   between node 1 and node 3.  Node 2 MUST identify the Generalized
   Label format based on [RFC4328] after receiving the Path message and
   Generalized Label format defined in this document after receiving the
   Resv message.  On the other hand, node 3 MUST identify the
   Generalized Label format based on this document.

                      Backward Compatibility Scenario

   A control plane designed for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43 MUST have
   the ability to synchronously process the different Generalized Label
   format of ODU2 and ODU3 defined in [RFC4328] and in this document.
   The Generalized Label format is identified by the Signal Type.

   When a downstream (upstream) node receives Path (Resv) message in
   which the Signal Type is ODU0, ODU2e, ODUflex, ODU4, ODU3e1 or
   ODU3e2, it must identify the Generalized Label format based on this
   document.

   If a node receives a Path message in which the Signal Type identifies
   the ODU multiplex structure, it MUST check the local mapping
   capability.  If it can not support this ODU multiplex structure, the
   Path message is terminated and a PathErr message with a "Traffic
   Control Error/Service unsupported" indication MUST be generated.

11.  Examples of Generalized Label

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the
   processing described in this document.
   1.   ODU4 in OTU4 mapping: when one ODU4 signal is directly
        transported into an OTU4,the upstream node requests results
        simply in an ODU4 signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return a unique
        label because the ODU4 is directly mapped into the corresponding
        OTU4.  Due to the fact that a single ODU4 signal is requested,
        the downstream node has to return a single ODU4 label, which is:

       - Signal type=14, t4=1, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates a single ODU4 mapped into an OTU4


   2.   ODU0 into ODUk multiplexing (k = 1, 2, 3 or 4): when one ODU0 is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU1 (ODU2, ODU3 or
        ODU4), the upstream node requests results simply in an ODU0
        signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return a unique
        label because the ODU0 is multiplexed into one ODTUG1 (ODTUG2,
        ODTUG3 or OTDUG4).  The latter is then mapped into the ODU1
        (ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4) via OPU1 (OPU2, OPU3 or OPU4) and then
        mapped into the corresponding OTU1 (OTU2, OTU3 or OTU4).  Due to
        the fact a single ODU0 multiplexed signal is requested (Signal
        Type = 10 and NMC = 1), the downstream node has to return a
        single ODU0 label, which can take, for instance, one of the
        following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=0, t1=1;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 1st TS of the ODTUG1

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=4, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 4th TS of the ODTUG2

       - t4=0, t3=26, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 26th TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=68, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 68th TS of the ODTUG4

   3.   ODU1 into 1.25G tributary slots of OPUk (k = 2, 3, 4)
        multiplexing: when one ODU1 is multiplexed into the payload of a
        structured ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4), the upstream node requests
        results simply in an ODU1 signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return two labels
        because the ODU1 is multiplexed into one ODTUG2 (ODTUG3 or
        ODTUG4).  The latter is then mapped into the ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4)
        via OPU2 (OPU3 or OPU4) and then mapped into the corresponding
        OTU2 (OTU3 or OTU4).  Due to the fact that a single ODU1
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 11 and NMC = 2),
        the downstream node has to return two ODU1 labels, which can
        take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=13, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 5th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG2

         or

       - t4=0, t3=58, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 26th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

         or

       - t4=82, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 1st 1.25G TS of the ODTUG4

   4.   ODU2 into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU3: when one ODU2 is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU3, the upstream
        node requests results simply in an ODU2 signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return eight
        labels because the ODU2 is multiplexed into one ODTUG3.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3 via OPU3 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3.  Due to the fact that a single ODU1
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 12 and NMC = 8),
        the downstream node has to return eight ODU2 labels, which can
        take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=67, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2 in the 3rd 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=73, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2 in the 9th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=82, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2 in the 18th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

   5.   ODU2/ODU2e into ODU4 multiplexing: when one ODU2 (or ODU2e) is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU4, the upstream
        node requests results simply in an ODU2 (or ODU2e) signal
        request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return eight
        labels because the ODU2 (ODU2e) is multiplexed into one ODTUG4.
        The latter is then mapped into the ODU4 via OPU4 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU4.  Because a single ODU2 (or ODU2e)
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 12 and NMC = 8 or
        Signal Type = 15 and NMC = 8), the downstream node has to return
        eight ODU2 (or ODU2e) labels, one of which can take, for
        instance, the following values:

       - Signal type=12, t4=182, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2 in the 21st TS of the ODTUG4

       - Signal type=15, t4=480, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 79th TS of the ODTUG4

   6.   ODU3 into ODU4 multiplexing: when one ODU3 is multiplexed into
        the payload of a structured ODU4, the upstream node requests
        results simply in an ODU3 signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return thirty-two
        labels because the ODU3 is multiplexed into one ODTUG4.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU4 via OPU4 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU4.  Because a single ODU3 multiplexed
        signal is requested (Signal Type = 13 and NMC = 32), the
        downstream node has to return thirty-two ODU3 labels, one of
        which can take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=248, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU3 in the 7th TS of the ODTUG4

       - t4=289, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU3 in the 48th TS of the ODTUG4

       - t4=71, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU3 in the 71st TS of the ODTUG4

   7.   ODU2e into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU3: when one ODU2e is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU3, the upstream
        node requests results simply in an ODU2e signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return nine
        labels because the ODU2e is multiplexed into one ODTUG3.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3 via OPU3 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3.  Due to the fact that a single
        ODU2e multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 15 and NMC
        = 9), the downstream node has to return nine ODU2e labels, one
        of which can take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=133, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 4th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=144, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 16th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=152, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 24th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

   8.   [NN] - ODU2e into ODU3e1 multiplexing: when one ODU2e is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU3e1, the
        upstream node requests results simply in an ODU2e signal
        request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return four
        labels because the ODU2e is multiplexed into one ODTUG3e1.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3e1 via OPU3e1 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3e1.  Because a single ODU2e
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 15 and NMC = 4),
        the downstream node has to return four ODU2e labels, which can
        take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=161, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 1st TS of the ODTUG3e1

       - t4=0, t3=166, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 6th TS of the ODTUG3e1

       - t4=0, t3=170, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 10th TS of the ODTUG3e1

       - t4=0, t3=175, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 15th TS of the ODTUG3e1

   9.   [NN] ODU2e into ODU3e2 multiplexing: when one ODU2e is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU3e2, the
        upstream node requests results simply in an ODU2e signal
        request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return eight
        labels because the ODU2e is multiplexed into one ODTUG3e2.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3e2 via OPU3e2 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3e2.  Because a single ODU2e
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 15 and NMC = 8),
        the downstream node has to return eight ODU2e labels, one of
        which can take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=181, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 5th TS of the ODTUG3e2

       - t4=0, t3=197, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 21st TS of the ODTUG3e2

       - t4=0, t3=207, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 31st TS of the ODTUG3e2

   10.  ODUflex is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU2 (OPU3 or
        OPU4).  When one ODUflex is multiplexed into the payload of a
        structured ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4), the upstream node requests
        results simply in an ODUflex signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return some
        labels whose number is determined in terms of NMC value.  The
        ODUflex is multiplexed into one ODTUG2 (ODTUG3 or ODTUG4).  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4) via OPU2
        (OPU3 or OPU4) and then mapped into the corresponding OTU2 (OTU3
        or OTU4).  Because a single ODUflex multiplexed signal is
        requested (Signal Type = 18), the downstream node has to return
        some labels (i.e., the number of labels is NMC), which can take,
        for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=21, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 5th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG2

         or

       - t4=0, t3=118, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 22nd 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

         or

       - t4=368, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 47th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG4

   11.  [NN] ODUflex is mapped into 2.5G tributary slots of OPU2 (or
        OPU3).  When one ODUflex is multiplexed into the payload of a
        structured ODU2 (or ODU3), the upstream node requests results
        simply in an ODUflex signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return some
        labels whose number is determined in terms of NMC value.  The
        ODUflex is multiplexed into one ODTUG2 (or ODTUG3).  The latter
        is then mapped into the ODU2 (or ODU3) via OPU2 (or OPU3) and
        then mapped into the corresponding OTU2 (or OTU3).  Because a
        single ODUflex multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type =

        19), the downstream node has to return some labels (i.e., the
        number of labels is NMC), which can take, for instance, the
        following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=26, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 2nd 2.5G TS of the ODTUG2

         or

       - t4=0, t3=220, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 12nd 2.5G TS of the ODTUG3

14.  Security Considerations

   The procedures described in this document rely completely on RSVP-TE
   messages and mechanism.  The use of H bit set in Admin Status Object
   basically informs the receiving entity that no operations are to be
   done over Data Plane as consequence of such special signaling flow.
   Using specially flagged signaling messages we want to limit the
   function of setup and tear down messages to Control Plane, making
   them not effective over related Data Plane resource usage.  So, no
   additional or special issues are arisen by adopting this procedure,
   that aren't already brought up by the use of the same messages,
   without H bit setting, for LSP control.  For RSVP-TE Security please
   refer to [RFC3473].
