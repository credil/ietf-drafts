    <abstract>
      <t>Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in
      IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document deprecates the
      concept that an IP-capable node MAY support IPv4 _only_, and redefines
      an IP-capable node as one which supports either IPv6 _only_ or IPv4/IPv6
      dual-stack. This document updates RFC1812, RFC1122 and RFC4084 to
      reflect the change in requirements.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IP version 4 (IPv4) has served to connect public and private hosts
      all over the world for over 30 years. However, due to the success of the
      Internet in finding new and innovative uses for IP networking, billions
      of hosts are now connected via the Internet and requiring unique
      addressing. This demand has led to the exhaustion of the IANA global
      pool of unique IPv4 addresses <xref target="IANA-exhaust"></xref>, and
      will be followed by the exhaustion of the free pools for each Regional
      Internet Registry (RIR), the first of which is APNIC <xref
      target="APNIC-exhaust"></xref>. While transition technologies and other
      means to extend the lifespan of IPv4 do exist, nearly all of them come
      with tradeoffs that prevent them from being optimal long-term solutions
      when compared with deployment of IP version 6 (IPv6) as a means to allow
      continued growth on the Internet. See <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.donley-nat444-impacts"></xref> for some discussion on this
      topic.</t>

      <t>IPv6 <xref target="RFC1883"></xref> was proposed in 1995 as, among
      other things, a solution to the limitations on globally unique
      addressing that IPv4's 32-bit addressing space represented, and has been
      under continuous refinement and deployment ever since. <xref
      target="RFC2460"></xref>. The exhaustion of IPv4 and the continued
      growth of the internet worldwide has created the driver for widespread
      IPv6 deployment.</t>

      <t>However, the IPv6 deployment necessary to reduce reliance on IPv4 has
      been hampered by a lack of ubiquitous hardware and software support
      throughout the industry. Many vendors, especially in the consumer space
      have continued to view IPv6 support as optional. Even today they are
      still selling "IP capable" or "Internet Capable" devices which are not
      IPv6-capable, which has continued to push out the point at which the
      natural hardware refresh cycle will significantly increase IPv6 support
      in the average home or enterprise network. They are also choosing not to
      update existing software to enable IPv6 support on software-updatable
      devices, which is a problem because it is not realistic to expect that
      the hardware refresh cycle will single-handedly purge IPv4-only devices
      from the active network in a reasonable amount of time. This is a
      significant problem, especially in the consumer space, where the network
      operator often has no control over the hardware the consumer chooses to
      use. For the same reason that the average consumer is not making a
      purchasing decision based on the presence of IPv6 support in their
      Internet-capable devices and services, consumers are unlikely to replace
      their still-functional Internet-capable devices simply to add IPv6
      support - they don't know or don't care about IPv6, they simply want
      their devices to work as advertised.</t>

      <t>This lack of support is making the eventual IPv6 transition
      considerably more difficult, and drives the need for expensive and
      complicated transition technologies to extend the life of IPv4-only
      devices as well as eventually to interwork IPv4-only and IPv6-only
      hosts. While IPv4 is expected to coexist on the Internet with IPv6 for
      many years, a transition from IPv4 as the dominant Internet Protocol
      towards IPv6 as the dominant Internet Protocol will need to occur. The
      sooner the majority of devices support IPv6, the less protracted this
      transition period will be.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="simple_list" title="Requirements and Recommendation">
      <t>This draft updates the following documents:</t>

      <t>Updates <xref target="RFC1812"></xref>, especially sections 1, 2, and
      4 which use the generic "IP" synonymously with the more specific "IPv4."
      Since RFC1812 is an IPv4 router specification, the generic use of IP in
      this standard may cause confusion as IP is redefined to mean IPv4 +
      IPv6. This proposed update is not intended to change the existing
      technical interpretation of RFC1812 to include IPv6 in its
      implementation details. Rather, it is intended to ensure that those
      using RFC1812 as a guideline for IP implementations understand that IP
      nodes SHOULD NOT support IPv4 only, and that they should use the other
      informative references in this document as a companion guideline for
      proper IPv6 implementations. </t>

      <t>Updates <xref target="RFC1122"></xref> to clarify that this document,
      especially in section 3, primarily discusses IPv4 where it uses the more
      generic term "IP" and is no longer a complete definition of "IP" or the
      Internet Protocol suite by itself. For example, section 3.1 does not
      contain references to the IPv6 equivalent standards for the Internet
      layer, section 3.2 is a protocol walk-through for IPv4 only; section
      3.2.1.1 explicitly requires an IP datagram whose version number is not 4
      to be discarded, which would be detrimental to IPv6 forwarding. However,
      portions of RFC1122 refer to the Internet Layer and IP more in terms of
      its function and are less version-specific, such as Section 1.1.3. In
      these cases, it is possible to redefine generic "IP" support to include
      and require IPv6 for IP-capable nodes and routers. </t>

      <t>Updates <xref target="RFC4084"></xref> to move "Version Support" from
      Section 4, "Additional Terminology" to Section 2, "General Terminology."
      This is to reflect the idea that version support is now critical to
      defining the types of IP service, especially with respect to Full
      Internet Connectivity.</t>

      <t>Rather than update the existing IPv4 protocol specification standards
      to include IPv6, IETF has defined a completely separate set of
      standalone documents which cover IPv6. Therefore, the above-listed
      standards are not being updated to include the complete technical
      details of IPv6, but to identify that a distinction must be made between
      IPv4 and IPv6 in some places where IP is used generically. Current
      requirements for IPv6 support can be found in <xref
      target="RFC4294"></xref>, soon to be updated by <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis"></xref> and in <xref
      target="RFC6204"></xref>. Each of these documents contains specific
      information, requirements, and references to other draft and proposed
      standards governing many aspects of IPv6 implementation.</t>

      <t>From a practical perspective, the requirements proposed by this draft
      mean that:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>New IP implementations MUST support IPv6.</t>

          <t>Current IP implementations SHOULD support IPv6.</t>

          <t>IPv6 support MUST be equivalent or better in quality and
          functionality when compared to IPv4 support in an IP
          implementation.</t>

          <t>Current and new IP Networking implementations SHOULD support IPv4
          and IPv6 coexistence (dual-stack), but MUST NOT require IPv4 for
          proper and complete function.</t>

          <t>It is expected that many existing devices and implementations
          will not be able to support IPv6 for one or more valid technical
          reasons, but for maximum flexibility and compatibility, a best
          effort SHOULD be made to update existing hardware and software to
          enable IPv6 support.</t>
