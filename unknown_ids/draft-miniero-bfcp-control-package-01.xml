		<t>
			The Media Control Channel Framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>
			provides a generic approach for establishment and reporting
			capabilities of remotely initiated commands. The Framework utilizes
			many functions provided by the Session Initiation Protocol
			(SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"/> for the rendezvous and establishment of a reliable channel for
			control interactions. The Control Framework also introduces the
			concept of a Control Package. A Control Package is an explicit usage
			of the Control Framework for a particular interaction set. This
			specification defines a package for floor control in conferences based
			on the use of the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) <xref target="RFC4582"/>.
		</t>
		<t>
			Floor control is needed whenever access to a resource, or set of resources,
			needs to be moderated. A typical example is the right to talk in a conference.
			In such a scenario, a participant willing to talk would first have to place
			a request concerning the floor associated with such audio resource.
			The participant would then be added to the conference mix only when his
			request has been granted, by the server itself or by a designated chair.
			RFC4582 <xref target="RFC4582"/> defines a Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)
			to specifically deal with such a need. It defines all the relevant entities
			(floors, queues, requests) and related actors (floor control servers, participants and chairs).
			So, the scope of this package is adding BFCP-based floor control functionality
			to complementary packages that might need it, as the Mixer Control Package
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package"/>.
			In particular, this package aims at dealing with the case where the Floor Control Server (FCS),
			as defined in <xref target="RFC4582"/>, is co-located with the Media Server (MS).
			In fact, if the FCS were co-located with the Application Server (AS), floor
			control would be part of the AS application logic, and thus out of scope for
			the MS. A typical example of how this could be accomplished is the 'controller'
			mechanism as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package"/>,
			where mixing in the MS and its contributors are actively setup by the AS, according
			to any policy the AS might be enforcing, including floor control.
		</t>
		<t>
			Considering users are added by the AS to the MS by means of a 3PCC
			<xref target="RFC3725"/> mechanism, a way to include BFCP negotiation
			is needed. In fact, users willing to act as floor participants will need
			to be made aware of all the relevant identifiers (i.e. the transport
			address of the floor control server, the BFCP conference
			ID associated with the mix, the BFCP user ID the user has been assigned,
			all the floor identifiers and their mapping with existing resources, and
			so on) to properly interact with a floor control server.
			To achieve this, RFC4583 <xref target="RFC4583"/> provides with
			a way to negotiate BFCP connections within the context of a
			SDP offer/answer <xref target="RFC3264"/>.
		</t>

	<!-- Control Package Definition -->
	<section title="Control Package Definition" anchor="sec-ctrlpkg">
		<t>
			This section fulfills the mandatory requirement for information that
			MUST be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
			Package, as detailed in Section 9 of
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>.

		</t>
		<section title="Control Package Name" anchor="sec-ctrlpkg-name">
			<t>
				<t>The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
				specify and register a unique name and version.</t>
				
				<t>The name and version of this Control Package is "msc-bfcp/1.0"
				(Media Server Control - Binary Floor Control - version 1.0).</t>

			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Framework Message Usage" anchor="sec-ctrlpkg-msg">
			<t>
				BFCP functionality includes several different capabilities.
				There must be means to appropriately create, modify and
				destroy each of the available resources. This includes means
				to create a BFCP conference with specified settings,
				adding and removing floors to the conference, setting
				or unsetting designated chairs for such floors and so on.
				Proper subscription and notification mechanisms must also
				be made available, in order to make the AS aware of all the
				relevant events it might be interested to.
			</t>
			<t>
				This package defines XML elements in <xref target="sec-element"/>
				and provides an XML Schema in <xref target="sec-syntax"/>.
				Additionally, some examples are provided in <xref target="sec-examples"/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				The XML elements in this package are split into requests, responses
				and event notifications, all of which are contained within a root
				&lt;mscbfcp&gt; element. Requests are carried in CONTROL message
				bodies; &lt;moderateconference&gt; and &lt;addfloor&gt; elements
				are examples of package requests. Responses are carried either in
				REPORT message or Control Framework 200 response bodies; the
				&lt;response&gt; element is defined as a package response. Event
				notifications are instead carried in CONTROL message bodies; the
				&lt;event&gt; element is defined for package event notifications. Event
				subscription is accomplished by means of the &lt;subscribe&gt; element.
			</t>
			<t>
				Note that package responses are different from framework response
				codes. Framework error response codes (see Section 8 of
				<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>)
				are used when the request or event notification is invalid; for example,
				a request is invalid XML (400), or not understood (500). Package
				responses are carried in 200 response or REPORT message bodies. This
				package's response codes are defined in <xref target="sec-response"/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				The schema uses the &quot;connection-id&quot; and &quot;conf-id&quot; attributes
				which are imported from the schema defined in the core Control Framework
				<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Common XML Support" anchor="sec-ctrlpkg-xml">
			<t>
				The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
				specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
				are required.
			</t>
			<t>
				This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 17.1 of
				<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework"/>
				MUST be supported for media dialogs and conferences.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="CONTROL Message Body" anchor="sec-ctrlpkg-control">
			<t>
				The Control Framework requires a Control Package to define the
				control body that can be contained within a CONTROL command request
				and to indicate the location of detailed syntax definitions and
				semantics for the appropriate body types.
			</t>
			<t>
				When operating as Control Framework Server, the MS receives CONTROL
				messages with a body containing an &lt;mscbfcp&gt; element with either a
				floor control management or audit request child element.
			</t>
			<t>
				The following mixer management request elements are carried in
				CONTROL message bodies to MS: &lt;moderateconference&gt; (<xref target="sec-moderate"/>),
				&lt;unmoderateconference&gt; (<xref target="sec-unmoderate"/>), &lt;addfloor&gt;
				(<xref target="sec-addfloor"/>), &lt;modifyfloor&gt; (<xref target="sec-modifyfloor"/>), &lt;removefloor&gt;
				(<xref target="sec-removefloor"/>), &lt;addparticipant&gt; (<xref target="sec-addparticipant"/>),
				&lt;modifyparticipant&gt; (<xref target="sec-modifyparticipant"/>) and
				&lt;removeparticipant&gt; (<xref target="sec-removeparticipant"/>) elements.
			</t>
			<t>
				The &lt;audit&gt; request element (<xref target="sec-audit-root"/>) is also carried in
				CONTROL message bodies.
			</t>
			<t>
				When operating as Control Framework Client, the MS sends CONTROL
				messages with a body containing a notification &lt;event&gT; element
				(<xref target="sec-event"/>).
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="REPORT Message Body" anchor="sec-ctrlpkg-report">
			<t>
				A valid REPORT body MUST conform to the schema defined in
				<xref target="sec-syntax"/> and described in <xref target="sec-element"/>.
				XML messages appearing in REPORT messages MUST contain a &lt;response&gt;
				(<xref target="sec-response"/>), or a (notification)
				&lt;event&gt; element (<xref target="sec-event"/>).
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Audit" anchor="sec-ctrlpkg-audit">
			<t>
				The Control Framework encourages Control Packages to specify whether
				auditing is available, how it is triggered as well as the query/
				response formats.
			</t>
			<t>
				This Control Packages supports auditing of package capabilities and
				dialogs on the MS.  An audit request is carried in a CONTROL messages
				and an audit response in a REPORT message (or a 200 reponse to the
				CONTROL if it can execute the audit in time).
			</t>
			<t>
				The syntax and semantics of audit request and response elements is
				defined in Section 4.4.
			</t>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section title="Floors Manipulation" anchor="sec-floors">
		<t>
			Before delving into the details of the package elements,
			a few words are worth being spent with respect to how
			floors are assumed to be manipulated in this package.
		</t>
		<t>
			Floors are defined as tokens associated with a
			resource, or set of resources, in order to
			moderate the access to their functionality
			by users. This introduces the need for a mechanism
			in the package to properly take care of this
			kind of association, especially when dealing
			about resources directly manipulated by
			the Media Server (e.g. andio and video).
		</t>
		<t>
			Let's consider the following figure, which
			presents the view of an audio conference
			with three participants, and the related
			media labels associated with each participant's
			media stream:

		<t>
			Even if each participant sees a different
			label for the stream it has with the mixer,
			the floor associated with the only available
			resource in the conference (audio) is the same.
			This means that the package needs to have
			a way to address each resource in the conference
			according to how it is defined in
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package"/>,
			e.g. &quot;associate media 'audio' with floor 11&quot; or
			any other more complex assignment involving labels and the like.
			Once a participant's media stream is attached to the
			resource, the related label is consequently associated
			with the floor as specified in <xref target="RFC4583"/>.
			<xref target="fig-conf-bfcp"/> depicts such the case
			where all the participants have been attached to the
			mix.

			The same approach can be considered when dealing with
			different floors associated with one or more different
			resources, e.g. conferences with an audio and a video stream,
			conferences with two different audio streams, and so on.
			Each floor needs to be unambiguously associated with
			a subset of the available resources (e.g. floor 11 is audio1
			and floor 22 is video, or floor 11 is audio1 while floor 22 is
			audio2, or floor 11 is audio1 AND audio2 AND video2, and
			so on).
		</t>
		<t>
			To achieve this, each floor, together with its configuration,
			is defined in the package by the &lt;floor&gt; element, as
			described in <xref target="sec-floor"/>.
