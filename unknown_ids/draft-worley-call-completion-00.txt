1.  Introduction

   This paper is a companion to and extension of [2], in order to give a
   more detailed discussion of the implementation of the "call
   completion on busy subscriber" and "call completion on no response"
   features within SIP[1].  It is presented separately from [2] in order
   to allow this proposal to be discussed and refined before integrating
   it with the more mature work in [2].  This paper assumes a
   familiarity with the concept of the CCBS and CCNR features, as well
   as familiarity with the implementation proposed in [2].

2.  Outline

   The call-completion architecture augments each caller's UA (or UAC)
   which wishes to be able to use the call-completion features with with
   a "call-completion agent" (also written as "CC agent", "agent", or
   "caller's agent").  It augments each callee's UA (or UAS) which
   wishes to be able to be the target of the call-completion features
   with a "call-completion monitor" (also written as "CC monitor",
   "monitor", or "callee's monitor").  The caller's agent subscribes to
   the call-completion event package[2] of the callee's monitor in order
   to coordinate with the monitor to implement the call-completion
   features.

   When the caller's UA makes a call to a callee that fails (either
   because the callee was busy or the callee did not answer), and the
   caller wishes to use CCBS or CCNR to contact the callee later, the
   caller instructs the caller's agent to activate the CC feature.

   The caller's agent sends a SUBSCRIBE request for the call-completion
   event package to the original destination URI of the call.  This
   SUBSCRIBE reaches the callee's monitor.  The callee's monitor uses
   the existence of the subscription to know that the caller is
   interested in using the CC feature for the original call.  The
   monitor keeps a list or queue of failed calls to the callee, and of
   the caller's agent subscriptions, which indicate the callers that are
   waiting to use the CC features.

   When the callee UA becomes free in a suitable way for call-
   completion, the callee's monitor selects one caller's agent to be the
   next caller to execute call-completion.  The callee's monitor sends a
   call-completion event update to the selected caller's agent telling
   it to begin execution of call-completion.

   When the caller's agent receives this update, it calls the caller's
   UA or otherwise tests whether the caller is available to take
   advantage of call-completion.  If the caller is available, the agent
   directs the caller's UA to make again the call to the callee.  This
   call is identified as a call-completion call so it can be given
   precedence in reaching the callee's UA.

3.  Detailed Description

3.1.  Caller's Call-Completion Agent

   The call-completion architecture augments each caller's UA (or UAC)
   which wishes to be able to use the call-completion features with with
   a "call-completion agent".  An agent may be associated with more than
   one UA if it is common that a caller or population of users will be
   shared between the UAs, and especially if the UAs share an AOR.

   The caller's agent has a method of monitoring calls made from the
   UA(s) in order to determine their Call-Id's and (potentially) their
   final response statuses.  This may be achieved by subscribing to the
   dialog event package of the UA(s) or by other means.

   The callers using the UA(s) can indicate to the caller's agent when
   they wish to avail themselves of CC for a recently-made call which
   failed to reach their chosen destination.  This may be achieved by an
   INVITE to a special URI which is routed to the caller's agent or by
   other means.

   The caller's agent has a method of monitoring the status of the UA(s)
   to determine when they are available to be used for a CC call.  This
   may be achieved by subscribing to the dialog event package of the
   UA(s) or by other means.

   The caller's agent can communicate to the UA(s) that CC has become
   active and to inquire if the relevant calling user is available for
   the CC call.  This may be achieved by sending an INVITE to the UA(s)
   or by other means.

   The caller's agent can order the UA(s) at which the relevant calling
   user is available to generate a CC call to the callee.  This may be
   achieved by sending a REFER to the UA(s) or by other means.

3.2.  Callee's Call-Completion Monitor

   The call-completion architecture augments callee's UA (or UAS) which
   wishes to be able to be the target of the call-completion features
   with a "call-completion monitor".  A monitor may be associated with
   more than one UA if it is common that a callee or population of users
   will be shared between the UAs, and especially if the UAs share an
   AOR.

   The callee's monitor has a method of monitoring calls made to the
   UA(s) in order to determine their Call-Id's and (potentially) their
   final response statuses.  This may be achieved by subscribing to the
   dialog event package of the UA(s) or by other means (e.g., by



Worley                   Expires April 27, 2008                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               Call Completion                October 2007


   communication with the UA's "home proxy").

   The callee's using the UA(s) may be able to indicate to the callee's
   monitor when they wish to receive CC calls.  This may be achieved by
   an INVITE to a special URI which is routed to the callee's monitor or
   by other means.

   The callee's monitor has a method of monitoring the status of the
   UA(s) to determine when they are in a suitable state to receive a CC
   call.  This state may vary depending on the type of CC call in
   question.  E.g., a UA is available for CCBS when it is not busy, but
   a UA is available for CCNR when it becomes not busy after being busy
   with an established call.  This monitoring may be achieved by
   subscribing to the dialog event package of the UA(s) or by other
   means.

   The callee's monitor maintains information about the set of INVITEs
   that have been received by the UA(s) that did not obtain successful
   final responses.  In practice, the monitor may remove knowledge about
   an incoming dialog from its set if its CC policy establishes that the
   dialog is no longer eligible for CC.

3.3.  The Original Call Is Made

   The caller's UA sends an INVITE to a request URI.  One or more forks
   of this request reach one or more of the callee's UAs.  By
   hypothesis, none of the callee's UAs returns a success response, as
   otherwise, call completion services would not be needed for this
   call.  However, the caller's INVITE might succeed at some other UA
   that the calling user considers insufficient to satisfy his needs.
   E.g., a call that is not answered by the callee user may connect to
   the callee user's voicemail server.  Eventually, the INVITE fails, or
   the resulting dialog(s) are terminated.  Note that the Call-Id of the
   INVITE is a unique identifier of this call attempt.

   The caller's agent records the request URI, the Call-Id, and possibly
   the final request status that the caller's UA received.  The callee's
   monitor records the Call-Id and possibly the final request status(es)
   returned by the callee's UA(s).

   Note that the caller's UA may not receive any response from any of
   the callee's UA(s), as the final response returned to the caller's UA
   may have been from a fork that reached a UA that was not the
   callee's.

3.4.  Call-Completion Is Invoked

   The calling user indicates to the caller's agent that he wishes to



Worley                   Expires April 27, 2008                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               Call Completion                October 2007


   invoke call-completion services on the recent call.  Note that from
   the SIP point of view, the INVITE may be successful, but from the
   user's point of view, the call may be unsuccessful.  E.g., the call
   may have connected to the callee's voicemail, which would return a
   200 status to the INVITE but from the caller's point of view is "no
   reply".

   Question: At this point, it seems that the best choice is that the
   caller's agent need not determine what type of CC is being requested
   (CCNR vs. CCBS), as (1) it cannot determine this from the INVITE
   final response, (2) it would be a burden to make the calling user to
   specify it, and (3) the callee's monitor can determine this from the
   responses returned by the callee's UAs.

   The caller's agent subscribes to the call-completion event package[2]
   using the request URI of the original call.  This SUBSCRIBE should be
   routed in much the same way as the original INVITE, but ultimately
   being routed not to the callee's UAs but to the callee's monitor.
   The Event header of the subscribe specifies the call-completion event
   package with a parameter "call_id=[Call-Id of the original call]".

   Question: Should the specification of the original call be done in
   the SUBSCRIBE body rather than in an event-param?

   The SUBSCRIBE should have headers to optimize its routing.  In
   particular, it should contain "Request-Disposition: parallel, no-
   cancel", and an Accept-Contact header to eliminate callee UAs that
   are not acceptable to the calling user.[3]

   The callee's monitor(s) that receive the SUBSCRIBE establish
   subscriptions.  These subscriptions represent the caller's agent's
   request for call-completion services.  The callee's monitor must be
   prepared to receive multiple forks of a single SUBSCRIBE, and should
   respond 482 (Merged Request) to all but one fork.  The callee's
   monitor must be prepared to receive SUBSCRIBEs regarding original
   calls that it has no knowledge of, and should respond 404 (Not Found)
   to such SUBSCRIBEs.  The monitor may apply additional restrictions as
   to which caller's agents may subscribe.

   The caller's agent must be prepared to receive multiple responses to
   the SUBSCRIBE and to have multiple subscriptions established.  The
   agent must also be prepared to have the SUBSCRIBE fail, in which
   case, CC cannot be invoked for this original call.

   The call-completion event package returns various information to the
   caller's agent, but the vital datum is that it contains an indication
   whether the callee's monitor has chosen the caller's agent to perform
   the next CC call to the callee.  This datum is initially false.

Internet-Draft               Call Completion                October 2007


3.5.  The Call-Completion Request Is Queued

   The continuation of the caller's agent's subscription indicates that
   the caller's agent is prepared to initiate the CC call when it is
   selected by the callee's monitor.  If the caller's agent becomes
   unwilling to initiate the CC call (e.g., because the calling user has
   deactivated CC or because the caller's UA becomes busy), the caller's
   agent must terminate or suspend the subscription(s).  (Currently, no
   method of suspending a subscription is defined.)  If the caller's
   agent later becomes willing again to initiate CC for the original
   call, it may resume the suspended subscription(s) or initiate new
   one(s).

   If the callee's monitor becomes aware that, according to its policy,
   the original call referenced by a subscription will never be selected
   for call-completion, it should terminate the subscription.  (And
   respond to any attempt to start a new subscription for that original
   call with 404.)

3.6.  Call-Completion Is Activated

   The callee's monitor has a policy regarding when and how it selects
   CC requests to be activated.  This policy may take into account the
   type of the requests (CCNR vs. CCBS), the state of the callee's
   UA(s), the order in which the original calls arrived, and any
   previous CC attempts for the same original call.  Usually the
   callee's monitor will choose only one CC request for activation at a
   time, but if the callee's UA(s) can support multiple calls, it may
   choose more than one.

   The callee's monitor changes the "call completion active" datum for
   the chosen caller's agent from false to true.  This triggers a
   notification for the agent's subscription.

   The agent receives the notification with the CC active datum set to
   true.  It then terminates or suspends all other CC subscriptions for
   this original call, and all CC subscriptions for all other original
   calls, in order to prevent any other CC requests from this caller
   from being activated.  The agent then determines whether the calling
   user is available for the CC call, usually by calling the caller's
   UA(s).

   If the calling user is not available, the caller's agent indicates
   this to the callee's monitor by terminating the CC subscription.

   If the calling user is available, the caller's agent causes the
   caller's UA to initiate a call to the request URI (which is expected
   to be routed to the callee's UA(s)).

Internet-Draft               Call Completion                October 2007


   Question: Should the callee's monitor supply a URI which should be
   used in the CC call?  This seems like it would be more reliable, as
   the monitor is probably "for" a particular callee URI, and it has no
   information about the destinations of any other forks of the original
   call.

   Question: The CC must be marked in some way as a CC call in order for
   the callee's monitor to know that the CC activation is being acted
   upon by the caller's agent.  And the marking must include the
   original Call-Id to allow correlation with the original call.
   Possibilities for a marking are a special URI-parameter on the
   request URI or a special header.

   The callee's UA(s) and any associated proxies may give the CC call
   precedence over non-CC calls.

   The callee's monitor supervises the receiving of the CC call.  If the
   CC call does not arrive at the callee's UA(s) promptly, the monitor
   will withdraw CC activation from the caller's agent by changing the
   value of its CC active datum to false.  Similarly, if the CC call
   fails, the monitor will withdraw CC activation.  Depending on its
   policy, the same original call may be selected again for CC
   activation at a later time.  If the CC call succeeds, the monitor
   will also withdraw CC activation, but the original call will never
   again be selected for CC activation (and in practice, can be deleted
   from the monitor's records).

   Question: Is that last statement true?  Can a call appear to succeed
   from the monitor's point of view but fail from the calling user's
   point of view?

   Once the CC call has failed, or if it has succeeded, once the CC call
   has been terminated, the callee's monitor's policy may select another
   CC request for activation.

3.7.  Data Provided in the Call-Completion Event Package

   Question: What format should the event package data be presented in?
   [2] proposes a simple attribute-value format.  We might also consider
   yet another XML format.

   The only necessary information to be provided by the call-completion
   event package is the CC activation datum, whose value is false
   (meaning that this CC request has not been chosen for activation) or
   true (meaning that it has).

   Question: If we decide to let the callee's monitor provide the
   request URI for the CC call, that request URI should probably be a



Worley                   Expires April 27, 2008                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               Call Completion                October 2007


   mandatory datum as well.

   The event package may provide information about the callee's
   monitor's policy.  In particular, the PSTN CC feature gives an
   indication of the "service retention" attribute, which indicates
   whether the CC request can be continued to a later time if the call-
   completion call fails due to the callee's UA(s) being busy.[2]

   If the callee has a caller-queuing facility, we want to treat the
   call-completion queue as part of the queuing facility, and include in
   the event package information regarding the state of the queue, such
   as number of callers ahead of this caller and expected wait time.  In
   that case, this data should probably not trigger a notification every
   time it changes, but rather at suitable time increments.

4.  Security Considerations

   The use of the CC facility allows the caller's agent to determine
   some status information regarding the callee.  The information is
   confined to a busy/not-busy indication, and is to a considerable
   degree protected by the necessity of presenting the Call-Id of a
   recent call to the callee in order to obtain information.

   The CC facility may enhance the effectiveness of SPIT by the
   following technique: The caller makes calls to a group of targets.
   The caller then requests CC for the calls that do not connect to the
   targets.  The CC calls resulting are probably more likely to reach
   the targets than original calls to a further group of targets.
