    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an architectural framework for the
      application of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to the construction
      of packet-switched transport networks. It describes a common set of
      protocol functions - the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) - that
      supports the operational models and capabilities typical of such
      networks, including signaled or explicitly provisioned bi-directional
      connection-oriented paths, protection and restoration mechanisms,
      comprehensive Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
      functions, and network operation in the absence of a dynamic control
      plane or IP forwarding support. Some of these functions are defined in
      existing MPLS specifications, while others require extensions to
      existing specifications to meet the requirements of the MPLS-TP.</t>

      <t>This document defines the subset of the MPLS-TP applicable in general
      and to point-to-point transport paths. The remaining subset, applicable
      specifically to point-to-multipoint transport paths, is outside the
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
      Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
      Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
      capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
      defined by the ITU-T.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Motivation and Background">
        <t>This document describes an architectural framework for the
        application of MPLS to the construction of packet-switched transport
        networks. It specifies the common set of protocol functions that meet
        the requirements in <xref target="RFC5654"></xref>, and that together
        constitute the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) for point-to-point
        transport paths. The remaining MPLS-TP functions, applicable
        specifically to point-to-multipoint transport paths, are outside the
        scope of this document.</t>

        <t>Historically the optical transport infrastructure - Synchronous
        Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) and Optical
        Transport Network (OTN) - has provided carriers with a high benchmark
        for reliability and operational simplicity. To achieve this, transport
        technologies have been designed with specific characteristics:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Strictly connection-oriented connectivity, which may be
            long-lived and may be provisioned manually, for example by network
            management systems or direct node configuration using a command
            line interface.</t>

            <t>A high level of availability.</t>

            <t>Quality of service.</t>

            <t>Extensive OAM capabilities.</t>
          </list> Carriers wish to evolve such transport networks to take
        advantage of the flexibility and cost benefits of packet switching
        technology and to support packet based services more efficiently.
        While MPLS is a maturing packet technology that already plays an
        important role in transport networks and services, not all MPLS
        capabilities and mechanisms are needed in, or consistent with, the
        transport network operational model. There are also transport
        technology characteristics that are not currently reflected in
        MPLS.</t>

        <t>There are thus two objectives for MPLS-TP:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>To enable MPLS to be deployed in a transport network and
            operated in a similar manner to existing transport
            technologies.</t>

            <t>To enable MPLS to support packet transport services with a
            similar degree of predictability to that found in existing
            transport networks.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In order to achieve these objectives, there is a need to define a
        common set of MPLS protocol functions - an MPLS Transport Profile -
        for the use of MPLS in transport networks and applications. Some of
        the necessary functions are provided by existing MPLS specifications,
        while others require additions to the MPLS tool-set. Such additions
        should, wherever possible, be applicable to MPLS networks in general
        as well as those that conform strictly to the transport network
        model.</t>

        <t>This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
        Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
        Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an
        MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to
        support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
        network as defined by the ITU-T.</t>

        <section title="Transport Network">
          <t>A Transport Network provides transparent transmission of client
          user plane traffic between attached client devices by establishing
          and maintaining point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections
          between such devices. The architecture of networks supporting point
          to multipoint connections is outside the scope of this document. A
          Transport Network is independent of any higher-layer network that
          may exist between clients, except to the extent required to supply
          this transmission service. In addition to client traffic, a
          Transport Network may carry traffic to facilitate its own operation,
          such as that required to support connection control, network
          management, and Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
          functions.</t>

            </list>A UNI service interface may be a layer 2 interface that
          carries only network layer clients. MPLS-TP LSPs are both necessary
          and sufficient to support this service interface as described in
          section 3.4.3. Alternatively, it may be a layer 2 interface that
          carries both network layer and non-network layer clients. To support
          this service interface, a PW is required to adapt the client traffic
          received over the service interface. This PW in turn is a client of
          the MPLS-TP server layer. This is described in section 3.4.2.</t>

          <t>An NNI service interface may be to an MPLS LSP or a PW. To
          support this case an MPLS-TP PE participates in the service
          interface signaling.</t>

      <t>MPLS-TP LSPs do not merge with other LSPs at an MPLS-TP LSR and it
      must be possible to detect if a merged LSP has been created.</t>

      <t>It must be possible to forward packets solely based on switching the
      MPLS or PW label. It must also be possible to establish and maintain
      LSPs and/or pseudowires both in the absence or presence of a dynamic
      control plane. When static provisioning is used, there must be no
      dependency on dynamic routing or signaling.</t>

      <t>OAM, protection and forwarding of data packets must be able to
      operate without IP forwarding support.</t>

      <t>It must be possible to monitor LSPs and pseudowires through the use
      of OAM in the absence of control plane or routing functions. In this
      case information gained from the OAM functions is used to initiate path
      recovery actions at either the PW or LSP layers.</t>

    <section title="MPLS Transport Profile Overview">
      <section anchor="pts" title="Packet Transport Services">
        <t>One objective of MPLS-TP is to enable MPLS networks to provide
        packet transport services with a similar degree of predictability to
        that found in existing transport networks. Such packet transport
        services inherit a number of characteristics, defined in <xref
        target="RFC5654"></xref>:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>In an environment where an MPLS-TP layer network is supporting
            a client layer network, and the MPLS-TP layer network is supported
            by a server layer network then operation of the MPLS-TP layer
            network must be possible without any dependencies on either the
            server or client layer network.</t>

            <t>The service provided by the MPLS-TP network to the client is
            guaranteed not to fall below the agreed level regardless of other
            client activity.</t>

            <t>The control and management planes of any client network layer
            that uses the service is isolated from the control and management
            planes of the MPLS-TP layer network, where the client network
            layer is considered to be the native service of the MPLS-TP
            network.</t>

            <t>Where a client network makes use of an MPLS-TP server that
            provides a packet transport service, the level of co-ordination
            required between the client and server layer networks is minimal
            (preferably no co-ordination will be required).</t>

            <t>The complete set of packets generated by a client MPLS(-TP)
            layer network using the packet transport service, which may
            contain packets that are not MPLS packets (e.g. IP or CLNS packets
            used by the control/management plane of the client MPLS(-TP) layer
            network), are transported by the MPLS-TP server layer network.</t>

            <t>The packet transport service enables the MPLS-TP layer network
            addressing and other information (e.g. topology) to be hidden from
            any client layer networks using that service, and vice-versa.</t>
          </list>These characteristics imply that a packet transport service
        does not support a connectionless packet-switched forwarding mode.
        However, this does not preclude it carrying client traffic associated
        with a connectionless service.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scope of the MPLS Transport Profile">
        <t><xref target="mpls-tp-scope"></xref> illustrates the scope of
        MPLS-TP. MPLS-TP solutions are primarily intended for packet transport
        applications. MPLS-TP is a strict subset of MPLS, and comprises only
        those functions that are necessary to meet the requirements of <xref
        target="RFC5654"></xref>. This includes MPLS functions that were
        defined prior to <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> but that meet the
        requirements of <xref target="RFC5654"></xref>, together with
        additional functions defined to meet those requirements. Some MPLS
        functions defined before <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> such as Equal
        Cost Multi-Path, LDP signaling used in such a way that it creates
        multipoint-to-point LSPs, and IP forwarding in the data plane are
        explicitly excluded from MPLS-TP by that requirements
        specification.</t>

        <t>Note that MPLS as a whole will continue to evolve to include
        additional functions that do not conform to the MPLS Transport Profile
        or its requirements, and thus fall outside the scope of MPLS-TP.</t>

            <t>Optional control planes for LSPs and PWs, as well as support

            <t>Optional path protection mechanisms to ensure that the packet

        <t>The MPLS-TP architecture for LSPs and PWs includes the following
        two sets of functions:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>MPLS-TP native service adaptation</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP forwarding</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The adaptation functions interface the native service (i.e. the
        client layer network service) to MPLS-TP. This includes the case where
        the native service is an MPLS-TP LSP.</t>

        <t>The forwarding functions comprise the mechanisms required for
        forwarding the encapsulated native service traffic over an MPLS-TP
        server layer network, for example PW and LSP labels.</t>

        <section title="MPLS-TP Native Service Adaptation Functions"
                 toc="default">
          <t>The MPLS-TP native service adaptation functions interface the
          client layer network service to MPLS-TP. For pseudowires, these
          adaptation functions are the payload encapsulation described in
          Section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC3985"></xref> and Section 6 of <xref
          target="RFC5659"></xref>. For network layer client services, the
          adaptation function uses the MPLS encapsulation format as defined in
          <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The purpose of this encapsulation is to abstract the client layer
          network data plane from the MPLS-TP data plane, thus contributing to
          the independent operation of the MPLS-TP network.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP is itself a client of an underlying server layer. MPLS-TP
          is thus also bounded by a set of adaptation functions to this server
          layer network, which may itself be MPLS-TP. These adaptation
          functions provide encapsulation of the MPLS-TP frames and for the
          transparent transport of those frames over the server layer network.
          The MPLS-TP client inherits its Quality of Service (QoS) from the
          MPLS-TP network, which in turn inherits its QoS from the server
          layer. The server layer must therefore provide the necessary QoS to
          ensure that the MPLS-TP client QoS commitments can be satisfied.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="MPLS-TP Forwarding Functions">
          <t>The forwarding functions comprise the mechanisms required for
          forwarding the encapsulated native service traffic over an MPLS-TP
          server layer network, for example PW and LSP labels.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP LSPs use the MPLS label switching operations and TTL
          processing procedures defined in <xref target="RFC3031"></xref>,
          <xref target="RFC3032"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3443"></xref>,
          as profiled in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-data-plane"></xref>.
          These operations are highly optimised for performance and are not
          modified by the MPLS-TP profile.</t>

          <t>In addition, MPLS-TP PWs use the SS-PW and optionally the MS-PW
          forwarding operations defined in <xref target="RFC3985"></xref> and
          <xref target="RFC5659"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Per-platform label space is used for PWs. Either per-platform,
          per-interface or other context-specific label space <xref
          target="RFC5331"></xref> may be used for LSPs.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP forwarding is based on the label that identifies the
          transport path (LSP or PW). The label value specifies the processing
          operation to be performed by the next hop at that level of
          encapsulation. A swap of this label is an atomic operation in which
          the contents of the packet after the swapped label are opaque to the
          forwarder. The only event that interrupts a swap operation is TTL
          expiry. This is a fundamental architectural construct of MPLS to be
          taken into account when designing protocol extensions (such as those
          for OAM) that require packets to be sent to an intermediate LSR.</t>

          <t>Further processing to determine the context of a packet occurs
          when a swap operation is interrupted in this manner, or a pop
          operation exposes a specific reserved label at the top of the stack,
          or the packet is received with the GAL (<xref
          target="GENERICACH"></xref>) at the top of stack. Otherwise the
          packet is forwarded according to the procedures in <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP supports Quality of Service capabilities via the MPLS
          Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture <xref
          target="RFC3270"></xref>. Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes
          are supported.</t>

      <section anchor="native-services"
               title="MPLS-TP Native Service Adaptation">
        <t>This document describes the architecture for two native service
        adaptation mechanisms, which provide encapsulation and demultiplexing
        for native service traffic traversing an MPLS-TP network:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A PW</t>

            <t>An MPLS Label</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A PW provides any emulated service that the IETF has defined to be
        provided by a PW, for example Ethernet, Frame Relay, or PPP/HDLC. A
        list of PW types is maintained by IANA in the the "MPLS Pseudowire
        Type" registry. When the native service adaptation is via a PW, the
        mechanisms described in <xref target="PW-sec"></xref> are used.</t>

        <t>An MPLS LSP Label can also be used as the adaptation, in which case
        any native service traffic type supported by <xref
        target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref> is
        allowed. Examples of such traffic types include IP, and MPLS-labeled
        packets. Note that the latter case includes TE-LSPs <xref
        target="RFC3209"></xref> and LSP based applications such as PWs, Layer
        2 VPNs <xref target="RFC4664"></xref>, and Layer 3 VPNs <xref
        target="RFC4364"></xref>. When the native service adaptation is via an
        MPLS label, the mechanisms described in <xref
        target="NLTS-sec"></xref> are used.</t>

        <section title="MPLS-TP Client/Server Layer Relationship">
          <t>The relationship between the client layer network and the MPLS-TP
          server layer network is defined by the MPLS-TP network boundary and
          the label context. It is not explicitly indicated in the packet. In
          terms of the MPLS label stack, when the native service traffic type
          is itself MPLS-labeled, then the S bits of all the labels in the
          MPLS-TP label stack carrying that client traffic are zero; otherwise
          the bottom label of the MPLS-TP label stack has the S-bit set to 1.
          In other words, there can be only one S-bit set in a label
          stack.</t>

          <t>The data plane behaviour of MPLS-TP is the same as the best
          current practise for MPLS. This includes the setting of the S-bit.
          In each case, the S-bit is set to indicate the bottom (i.e.
          inner-most) label in the label stack that is contiguous between the
          MPLS-TP server layer and the client layer. Note that this best
          current practice differs slightly from <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref> which uses the S-bit to identify when MPLS
          label processing stops and network layer processing starts.</t>

          <t>The relationship of MPLS-TP to its clients is illustrated in
          <xref target="clients"></xref>. Note that the label stacks shown in
          the figure are divided between those inside the MPLS-TP Network and
          those within the client network when the client network is
          MPLS(-TP). They illustrate the smallest number of labels possible.
          These label stacks could also include more labels.</t>

        <section title="MPLS-TP Transport Layers">
          <t>An MPLS-TP network consists logically of two layers: the
          Transport Service layer and the Transport Path layer.</t>

          <t>The Transport Service layer provides the interface between
          Customer Edge (CE) nodes and the MPLS-TP network. Each packet
          transmitted by a CE node for transport over the MPLS-TP network is
          associated at the receiving MPLS-TP Provider Edge (PE) node with a
          single logical point-to-point connection at the Transport Service
          layer between this (ingress) PE and the corresponding (egress) PE to
          which the peer CE is attached. Such a connection is called an
          MPLS-TP Transport Service Instance, and the set of client packets
          associated with such an instance on a particular CE-PE link is
          called a client flow.</t>

          <t>The Transport Path layer provides aggregation of Transport
          Service Instances over MPLS-TP transport paths (LSPs), as well as
          aggregation of transport paths (via LSP hierarchy).</t>

          <t>Awareness of the Transport Service layer need exist only at PE
          nodes. MPLS-TP Provider (P) nodes need have no awareness of this
          layer. Both PE and P nodes participate in the Transport Path layer.
          A PE terminates (i.e., is an LER with respect to) the transport
          paths it supports, and is responsible for multiplexing and
          demultiplexing of Transport Service Instance traffic over such
          transport paths.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="MPLS-TP Transport Service Interfaces">
          <t>An MPLS-TP PE node can provide two types of interface to the
          Transport Service layer. The MPLS-TP User-Network Interface (UNI)
          provides the interface between a CE and the MPLS-TP network. The
          MPLS-TP Network-Network Interface (NNI) provides the interface
          between two MPLS-TP PEs in different administrative domains.</t>

          <t>When providing a Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), Virtual
          Private Local Area Network Service (VPLS), Virtual Private Multicast
          Service (VPMS), or Internet Protocol Local Area Network Service
          (IPLS), pseudowires must be used to carry the client service. VPWS,
          VLPS, and IPLS are described in <xref target="RFC4664"></xref>. VPMS
          is described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpms-frmwk-requirements"></xref>.</t>

          <t>When MPLS-TP is used to provide a transport service for e.g. IP
          services that are a part of a Layer 3 VPN, then packets are
          transported in the same manner as specified in <xref
          target="RFC4364"></xref>.</t>

          <section anchor="uni-section" title="User-Network Interface">
            <t>The MPLS-TP User-Network interface (UNI) is illustrated in
            <xref target="PE-UNI-FIG"></xref>. The UNI for a particular client
            flow may or may not involve signaling between the CE and PE, and
            if signaling is used, it may or may not traverse the same
            data-link that supports the client flow.</t>

          <section title="Example Interfaces">
            <t>This section considers some special cases of UNI and NNI
            processing for particular transport service types. These are
            illustrative, and do not preclude other transport service
            types.</t>

            <section title="Layer 2 Transport Service">
              <t>In this example the MPLS-TP network is providing a
              point-to-point Layer 2 transport service between attached CE
              nodes. This service is provided by a Transport Service Instance
              consisting of a PW established between the associated PE nodes.
              The client flows associated with this Transport Service Instance
              are the sets of all Layer 2 frames transmitted and received over
              the attachment circuits.</t>

              <t>The processing steps in this case for a frame received from
              the CE are:</t>

              <t><list style="numbers">
                  <t>Link-layer specific preprocessing, if any, is performed,
                  corresponding to the PREP function illustrated in Figure 3
                  of <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>.</t>

                  <t>The frame is associated with a Transport Service Instance
                  based on the attachment circuit over which it was
                  received.</t>

                  <t>A transport service encapsulation, consisting of the PW
                  control word and PW label, is associated with the frame.</t>

                  <t>The resulting packet is mapped to an LSP, the LSP label
                  is pushed, and the packet is transmitted over the outbound
                  interface associated with the LSP.</t>
                </list>The steps in the reverse direction for PW packets
              received over the LSP are analogous.</t>
            </section>
          </section>

          <section title="IP Transport Service">
            <t>In this example the MPLS-TP network is providing a
            point-to-point IP transport service between CE1, CE2, and CE3, as
            follows. One point-to-point transport service instance delivers
            IPv4 packets between CE1 and CE2, and another instance delivers
            IPv6 packets between CE1 and CE3.</t>

            <t>The processing steps in this case for an IP packet received
            from CE1 are:</t>

            <t>A1. No link-layer-specific processing is performed.</t>

            <t>A2. The IP packet is extracted from the link-layer frame and
            associated with a Service LSP based on the source MAC address
            (CE1) and the IP protocol version.</t>

            <t>A3. A transport service encapsulation, consisting of the
            Service LSP label, is associated with the packet.</t>

            <t>A4. The resulting packet is mapped to a tunnel LSP, the tunnel
            LSP label is pushed, and the packet is transmitted over the
            outbound interface associated with the LSP.</t>

            <t>The steps in the reverse direction, for packets received over a
            tunnel LSP carrying the Service LSP label, are analogous.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PW-sec" title="Pseudowire Adaptation">
          <t>If the MPLS-TP network provides a layer 2 interface, that can
          carry both network layer and non-network layer traffic, as a service
          interface, then a PW is required to support the service interface.
          The PW is a client of the MPLS-TP LSP server layer. The architecture
          for an MPLS-TP network that provides such services is based on the
          MPLS <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> and pseudowire <xref
          target="RFC3985"></xref> architectures. Multi-segment pseudowires
          may optionally be used to provide a packet transport service, and
          their use is consistent with the MPLS-TP architecture. The use of
          MS-PWs may be motivated by, for example, the requirements specified
          in <xref target="RFC5254"></xref>. If MS-PWs are used, then the
          MS-PW architecture <xref target="RFC5659"></xref> also applies.</t>

          <t><xref target="tp-arch"></xref> shows the architecture for an
          MPLS-TP network using single-segment PWs. Note that, in this
          document, the client layer is equivalent to the emulated service
          described in <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>, while the Transport LSP
          is equivalent to the Packet Switched Network (PSN) tunnel of <xref

        <section anchor="NLTS-sec" title="Network Layer Adaptation">
          <t>MPLS-TP LSPs can be used to transport network layer clients. This
          document uses the term Network Layer in the same sense as it is used
          in <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>. The network layer protocols supported by
          <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>
          can be transported between service interfaces. Examples are shown in
          Figure 5 above. Support for network layer clients follows the MPLS
          architecture for support of network layer protocols as specified in
          <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

          <t>With network layer adaptation, the MPLS-TP domain provides either
          a uni-directional or bidirectional point-to-point connection between
          two PEs in order to deliver a packet transport service to attached
          customer edge (CE) nodes. For example, a CE may be an IP, MPLS or
          MPLS-TP node. As shown in <xref target="tp-ip-lsp-arch"></xref>,
          there is an attachment circuit between the CE node on the left and
          its corresponding provider edge (PE) node which provides the service
          interface, a bidirectional LSP across the MPLS-TP network to the
          corresponding PE node on the right, and an attachment circuit
          between that PE node and the corresponding CE node for this
          service.</t>

          <t>The attachment circuits may be heterogeneous (e.g., any
          combination of SDH, PPP, Frame Relay, etc.) and network layer
          protocol payloads arrive at the service interface encapsulated in
          the Layer1/Layer2 encoding defined for that access link type. It
          should be noted that the set of network layer protocols includes
          MPLS and hence MPLS encoded packets with an MPLS label stack (the
          client MPLS stack), may appear at the service interface.</t>

          <t>At the ingress service interface the client packets are received.
          The PE pushes one or more labels onto the client packets which are
          then label switched over the transport network. Correspondingly the
          egress PE pops any labels added by the MPLS-TP networks and
          transmits the packet for delivery to the attached CE via the egress
          service interface.</t>

          <t>In this figure the Transport Service Layer <xref
          target="RFC5654"></xref> is identified by the Service LSP (SvcLSP)
          demultiplexer (Demux) label and the Transport Path Layer <xref
          target="RFC5654"></xref> is identified by the Transport (Trans) LSP
          Demux Label. Note that the functions of the Encapsulation label
          (Encap Label) and the Service Label (SvcLSP Demux) shown above may
          alternatively be represented by a single label stack entry. Note
          that the S-bit is always zero when the client layer is
          MPLS-labelled.</t>

          <t>Within the MPLS-TP transport network, the network layer protocols
          are carried over the MPLS-TP network using a logically separate MPLS
          label stack (the server stack). The server stack is entirely under
          the control of the nodes within the MPLS-TP transport network and it
          is not visible outside that network. <xref
          target="MPLS-TP-NL-Stack"></xref> shows how a client network
          protocol stack (which may be an MPLS label stack and payload) is
          carried over a network layer client service over an MPLS-TP
          transport network.</t>

          <t>A label may be used to identify the network layer protocol
          payload type. Therefore, when multiple protocol payload types are to
          be carried over a single service LSP, a unique label stack entry
          must be present for each payload type. Such labels are referred to
          as "Encapsulation Labels", one of which is shown in <xref
          target="MPLS-TP-NL-Stack"></xref>. Encapsulation Label may be either
          configured or signaled.</t>

          <t>Both an Encapsulation Label and a Service Label should be present
          in the label stack when a particular packet transport service is
          supporting more than one network layer protocol payload type. For
          example, if both IP and MPLS are to be carried, as shown in <xref
          target="tp-ip-lsp-arch"></xref>, then two Encapsulation Labels are
          mapped on to a common Service Label.</t>

          <t>Note: The Encapsulation Label may be omitted when the service LSP
          is supporting only one network layer protocol payload type. For
          example, if only MPLS labeled packets are carried over a service,
          then the Service Label (stack entry) provides both the payload type
          indication and service identification.</t>

          <t>Service labels are typically carried over an MPLS-TP Transport
          LSP edge-to-edge (or transport path layer). An MPLS-TP Transport LSP
          is represented as an LSP Transport Demux label, as shown in <xref
          target="MPLS-TP-NL-Stack"></xref>. Transport LSP is commonly used
          when more than one service exists between two PEs.</t>

          <t>Note that, if only one service exists between two PEs, the
          functions of the Transport LSP label and the Service LSP Label may
          be combined into a single label stack entry. For example, if only
          one service is carried between two PEs then a single label could be
          used to provide both the service indication and the MPLS-TP
          transport LSP. Alternatively, if multiple services exist between a
          pair of PEs then a per-client Service Label would be mapped on to a
          common MPLS-TP transport LSP.</t>

          <t>As noted above, the layer 2 and layer 1 protocols used to carry
          the network layer protocol over the attachment circuits are not
          transported across the MPLS-TP network. This enables the use of
          different layer 2 and layer 1 protocols on the two attachment
          circuits.</t>

          <t>At each service interface, Layer 2 addressing must be used to
          ensure the proper delivery of a network layer packet to the adjacent
          node. This is typically only an issue for LAN media technologies
          (e.g., Ethernet) which have Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. In
          cases where a MAC address is needed, the sending node must set the
          destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
          adjacent node. That is the CE sets the destination MAC address to an
          address that ensures delivery to the PE, and the PE sets the
          destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
          CE. The specific address used is technology type specific and is not
          specified in this document. In some technologies the MAC address
          will need to be configured.</t>

          <t>Note that when two CEs, which peer with each other, operate over
          a network layer transport service and run a routing protocol such as
          IS-IS or OSPF, some care should be taken to configure the routing
          protocols to use point-to-point adjacencies. The specifics of such
          configuration is outside the scope of this document. See <xref
          target="RFC5309"></xref> for additional details.</t>

          <t>The CE to CE service types and corresponding labels may be

            <t>An IP encapsulation where IP capabilities are present. e.g. PW
            ACH encapsulation with IP headers for VCCV-BFD <xref

            MPLS BFD <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref>.</t>
          </list>MPLS-TP makes use of such a generic associated channel
        (G-ACh) to support Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and
        Security (FCAPS) functions by carrying packets related to OAM, PSC,
        SCC, MCC or other packet types in-band over LSPs, PWs or sections. The
        G-ACh is defined in <xref target="RFC5586"></xref> and is similar to
        the Pseudowire Associated Channel <xref target="RFC4385"></xref>,
        which is used to carry OAM packets over pseudowires. The G-ACh is
        indicated by an Associated Channel Header (ACH), similar to the
        Pseudowire VCCV control word; this header is present for all sections,
        LSPs and PWs making use of FCAPS functions supported by the G-ACh.</t>

        <t>The G-ACh must only be used for channels that are an adjunct to the
        data service. Examples of these are OAM, PSC, MCC and SCC, but the use
        is not restricted to these services. The G-ACh must not be used to
        carry additional data for use in the forwarding path, i.e. it must not
        be used as an alternative to a PW control word, or to define a PW
        type.</t>

        <t>At the server layer, bandwidth and QoS commitments apply to the
        gross traffic on the LSP, PW or section. Since the G-ACh traffic is
        indistinguishable from the user data traffic, protocols using the
        G-ACh must take into consideration the impact they have on the user
        data with which they are sharing resources. Conversely, capacity must
        be made available for important G-ACh uses such as protection and OAM.
        In addition, protocols using the G-ACh must conform to the security
        and congestion considerations described in <xref

      </section>

      <section anchor="OAM"
               title="Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)">
        <t>The MPLS-TP OAM architecture supports a wide range of OAM functions
        to check continuity, to verify connectivity, to monitor path
        performance, and to generate, filter and manage local and remote
        defect alarms. These functions are applicable to any layer defined
        within MPLS-TP, i.e. to MPLS-TP sections, LSPs and PWs.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP OAM tool-set must be able to operate without relying on
        a dynamic control plane or IP functionality in the datapath. In the
        case of an MPLS-TP deployment in a network in which IP functionality
        is available, all existing IP/MPLS OAM functions, e.g. LSP-Ping, BFD
        and VCCV, may be used. Since MPLS-TP must be able to operate in
        environments where IP is not used in the forwarding plane, the default
        mechanism for OAM demultiplexing in MPLS-TP LSPs and PWs is the
        Generic Associated Channel (<xref target="GENERICACH"></xref>).
        Forwarding based on IP addresses for user or OAM packets is not
        required for MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4379"></xref> and BFD for MPLS LSPs <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref> have defined alert mechanisms that
        enable an MPLS LSR to identify and process MPLS OAM packets when the
        OAM packets are encapsulated in an IP header. These alert mechanisms
        are based on TTL expiration and/or use an IP destination address in
        the range 127/8 for IPv4 and that same range embedded as IPv4 mapped
        IPv6 addresses for IPv6 <xref target="RFC4379"></xref>. When the OAM
        packets are encapsulated in an IP header, these mechanisms are the
        default mechanisms for MPLS networks in general for identifying MPLS
        OAM packets, although the mechanisms defined in <xref
        target="RFC5586"></xref> can also be used. MPLS-TP must be able to
        operate in environments where IP forwarding is not supported, and thus
        the G-ACh/GAL is the default mechanism to demultiplex OAM packets in
        MPLS-TP in these environments.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP supports a comprehensive set of OAM capabilities for packet
        transport applications, with equivalent capabilities to those provided
        in SONET/SDH.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP requires <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref> that a set of OAM
        capabilities is available to perform fault management (e.g. fault
        detection and localisation) and performance monitoring (e.g. packet
        delay and loss measurement) of the LSP, PW or section. The framework
        for OAM in MPLS-TP is specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref>.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP OAM packets share the same fate as their corresponding data
        packets, and are identified through the Generic Associated Channel
        mechanism <xref target="RFC5586"></xref>. This uses a combination of
        an Associated Channel Header (ACH) and a G-ACh Label (GAL) to create a
        control channel associated to an LSP, Section or PW.</t>

        <t>OAM and monitoring in MPLS-TP is based on the concept of
        maintenance entities, as described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref>. A Maintenance Entity
        (ME) can be viewed as the association of two Maintenance Entity Group
        End Points (MEPs). A Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) is a collection of
        one or more MEs that belongs to the same transport path and that are
        maintained and monitored as a group. The MEPs that form an ME limit
        the OAM responsibilities of an OAM flow to within the domain of a
        transport path or segment, in the specific layer network that is being
        monitored and managed.</t>

        <t>A MEG may also include a set of Maintenance Entity Group
        Intermediate Points (MIPs). MEPs are capable of sourcing and sinking
        OAM flows, while MIPs can both react to OAM flows received from within
        a MEG. Intermediate nodes can also originate notifications to the MEPs
        as a result of specific network conditions.</t>

        <t>A G-ACh packet may be directed to an individual MIP along the path
        of an LSP or MS-PW by setting the appropriate TTL in the label for the
        G-ACh packet, as per the traceroute mode of LSP Ping <xref
        target="RFC4379"></xref> and the vccv-trace mode of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw"></xref>. Note that this works when
        the location of MIPs along the LSP or PW path is known by the MEP.
        There may be circumstances where this is not the case, e.g. following
        restoration using a facility bypass LSP. In these cases, tools to
        trace the path of the LSP may be used to determine the appropriate
        setting for the TTL to reach a specific MIP.</t>

        <t>Within an LSR or PE, MEPs and MIPs can only be placed where MPLS
        layer processing is performed on a packet. The MPLS architecture
        mandates that MPLS layer processing occurs at least once on an
        LSR.</t>

        <t>Any node on an LSP can send an OAM packet on that LSP. Likewise,
        any node on a PW can send OAM packets on a PW, including S-PEs.</t>

        <t>An OAM packet can only be received to be processed at an LSP
        endpoint, a PW endpoint (T-PE), or on the expiry of the TTL of the LSP
        or PW label.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Return Path">
        <t>Management, control and OAM protocol functions may require response
        packets to be delivered from the receiver back to the originator of a
        message exchange. This section provides a summary of the return path
        options in MPLS-TP networks. Although this section describes the case
        of an MPLS-TP LSP, it is also applicable to a PW.</t>

        <t>In this description, U and D are LSRs that terminate MPLS-TP LSPs
        (i.e. LERs) and that Y is an intermediate LSR along the LSP. In the
        unidirectional case, U is the upstream LER and D is the downstream LER
        with respect to the LSP. This reference model is shown in <xref
        target="ret-path-fig"></xref>.</t>

          </figure></t>

        <t>The following cases are described for the various types of
        LSPs:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Case 1">Packet transmission from D to U</t>

            <t hangText="Case 2">Packet transmission from Y to U</t>

            <t hangText="Case 3">Packet transmission from D to Y</t>
          </list>Note that a return path may not always exist, and that packet
        transmission in one or more of the above cases may not be possible. In
        general the existence and nature of return paths for MPLS-TP LSPs is
        determined by operational provisioning.</t>

        <section title="Return Path Types">
          <t>There are two types of return path that may be used for the
          delivery of traffic from a downstream node D to an upstream node U.
          Either:</t>

          <t><list style="letters">
              <t>The LSP between U and D is bidirectional, and therefore D has
              a path via the MPLS-TP LSP to return traffic back to U, or</t>

              <t>D has some other unspecified means of directing traffic back
              to U.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The first option is referred to as an "in-band" return path, the
          second as an "out-of-band" return path.</t>

          <t>There are various possibilities for "out-of-band" return paths.
          Such a path may, for example, be based on ordinary IP routing. In
          this case packets would be forwarded as usual to a destination IP
          address associated with U. In an MPLS-TP network that is also an
          IP/MPLS network, such a forwarding path may traverse the same
          physical links or logical transport paths used by MPLS-TP. An
          out-of-band return path may also be indirect, via a distinct Data
          Communication Network (DCN) (provided, for example, by the method
          specified in <xref target="RFC5718"></xref>); or it may be via one
          or more other MPLS-TP LSPs.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Point-to-Point Unidirectional LSPs">
          <t><list counter="" hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Case 1">In this situation, either an in-band or
              out-of-band return path may be used to deliver traffic from D
              back to U.</t>

              <t>It is recommended for reasons of operational simplicity that
              point-to-point unidirectional LSPs be provisioned as associated
              bidirectional LSPs (which may also be co-routed) whenever return
              traffic from D to U is required. Note that the two directions of
              such an LSP may have differing bandwidth allocations and QoS
              characteristics. In the in-band case there is in essence an
              associated bidirectional LSP between U and D, and the discussion
              for such LSPs below applies.</t>

              <t hangText="Case 2">In this case only the out-of-band return
              path option is available. However, an additional out-of-band
              possibility is worthy of note here: if D is known to have a
              return path to U, then Y can arrange to deliver return traffic
              to U by first sending it to D along the original LSP. The
              mechanism by which D recognises the need for and performs this
              forwarding operation is protocol-specific.</t>

              <t hangText="Case 3">In this case only the out-of-band return
              path option is available. However, if D has a return path to U,
              then in a manner analogous to the previous case D can arrange to
              deliver return traffic to Y by first sending it to U along that
              return path. The mechanism by which U recognises the need for
              and performs this forwarding operation is protocol-specific.</t>

        <section title="Point-to-Point Associated Bidirectional LSPs">
          <t>For Case 1, D has a natural in-band return path to U, the use of
          which is typically preferred for return traffic, although
          out-of-band return paths are also applicable.</t>

          <t>For Cases 2 and 3, the considerations are the same as those for
          point-to-point unidirectional LSPs.</t>

          <t>For all of Cases 1, 2, and 3, a natural in-band return path

          applicable, primarily as an alternative means of delivery in case

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane is based on existing MPLS and PW control
        plane protocols, and is consistent with the Automatically Switched
        Optical Networks (ASON) architecture <xref target="G.8080"></xref>.
        MPLS-TP uses Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling (<xref
        target="RFC3945"></xref>, <xref target="RFC3471"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC3473"></xref>) for LSPs and Targeted LDP (T-LDP) <xref
        target="RFC4447"></xref> <xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw">
        </xref><xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw"></xref> for
        pseudowires.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP requires that any control plane traffic be capable of being
        carried over an out-of-band signaling network or a signaling control
        channel such as the one described in <xref target="RFC5718"></xref>.
        Note that while T-LDP signaling is traditionally carried in-band in
        IP/MPLS networks, this does not preclude its operation over
        out-of-band channels. References to T-LDP in this document do not
        preclude the definition of alternative PW control protocols for use in
        MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t>PW control (and maintenance) takes place separately from LSP tunnel
        signaling. The main coordination between LSP and PW control will occur
        within the nodes that terminate PWs. The control planes for PWs and
        LSPs may be used independently, and one may be employed without the
        other. This translates into the four possible scenarios: (1) no
        control plane is employed; (2) a control plane is used for both LSPs
        and PWs; (3) a control plane is used for LSPs, but not PWs; (4) a
        control plane is used for PWs, but not LSPs. The PW and LSP control
        planes, collectively, must satisfy the MPLS-TP control plane
        requirements reviewed in the MPLS-TP Control Plane Framework <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework"></xref>. When client
        services are provided directly via LSPs, all requirements must be
        satisfied by the LSP control plane. When client services are provided
        via PWs, the PW and LSP control planes operate in combination and some
        functions may be satisfied via the PW control plane while others are
        provided to PWs by the LSP control plane.</t>

        <t>Note that if MPLS-TP is being used in a multi-layer network, a
        number of control protocol types and instances may be used. This is
        consistent with the MPLS architecture which permits each label in the
        label stack to be allocated and signaled by its own control
        protocol.</t>

        <t>The distributed MPLS-TP control plane may provide the following
        functions:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Signaling</t>

            <t>Routing</t>

            <t>Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In a multi-domain environment, the MPLS-TP control plane supports
        different types of interfaces at domain boundaries or within the
        domains. These include the User-Network Interface (UNI), Internal
        Network-Network Interface (I-NNI), and External Network-Network
        Interface (E-NNI). Note that different policies may be defined that
        control the information exchanged across these interface types.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane is capable of activating MPLS-TP OAM
        functions as described in the OAM section of this document <xref
        target="OAM"></xref>, e.g. for fault detection and localisation in the
        event of a failure in order to efficiently restore failed transport
        paths.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane supports all MPLS-TP data plane
        connectivity patterns that are needed for establishing transport
        paths, including protected paths as described in <xref
        target="SURVIVE"></xref>. Examples of the MPLS-TP data plane
        connectivity patterns are LSPs utilising the fast reroute backup
        methods as defined in <xref target="RFC4090"></xref> and
        ingress-to-egress 1+1 or 1:1 protected LSPs.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane provides functions to ensure its own
        survivability and to enable it to recover gracefully from failures and
        degradations. These include graceful restart and hot redundant
        configurations. Depending on how the control plane is transported,
        varying degrees of decoupling between the control plane and data plane
        may be achieved. In all cases, however, the control plane is logically
        decoupled from the data plane such that a control plane failure does
        not imply a failure of the existing transport paths.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Interdomain Connectivity">
        <t>A number of methods exist to support inter-domain operation of
        MPLS-TP, including the data plane, OAM and configuration aspects, for
        example:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Inter-domain TE LSPs <xref target="RFC4216"></xref></t>

            <t>Multi-segment Pseudowires <xref target="RFC5659"></xref></t>

            <t>LSP stitching <xref target="RFC5150"></xref></t>

            <t>back-to-back attachment circuits <xref
            target="RFC5659"></xref></t>
          </list></t>

        <t>An important consideration in selecting an inter-domain
        connectivity mechanism is the degree of layer network isolation and
        types of OAM required by the operator. The selection of which
        technique to use in a particular deployment scenario is outside the
        scope of this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="static" title="Static Operation of LSPs and PWs">
        <t>A PW or LSP may be statically configured without the support of a
        dynamic control plane. This may be either by direct configuration of
        the PEs/LSRs, or via a network management system. Static operation is
        independent for a specific PW or LSP instance. Thus it should be
        possible for a PW to be statically configured, while the LSP
        supporting it is set up by a dynamic control plane. When static
        configuration mechanisms are used, care must be taken to ensure that
        loops are not created.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SURVIVE" title="Survivability">
        <t>The survivability architecture for MPLS-TP is specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk"></xref>.</t>

        <t>A wide variety of resiliency schemes have been developed to meet
        the various network and service survivability objectives. For example,
        as part of the MPLS/PW paradigms, MPLS provides methods for local
        repair using back-up LSP tunnels (<xref target="RFC4090"></xref>),
        while pseudowire redundancy <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy"></xref> supports scenarios where the
        protection for the PW cannot be fully provided by the underlying LSP
        (i.e. where the backup PW terminates on a different target PE node
        than the working PW in dual homing scenarios, or where protection of
        the S-PE is required). Additionally, GMPLS provides a well known set
        of control plane driven protection and restoration mechanisms <xref
        target="RFC4872"></xref>. MPLS-TP provides additional protection
        mechanisms that are optimised for both linear topologies and ring
        topologies, and that operate in the absence of a dynamic control
        plane. These are specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Different protection schemes apply to different deployment
        topologies and operational considerations. Such protection schemes may
        provide different levels of resiliency, for example:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Two concurrent traffic paths (1+1).</t>

            <t>one active and one standby path with guaranteed bandwidth on
            both paths (1:1).</t>

            <t>one active path and a standby path the resources of which are
            shared by one or more other active paths (shared protection).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The applicability of any given scheme to meet specific requirements
        is outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>The characteristics of MPLS-TP resiliency mechanisms are as
        follows:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Optimised for linear, ring or meshed topologies.</t>

            <t>Use OAM mechanisms to detect and localise network faults or
            service degenerations.</t>

            <t>Include protection mechanisms to coordinate and trigger
            protection switching actions in the absence of a dynamic control
            plane. This is known as a Protection State Coordination (PSC)
            mechanism.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery schemes are applicable to all levels in the
            MPLS-TP domain (i.e. section, LSP and PW), providing segment and
            end-to-end recovery.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms support the coordination of
            protection switching at multiple levels to prevent race conditions
            occurring between a client and its server layer.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms can be data plane, control plane or
            management plane based.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP supports revertive and non-revertive behaviour.</t>

      <section anchor="PST" title="Path Segment Tunnels">
        <t>In order to monitor, protect and manage a portion of an LSP, a new
        architectural element is defined called the Path Segment Tunnel (PST).
        A PST is a hierarchical LSP <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> which is
        defined and used for the purposes of OAM monitoring, protection or
        management of LSP segments or concatenated LSP segments.</t>

        <t>A PST is defined between the edges of the portion of the LSP that
        needs to be monitored, protected or managed. OAM messages can be
        initiated at the edge of the PST and sent to the peer edge of the PST
        or to a MIP along the PST by setting the TTL value at the PST level
        accordingly. A P router only pushes or pops a label if it is at the
        end of a PST. In this mode, it is an LER for the PST.</t>

        <t>For example in <xref target="PST-ic"></xref>, two PSTs are
        configured to allow monitoring, protection and management of the LSP
        concatenated segments. One PST is defined between LER2 and LER3, and a
        second PST is set up between LER4 and LER5. Each of these PSTs may be
        monitored, protected, or managed independently.</t>

        <t><figure anchor="PST-ic" title="PSTs in inter-carrier network">

          </figure></t>

        <t>The end-to-end traffic of the LSP, including data traffic and
        control traffic (OAM, Protection Switching Control, management and
        signaling messages) is tunneled within the PST by means of label
        stacking as defined in <xref target="RFC3031"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The mapping between an LSP and a PST can be 1:1, in which case it
        is similar to the ITU-T Tandem Connection element <xref
        target="G.805"></xref>. The mapping can also be 1:N to allow
        aggregated monitoring, protection and management of a set of LSP
        segments or concatenated LSP segments. <xref
        target="PST-concat"></xref> shows a PST which is used to aggregate a
        set of concatenated LSP segments for the LSP from LERx to LERt and the
        LSP from LERa to LERd. Note that such a construct is useful, for
        example, when the LSPs traverse a common portion of the network and
        they have the same Traffic Class.</t>

        <t>PSTs can be provisioned either statically or using control plane
        signaling procedures. The make-before-break procedures which are
        supported by MPLS allow the creation of a PST on existing LSPs
        in-service without traffic disruption. A PST can be defined
        corresponding to one or more end-to-end tunneled LSPs. New end-to-end
        LSPs which are tunneled within the PST can be set up. Traffic of the
        existing LSPs is switched over to the new end-to-end tunneled LSPs.
        The old end-to-end LSPs can then be torn down.</t>

      <section anchor="NETMGT" title="Network Management">
        <t>The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP
        are specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-framework"></xref>
        and <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"></xref>. These derive from
        the generic specifications described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 <xref
        target="G.7710"></xref> for transport technologies. They also
        incorporate the OAM requirements for MPLS Networks <xref
        target="RFC4377"></xref> and MPLS-TP Networks <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref> and expand on those
        requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,
        configuration, performance, and security in a transport network.</t>

        <t>The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of an MPLS-TP Network
        Element (NE) (i.e. LSR, LER, PE, S-PE or T-PE) provides the means
        through which a management system manages the NE. The Management
        Communication Channel (MCC), realised by the G-ACh, provides a logical
        operations channel between NEs for transferring Management
        information. For the management interface from a management system to
        an MPLS-TP NE, there is no restriction on which management protocol is
        used. The Network Management System (NMS) is used to provision and
        manage an end-to-end connection across a network where some segments
        are created/managed by, for example, Netconf <xref
        target="RFC4741"></xref> or SNMP <xref target="RFC3411"></xref> and
        other segments by XML or CORBA interfaces. Maintenance operations are
        run on a connection (LSP or PW) in a manner that is independent of the
        provisioning mechanism. An MPLS-TP NE is not required to offer more
        than one standard management interface. In MPLS-TP, the EMF must be
        capable of statically provisioning LSPs for an LSR or LER, and PWs for
        a PE, as well as any associated MEPs and MIPs, as per <xref
        target="static"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Fault Management (FM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-TP NE
        enable the supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction,
        and alarm handling of abnormal conditions in the MPLS-TP network and
        its environment. FM must provide for the supervision of transmission
        (such as continuity, connectivity, etc.), software processing,
        hardware, and environment. Alarm handling includes alarm severity
        assignment, alarm suppression/aggregation/correlation, alarm reporting
        control, and alarm reporting.</t>

        <t>Configuration Management (CM) provides functions to control,
        identify, collect data from, and provide data to MPLS-TP NEs. In
        addition to general configuration for hardware, software protection
        switching, alarm reporting control, and date/time setting, the EMF of
        the MPLS-TP NE also supports the configuration of maintenance entity
        identifiers (such as Maintenance Entity Group Endpoint (MEP) ID and
        MEG Intermediate Point (MIP) ID). The EMF also supports the
        configuration of OAM parameters as a part of connectivity management
        to meet specific operational requirements. These may specify whether
        the operational mode is one-time on-demand or is periodic at a
        specified frequency.</t>

        <t>The Performance Management (PM) functions within the EMF of an
        MPLS-TP NE support the evaluation and reporting of the behaviour of
        the NEs and the network. One particular requirement for PM is to
        provide coherent and consistent interpretation of the network
        behaviour in a hybrid network that uses multiple transport
        technologies. Packet loss measurement and delay measurements may be
        collected and used to detect performance degradation. This is reported
        via fault management to enable corrective actions to be taken (e.g.
        protection switching), and via performance monitoring for Service
        Level Agreement (SLA) verification and billing. Collection mechanisms
        for performance data should be capable of operating on-demand or
        pro-actively.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The introduction of MPLS-TP into transport networks means that the
