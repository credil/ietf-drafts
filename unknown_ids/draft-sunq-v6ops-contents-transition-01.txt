Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The global IPv4 address depletion becomes a reality.  Although the
   IPv4 to IPv6 transition is considered inevitable, deployments of IPv6
   are still quite limited as this document is written.  Facing the
   pressure of IPv4 address shortage, the operators may like to provide
   services through IPv6 in some ways.  However, compared to the
   readiness of operators' infrastructures, the IPv6 transition on the
   content provider and end user sides moves even more slowly.  The lack
   of IPv6-reachable contents becomes one of the main obstacles.

   This document describes one deployment model of the stateful IPv4/
   IPv6 translation [RFC6146],[RFC6052],[RFC6144],[RFC6145] , aiming at
   rapidly increasing the amount of IPv6-reachable contents with lower
   cost at the early stage of transition, for users from IPv6 Internet.
   The contents can be still accessible through IPv4.  While this would
   be very helpful for CP/SPs to achieve rapid transition, the native
   transition of contents (by "Dual-Stack") should always be
   recommended.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Motivations

   There have been statements from several popular content providers
   that they have turned on, or planned to turn on IPv6 soon, which do
   have a beneficial effect on encouraging end users' transition to
   IPv6.  While given the operational cost, the risk to the continuity
   of service delivery and compared to the number of active IPv6 users
   currently, it is difficult to convince much more content providers
   (especially the great many ones of small-to-medium size) to
   immediately enable IPv6 natively and make their publically-facing
   services accessible through IPv6.  On the other hand, from the users'
   perspective the IPv6 reachability of resources required for their
   daily lives is one of the foremost concerns when making the decision
   on whether or not to access Internet using IPv6.  It is a chicken or
   egg dilemma, but the two perspectives are interdependent.  If the
   transition of one side passes the point of inflexion, the other side
   will be speeded up after.  So, more efforts are needed to encourage
   the IPv6 adoption and reach the point.

2.1.  Transition As A Service

   The deployment model of the stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation
   [RFC6146],[RFC6052],[RFC6144],[RFC6145] described in this document
   can be regarded as a transition service offered by the operators, to
   small-to-medium size content providers (e.g. , those who rent servers
   from the operators).  By this means, they could make the publically-
   facing services to be IPv6-accessible shortly with lower cost,
   compared to the employment of "Dual-Stack" approach where the
   software or codes may have to be upgraded, which requires additional
   investment and expertise right away.  Moreover, in this deployment
   model, we can still make use of current IPv4 security infrastructures
   in data centers, e.g. firewalls, IPS, etc.

   For larger content providers (e.g. those who manage servers, or even
   the Data Centers of their own), this deployment model can also be
   attractive at the very early stage of transition (considering risks
   to the service continuity, and the costs).  If there are load
   balancing devices deployed already, the NAT64 functional elements are
   likely to be co-located on these boxes naturally.

   But it should be noted that the purpose of this deployment model is
   to encourage the IPv6 transition with economic justification within
   given transition period.  The Dual-Stack mode which is the most
   straightforward approach should still be recommended to customers
   from the very beginning if the costs and risks are acceptable to
   them.


3.  Deployment Model

   The NAT64 gateway is deployed between the IPv6 Internet and the IPv4
   servers[RFC6144].  See the following as an example.

           +----------------+     +---------+     +--------------+
           | Data Center    |     |  NAT64  |     |     IPv6     |
           |                | --- | Gateway | --- |   Internet   |
           |    +--------+  |     +---------+     +--------------+
           |    |  IPv4  |  |
           |    | Server |  |                     +--------------+
           |    +--------+  |  -----------------  |     IPv4     |
           |                |                     |   Internet   |
           +----------------+                     +--------------+


   In this deployment model, the Stateful NAT64 is performed to
   translate IPv6 packets to IPv4 and vice versa.  The guidance in
   [RFC6146],[RFC6052],[RFC6144],[RFC6145] should be followed.  The

   communications are initiated from the IPv6 side.  The IPv6 node will
   firstly get A/AAAA addresses of the server from DNS, and then the
   communication will follow the path to NAT64 Gateway.  When an IPv6
   packet arrives at NAT64 Gateway, a lookup of the mapping table will
   be carried out to get the IPv4 address used for the translation.  If
   there is no one matched, a new entry will be created.

   (1)Mapping and Addressing

   The Stateful NAT64 can be operated in either of the two mapping
   modes:

   o  1:1, one IPv6 address is mapped to one IPv4 address (exclusively
      for given lifetime);

   o  N:1, each of the IPv4 addresses (i.e.  IPv4 address pool) will be
      shared by multiple IPv6 users from Internet.

   To save global IPv4 addresses which become scarce resources , private
   blocks, for instance 10.0.0.0/8 may be used for the Stateful NAT64.
   In addition, an IPv6 prefix is needed to represent the IPv4 server,
   and the route of the prefix should be advertised to the IPv6
   Internet.  The IPv4 address of the server can be embedded in the IPv6
   prefix following the algorithm specified in [RFC6052].

   (2)DNS

   Before initiating a session, generally an IPv6 user will generate a
   DNS lookup to get the AAAA records and learn the addresses of the
   hosts to access.  In this case, the IPv6 addresses learned through
   AAAA records are those translated from the IPv4 addresses of the
   server.

   Note that the connections may fail in case of IPv4 address literals.
   Refer to [I-D.wing-behave-http-ip-address-literals] for more details.

   The workflow of this model is depicted in the following Figure.

            |IPv4 Server|      server address: 202.0.0.5
            +-----------+


4.  The Implementation

   The deployments of Stateful NAT64 on the server side are different
   from those on the client side:

   o  The traffic accessing servers come from IPv6 Internet, so the
      source IPv6 addresses do not belong to prefixes of any special
      Service Provider's;

   o  It is possible to use private IPv4 blocks for the Stateful NAT64;

   o  The DNS implementation.

4.1.  Address Mapping

   Considering the scale of traffic in the foreseeable future, the 1:1
   Mapping Mode with private blocks (one IPv6 address mapped to one
   private IPv4 address within 10.0.0.0/8) is elected for the Stateful
   NAT64.  By this means, the efficiency of stateful operations could be
   improved and the problems introduced by the address sharing could be
   alleviated (for example, the burden of logging will be reduced in
   this mode).

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                 July 2011


   However, there may be conflicts if the same private space is used
   internally for the interconnection of servers (e.g. multiple servers
   for load balancing).  In this case, N:1 mode with public blocks can
   be used.

   Additionally, an IPv6 prefix from the Service Provider's space is
   assigned to represent the servers and form the IPv4-translated AAAA
   records.

4.2.  DNS implementations

   To make sure the addresses of servers can be retrieved by IPv6 users
   before initiating sessions, the AAAA records which are formed through
   IPv4-translated addresses should be added on the domain's
   authoritative DNS.  The AAAA records under one domain name could be
   converted from the corresponding A records.

   Please note that if the authoritative DNS of given Content Providers'
   domain names are maintained by some third-party DNS Providers but not
   by themselves or the operator from whom this transition service (i.e.
   the deployment model of Stateful NAT64 discussed herein) is
   purchased, the Content Providers must make sure the authoritative
   AAAA records can be added.

4.3.  Fragmentation

   Basically, the processing of packets carrying fragments follows the
   guidance specified in [RFC6145] and [RFC6146] with exceptions that
   fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets will be firstly reassembled to an
   integrated packet before doing packet translation and so on.

4.4.  Examples

   See below for some sites that have migrated through the approach
   aforementioned, and are IPv6 accessible:

4.5.  Logging and Statistics

   Up to now, there are more than 15 thousands different IPv6 users ever
   accessing the above six Content Providers through the NAT64 box
   totally, with 6000 to 7000 active users every day. "www.voc.com.cn"
   is the most popular one accessed by more than 4000 IPv6 users daily,
   and www.chinatelecom.com.cn (the official website of china telecom)
   has amounts of access from 1200 IPv6 users on average every day.

   The IPv6 users aforementioned are located worldwide.  More than 91
   percent come from CERNET2, and the rest are from China telecom, USA,
   Australia, Finland, etc.  The total percentage of 6to4 users accounts
   for approximately 3.2%.
