Abstract

   The IETF has completed its work on the core specification of TWAMP -
   the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol.  This memo describes a new
   feature for TWAMP, that gives the controlling host the ability to
   start and stop one or more individual test sessions using their
   Session Identifiers.  The base capability of the TWAMP protocol
   requires all test sessions previously requested and accepted to start
   and stop at the same time.

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control             October 2008


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has completed its work on the core specification of TWAMP -
   the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol [RFC5357].  TWAMP is an
   extension of the One-way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP
   [RFC4656].  The TWAMP specification gathered wide review as it
   approached completion, and the by-products were several
   recommendations for new features in TWAMP.  There are a growing
   number TWAMP implementations at present, and wide-spread usage is
   expected.  There are even devices that are designed to test
   implementations for protocol compliance.

   This memo describes a new feature for TWAMP.  TWAMP (and OWAMP) start
   all previously requested and accepted test sessions at once.  This
   feature allows the Control-Client to control individual test sessions
   on the basis of their Session Identifier (SID).  The feature permits
   a short duration TWAMP test to start (and/or stop) during a longer
   test.  This feature permits a specific diagnostic test to begin if
   intermediate results indicate that the test is warranted, for
   example.

   This feature requires a Mode bit position assignment and the
   assignment of two new TWAMP command numbers (for the augmented Start
   and Stop commands).  This feature also specifies a new Stop-ACK
   Server response, to complete the symmetry of the session stopping
   process in the same way as the Start-ACK response.

   Implementers of this feature may also wish to implement the "Reflect
   Octets" feature, described in [draft-ietf-ippm-twamp-reflect-octets,
   work in progress].  This feature allows a Control-Client to insert a
   locally-specified request number into the Request-TW-Session command
   (in octets originally designated MBZ=Must Be Zero), and a compliant
   Server will return the request number in its reply (Accept message).

   This memo is intended to be an update to the TWAMP RFC.


2.  Purpose and Scope

   The purpose of this memo is to describe an additional function and
   feature for TWAMP [RFC5357].  The feature needs a clear description
   so it can be discussed and (hopefully) adopted in the IP Performance
   Metrics Charter.

   The scope of the memo is currently limited to specifications of the
   following features:

   1.  Extension of the modes of operation through assignment of a new
       value in the Mode field to communicate feature capability and
       use,

   2.  the definition of augmented Start Session and Stop Session
       commands, and

   3.  the definition of related procedures for TWAMP entities.

   The motivation for this added feature is the ability to start and
   stop individual test sessions at will, using a single TWAMP-control
   connection.


3.  TWAMP Control Extensions

   TWAMP-Control protocol is a derivative of the OWAMP-Control protocol,
   and provides two-way measurement capability.  TWAMP [RFC5357] uses
   the Modes Field to identify and select specific communication
   capabilities, and this field is a recognized extension mechanism.
   The following sections describe one such extension.

3.1.  Connection Setup with Individual Session Control

   TWAMP-Control connection establishment follows the procedure defined
   in section 3.1 of [RFC4656] OWAMP.  The Individual Session Control
   mode requires one new bit position (and value) to identify the
   ability of the Server/Session-Reflector to start and stop specific
   sessions (according to their Session Identifier, or SID).  This new
   feature requires an additional TWAMP mode bit assignment as follows:

   Value  Description             Reference/Explanation
   0      Reserved
   1      Unauthenticated         RFC4656, Section 3.1
   2      Authenticated           RFC4656, Section 3.1
   4      Encrypted               RFC4656, Section 3.1
   8      Unauth. TEST protocol,  draft-...-more-twamp (3)
          Auth. CONTROL
   --------------------------------------------------------
   zzz    Individual Session      this memo, bit position (Z)
          Control


   In the original OWAMP mode field, setting bit positions 0, 1 or 2
   indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test
   protocol inherited the same mode (see section 4 of [RFC4656]).  In
   the [I-D.ietf-ippm-more-twamp] memo, bit position (3) allows a
   different security mode in the Test protocol and uses the

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control             October 2008


   unauthenticated test packet format.

   If the Server sets the new bit position (bit position Z) in the
   Server Greeting message to indicate its capabilities, then the Server
   and Session-Reflector MUST comply with the requirements of this memo
   to control sessions on an individual basis if desired.

   If the Control-Client intends to control sessions on an individual
   basis (according to the requirements in this memo), it MUST set the
   mode bit (Z, corresponding to the new mode) in the Setup Response
   message.

   IF the Control-Client has selected the Reflect Octets feature
   [draft-ietf-ippm-twamp-reflect-octets, work in progress] in
   combination with the Individual Session Control feature (after the
   Server identified its capability), AND utilizes the feature to insert
   a locally-specified request number in the Request-TW-Session command,
   THEN the Control Client MAY send more than one Request-TW-Session
   command to a given Server without waiting for the corresponding
   Accept-Session message.

3.2.  Start-Sessions Command with Session Control

   Having requested one or more test sessions and received affirmative
   Accept-Session responses, a TWAMP Client MAY start the execution of
   the requested test sessions by sending a Start-Sessions message to
   the server.

   The format of this message is as follows:

   The Number of sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
   this Start command applies to.  The SID is as defined in OWAMP (and
   TWAMP) section 3.5 [RFC4656].

   The Server MUST respond with a Start-Ack message (which SHOULD be
   sent as quickly as possible).  Start-Ack messages have the format
   defined in section 3.7 of [RFC4656].

   The Control Client MUST NOT send a subsequent Start Sessions command
   until an outstanding message is acknowledged with a Start-Ack
   message.

3.3.  Stop-Sessions Command with Session Control

   The Stop-Sessions command can only be issued by the Control-Client.
   The message MUST contain at least one SID.  The message is terminated
   with a single block HMAC, to complete the Stop-Sessions Command.

   Thus, the TWAMP Stop-Sessions command for individual session control
   is constructed as follows:

   The Number of sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
   this Stop command applies to.  The SID is as defined in OWAMP (and
   TWAMP) section 3.5 [RFC4656].

3.4.  SERVWAIT Timeout Operation

   Section 3.1 of [RFC5357] describes the operation of the optional
   SERVWAIT timer.  In normal TWAMP operation, the Server suspends
   monitoring the SERVWAIT timer while test sessions are in progress.
   When the Individual Session Control feature is utilized, this
   suspension is extended to cover the time when ANY test session is in
   progress.

   Thus, the Server SHALL suspend monitoring control connection activity
   after receiving any Start-Sessions command, and after receiving a
   Stop-Sessions command for all corresponding SIDs (and no test
   sessions are in-progress), OR when REFWAIT expires on ALL test
   sessions initiated by a TWAMP-Control connection, then the SERVWAIT
   monitoring SHALL resume (as though a Stop-Sessions command had been
   received).  An implementation which supports the SERVWAIT timeout
   option SHOULD also implement the REFWAIT timeout option.

3.5.  Additional considerations

   The value of the Modes field sent by the Server (in the Server
   Greeting message) is the bit-wise OR of the mode values that it is
   willing to support during this session.

   If this feature is adopted, the last ???? bits of the Modes 32-bit
   field are used.  A Control-Client MAY ignore other bit positions
   greater than 2 in the Modes Field, or it MAY support other features
   that are communicated in these bit positions.  (The unassigned bits
   are available for future protocol extensions.)

   Other ways in which TWAMP extends OWAMP are described in [RFC5357].


4.  TWAMP Test with Individual Session Control

   The TWAMP test protocol is similar to the OWAMP [RFC4656] test
   protocol with the exception that the Session-Reflector transmits test
   packets to the Session-Sender in response to each test packet it
   receives.  TWAMP [RFC5357] defines two different test packet formats,
   one for packets transmitted by the Session-Sender and one for packets
   transmitted by the Session-Reflector.  As with OWAMP-Test protocol
   there are three security modes: unauthenticated, authenticated, and
   encrypted.  Unauthenticated mode has one test packet format, while
   authenticated and encrypted modes use another (common) format.

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control             October 2008


4.1.  Sender Behavior

   The individual session control feature requires that the sender MUST
   manage test sessions according to their SID.  Otherwise, the sender
   behavior is as describe in section 4.1 of [RFC5357].

4.2.  Reflector Behavior

   The TWAMP Reflector follows the procedures and guidelines in section
   4.2 of [RFC5357], with the following additional functions required by
   this feature:

   o  The Session-Reflector MUST manage all test sessions accepted
      according to their SID.

   o  Packets for a specific session/SID not received within the Timeout
      (following the Stop-Session command) MUST be ignored by the
      Session-Reflector.  The Session-Reflector MUST NOT generate a test
      packet to the Session-Sender for packets that are ignored.

   o  If the RECOMMENDED REFWAIT timer is implemented, it SHOULD be
      enforced when any test session is in-progress (started and not
      stopped).


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See the security
   considerations in[RFC4656] and [RFC5357].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests assignment of one mode bit position/value to the
   IANA registry for the TWAMP Mode field, and describes behavior when
   the new mode is used.  This field is a recognized extension mechanism
   for TWAMP.

   This memo also requests assignment of two command numbers in the
   TWAMP-Control Command Number registry, and describes the use of the
   new commands.  The command number field is a recognized extension
   mechanism for TWAMP.

6.1.  Registry Specification

   IANA has created a TWAMP-Modes registry (as requested in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-more-twamp]).  TWAMP-Modes are specified in TWAMP

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control             October 2008


   Server Greeting messages and Set-up Response messages, as described
   in section 3.1 of [RFC5357], consistent with section 3.1 of
   [RFC4656], and extended by this memo.  Modes are indicated by setting
   bits in the 32-bit Modes field.  Thus, this registry can contain a
   total of 32 possible values.

   IANA has also created a TWAMP-Control Command Number registry.
   TWAMP-Control commands are specified by the first octet in TWAMP-
   Control messages as specified in section 3.5 of [RFC5357], and
   augmented by this memo.  This registry may contain sixteen possible
   values.

6.2.  Registry Management

   Because the TWAMP-Control Command Number registry can contain only
   sixteen values, TWAMP-Modes can only contain thirty-two values, and
   because TWAMP is an IETF protocol, these registries must be updated
   only by "IETF Consensus" as specified in [RFC2434](an RFC documenting
   registry use that is approved by the IESG).  Management of these
   registries is described in section 8.2 of [RFC5357] and
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-more-twamp].

   This memo proposes assignment of values 7 and 8.

6.3.  Experimental Numbers

   One experimental value has been assigned in the TWAMP-Control Command
   Number registry.

   No additional experimental values are assigned in the TWAMP-Modes
   registry.
