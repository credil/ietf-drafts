   Network Management Private Enterprise Code) for use in documentation.


1.  Introduction

   RFC 1065 [RFC1065] created a subtree (arc) of object identifiers
   (OIDs) for identifying management objects that are defined
   unilaterally by a single party, such as an enterprise.  The subtree
   for a particular enterprise consists of the prefix "1.3.6.1.4.1.",
   followed by the Enterprise Number assigned for that enterprise.

   Enterprise Numbers are allocated by IANA, and are also known as
   "Private Enterprise Numbers", "Enterprise Codes", and "SMI (Structure
   of Management Information) Network Management Private Enterprise
   Codes".  See [Application] for more information on how to request an
   Enterprise Number from IANA, and [Numbers] for the list of currently
   assigned numbers.

   Enterprise Numbers have also been used for many other purposes than
   OIDs in various protocols; for example:

   o  "STRUCTURED-DATA" identifiers in Syslog [RFC5424]
   o  "Vendor-Specific" RADIUS attributes [RFC2865]
   o  Mobile IPv4 vendor/organization-specific extensions [RFC3115]
   o  User-defined error information in RSVP [RFC5284]
   o  Vendor options in DHCPv4 [RFC3925]
   o  Enterprise-specific information elements in IP Flow Information
      Export (IPFIX) protocol [RFC5101]

   From time to time, documents created by the IETF or by other
   organizations show examples involving Enterprise Numbers, where the
   actual number used is not relevant.  To reduce the likelihood of
   conflict and confusion, this document specifies an Enterprise Number
   for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.


2.  Enterprise Number for Documentation Use

   The Enterprise Number 32473 has been allocated for use in examples in
   RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update (has updated) the registration for Enterprise
   Number 32473 to point to this RFC.

4.  Security Considerations

   The enterprise number in this document is for use in documentation
   only, and does not have any direct impact on security.


5.  Acknowledgments

   The need for an Enterprise Number for documentation use was
   identified by Rainer Gerhards for the examples in [RFC5424].  The
   authors would also like to thank Michelle Cotton for her help.  This
   document borrows text from [RFC4735] and [IDR].
