1. Introduction 

   Impairments in optical networks can be accounted for in a number of 
   ways as discussed in reference [Imp-Frame]. This document provides an 
   information model for path validation in optical networks utilizing 
   approximate computations. The definitions, characteristics and usage 
   of the optical parameters that form this model are based on ITU-T 
   recommendation G.680 [G.680]. This impairment related model is 
   intentionally compatible with the impairment free model of reference 
   [RWA-Info]. Although this document focuses on the optical impairment 
   parameters from a control plane point of view, Appendix A provides a

   list of optical parameters and their definition from ITU-T G.680 and 
   related documents. 

2. Optical Impairment Information Model 

   The definitions of optical impairment parameters of network elements 
   and examples of their use can be found in [G.680] and related 
   documents (also see Appendix A). From an information modeling and 
   control plane perspective, one basic aspect of a given parameter is 
   the scope of its applicability within a network element. In 
   particular we need to know which parameters will (a) apply to the 
   network element as a whole, (b) can vary on a per port basis for a 
   network element, and (c)can vary based on ingress to egress port 
   pairs. 

    

2.1. Network Element Wide Parameters 

   Based on the definitions in [G.680] and related documents we have the 
   following parameters apply to the network element as a whole. At most 
   one of these parameters is required per network element. 

   1. Channel frequency range (GHz, Max, Min) 

   2. Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max) 

   3. Ripple (dB, Max) 

   4. Channel chromatic dispersion (ps/nm, Max, Min) 

   5. Differential group delay (ps, Max) 

   6. Polarization dependent loss (dB, Max) 

   7. Reflectance (passive component) (dB, Max) 

   8. Reconfigure time/Switching time (ms, Max, Min) 

   9. Channel uniformity (dB, Max) 

   10.Channel addition/removal (steady-state) gain response (dB, Max, 
      Min) 

   11.Transient duration (ms, Max) 

   12.Transient gain increase (dB, Max)

   13.Transient gain reduction (dB, Max) 

   14.Multichannel gain-change difference (inter-channel gain-change 
      difference) (dB, Max) 

   15.Multichannel gain tilt (inter-channel gain-change ratio)(dB, Max) 

2.2. Per Port Parameters 

   The following optical parameters may exhibit per port dependence, 
   hence may be specified a most once for each port of the network 
   element. 

   1. Total input power range (dBm, Max, Min) 

   2. Channel input power range (dBm, Max, Min) 

   3. Channel output power range (dBm, Max, Min) 

   4. Input reflectance (dB, Max) (with amplifiers) 

   5. Output reflectance (dB, Max) (with amplifiers) 

   6. Maximum reflectance tolerable at input (dB, Min) 

   7. Maximum reflectance tolerable at output (dB, Min) 

   8. Maximum total output power (dBm, Max) 

2.3. Port to Port Parameters 

   The following optical parameters may exhibit a port-to-port 
   dependence and hence may be specified at most once for each 
   ingress/egress port pair of the network element. 

   1. Insertion loss (dB, Max, Min) 

   2. Isolation, adjacent channel (dB, Min) 

   3. Isolation, non-adjacent channel (dB, Min) 

   4. Channel extinction (dB, Min) 

   5. Channel signal-spontaneous noise figure (dB, Max) 

   6. Channel gain (dB, Max, Min)

3. Encoding Considerations 

   The units for the various parameters include GHz, dB, dBm, ms, ps, 
   and ps/nm. These are typically expressed as floating point numbers. 
   Due to the measurement limitations inherent in these parameters 
   single precision floating point, e.g., 32 bit IEEE floating point, 
   numbers should be sufficient. 

   For realistic optical network elements the per port and port-to-port 
   parameters typically only assume a few values. For example, the 
   channel gain of a ROADM is usually specified in terms of input to 
   drop, add to output, and input to output. This implies that many port 
   and port-to-port parameters could be efficiently specified, stored 
   and transported by making use of the Link Set Sub-TLV and 
   Connectivity Matrix Sub-TLV of reference [Encode]. 

4. Usage of Parameters in Optical Path Validation 

   Given an optical path and the optical characteristics of each network 
   element along the path we then need to use these characteristics to 
   validate the path. We envisage that these parameters will be made 
   available via some mechanism to the entity in which optical path 
   validation takes place. Refer to [Imp-Frame] for architectural 
   options in which impairment validation for an optical path is 
   defined.  

   Section 9 and 10 of G.680 gives techniques and formulas for use in 
   calculating the impact of a cascade of network elements. These range 
   from relatively simple bounds on the sum of uncompensated chromatic 
   dispersion (residual dispersion) to more elaborate formulas for 
   overall optical signal to noise ration (OSNR) computations based on 
   multiple parameters including noise factor. 

   To further aid understanding and use of these optical parameters 
   Appendix I of [G.680] furnishes example parameter values for 
   different network element types and appendix II provides examples of 
   computations involving the cascades of network elements along a path. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document defines an information model for impairments in optical 
   networks. If such a model is put into use within a network it will by 
   its nature contain details of the physical characteristics of an 
   optical network. Such information would need to be protected from 
   intentional or unintentional disclosure.

6. IANA Considerations 

   This draft does not currently require any consideration from IANA.  

7. Conclusions 

   The state of standardization of optical device characteristics has 
   matured from when initial IETF work concerning optical impairments 
   was investigated in [RFC4054]. Relatively recent ITU-T 
   recommendations provide a standardized based of optical 
   characteristic definitions and parameters that control plane 
   technologies such as GMPLS and PCE can make use of in performing 
   optical path validation. The enclosed information model shows how 
   readily such ITU-T optical work can be utilized within the control 
   plane.

APPENDIX A: Optical Parameters 

   The following provides an annotated list of optical characteristics 
   from ITU-T recommendation G.680 [G.680] for use in optical path 
   impairment computations. For each parameter we specify the units to 
   be used, whether minimum or maximum values are used, and whether the 
   parameters applies to the optical network element as a whole, on a 
   per port basis or on a port-to-port pair basis.  

   Not all these parameters will apply to all devices. The main 
   differentiation in G.680 comes from those network elements that 
   include or do not include optical amplifiers. 

A.1. Parameters for NEs without optical amplifiers 

   Channel frequency range (GHz, Max, Min): [G.671] The frequency range 
   within which a DWDM device is required to operate with a specified 
   performance. For a particular nominal channel central frequency, 
   fnomi, this frequency range is from fimin = (fnomi - dfmax) to fimax 
   = (fnomi + dfmax), where dfmax is the maximum channel central 
   frequency deviation. Nominal channel central frequency and maximum 
   channel central frequency deviation are defined in ITU-T Rec. G.692. 

   Insertion loss (dB, Port-Port, Max, Min):[G.671] It is the reduction 
   in optical power between an input and output port of a WDM device in 
   decibels (dB). 

   Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max):[G.671] This is the 
   maximum variation of insertion loss at any frequency within the 
   channel frequency range (DWDM devices) or channel wavelength range 
   (CWDM and WWDM devices). 

   Ripple (dB, Max): [G.671] For WDM devices and tuneable filters, the 
   peak-to-peak difference in insertion loss within a channel frequency 
   (or wavelength) range. 

   Channel chromatic dispersion (ps/nm, Max, Min): [G.650.1] Change of 
   the group delay of a light pulse for a unit fibre length caused by a 
   unit wavelength change. 

   Differential group delay (ps, Max): [G.671] Polarization Mode 
   Dispersion (PMD) is usually described in terms of a Differential 
   Group Delay (DGD), which is the time difference between the principal 
   States of Polarization (SOPs) of an optical signal at a particular 
   wavelength and time.

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model          October 2008 
    

   Polarization dependent loss (dB, Max): [G.671] Maximum variation of 
   insertion loss due to a variation of the state of polarization (SOP) 
   over all SOPs. 

   Reflectance (dB, Max): [G.671] The ratio of reflected power Pr to 
   incident power, Pi at a given port of a passive component, for given 
   conditions of spectral composition, polarization and geometrical 
   distribution. 

   Isolation, adjacent channel (dB, Min, Port-Port): [G.671] The 
   adjacent channel isolation (of a WDM device) is defined to be equal 
   to the unidirectional (far-end) isolation of that device with the 
   restriction that x, the isolation wavelength number, is restricted to 
   the channels immediately adjacent to the (channel) wavelength number 
   associated with port o.  

   Isolation, non-adjacent channel (dB, Min, Port-Port): [G.671] The 
   non-adjacent channel isolation (of a WDM device) is defined to be 
   equal to the unidirectional (far-end) isolation of that device with 
   the restriction that x, the isolation wavelength number, is 
   restricted to each of the channels not immediately adjacent to the 
   (channel) wavelength number associated with port o.  

   Note: [G.671] In a WDM device able to separate k wavelengths (w1, w2, 
   ... , wk) radiation coming from one input port into k output ports, 
   each one nominally passing radiation at one specific wavelength only. 
   The unidirectional (far-end) isolation is a measure of the part of 
   the optical power at each wavelength exiting from the port at 
   wavelengths different from the nominal wavelength relative to the 
   power at the nominal wavelength. 

   Channel extinction (dB, Min, Port-Port): [G.671] Within the operating 
   wavelength range, the difference (in dB) between the maximum 
   insertion loss for the non-extinguished (non-blocked) channels and 
   the minimum insertion loss for the extinguished (blocked) channels. 

   Reconfigure time (ms, Max, Min): [G.680] The reconfigure time (of an 
   ROADM) is the elapsed time measured from the earliest point that the 
   actuation energy is applied to reconfigure the ONE to the time when 
   the channel insertion loss for all wanted channels has settled to 
   within 0.5 dB of its final steady state value and all other 
   parameters of the device (e.g., isolation and channel extinction)are 
   within the allowed limits. 

   Switching time (for PXC) (ms, Max, Min): [G.671] The elapsed time it 
   takes the switch to turn path io on or off from a particular initial

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model          October 2008 
    

   state, measured from the time the actuation energy is applied or 
   removed. 

   Channel uniformity (dB, Max): [G.671] The difference (in dB) between 
   the powers of the channel with the most power (in dBm) and the 
   channel with the least power (in dBm). This applies to a multichannel 
   signal across the operating wavelength range. 

A.2. Additional parameters for NEs with optical amplifiers 

   Total input power range (dBm, Max, Min, Port): [G.661] The range of 
   optical power levels at the input for which the corresponding output 
   signal optical power lies in the specified output power range, where 
   the OA performance is ensured.

   Channel output power range (dBm, Max, Min, Port): [G.661] The range 
   of optical power levels at the output of the OA for which the 
   corresponding input signal power lies in the specified input power 
   range, where the OA performance is ensured. 

   Channel signal-spontaneous noise figure (dB, Max, Port-Port) [G.661] 
   The signal-spontaneous beat noise contribution to the noise figure, 
   expressed in dB. 

   Input reflectance (dB, Max, Port): [G.661] The maximum fraction of 
   incident optical power, at the operating wavelength and over all 
   states of input light polarization, reflected by the OA from the 
   input port, under nominal specified operating conditions, expressed 
   in dB. 

   Output reflectance (dB, Max, Port): [G.661] The fraction of incident 
   optical power at the operating wavelength reflected by the OA from 
   the output port, under nominal operating conditions, expressed in dB. 

   Maximum reflectance tolerable at input (dB, Min, Port): [G.661] The 
   maximum fraction of power, expressed in dB, exiting the optical input 
   port of the OA which, when reflected back into the OA, allows the 
   device to still meet its specifications. 

   Maximum reflectance tolerable at output (dB, Min, Port): [G.661] The 
   maximum fraction of power, expressed in dB, exiting the optical 
   output port of the OA which, when reflected back into the OA, allows 
   the device to still meet its specifications.
