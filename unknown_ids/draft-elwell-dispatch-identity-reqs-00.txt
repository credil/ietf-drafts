Internet-Draft      SIP Secure Caller ID Requirements          June 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document examines requirements for secure caller identification
   in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261].  The primary
   purpose of SIP is establishment of a session, or call, between two
   users, each represented by a user agent (UA).  One UA (the calling
   UA) originates the call (on behalf of the calling user or caller) and
   the other UA (the called UA) receives the call (on behalf of the
   called user or callee).  Call establishment is achieved using the SIP
   INVITE method.  Caller identification is the provision of calling
   user identification to the called UA, which can then make it
   available to the called user.

   Caller identification can be used for many purposes, some of which
   require the information to be secure (e.g., not subject to forgery).
   SIP already has some mechanisms for achieving caller identification,
   and some of these mechanisms can be secure, depending on how they are
   deployed.  One mechanism uses the From header field, with
   authentication provided by the Identity header field (SIP Identity)
   [RFC4474].  Alternatively, in trusted environments, the P-Asserted-
   Identity header field [RFC3325] can be used.  Doubts have been
   expressed as to whether these mechanisms are sufficient to address
   all requirements for secure caller identification.  This document
   examines requirements for secure caller identification as a step
   towards evaluating existing mechanisms and proposing new or modified
   mechanisms where requirements are not yet met.

   The importance of secure end-to-end identification is discussed in
   more detail in [I-D.elwell-sip-e2e-identity-important].

   Existing SIP authentication mechanisms serve the purpose of providing
   secure identification of the sender of a SIP request (sender
   identification).  They can be applied to a variety of request types,
   including:

   o  INVITE requests (for initiating a call);

   o  other dialog-initiating requests (e.g.  SUBSCRIBE, REFER);

   o  mid-dialog requests (e.g., BYE or re-INVITE requests during an
      INVITE-initiated dialog, NOTIFY requests);

   o  stand-alone requests (e.g., MESSAGE, PUBLISH).

   Therefore in one sense, caller identification is a particular
   instance of sender identification.  However, caller identification is
   more than that, because a call comprises not only the signalling
   messages exchanged between UAs, but also the media streams

   established as a result of that signalling.  The average user does
   not distinguish signalling and media, and expects caller
   identification to identify the other party in the call (i.e., both
   signalling and media).  There is some overlap between requirements
   for caller identification and requirements for sender identification,
   but this document focuses on requirements for caller identification.
   Because there are both similarities and differences in requirements
   between caller identification and sender identification, it may or
   may not be possible to use a single mechanism to solve the two
   problems.

   A caller sometimes needs to know to which user the call has been
   delivered.  Because of serial or parallel forking of an INVITE
   request, a call can be offered to more than one called UA, perhaps
   representing different called users.  The call is normally awarded to
   the first UA that answers.  Identification of the user whose UA
   successfully answers a call is known as connected user identification
   (often shortened to "connected identity").  This needs to be
   delivered to the calling UA securely.  An existing mechanism for
   achieving secure connected user identification is specified in
   [RFC4916] and builds on the SIP Identity mechanism [RFC4474].  This
   document also covers requirements for connected user identification,
   which are similar to those for caller identification.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Uses of caller identification

   Caller identification is delivered to the called UA, which can use it
   for a number of purposes, for example:

   o  presentation to the called user;

   o  access to other information about the caller (e.g., account
      details);

   o  automatic call handling (e.g., rejection of unwanted calls,
      forwarding to voice mail, forwarding to another user);

   o  logging of received and missed calls;

   o  facilitating the establishment of a return call.

   The called user can use this information for a number of purposes,
   for example:

Internet-Draft      SIP Secure Caller ID Requirements          June 2009


   o  deciding whether to answer a call, ignore a call, reject a call or
      cause a call to be forwarded to voicemail or elsewhere);

   o  deciding how to greet the caller;

   o  deciding how to behave during the call (e.g., whether it is safe
      to disclose sensitive information).

   Recognition of the caller by voice or video is clearly an alternative
   means of accomplishing the last of these, but only if the called user
   knows the caller in person.

   Sometimes decisions can be made on the basis of the name, telephone
   number or other form of identification of the particular caller, but
   on other occasions the caller's affiliation may be of more use.  For
   example, a called user may not know a particular employee of company
   X, but can make useful decisions in the knowledge that the call is
   from company X.

   Handling of received identification information by a UA and use by a
   user is discussed in more detail in
   [I-D.elwell-sip-identity-handling-ua].


3.  Forms of caller identification

   Caller identification, as delivered to the called UA, is in the form
   of a SIP (or SIPS) URI or a TEL URI.  In practice it is usually a SIP
   URI.

   A SIP URI can be based on an E.164 telephone number, in which case
   the meaning of the domain part is unclear.  However, generally the
   call will have arrived from or via the indicated domain.  If all
   calls arriving via the called user's service provider carry that
   service provider's domain name, the domain name says nothing about
   the origin of the call.  The domain part would be far more useful if
   it represented the originating domain.  This is particularly true if
   the called user or called UA does not recognise the particular
   telephone number.  For example, if caller identification

      sip:+123456789@example.com;user=phone

   is received, even if the telephone number is not recognised, the fact
   that the call has come from the example.com domain might be of use,
   but not if all calls arrive via example.com.  In some cases the
   telephone number alone may be useful and the domain part can be
   ignored.

Internet-Draft      SIP Secure Caller ID Requirements          June 2009


   In the case of a SIP URI not based on an E.164 number (e.g., with a
   name or private telephone number in the user part) either the domain
   part alone or the domain part plus user part might be of use to the
   called UA or called user.  The user part alone might be of use, but
   only if it is fairly unique.


4.  Security of caller identification

   A user often needs to know whether a call is secure.  Typically a
   user's expectation is that information (media) cannot be eavesdropped
   during a secure call, e.g., anything spoken cannot be overheard by
   third parties.  Another reasonable expectation is that information
   received has not been inserted, removed or modified by a third party.
   These expectations imply that the user must know with certainty who
   is the other party in the call.  Therefore secure caller or connected
   user identification plays an important part in determining whether a
   call is secure.  The need for a visual indication that caller
   identification can be trusted is discussed in
   [I-D.york-sip-visual-identifier-trusted-identity].

   Identification information in a SIP message can be subject to
   forgery, unless a trusted entity can assert that the information is
   correct.  Any assertion must itself be protected against forgery, and
   must be accompanied by evidence that the assertion is made by an
   entity that possesses secret information (e.g., a private key known
   only to the trusted entity or a shared secret known only to the
   trusted party and a relying party).  The asserting entity has to be
   trusted not to disclose the secret information to other parties and
   to assert only what it knows to be true.

   For example, a user might trust his/her local SIP service provider to
   assert the identity of the other user.  This is the solution provided
   by P-Asserted-Identity, the assertion being secured by using TLS
   transport between the local proxy and the UA, the UA having
   authenticated the proxy at TLS establishment time.  However, if the
   remote user is not within the local domain, the local domain must
   rely on an assertion from an upstream domain.  Depending on how many
   domains the call passes through, there could be a chain of assertions
   of arbitrary length.  The first domain should have based its
   assertion on authentication of its user (e.g., using SIP digest
   authentication).  It is not uncommon for a call to pass through 4
   domains (e.g., enterprise 1, service provider 1, service provider 2
   and enterprise 2), resulting in a chain of assertions.  There can be
   more domains in the case of a forwarded call.  The UA receiving an
   assertion is not aware of the length of the chain or the intermediate
   domains whose assertions are being relied upon.

Internet-Draft      SIP Secure Caller ID Requirements          June 2009


   As another example, a user might trust the other user's domain to
   assert the identity of that user, this assertion being based on
   authentication of the user (e.g., using SIP digest authentication).
   Authentication of the asserting domain requires that the UA knows in
   advance the expected certificate of that domain or the expected
   certification authority (CA) certificate.  This is the solution
   provided by SIP Identity.  The assertion has to pass through any
   intermediate domains en route to the validating UA, and this tends to
   encounter deployment difficulties.

   As yet another example, a UA could initiate some form or return
   routability check.  For example, on receipt of an INVITE request, the
   UA could send a SIP request to the identified calling user or domain.
   Trust then is in any intermediate domains to route only to the target
   domain or user, and in the target domain or user to reject the
   request if it cannot be correlated with an outbound call request.

   In all cases, the identified calling or connected user is the user
   that the calling or connected UA is acting on behalf of.  Whether it
   really is that particular user or another person gaining authorised
   or unauthorised access to the device cannot be known.  It depends on
   the user interface provided by the UA (e.g., whether it is password
   protected) and user discipline (e.g., not leaving the device
   unattended and unlocked, not disclosing the password to others).
   This aspect of the problem cannot be solved by protocols and is not
   addressed in this document.


5.  Requirements

   REQ1 - It MUST be possible for a called user to receive caller
   identification that includes the calling user's domain and the
   calling user's name or telephone number within that domain.

   REQ2 - It MUST be possible for a called UA to receive an assertion
   from the calling user's domain that the call originates in that
   domain and that caller identification is correct, based on that
   domain having authenticated the calling UA.

   REQ3 - It MUST be possible for a called UA to verify such an
   assertion based on a trust anchor, such as a CA certificate.

   REQ4 - It MUST be possible to bind the source and sink of secure
   media (e.g., using SRTP or TLS) to an asserted caller identification.

   REQ5 - The solution MUST work when a call traverses multiple domains,
   including cases where domains change certain parts of the SIP
   message.

      Note that the precise identification of elements of a SIP message
      that must be allowed to change is for further study, but is
      expected to include at least those parts of SDP that are changed
      in order to accomplish media steering.

   REQ6 - It MUST be possible for a calling user to receive connected
   user identification meeting similar requirements to those above for
   caller identification.


6.  TODO

   This current draft does not address PSTN interworking, where clearly
   considerations are very different.

   This current draft does not address 3PCC situations.

   Does anything need to be said about the special requirements of
   conferences?


7.  IANA considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.


8.  Security considerations

   Authentication of parties involved in a call is an essential part of
   this document and is fully discussed in the preceding sections.
   There are no other security considerations.


9.  Acknowledgements

   The author received help and encouragement from Victor Pascual Avila
   during drafting.
