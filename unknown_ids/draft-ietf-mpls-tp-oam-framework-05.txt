Abstract 

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is 
   based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as 
   specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) 
   and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with 
   additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) 
   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management 
   for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of 
   a control plane. 

   This document describes a framework to support a comprehensive set of 
   OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [12]. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force 
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications 
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport 
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the 
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as 
   defined by the ITU-T.

Editors' Note: 

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF 
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF 
   Last Call. 

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and 
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published 
   RFC has IETF Consensus.] 

1. Introduction 

   As noted in [8], MPLS-TP defines a profile of the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW 
   architectures defined in RFC 3031 [2], RFC 3985 [5] and [7] which is 
   complemented with additional OAM mechanisms and procedures for alarm, 
   fault, performance and protection-switching management for packet 
   transport applications. 

   In line with [13], existing MPLS OAM mechanisms will be used wherever 
   possible and extensions or new OAM mechanisms will be defined only 
   where existing mechanisms are not sufficient to meet the 
   requirements. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework defined in this document provides a 
   comprehensive set of OAM procedures that satisfy the MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements [12]. In this regard, it defines similar OAM 
   functionality as for existing SONET/SDH and OTN OAM mechanisms (e.g. 
   [16]). 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework is applicable to both LSPs and (MS-)PWs and 
   supports co-routed and bidirectional p2p transport paths as well as 
   unidirectional p2p and p2mp transport paths. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force 
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications 
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport 
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the 
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as 
   defined by the ITU-T.

2.2. Definitions 

   Note - the definitions in this section are intended to be in line 
   with ITU-T recommendation Y.1731 in order to have a common, 
   unambiguous terminology. They do not however intend to imply a 
   certain implementation but rather serve as a framework to describe 
   the necessary OAM functions for MPLS-TP. 

   Data plane loopback: it is an out-of-service test where an interface 
   at either an intermediate or terminating node in a path is placed 
   into a data plane loopback state, such that it loops back all the 
   packets (including user data and OAM) it receives on a specific MPLS-
   TP transport path. 

   Domain Border Node (DBN): An LSP intermediate MPLS-TP node (LSR) that 
   is at the boundary of an MPLS-TP OAM domain. Such a node may be 
   present on the edge of two domains or may be connected by a link to 
   an MPLS-TP node in another OAM domain. 

   Loopback: see data plane loopback and OAM loopback definitions. 

   Maintenance Entity (ME): Some portion of a transport path that 
   requires management bounded by two points, and the relationship 
   between those points to which maintenance and monitoring operations 
   apply (details in section 3.1).  

   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG): The set of one or more maintenance 
   entities that maintain and monitor a transport path in an OAM domain. 

   MEP: A MEG end point (MEP) is capable of initiating (MEP Source) and 
   terminating (MEP Sink) OAM messages for fault management and 
   performance monitoring. MEPs reside at the boundaries of an ME 
   (details in section 3.3).  

   MEP Source: A MEP acts as MEP source for an OAM message when it 
   originates and inserts the message into the transport path for its 
   associated MEG. 

   MEP Sink: A MEP acts as a MEP sink for an OAM message when it 
   terminates and processes the messages received from its associated 
   MEG. 

   MIP: A MEG intermediate point (MIP) terminates and processes OAM 
   messages and may generate OAM messages in reaction to received OAM 
   messages. It never generates unsolicited OAM messages itself. A MIP 
   resides within an MEG between MEPs (details in section 3.3).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   OAM domain: A domain, as defined in [11], whose entities are grouped 
   for the purpose of keeping the OAM confined within that domain. 

   Note - within the rest of this document the term "domain" is used to 
   indicate an "OAM domain" 

   OAM flow: Is the set of all OAM messages originating with a specific 
   MEP that instrument one direction of a MEG. 

   OAM information element: An atomic piece of information exchanged 
   between MEPs in MEG used by an OAM application. 

   OAM loopback: it is the capability of a node to intercepts some 
   specific OAM packets and to generate a reply back to their sender. 
   OAM loopback can work in-service and can support different OAM 
   functions (e.g., bidirectional on-demand connectivity verification). 

   OAM Message: One or more OAM information elements that when exchanged 
   between MEPs or between MEPs and MIPs performs some OAM functionality 
   (e.g. connectivity verification) 

   OAM Packet: A packet that carries one or more OAM messages (i.e. OAM 
   information elements). 

   Path: See Transport Path 

   Signal Fail: A condition declared by a MEP when the data forwarding 
   capability associated with a transport path has failed, e.g. loss of 
   continuity.  

   Tandem Connection: A tandem connection is an arbitrary part of a 
   transport path that can be monitored (via OAM) independent of the 
   end-to-end monitoring (OAM). The tandem connection may also include 
   the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the boundaries of the 
   tandem connection. 

   This document uses the terms defined in RFC 5654 [11]. 

   This document uses the term 'Per-hop Behavior' as defined in [14]. 

3. Functional Components 

   MPLS-TP defines a profile of the MPLS and PW architectures ([2], [5] 
   and [7]) that is required to transport service traffic where the 
   characteristics of information transfer between the transport path 
   endpoints can be demonstrated to comply with certain performance and 
   quality guarantees.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   In order to describe the required OAM functionality, this document 
   introduces a set of high-level functional components. 

3.1. Maintenance Entity and Maintenance Entity Group 

   MPLS-TP OAM operates in the context of Maintenance Entities (MEs) 
   that are a relationship between two points of a point to point 
   transport path or a root and a leaf of a point to multipoint 
   transport path to which maintenance and monitoring operations apply. 
   These two points are called Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) End Points 
   (MEPs). In between these two points zero or more intermediate points, 
   called Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs), MAY exist 
   and can be shared by more than one ME in a MEG.  

   The abstract reference model for an ME with MEPs and MIPs is 
   described in Figure 1 below: 

    
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
                            |A|----|B|----|C|----|D| 
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
    
                   Figure 1 ME Abstract Reference Model 

   The instantiation of this abstract model to different MPLS-TP 
   entities is described in section 4. In this model, nodes A, B, C and 
   D can be LER/LSR for an LSP or the {S|T}-PEs for a MS-PW. MEPs reside 
   in nodes A and D while MIPs reside in nodes B and C. The links 
   connecting adjacent nodes can be physical links, (sub-)layer 
   LSPs/PSTs, or serving layer paths. 

   This functional model defines the relationships between all OAM 
   entities from a maintenance perspective, to allow each Maintenance 
   Entity to monitor and manage the (sub-)layer network under its 
   responsibility and to localize problems efficiently. 

   Another OAM functional component is referred to as Maintenance Entity 
   Group, which is a collection of one or more MEs that belongs to the 
   same transport path and that are maintained and monitored as a group. 
   An MPLS-TP Maintenance Entity Group may be defined to monitor the 
   transport path for fault and/or performance management.  

   The MEPs that form an MEG are configured and managed to limit the 
   scope of an OAM flow within the MEG that the MEPs belong to (i.e. 
   within the domain of the transport path that is being monitored and 
   managed). A misbranching fault may cause OAM packets to be delivered 
   to a MEP that is not in the MEG of origin.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   In case of unidirectional point-to-point transport paths, a single 
   unidirectional Maintenance Entity is defined to monitor it. 

   In case of associated bi-directional point-to-point transport paths, 
   two independent unidirectional Maintenance Entities are defined to 
   independently monitor each direction. This has implications for 
   transactions that terminate at or query a MIP as a return path from 
   MIP to source MEP does not necessarily exist in a unidirectional MEG. 

   In case of co-routed bi-directional point-to-point transport paths, a 
   single bidirectional Maintenance Entity is defined to monitor both 
   directions congruently. 

   In case of unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport paths, a 
   single unidirectional Maintenance entity for each leaf is defined to 
   monitor the transport path from the root to that leaf. 

   The reference model for the p2mp MEG is represented in Figure 2.

                   Figure 2 Reference Model for p2mp MEG 

   In case of p2mp transport paths, the OAM operations are independent 
   for each ME (A-D, A-E and A-F): 

   o Fault conditions - some faults may impact more than one ME 
      depending from where the failure is located; 

   o Packet loss - packet dropping may impact more than one ME 
      depending from where the packets are lost; 

   o Packet delay - will be unique per ME. 

   Each leaf (i.e. D, E and F) terminates OAM flows to monitor the ME 
   from itself and the root while the root (i.e. A) generates OAM

   messages common to all the MEs of the p2mp MEG. Nodes B and C MAY 
   implement a MIP in the corresponding MEG. 

3.2. Nested MEGs: Path Segment Tunnels and Tandem Connection Monitoring 

   In order to verify and maintain performance and quality guarantees, 
   there is a need to not only apply OAM functionality on a transport 
   path granularity (e.g. LSP or MS-PW), but also on arbitrary parts of 
   transport paths, defined as Tandem Connections, between any two 
   arbitrary points along a transport path. 

   Path segment tunnels (PSTs), as defined in [8], are instantiated to 
   provide monitoring of a portion of a set of co-routed transport paths 
   (LSPs or MS-PWs). Path segment tunnels can also be employed to meet 
   the requirement to provide tandem connection monitoring (TCM). 

   TCM for a given portion of a transport path is implemented by first 
   creating a path segment tunnel that has a 1:1 association with 
   portion of the transport path that is to be uniquely monitored. This 
   means there is direct correlation between all FM and PM information 
   gathered for the PST AND the monitored portion of the E2E transport 
   path. The PST is monitored using normal LSP monitoring. 

   There are a number of implications to this approach: 

   1) The PST would use the uniform model of TC code point copying 
      between sub-layers for diffserv such that the E2E markings and 
      PHB treatment for the transport path was preserved by the PST. 

   2) The PST would use the pipe model for TTL handling such that MIP 
      addressing for the E2E entity would be not be impacted by the 
      presence of the PST. 

   3) PM statistics need to be adjusted for the encapsulation overhead 
      of the additional PST sub-layer. 

   A PST is instantiated to create an MEG that monitors a segment of a 
   transport path (LSP or PW). The endpoints of the PST are MEPs and 
   limit the scope of an OAM flow within the MEG the MEPs belong to 
   (i.e. within the domain of the PST that is being monitored and 
   managed). 

   The following properties apply to all MPLS-TP MEGs:

   o They can be nested but not overlapped, e.g. an MEG may cover a 
      segment or a concatenated segment of another MEG, and may also 
      include the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the edge(s) of 
      the segment or concatenated segment, but all its MEPs and MIPs are 
      no longer part of the encompassing MEG. It is possible that MEPs 
      of nested MEGs reside on a single node. 

   o It is possible for MEPs of nested MEGs to reside on a single node. 

   o Each OAM flow is associated with a single Maintenance Entity 
      Group. 

   o OAM packets that instrument a particular direction of a transport 
      path are subject to the same forwarding treatment (i.e. fate 
      share) as the data traffic and in some cases may be required to 
      have common queuing discipline E2E with the class of traffic 
      monitored. OAM packets can be distinguished from the data traffic 
      using the GAL and ACH constructs [9] for LSP and Section or the 
      ACH construct [6]and [9] for (MS-)PW. 

3.3. MEG End Points (MEPs) 

   MEG End Points (MEPs) are the source and sink points of an MEG. In 
   the context of an MPLS-TP LSP, only LERs can implement MEPs while in 
   the context of a path segment tunnel (PST) both LERs and LSRs can 
   implement MEPs that contribute to the overall monitoring 
   infrastructure for the transport path. Regarding MPLS-TP PW, only T-
   PEs can implement MEPs while for PSTs supporting a PW both T-PEs and 
   S-PEs can implement MEPs. In the context of MPLS-TP Section, any 
   MPLS-TP LSR can implement a MEP. 

   MEPs are responsible for activating and controlling all of the OAM 
   functionality for the MEG. A MEP is capable of originating and 
   terminating OAM messages for fault management and performance 
   monitoring. These OAM messages are encapsulated into an OAM packet 
   using the G-ACh as defined in RFC 5586 [9]: in this case the G-ACh 
   message is an OAM message and the channel type indicates an OAM 
   message. A MEP terminates all the OAM packets it receives from the 
   MEG it belongs to. The MEG the OAM packet belongs to is inferred from 
   the MPLS or PW label or, in case of MPLS-TP section, the MPLS-TP port 
   the OAM packet has been received with the GAL at the top of the label 
   stack. 

   OAM packets may require the use of an available "out-of-band" return 
   path (as defined in [8]). In such cases sufficient information is 
   required in the originating transaction such that the OAM reply 
   packet can be constructed (e.g. IP address).

   Once an MEG is configured, the operator can configure which OAM 
   functions to use on the MEG but the MEPs are always enabled. A node 
   at the edge of an MEG always supports a MEP. 

   MEPs terminate all OAM packets received from the associated MEG. As 
   the MEP corresponds to the termination of the forwarding path for an 
   MEG at the given (sub-)layer, OAM packets never "leaks" outside of a 
   MEG in a fault free implementation. 

   A MEP of an MPLS-TP transport path (Section, LSP or PW) coincides 
   with transport path termination and monitors it for failures or 
   performance degradation (e.g. based on packet counts) in an end-to-
   end scope. Note that both MEP source and MEP sink coincide with 
   transport paths' source and sink terminations. 

   The MEPs of a path segment tunnel are not necessarily coincident with 
   the termination of the MPLS-TP transport path (LSP or PW) and monitor 
   some portion of the transport path for failures or performance 
   degradation (e.g. based on packet counts) only within the boundary of 
   the MEG for the path segment tunnel. 

   An MPLS-TP MEP sink passes a fault indication to its client 
   (sub-)layer network as a consequent action of fault detection. 

   It may occur that the MEPs of a path segment tunnel are set on both 
   sides of the forwarding engine such that the MEG is entirely internal 
   to the node. 

   Note that a MEP can only exist at the beginning and end of a layer 
   i.e. an LSP or PW. If we need to monitor some portion of that LSP or 
   PW, a new sub-layer in the form of a path segment tunnel MUST be 
   created which permits MEPs and an associated MEG to be created. 

   We have the case of an intermediate node sending msg to a MEP. To do 
   this it uses the LSP label - i.e. the top label of the stack at that 
   point. 

3.4. MEG Intermediate Points (MIPs) 

   A MEG Intermediate Point (MIP) is a point between the MEPs of an MEG. 

   A MIP is capable of reacting to some OAM packets and forwarding all 
   the other OAM packets while ensuring fate sharing with data plane 
   packets. However, a MIP does not initiate unsolicited OAM packets, 
   but may be addressed by OAM packets initiated by one of the MEPs of 
   the MEG. A MIP can generate OAM packets only in response to OAM 
   packets that are sent on the MEG it belongs to. 
 
 
Busi et al.           Expires September 5, 2010              [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   An intermediate node within a MEG can either: 

   o support per-node MIP (i.e. a single MIP per node) 

   o support per-interface MIP (i.e. two or more MIPs per node on both 
      sides of the forwarding engine) 

   When sending an OAM packet to a MIP, the source MEP should set the 
   TTL field to indicate the number of hops necessary to reach the node 
   where the MIP resides. It is always assumed that the "pipe"/"short 
   pipe" model of TTL handling is used by the MPLS transport profile.  

   The source MEP should also include Target MIP information in the OAM 
   packets sent to a MIP to allow proper identification of the MIP 
   within the node. The MEG the OAM packet is associated with is 
   inferred from the MPLS label. 

   A node at the edge of an MEG can also support per-interface MEPs and 
   per-interface MIPs on either side of the forwarding engine. 

   Once an MEG is configured, the operator can enable/disable the MIPs 
   on the nodes within the MEG. All the intermediate nodes host MIP(s). 
   Local policy allows them to be enabled per function and per LSP. The 
   local policy is controlled by the management system, which may 
   delegate it to the control plane. 

3.5.  Server MEPs 

   A server MEP is a MEP of an MEG that is either: 

   o defined in a layer network that is "below", which is to say 
      encapsulates and transports the MPLS-TP layer network being 
      referenced, or 

   o defined in a sub-layer of the MPLS-TP layer network that is 
      "below" which is to say encapsulates and transports the sub-layer 
      being referenced. 

   A server MEP can coincide with a MIP or a MEP in the client (MPLS-TP) 
   (sub-)layer network. 

   A server MEP also interacts with the client/server adaptation 
   function between the client (MPLS-TP) (sub-)layer network and the 
   server (sub-)layer network. The adaptation function maintains state 
   on the mapping of MPLS-TP transport paths that are setup over that 
   server (sub-)layer's transport path.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   For example, a server MEP can be either: 

   o A termination point of a physical link (e.g. 802.3), an SDH VC or 
      OTN ODU, for the MPLS-TP Section layer network, defined in section 
      4.1; 

   o An MPLS-TP Section MEP for MPLS-TP LSPs, defined in section 4.2; 

   o An MPLS-TP LSP MEP for MPLS-TP PWs, defined in section 4.4; 

   o An MPLS-TP PST MEP used for LSP segment monitoring, as defined in 
      section 4.3, for MPLS-TP LSPs or higher-level LSP PSTs; 

   o An MPLS-TP PST MEP used for PW segment monitoring, as defined in 
      section 4.5, for MPLS-TP PWs or higher-level PW PSTs. 

   The server MEP can run appropriate OAM functions for fault detection 
   within the server (sub-)layer network, and provides a fault 
   indication to its client MPLS-TP layer network. Server MEP OAM 
   functions are outside the scope of this document. 

3.6. Configuration Considerations 

   When a control plane is not present, the management plane configures 
   these functional components. Otherwise they can be configured either 
   by the management plane or by the control plane. 

   Local policy allows to disable the usage of any available "out-of-
   band" return path, as defined in [8], to generate OAM reply packets, 
   irrespectively on what is requested by the node originating the OAM 
   packet triggering the request. 

   PSTs are usually instantiated when the transport path is created by 
   either the management plane or by the control plane (if present). 
   Sometimes PST can be instantiated after the transport path is 
   initially created (e.g. PST). 

3.7. P2MP considerations 

   All the traffic sent over a p2mp transport path, including OAM 
   packets generated by a MEP, is sent (multicast) from the root to all 
   the leaves. As a consequence: 

      o To send an OAM packet to all leaves, the source MEP can send a 
        single OAM packet that will be delivered by the forwarding plane 
        to all the leaves and processed by all the leaves.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

      o To send an OAM packet to a single leaf, the source MEP sends a 
        single OAM packet that will be delivered by the forwarding plane 
        to all the leaves but contains sufficient information to 
        identify a target leaf, and therefore is processed only by the 
        target leaf and ignored by the other leaves. 

      o In order to send an OAM packet to M leaves (i.e., a subset of 
        all the leaves), the source MEP sends M different OAM packets 
        targeted to each individual leaf in the group of M leaves. 
        Better mechanisms are outside the scope of this document. 

   P2MP paths are unidirectional, therefore any return path to a source 
   MEP for on demand transactions will be out of band. 

   A mechanism to scope the set of MEPs or MIPs expected to respond to a 
   given "on demand" transaction is useful as it relieves the source MEP 
   of the requirement to filter and discard undesired responses as 
   normally TTL exhaust will address all MIPs at a given distance from 
   the source, and failure to exhaust TTL will address all MEPs. 

4. Reference Model 

   The reference model for the MPLS-TP framework builds upon the concept 
   of an MEG, and its associated MEPs and MIPs, to support the 
   functional requirements specified in [12]. 

   The following MPLS-TP MEGs are specified in this document: 

   o A Section Maintenance Entity Group (SME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of MPLS-TP Sections (between MPLS LSRs). 

   o A LSP Maintenance Entity Group (LME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of an end-to-end LSP (between LERs). 

   o A PW Maintenance Entity Group (PME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of an end-to-end SS/MS-PWs (between T-PEs). 

   o A LSP PST Maintenance Entity Group (LPSTME), allowing monitoring 
      and management of a path segment tunnel (between any LERs/LSRs 
      along an LSP). 

   o A MS-PW PST Maintenance Entity (PPSTME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of an MPLS-TP path segment tunnel (between any 
      T-PEs/S-PEs along the (MS-)PW). 

   The MEGs specified in this MPLS-TP framework are compliant with the 
   architecture framework for MPLS-TP MS-PWs [7] and LSPs [2].

   Hierarchical LSPs are also supported in the form of path segment 
   tunnels. In this case, each LSP Tunnel in the hierarchy is a 
   different sub-layer network that can be monitored, independently from 
   higher and lower level LSP tunnels in the hierarchy, on an end-to-end 
   basis (from LER to LER) by a PSTME. It is possible to monitor a 
   portion of a hierarchical LSP by instantiating a hierarchical PSTME 
   between any LERs/LSRs along the hierarchical LSP.

   Figure 3 depicts a high-level reference model for the MPLS-TP OAM 
   framework. The figure depicts portions of two MPLS-TP enabled network 
   domains, Domain 1 and Domain Z. In Domain 1, LSR1 is adjacent to LSR2 
   via the MPLS Section Sec12 and LSR2 is adjacent to LSR3 via the MPLS 
   Section Sec23. Similarly, in Domain Z, LSRX is adjacent to LSRY via 
   the MPLS Section SecXY and LSRY is adjacent to LSRZ via the MPLS 
   Section SecYZ. In addition, LSR3 is adjacent to LSRX via the MPLS 
   Section 3X.

   Figure 3 also shows a bi-directional MS-PW (PW1Z) between AC1 on TPE1 
   and AC2 on TPEZ. The MS-PW consists of three bi-directional PW 
   Segments: 1) PW13 segment between T-PE1 and S-PE3 via the bi-
   directional PSN13 LSP, 2) PW3X segment between S-PE3 and S-PEX, via 
   the bi-directional PSN3X LSP, and 3) PWXZ segment between S-PEX and 
   T-PEZ via the bi-directional PSNXZ LSP. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM procedures that apply to an MEG are expected to 
   operate independently from procedures on other MEGs. Yet, this does 
   not preclude that multiple MEGs may be affected simultaneously by the 
   same network condition, for example, a fiber cut event. 

   Note that there are no constrains imposed by this OAM framework on 
   the number, or type (p2p, p2mp, LSP or PW), of MEGs that may be 
   instantiated on a particular node. In particular, when looking at 
   Figure 3, it should be possible to configure one or more MEPs on the 
   same node if that node is the endpoint of one or more MEGs. 

   Figure 3 does not describe a PW3X PPSTME because typically PSTs are 
   used to monitor an OAM domain (like PW13 and PWXZ PPSTMEs) rather 
   than the segment between two OAM domains. However the OAM framework 
   does not pose any constraints on the way PSTs are instantiated as 
   long as they are not overlapping. 

   The subsections below define the MEGs specified in this MPLS-TP OAM 
   architecture framework document.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  all 
   references to domains, LSRs, MPLS Sections, LSPs, pseudowires and 
   MEGs in this section are made in relation to those shown in Figure 3.  

4.1. MPLS-TP Section Monitoring (SME) 

   An MPLS-TP Section ME (SME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended 
   to an MPLS Section as defined in [11]. An SME may be configured on 
   any MPLS section. SME OAM packets must fate share with the user data 
   packets sent over the monitored MPLS Section. 

   An SME is intended to be deployed for applications where it is 
   preferable to monitor the link between topologically adjacent (next 
   hop in this layer network) MPLS (and MPLS-TP enabled) LSRs rather 
   than monitoring the individual LSP or PW segments traversing the MPLS 
   Section and the server layer technology does not provide adequate OAM 
   capabilities. 

   Figure 3 shows 5 Section MEs configured in the network between AC1 
   and AC2:

   3. Sec3X ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR 3 and LSR X, 

   4. SecXY ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR X and LSR Y, 
      and 

   5. SecYZ ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR Y and LSR Z. 

4.2. MPLS-TP LSP End-to-End Monitoring (LME) 

   An MPLS-TP LSP ME (LME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor an end-to-end LSP between two LERs. An LME may be configured 
   on any MPLS LSP. LME OAM packets must fate share with user data 
   packets sent over the monitored MPLS-TP LSP. 

   An LME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor an entire LSP between its LERs, rather than, say, 
   monitoring individual PWs. 

   Figure 3 depicts 2 LMEs configured in the network between AC1 and 
   AC2: 1) the PSN13 LME between LER 1 and LER 3, and 2) the PSNXZ LME 
   between LER X and LER Y. Note that the presence of a PSN3X LME in 
   such a configuration is optional, hence, not precluded by this 
   framework. For instance, the SPs may prefer to monitor the MPLS-TP 
   Section between the two LSRs rather than the individual LSPs.  

4.3. MPLS-TP LSP Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring (LPSTME) 

   An MPLS-TP LSP Path Segment Tunnel ME (LPSTME) is an MPLS-TP 
   maintenance entity intended to monitor an arbitrary part of an LSP 
   between a given pair of LSRs independently from the end-to-end 
   monitoring  (LME).  An  LPSTMEE can  monitor  an  LSP  segment  or 
   concatenated segment and it may also include the forwarding engine(s) 
   of the node(s) at the edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. 

   Multiple LPSTMEs MAY be configured on any LSP. The LSRs that 
   terminate the LPSTME may or may not be immediately adjacent at the 
   MPLS-TP layer. LPSTME OAM packets must fate share with the user data 
   packets sent over the monitored LSP segment. 

   A LPSTME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o LER and any LSR of a given LSP. 

   o Any two LSRs of a given LSP.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   An LPSTME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of an LSP or set of 
   LSPs rather than the entire LSP itself, for example when there is a 
   need  to  monitor  a  part  of  an  LSP  that  extends  beyond  the 
   administrative  boundaries  of  an  MPLS-TP  enabled  administrative 
   domain.

   Figure 4 depicts a variation of the reference model in Figure 3 where 
   there is an end-to-end PSN LSP (PSN1Z LSP) between PE1 and PEZ. PSN1Z 
   LSP consists of, at least, three LSP Concatenated Segments: PSN13, 
   PSN3X and PSNXZ. In this scenario there are two separate LPSTMEs 
   configured to monitor the PSN1Z LSP: 1) a LPSTME monitoring the PSN13

4.4. MPLS-TP PW Monitoring (PME) 

   An MPLS-TP PW ME (PME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to 
   monitor a SS-PW or MS-PW between a pair of T-PEs. A PME MAY be 
   configured on any SS-PW or MS-PW. PME OAM packets must fate share 
   with the user data packets sent over the monitored PW. 

   A PME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is desirable 
   to monitor an entire PW between a pair of MPLS-TP enabled T-PEs 
   rather than monitoring the LSP aggregating multiple PWs between PEs.

   PW13, PW3X and PWXZ and its associated end-to-end PME (PW1Z PME). 

4.5. MPLS-TP MS-PW Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring (PPSTME) 

   An MPLS-TP MS-PW Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring ME (PPSTME) is an 
   MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to monitor an arbitrary part of 
   an MS-PW between a given pair of PEs independently from the end-to-
   end  monitoring  (PME).  A  PPSTME  can  monitor  a  PW  segment  or 
   concatenated segment and it may also include the forwarding engine(s) 
   of the node(s) at the edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. 

   Multiple PPSTMEs MAY be configured on any MS-PW. The PEs may or may 
   not be immediately adjacent at the MS-PW layer. PPSTME OAM packets 
   fate share with the user data packets sent over the monitored PW 
   Segment. 

   A PPSTME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o T-PE and any S-PE of a given MS-PW

   o Any two S-PEs of a given MS-PW. It can span several PW segments.  

   A PPSTME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of a MS-PW rather than 
   the entire end-to-end PW itself, for example to monitor an MS-PW 
   Segment within a given network domain of an inter-domain MS-PW.

   Figure 6 depicts the same MS-PW (MS-PW1Z) between AC1 and AC2 as in 
   Figure 5. In this scenario there are two separate PPSTMEs configured 
   to monitor MS-PW1Z: 1) a PPSTME monitoring the PW13 MS-PW Segment on 
   Domain 1 (PW13 PPSTME), and 2) a PPSTME monitoring the PWXZ MS-PW 
   Segment on Domain Z with (PWXZ PPSTME). 

   It is worth noticing that PPSTMEs can coexist with the PME monitoring 
   the end-to-end MS-PW and that PPSTME MEPs and PME MEPs can be 
   coincident in the same node (e.g. TPE1 node supports both the PW1Z 
   PME MEP and the PW13 PPSTME MEP). 

5. OAM Functions for proactive monitoring 

   In this document, proactive monitoring refers to OAM operations that 
   are either configured to be carried out periodically and continuously 
   or preconfigured to act on certain events such as alarm signals. 

   Proactive monitoring is frequently "in service" monitoring. The 
   control and measurement implications are: 

   1. Proactive monitoring for a MEG is typically configured at 
      transport path creation time. 

 
 
Busi et al.           Expires September 5, 2010              [Page 22] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   2. The operational characteristics of in-band measurement 
      transactions (e.g., CV, LM etc.) are configured at the MEPs. 

   3. Server layer events are reported by transactions originating at 
      intermediate nodes. 

   4. The measurements resulting from proactive monitoring are typically 
      only reported outside of the MEG as unsolicited notifications for 
      "out of profile" events, such as faults or loss measurement 
      indication of excessive impairment of information transfer 
      capability. 

   5. The measurements resulting from proactive monitoring may be 
      periodically harvested by an EMS/NMS. 

5.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification  

   Proactive Continuity Check functions, as required in section 2.2.2 of 
   [12], are used to detect a loss of continuity defect (LOC) between 
   two MEPs in an MEG. 

   Proactive Connectivity Verification functions, as required in section 
   2.2.3 of [12], are used to detect an unexpected connectivity defect 
   between two MEGs (e.g. mismerging or misconnection), as well as 
   unexpected connectivity within the MEG with an unexpected MEP. 

   Both functions are based on the (proactive) generation of OAM packets 
   by the source MEP that are processed by the sink MEP. As a 
   consequence these two functions are grouped together into Continuity 
   Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) OAM packets. 

   In order to perform pro-active Connectivity Verification function, 
   each CC-V OAM packet MUST also include a globally unique Source MEP 
   identifier. When used to perform only pro-active Continuity Check 
   function, the CC-V OAM packet MAY not include any globally unique 
   Source MEP identifier. Different formats of MEP identifiers are 
   defined in [10] to address different environments. When MPLS-TP is 
   deployed in transport network environments where IP addressing is not 
   used in the forwarding plane, the ICC-based format for MEP 
   identification is used. When MPLS-TP is deployed in IP-based 
   environment, the IP-based MEP identification is used. 

   As a consequence, it is not possible to detect misconnections between 
   two MEGs monitored only for continuity as neither the OAM message 
   type nor OAM message content provides sufficient information to 
   disambiguate an invalid source. To expand:

   o For CC leaking into a CC monitored MEG - undetectable 

   o For CV leaking into a CC monitored MEG - presence of additional 
      Source MEP identifier allows detecting the fault 

   o For CC leaking into a CV monitored MEG - lack of additional Source 
      MEP identifier allows detecting the fault. 

   o For CV leaking into a CV monitored MEG - different Source MEP 
      identifier permits fault to be identified. 

   CC-V OAM packets MUST be transmitted at a regular, operator's 
   configurable, rate. The default CC-V transmission periods are 
   application dependent (see section 5.1.3). 

   Proactive CC-V OAM packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss 
   probability PHB" within a single network operator. This PHB is 
   configurable on network operator's basis. PHBs can be translated at 
   the network borders by the same function that translates it for user 
   data traffic. The implication is that CC-V fate shares with much of 
   the forwarding implementation, but not all aspects of PHB processing 
   are exercised. On demand tools are used for finer grained fault 
   finding.  

   In a bidirectional point-to-point transport path, when a MEP is 
   enabled to generate pro-active CC-V OAM packets with a configured 
   transmission rate, it also expects to receive pro-active CC-V OAM 
   packets from its peer MEP at the same transmission rate as a common 
   SLA applies to all components of the transport path. In a 
   unidirectional transport path (either point-to-point or point-to-
   multipoint), only the source MEP is enabled to generate CC-V OAM 
   packets and only the sink MEP is configured to expect these packets 
   at the configured rate. 

   MIPs, as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM, are 
   transparent to the pro-active CC-V information and forward these pro-
   active CC-V OAM packets as regular data packets. 

   It is desirable to not generate spurious alarms during initialization 
   or tear down; hence the following procedures are recommended. At 
   initialization, the MEP source function (generating pro-active CC-V 
   packets) should be enabled prior to the corresponding MEP sink 
   function (detecting continuity and connectivity defects).  When 
   disabling the CC-V proactive functionality, the MEP sink function 
   should be disabled prior to the corresponding MEP source function.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

5.1.1. Defects identified by CC-V 

   Pro-active CC-V functions allow a sink MEP to detect the defect 
   conditions described in the following sub-sections. For all of the 
   described defect cases, the sink MEP SHOULD notify the equipment 
   fault management process of the detected defect. 

5.1.1.1. Loss Of Continuity defect  

   When proactive CC-V is enabled, a sink MEP detects a loss of 
   continuity (LOC) defect when it fails to receive pro-active CC-V OAM 
   packets from the peer MEP. 

   o Entry criteria:  if no pro-active CC-V OAM packets from the peer 
      MEP (i.e. with the correct globally unique Source MEP identifier) 
      are received within the interval equal to 3.5 times the receiving 
      MEP's configured CC-V reception period. 

   o Exit criteria: a pro-active CC-V OAM packet from the peer MEP 
      (i.e. with the correct globally unique Source MEP identifier) is 
      received. 

5.1.1.2. Mis-connectivity defect 

   When a pro-active CC-V OAM packet is received, a sink MEP identifies 
   a mis-connectivity defect (e.g. mismerge, misconnection or unintended 
   looping) with its peer source MEP when the received packet carries an 
   incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier. 

   o Entry criteria: the sink MEP receives a pro-active CC-V OAM packet 
      with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier. 

   o Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active CC-V 
      OAM packet with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier 
      for an interval equal at least to 3.5 times the longest 
      transmission period of the pro-active CC-V OAM packets received 
      with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP identifier since this 
      defect has been raised. This requires the OAM message to self 
      identify the CC-V periodicity as not all MEPs can be expected to 
      have knowledge of all MEGs. 

5.1.1.3. Period Misconfiguration defect 

   If pro-active CC-V OAM packets are received with a correct globally 
   unique Source MEP identifier but with a transmission period different 
   than the locally configured reception period, then a CV period mis-
   configuration defect is detected.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   o Entry criteria: a MEP receives a CC-V pro-active packet with 
      correct globally unique Source MEP identifier but with a Period 
      field value different than its own CC-V configured transmission 
      period.  

   o Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active CC-V 
      OAM packet with a correct globally unique Source MEP identifier 
      and an incorrect transmission period for an interval equal at 
      least to 3.5 times the longest transmission period of the pro-
      active CC-V OAM packets received with a correct globally unique 
      Source MEP identifier and an incorrect transmission period since 
      this defect has been raised. 

5.1.2. Consequent action 

   A sink MEP that detects one of the defect conditions defined in 
   section 5.1.1 MUST perform the following consequent actions. 

   If a MEP detects an unexpected globally unique Source MEP Identifier, 
   it MUST block all the traffic (including also the user data packets) 
   that it receives from the misconnected transport path. 

   If a MEP detects LOC defect that is not caused by a period 
   mis-configuration, it SHOULD block all the traffic (including also 
   the user data packets) that it receives from the transport path, if 
   this consequent action has been enabled by the operator. 

   It is worth noticing that the OAM requirements document [12] 
   recommends that CC-V proactive monitoring is enabled on every MEG in 
   order to reliably detect connectivity defects. However, CC-V 
   proactive monitoring MAY be disabled by an operator on an MEG. In the 
   event of a misconnection between a transport path that is pro-
   actively monitored for CC-V and a transport path which is not, the 
   MEP of the former transport path will detect a LOC defect 
   representing a connectivity problem (e.g. a misconnection with a 
   transport path where CC-V proactive monitoring is not enabled) 
   instead of a continuity problem, with a consequent wrong traffic 
   delivering. For these reasons, the traffic block consequent action is 
   applied even when a LOC condition occurs. This block consequent 
   action MAY be disabled through configuration. This deactivation of 
   the block action may be used for activating or deactivating the 
   monitoring when it is not possible to synchronize the function 
   activation of the two peer MEPs. 

   If a MEP detects a LOC defect (section 5.1.1.1),  a mis-connectivity 
   defect (section 5.1.1.2) or a period misconfiguration defect (section

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   5.1.1.3), it MUST declare a signal fail condition at the transport 
   path level. 

5.1.3. Configuration considerations 

   At all MEPs inside a MEG, the following configuration information 
   needs to be configured when a proactive CC-V function is enabled: 

   o MEG ID; the MEG identifier to which the MEP belongs; 

   o MEP-ID; the MEP's own identity inside the MEG; 

   o list of peer MEPs inside the MEG. For a point-to-point MEG the 
      list would consist of the single peer MEP ID from which the OAM 
      packets are expected. In case of the root MEP of a p2mp MEG, the 
      list is composed by all the leaf MEP IDs inside the MEG. In case 
      of the leaf MEP of a p2mp MEG, the list is composed by the root 
      MEP ID (i.e. each leaf MUST know the root MEP ID from which it 
      expect to receive the CC-V OAM packets). 

   o PHB; it identifies the per-hop behaviour of CC-V packet. Proactive 
      CC-V packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability 
      PHB" previously configured within a single network operator. This 
      PHB is configurable on network operator's basis. PHBs can be 
      translated at the network borders.  

   o transmission rate; the default CC-V transmission periods are 
      application dependent (depending on whether they are used to 
      support fault management, performance monitoring, or protection 
      switching applications): 

        o Fault Management: default transmission period is 1s (i.e. 
          transmission rate of 1 packet/second). 

        o Performance Monitoring: default transmission period is 100ms 
          (i.e. transmission rate of 10 packets/second). Performance 
          monitoring is only relevant when the transport path is defect 
          free. CC-V contributes to the accuracy of PM statistics by 
          permitting the defect free periods to be properly 
          distinguished. 

        o Protection Switching: default transmission period is 3.33ms 
          (i.e. transmission rate of 300 packets/second), in order to 
          achieve sub-50ms the CC-V defect entry criteria should resolve 
          in less than 10msec, and complete a protection switch within a 
          subsequent period of 50 msec.

   It SHOULD be possible for the operator to configure these 
   transmission rates for all applications, to satisfy his internal 
   requirements. 

   Note that the reception period is the same as the configured 
   transmission rate. 

   For statically provisioned transport paths the above information are 
   statically configured; for dynamically established transport paths 
   the configuration information are signaled via the control plane. 

   The operator SHOULD be able to enable/disable some of the consequent 
   actions defined in section 5.1.2. 

5.2. Remote Defect Indication  

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) function, as required in section 
   2.2.9 of [12], is an indicator that is transmitted by a MEP to 
   communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal fail condition exists.  
   RDI is only used for bidirectional connections and is associated with 
   proactive CC-V activation. The RDI indicator is piggy-backed onto the 
   CC-V packet. 

   When a MEP detects a signal fail condition (e.g. in case of a 
   continuity or connectivity defect), it should begin transmitting an 
   RDI indicator to its peer MEP.  The RDI information will be included 
   in all pro-active CC-V packets that it generates for the duration of 
   the signal fail condition's existence. 

   A MEP that receives the packets with the RDI information should 
   determine that its peer MEP has encountered a defect condition 
   associated with a signal fail. 

   MIPs as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM are 
   transparent to the RDI indicator and forward these proactive CC-V 
   packets that include the RDI indicator as regular data packets, i.e. 
   the MIP should not perform any actions nor examine the indicator. 

   When the signal fail defect condition clears, the MEP should clear 
   the RDI indicator from subsequent transmission of pro-active CC-V 
   packets.  A MEP should clear the RDI defect upon reception of a pro-
   active CC-V packet from the source MEP with the RDI indicator 
   cleared.

   In order to support RDI indication, this may be a unique OAM message 
   or an OAM information element embedded in a CV message. In this case 
   the RDI transmission rate and PHB of the OAM packets carrying RDI 
   should be the same as that configured for CC-V. 

5.3. Alarm Reporting  

   The Alarm Reporting function, as required in section 2.2.8 of [12], 
   relies upon an Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) message used to suppress 
   alarms following detection of defect conditions at the server 
   (sub-)layer. 

   o A server MEP that detects a signal fail conditions in the server 
      (sub-)layer, will notify the MPLS-TP client (sub-)layer adaptation 
      function, which can generate packets with AIS information in a 
      direction opposite to its peers MEPs to allow the suppression of 
      secondary alarms at the MEP in the client (sub-)layer. 

   A server MEP is responsible for notifying the MPLS-TP layer network 
   adaptation function upon fault detection in the server layer network 
   to which the server MEP is associated. 

   Only the client layer adaptation function at an intermediate node 
   will issue MPLS-TP packets with AIS information. Upon receiving 
   notification of a signal fail condition the adaptation function 
   SHOULD immediately start transmitting periodic packets with AIS 
   information. These periodic packets, with AIS information, continue 
   to be transmitted until the signal fail condition is cleared. 

   Upon receiving a packet with AIS information an MPLS-TP MEP enters an 
   AIS defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity alarms 
   associated with its peer MEP. A MEP resumes loss of continuity alarm 
   generation upon detecting loss of continuity defect conditions in the 
   absence of AIS condition.

   For example, let's consider a fiber cut between LSR 1 and LSR 2 in 
   the reference network of Figure 3. Assuming that all the MEGs 
   described in Figure 3 have pro-active CC-V enabled, a LOC defect is 
   detected by the MEPs of Sec12 SME, PSN13 LME, PW1 PPSTME and PW1Z 
   PME, however in transport network only the alarm associate to the 
   fiber cut needs to be reported to NMS while all these secondary 
   alarms should be suppressed (i.e. not reported to the NMS or reported 
   as secondary alarms). 

   If the fiber cut is detected by the MEP in the physical layer (in 
   LSR2), LSR2 can generate the proper alarm in the physical layer and 
   suppress the secondary alarm associated with the LOC defect detected 
   on Sec12 SME. As both MEPs reside within the same node, this process 
   does not involve any external protocol exchange. Otherwise, if the 
   physical layer has not enough OAM capabilities to detect the fiber 
   cut, the MEP of Sec12 SME in LSR2 will report a LOC alarm. 

   In both cases, the MEP of Sec12 SME in LSR 2 notifies the adaptation 
   function for PSN13 LME that then generates AIS packets on the PSN13 
   LME in order to allow its MEP in LSR3 to suppress the LOC alarm. LSR3 
   can also suppress the secondary alarm on PW13 PPSTME because the MEP 
   of PW13 PPSTME resides within the same node as the MEP of PSN13 LME. 
   The MEP of PW13 PPSTME in LSR3 also notifies the adaptation function 
   for PW1Z PME that then generates AIS packets on PW1Z PME in order to 
   allow its MEP in LSRZ to suppress the LOC alarm. 

   The generation of AIS packets for each MEG in the client (sub-)layer 
   is configurable (i.e. the operator can enable/disable the AIS 
   generation). 

   AIS packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability PHB" 
   within a single network operator. This PHB is configurable on network 
   operator's basis. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with AIS information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support AIS functionality. 

5.4. Lock Reporting 

   The Lock Reporting function, as required in section 2.2.7 of [12], 
   relies upon a Locked Report (LKR) message used to suppress alarms 
   following administrative locking action in the server (sub-)layer. 

   A server MEP is responsible for notifying the MPLS-TP layer network 
   adaption function upon locked condition applied to the server layer 
   network to which the server MEP is associated.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   Only the client layer adaptation function at an intermediate node 
   will issue MPLS-TP packets with LKR information. Upon receiving 
   notification of a locked condition the adaptation function SHOULD 
   immediately start transmitting periodic packets with LKR information. 
   These periodic packets, with LKR information, will continue to be 
   transmitted until the locked condition is cleared. 

   Upon receiving a packet with LKR information an MPLS-TP MEP enters an 
   LKR defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity alarm 
   associated with its peer MEP. A MEP resumes loss of continuity alarm 
   generation upon detecting loss of continuity defect conditions in the 
   absence of LKR condition. 

   The generation of LKR packets is configurable in the server 
   (sub-)layer (i.e. the operator can enable/disable the LKR 
   generation). 

   LKR packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability PHB" 
   within a single network operator. This PHB is configurable on network 
   operator's basis. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with LKR information and therefore 
   does not require any information to support LKR functionality. 

5.5. Packet Loss Measurement  

   Packet Loss Measurement (LM) is one of the capabilities supported by 
   the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring (PM) function in order to 
   facilitate reporting of QoS information for a transport path as 
   required in section 2.2.11 of [12]. LM is used to exchange counter 
   values for the number of ingress and egress packets transmitted and 
   received by the transport path monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   Proactive LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets from 
   a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during the life time of the 
   transport path. Each MEP performs measurements of its transmitted and 
   received packets. These measurements are then transactionally 
   correlated with the peer MEP in the ME to derive the impact of packet 
   loss on a number of performance metrics for the ME in the MEG. The LM 
   transactions are issued such that the OAM packets will experience the 
   same queuing discipline as the measured traffic while transiting 
   between the MEPs in the ME. 

   For a MEP, near-end packet loss refers to packet loss associated with 
   incoming data packets (from the far-end MEP) while far-end packet

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   loss refers to packet loss associated with egress data packets 
   (towards the far-end MEP).  

5.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support proactive LM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the LM OAM packets originating from a MEP need be 
   configured as part of the LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM packets 
   should be transmitted with the same PHB class that the LM is intended 
   to measure. If that PHB is not an ordered aggregate where the 
   ordering constraint is all packets with the PHB being delivered in 
   order, LM can produce inconsistent results. 

5.6. Client Failure Indication  

   The Client Failure Indication (CSF) function, as required in section 
   2.2.10 of [12], is used to help process client defects and propagate 
   a client signal defect condition from the process associated with the 
   local attachment circuit where the defect was detected (typically the 
   source adaptation function for the local client interface) to the 
   process associated with the far-end attachment circuit (typically the 
   source adaptation function for the far-end client interface) for the 
   same transmission path in case the client of the transport path does 
   not support a native defect/alarm indication mechanism, e.g. AIS. 

   A source MEP starts transmitting a CSF indication to its peer MEP 
   when it receives a local client signal defect notification via its 
   local CSF function. Mechanisms to detect local client signal fail 
   defects are technology specific. 

   A sink MEP that has received a CSF indication report this condition 
   to its associated client process via its local CSF function. 
   Consequent actions toward the client attachment circuit are 
   technology specific. 

   Either there needs to be a 1:1 correspondence between the client and 
   the MEG, or when multiple clients are multiplexed over a transport 
   path, the CSF message requires additional information to permit the 
   client instance to be identified. 

5.6.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support CSF indication, the CSF transmission rate and PHB 
   of the CSF OAM message/information element should be configured as 
   part of the CSF configuration.

5.7. Packet Delay Measurement  

   Packet Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities supported by 
   the MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate reporting of QoS 
   information for a transport path as required in section 2.2.12 of 
   [12]. Specifically, pro-active DM is used to measure the long-term 
   packet delay and packet delay variation in the transport path 
   monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   Proactive DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets from a 
   MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a configurable time 
   interval.  

   Pro-active DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing all 
      the required information to facilitate one-way packet delay and/or 
      one-way packet delay variation measurements at the peer MEP. Note 
      that this requires synchronized precision time at either MEP by 
      means outside the scope of this framework. 

   o Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its peer 
      MEP, which replies with a DM OAM packet as a DM response. The 
      request/response DM OAM packets containing all the required 
      information to facilitate two-way packet delay and/or two-way 
      packet delay variation measurements from the viewpoint of the 
      source MEP. 

5.7.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support pro-active DM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the DM OAM packets originating from a MEP need be 
   configured as part of the DM provisioning procedures. DM OAM packets 
   should be transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).  

6. OAM Functions for on-demand monitoring 

   In contrast to proactive monitoring, on-demand monitoring is 
   initiated manually and for a limited amount of time, usually for 
   operations such as e.g. diagnostics to investigate into a defect 
   condition. 


 
 
Busi et al.           Expires September 5, 2010              [Page 33] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   On-demand monitoring covers a combination of "in service" and "out-of 
   service" monitoring functions. The control and measurement 
   implications are: 

   1. A MEG can be directed to perform an "on demand" functions at 
      arbitrary times in the lifetime of a transport path. 

   2. "out of service" monitoring functions may require a-priori 
      configuration of both MEPs and intermediate nodes in the MEG 
      (e.g., data plane loopback) and the issuance of notifications into 
      client layers of the transport path being removed from service 
      (e.g., lock-reporting) 

   3. The measurements resulting from on-demand monitoring are typically 
      harvested in real time, as these are frequently craftsperson 
      initiated and attended. These do not necessarily require different 
      harvesting mechanisms that that for harvesting proactive 
      monitoring telemetry. 

6.1. Connectivity Verification  

   In order to preserve network resources, e.g. bandwidth, processing 
   time at switches, it may be preferable to not use proactive CC-V. In 
   order to perform fault management functions, network management may 
   invoke periodic on-demand bursts of on-demand CV packets, as required 
   in section 2.2.3 of [12]. 

   Use of on-demand CV is dependent on the existence of either a bi-
   directional MEG, or the availability of an out of band return path 
   because it requires the ability for target MIPs and MEPs to direct 
   responses to the originating MEPs. 

   An additional use of on-demand CV would be to detect and locate a 
   problem of connectivity when a problem is suspected or known based on 
   other tools.  In this case the functionality will be triggered by the 
   network management in response to a status signal or alarm 
   indication. 

   On-demand CV is based upon generation of on-demand CV packets that 
   should uniquely identify the MEG that is being checked.  The on-
   demand functionality may be used to check either an entire MEG (end-
   to-end) or between a MEP to a specific MIP. This functionality may 
   not be available for associated bidirectional transport paths, as the 
   MIP may not have a return path to the source MEP for the on-demand CV 
   transaction. 


 
 
Busi et al.           Expires September 5, 2010              [Page 34] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   On-demand CV may generate a one-time burst of on-demand CV packets, 
   or be used to invoke periodic, non-continuous, bursts of on-demand CV 
   packets.  The number of packets generated in each burst is 
   configurable at the MEPs, and should take into account normal packet-
   loss conditions.  

   When invoking a periodic check of the MEG, the source MEP should 
   issue a burst of on-demand CV packets that uniquely identifies the 
   MEG being verified.  The number of packets and their transmission 
   rate should be pre-configured and known to both the source MEP and 
   the target MEP or MIP.  The source MEP should use the mechanisms 
   defined in sections 3.3 and 3.4 when sending an on-demand CV packet 
   to a target MEP or target MIP respectively. The target MEP/MIP shall 
   return a reply on-demand CV packet for each packet received.  If the 
   expected number of on-demand CV reply packets is not received at 
   source MEP, the LOC defect state is entered. 

   On demand CV should have the ability to carry padding such that a 
   variety of MTU sizes can be originated to verify the MTU capacity of 
   the transport path. 

6.1.1. Configuration considerations 

   For on-demand CV the MEP should support the configuration of the 
   number of packets to be transmitted/received in each burst of 
   transmissions and their packet size. The transmission rate should be 
   configured between the different nodes. 

   In addition, when the CV packet is used to check connectivity toward 
   a target MIP, the number of hops to reach the target MIP should be 
   configured. 

   The PHB of the on-demand CV packets should be configured as well. 
   This permits the verification of correct operation of QoS queuing as 
   well as connectivity. 

6.2. Packet Loss Measurement  

   On-demand Packet Loss Measurement (LM) is one of the capabilities 
   supported by the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring function in order to 
   facilitate diagnostic of QoS performance for a transport path, as 
   required in section 2.2.11 of [12]. As proactive LM, on-demand LM is 
   used to exchange counter values for the number of ingress and egress 
   packets transmitted and received by the transport path monitored by a 
   pair of MEPs.   


 
 
Busi et al.           Expires September 5, 2010              [Page 35] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   On-demand LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets from 
   a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a pre-defined monitoring 
   period. Each MEP performs measurements of its transmitted and 
   received packets. These measurements are then correlated evaluate the 
   packet loss performance metrics of the transport path. 

6.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand LM, the beginning and duration of the 
   LM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with the LM 
   OAM packets originating from a MEP must be configured as part of the 
   on-demand LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM packets should be 
   transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet loss 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered Aggregates 
   (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the monitored transport path for the relevant 
   network domain(s).  

6.3. Diagnostic Tests  

6.3.1. Throughput Estimation 

   Throughput estimation is an on-demand out-of-service function, as 
   required in section 2.2.5 of [12], that allows verifying the 
   bandwidth/throughput of an MPLS-TP transport path (LSP or PW) before 
   it is put in-service. 

   Throughput estimation is performed between MEPs and can be performed 
   in one-way or two way modes. 

   This test is performed by sending OAM test packets at increasing rate 
   (up to the theoretical maximum), graphing the percentage of OAM test 
   packets received and reporting the rate at which OAM test packets 
   start begin dropped. In general, this rate is dependent on the OAM 
   test packet size. 

   When configured to perform such tests, a MEP source inserts OAM test 
   packets with test information with specified throughput, packet size 
   and transmission patterns. 

   For one way test, remote MEP sink receives the OAM test packets and 
   calculates the packet loss. For two way test, the remote MEP 
   loopbacks the OAM test packets back to original MEP and the local MEP 
   sink calculates the packet loss.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

6.3.1.1. Configuration considerations 

   Throughput estimation is an out-of-service tool. The diagnosed MEG 
   should be put into a Lock status before the diagnostic test is 
   started. 

   An MEG can be put into a Lock status either via NMS action or using 
   the Lock Instruct OAM tool as defined in section 6.6. 

   At the transmitting MEP, provisioning is required for a test signal 
   generator, which is associated with the MEP. At a receiving MEP, 
   provisioning is required for a test signal detector which is 
   associated with the MEP.   

   A MIP is transparent to the OAM test packets sent for throught 
   estimation and therefore does not require any provisioning to support 
   MPLS-TP throghtput estimation. 

6.3.2. Data plane Loopback 

   Data plane loopback is an out-of-service function, as required in 
   section 2.2.5 of [12], that permits traffic originated at the ingress 
   of a transport path to be looped back to the point of origin by an 
   interface at either an intermediate node or a terminating node. 

   If the loopback function is to be performed at an intermediate node 
   it is only applicable to co-routed bi-directional paths. If the 
   loopback is to be performed end to end, it is applicable to both co-
   routed bi-directional or associated bi-directional paths. 

   Where a node implements data plane loopback capability and whether it 
   implements more than one point is implementation dependent. 

6.4. Route Tracing 

   It is often necessary to trace a route covered by an MEG from a 
   source MEP to the sink MEP including all the MIPs in-between after 
   e.g., provisioning an MPLS-TP transport path or for trouble shooting 
   purposes, it. 

   The route tracing function, as required in section 2.2.4 of [12], is 
   providing this functionality. Based on the fate sharing requirement 
   of OAM flows, i.e. OAM packets receive the same forwarding treatment 
   as data packet, route tracing is a basic means to perform 
   connectivity verification and, to a much lesser degree, continuity 
   check. For this function to work properly, a return path must be 
   present. 
 
 
Busi et al.           Expires September 5, 2010              [Page 37] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   Route tracing might be implemented in different ways and this 
   document does not preclude any of them. 

   Route tracing should always discover the full list of MIPs and of the 
   peer MEPs. In case a defect exist, the route trace function needs to 
   be able to detect it and stop automatically returning the incomplete 
   list of OAM entities that it was able to trace. 

6.4.1. Configuration considerations 

   The configuration of the route trace function must at least support 
   the setting of the number of trace attempts before it gives up. 

6.5. Packet Delay Measurement 

   Packet Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities supported by 
   the MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate reporting of QoS 
   information for a transport path, as required in section 2.2.12 of 
   [12]. Specifically, on-demand DM is used to measure packet delay and 
   packet delay variation in the transport path monitored by a pair of 
   MEPs during a pre-defined monitoring period.   

   On-Demand DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets from a 
   MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from the peer MEP 
   (if a bidirectional transport path) during a configurable time 
   interval.  

   On-demand DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing all 
      the required information to facilitate one-way packet delay and/or 
      one-way packet delay variation measurements at the peer MEP. 

   o Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its peer 
      MEP, which replies with an DM OAM packet as a DM response. The 
      request/response DM OAM packets containing all the required 
      information to facilitate two-way packet delay and/or two-way 
      packet delay variation measurements from the viewpoint of the 
      source MEP. 

6.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand DM, the beginning and duration of the 
   DM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with the DM 
   OAM packets originating from a MEP need be configured as part of the 
   LM provisioning procedures. DM OAM packets should be transmitted with 
   the PHB that yields the lowest packet delay performance among the PHB

   Scheduling Classes or Ordering Aggregates (see RFC 3260 [15]) in the 
   monitored transport path for the relevant network domain(s). 

   In order to verify different performances between long and short 
   packets (e.g., due to the processing time), it SHOULD be possible for 
   the operator to configure of the on-demand OAM DM packet. 

6.6. Lock Instruct 

   Lock Instruct (LKI) function, as required in section 2.2.6 of [12], 
   is a command allowing a MEP to instruct the peer MEP(s) to put the 
   MPLS-TP transport path into a locked condition. 

   This function allows single-side provisioning for administratively 
   locking (and unlocking) an MPLS-TP transport path. 

   Note that it is also possible to administratively lock (and unlock) 
   an MPLS-TP transport path using two-side provisioning, where the NMS 
   administratively put both MEPs into ad administrative lock condition. 
   In this case, the LKI function is not required/used. 

6.6.1. Locking a transport path 

   A MEP, upon receiving a single-side administrative lock command from 
   NMS, sends an LKI request OAM packet to its peer MEP(s). It also puts 
   the MPLS-TP transport path into a locked and notify its client 
   (sub-)layer adaptation function upon the locked condition. 

   A MEP, upon receiving an LKI request from its peer MEP, can accept or 
   not the instruction and MUST reply to the peer MEP with an LKI reply 
   OAM packet indicating whether it has accepted or not the instruction. 

   If the lock instruction has been accepted, it also puts the MPLS-TP 
   transport path into a locked and notify its client (sub-)layer 
   adaptation function upon the locked condition. 

   Note that if the client (sub-)layer is also MPLS-TP, Lock Reporting 
   (LKR) generation at the client MPLS-TP (sub-)layer is started, as 
   described in section 5.4. 

6.6.2. Unlocking a transport path 

   A MEP, upon receiving a single-side administrative unlock command 
   from NMS, sends an LKI removal request OAM packet to its peer MEP(s).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework               March 2010 
    

   The peer MEP, upon receiving an LKI removal request, can accept or 
   not the removal instruction and MUST reply with an LKI removal reply 
   OAM packet indicating whether it has accepted or not the instruction. 

   If the lock removal instruction has been accepted, it also clears the 
   locked condition on the MPLS-TP transport path and notify this event 
   to its client (sub-)layer adaptation function. 

   The MEP that has initiated the LKI clear procedure, upon receiving a 
   positive LKI removal reply, also clears the locked condition on the 
   MPLS-TP transport path and notify this event to its client 
   (sub-)layer adaptation function. 

   Note that if the client (sub-)layer is also MPLS-TP, Lock Reporting 
   (LKR) generation at the client MPLS-TP (sub-)layer is terminated, as 
   described in section 5.4. 

7. Security Considerations 

   A number of security considerations are important in the context of 
   OAM applications.  

   OAM traffic can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, 
   performance data and details about e.g. the network topology. The 
   nature of OAM data therefore suggests to have some form of 
   authentication, authorization and encryption in place. This will 
   prevent unauthorized access to vital equipment and it will prevent 
   third parties from learning about sensitive information about the 
   transport network. 

   Mechanisms that the framework does not specify might be subject to 
   additional security considerations. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   No new IANA considerations.
