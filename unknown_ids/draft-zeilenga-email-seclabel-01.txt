Internet-Draft               email-seclabel                  August 2011


1.  Introduction

   A security label, sometimes referred to as a confidentiality label,
   is a structured representation of the sensitivity of a piece of
   information.  A security label is used in conjunction with a
   clearance, a structured representation of what information
   sensitivities a person (or other entity) is authorized to access, and
   a security policy to control access to each piece of information.
   For instance, an email message could have a "EXAMPLE SECRET" label,
   and hence requiring the sender and the receiver to have a clearance
   granting access to "EXAMPLE SECRET" labeled information.  X.841
   [X.841] provides a discussion of security labels, clearances, and
   security policy.

   A display marking is a textual representation of the sensitivity of a
   piece of information.  For instance, "EXAMPLE SECRET" is a textual
   representation of the sensitivity.  A security policy can be used to
   generate display markings from security labels.

   Sensitivity-based authorization is used in networks which operate
   under a set of information classification rules, such as in
   government military agency networks.  The standardized formats for
   security labels, clearances, and security policy are generalized and
   do have application in non-government networks.

   This document describes a protocol for conveying the sensitivity of a
   electronic mail message [RFC5322], as a whole.  In particular, this
   document describes a header field SIO-Label to carry a security
   label, a display marking, and display colors.

2.  Relationship to Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME

   While it may be possible to utilize the protocol described in this
   document concurrently with Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME
   (ESS) [RFC2634], this protocol is generally viewed as an alternative
   to ESS.

   It is noted that in ESS, the label applies to MIME [RFC2045] content,
   where in this protocol the label applies to the message as a whole.

   It is also noted that in ESS, labels are securely bound to the MIME
   content through the use of digital signatures, where, in this
   protocol, labels are not security bound to the message.  This
   protocol is designed for use where securely binding the label to the
   labeled information, at least through sender signing, is not
   necessary but may well be inappropriate, such in deployment where
   labels are replaced when crossing between security domains.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   A Mail User Agent (MUAs) originating a message can, if so configured,
   offer the user with a menu of sensitivities to choose from and, upon
   selection, insert the display marking, foreground and background
   colors, and security label parameters associated with that selection
   into the SIO-Label header field of the message.

   Mail Submission Agents (MSAs), Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs), and Mail
   Delivery Agents (MDAs) then can, if so configured, use the provided
   (or lack thereof) sensitivity information in determining whether to
   accept, forward, or otherwise act on the message as submitted.  MTAs
   can, if so configured, modify the sensitivity information of the
   message, such as replacing the security label with an equivalent
   security label of a different policy.

   Receiving MUAs which implement this extension SHALL prominently
   display the display marking conveyed in the header field.  The
   display marking SHOULD be displayed using the foreground and
   background colors conveyed in the header field.

   MUAs are not expected to make authorization decisions based upon
   values of the SIO-Label header field.

5.  The SIO-Label header field

   The header field name is "SIO-Label" and its content is a set of key/
   value pairs, each referred to as a parameter.

   The marking parameter contains a display string for use by
   implementations which are unable or unwilling to utilize the
   governing security policy to generate display markings.

   The fgcolor and bgcolor parameters contain the foreground and
   background colors, respectively, for use in colorizing the display
   marking string.  Their values are RGB colors in hexadecimal format
   (e.g., "#ff0000"), or one of the CSS color names (e.g., "red") given
   in named-color type below (the 16 HTML4 colors + "orange")
   [CSS3-Color].  The default foreground color is black.  The default
   background is white.  The fgcolor and bgcolor parameters SHALL be
   absent if the marking parameter is absent.

   The type parameter is either the string ":ess" or the string ":x411"
   or a URI [RFC3986] denoting the type of label and its encoding as
   held contained in the label parameter.  The type parameter SHALL be
   present if the label parameter is present.

   The string ":ess" indicates the label parameter value is the base64
   [RFC4648] encoding of the BER [X.690] encoding of an ESS security
   label [RFC2634].  The label parameter SHALL be present if the type
   parameter is present.

   ESS Label Example:
   SIO-Label: marking="EXAMPLE SECRET";
   fgcolor=black; bgcolor=red;
   type=":ess" label="MQYCAQIGASk="

   The URI ":x411" indicates the label parameter value is the base64
   [RFC4648] encoding of the BER [X.690] encoding of an X.411 security
   label [X.411].  The label parameter SHALL be present if the type
   parameter is present.

   X.411 Label Example:
   SIO-Label: marking="EXAMPLE SECRET";
   fgcolor=black; bgcolor=red;
   type=":x411" label="MQYCAQIGASk="

6.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234].  Terms not defined here are
   taken from [RFC5322].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add, as detailed below, the SIO-Label header
   field to the "Permanent Message Header Field Registry", defined by
   Registration Procedures for Message Header Fields [RFC3864].

   Header field name: SIO-Label
   Applicable protocol: mail [RFC5322]
   Status: standard
   Author/change controller: IETF (iesg@ietf.org)
   Specification document(s): [[anchor7: this document]]

8.  Security Considerations

   Security labels and display markings are used to express the
   sensitivity of a piece of information.  This document describes how
   to convey the security label and display marking expressing the
   sensitivity of an email message, as a whole, including its headers
   and body.  This extension does not provide a means to express the
   sensitivity of portions of an email message, such as the possibly
   different sensitivities of various MIME parts that the message may be
   composed of.

   This extension is intended to be used in environments/situations
   where it not necessary for the security label and other sensitivity
   information to be securely bound to message through use of digital
   signatures, and hence this document does not detail how security
   labels digital signatures could be used to securely bind the security
   label to the message.

   In environments/situations where security labels are used to make
   authorization decisions, MTAs making those authorization decisions
   are to ensure appropriate data confidential and integrity protection
   services are in place, such as requiring use of TLS [RFC5246] in
   email protocols such as SMTP [RFC5321] and IMAP [RFC3501].
