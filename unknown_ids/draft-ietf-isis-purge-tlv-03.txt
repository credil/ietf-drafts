             Purge Originator Identification TLV for IS-IS
                      draft-ietf-isis-purge-tlv-03

Abstract

   At present an IS-IS purge does not contain any information
   identifying the Intermediate System (IS) that generates the purge.
   This makes it difficult to locate the source IS.

   To address this issue, this document defines a TLV to be added to
   purges to record the system ID of the IS generating it.  Since normal
   LSP flooding does not change LSP contents, this TLV should propagate
   with the purge.

Internet-Draft     Purge Originator Identification TLV         June 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS [ISO 10589] routing protocol has been widely used in large-
   scale IP networks because of its strong scalability and fast
   convergence.

   The IS-IS protocol floods purges throughout an area, regardless of
   which IS initiated the purge.  If a network operator would like to
   investigate the cause of the purge, it is difficult to determine the
   origin of the purge.  At present the IS-IS protocol has no mechanism
   to locate the originator of a purge.  To address this problem, this
   document defines a TLV to be added to purges to record the system ID
   of the IS generating the purge.

   Field experience has observed several circumstances where an IS can
   improperly generate a purge.  These are all due to implementation
   deficiencies or implementations that predate [ISO TC1] and generate a
   purge when they receive a corrupted LSP.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The Purge Originator Identification TLV

   This document defines a TLV to be included in purges.  If an IS
   generates a purge, it SHOULD include this TLV in the purge with its
   own system ID.  If an IS receives a purge that does not include this
   TLV, then it SHOULD add this TLV with both its own system ID and the
   system ID of the IS that it received the purge from.

   This allows ISs receiving purges to log the system ID of the
   originator, or the upstream source of the purge.  This makes it much
   easier for the network administrator to locate the origin of the
   purge and thus the cause of the purge.  Similarly, this TLV is
   helpful to developers in lab situations.

   The Purge Originator Identification TLV is defined as:

   CODE - 13

   LENGTH - total length of the value field.

   VALUE -

      Number of system IDs carried in this TLV (1 octet) -- Only the
      values 1 and 2 are defined.

      System ID of the Intermediate System that inserted this TLV.

      System ID of the Intermediate System that the purge was received
      from. (optional)


4.  Using the Dynamic Hostname TLV in Purges

   This document also extends the use of the Dynamic hostname TLV (type
   137) [RFC5301].  This TLV MAY also be included in purges.  This will
   further aid in the rapid identification of the system that generated
   the purge.

   Implementations SHOULD include the Purge Originator Identification
   TLV in addition to the Dynamic hostname TLV.


5.  Security Considerations

   If the Purge Originator Identification TLV or the Dynamic hostname
   TLV is used in conjunction with IS-IS authentication mechanisms
   [RFC5304][RFC5310], the purge LSP is constructed or modified as
   follows.  First, the original contents of the LSP are removed,
   leaving only the LSP header, then the Purge Originator Identification
   TLV and/or the Dynamic hostname TLV are added, and then the IS-IS
   authentication TLV is added.

   Legacy systems that implement [RFC5304] or [RFC5310] MUST discard
   purges with these additional TLVs.  This is not thought to be a
   significant operational issue as the loss of purges is typically not
   critical.


6.  Functional Changes

   This document amends the behavior specified in [RFC5301], [RFC5304]
   and [RFC5310].  ISs that receive purges with the Purge Originator
   Identification TLV or the Dynamic hostname TLV with valid
   authentication MUST NOT discard the PDU and SHOULD process it
   normally.  The Purge Originator Identification TLV or Dynamic
   hostname TLV MUST NOT be removed from the purge prior to propagation.
   If multiple purges are received for the same LSP fragment, then the
   implementation MAY propagate any one of the purges.

7.  IANA Considerations

   RFC EDITOR NOTE: This section to be removed upon publication.

   This document requests that IANA assign a code point for this TLV
   from the IS-IS 'TLV Codepoints Registry'.
