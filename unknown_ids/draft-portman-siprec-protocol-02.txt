Internet-Draft               SIPREC Protocol                January 2011


1.  Introduction

   Communication session recording requires establishment of a recording
   session (RS) between a session recording client (SRC) and session
   recording server (SRS).  The overall architecture for media recording
   is described in the architecture draft [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture]

   The SIPREC Requirements [I-D.ietf-siprec-req] list a set of
   requirements that need to be met by session recording protocols.  SIP
   is chosen to be the protocol to establish the recording session to
   deliver recorded media to the session recording server.  Additional
   SIP extensions are specified in this document to meet some of the
   requirements outlined in the requirements draft.

   In order to describe the recorded media and the communication
   sessions involved, a metadata model is described in
   [I-D.ram-siprec-metadata] to deliver additional information shared
   between SRC and SRS.


2.  Definitions

   The core SIPREC definitions are taken from the requirements document
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-req].

   Session Recording Server (SRS)  A Session Recording Server (SRS) is a
      SIP User Agent (UA) that is a specialized media server or
      collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An SRS is
      a logical function that typically archives media for extended
      durations of time and provides interfaces for search and retrieval
      of the archived media.  An SRS is typically implemented as a
      multi-port device that is capable of receiving media from several
      sources simultaneously.  An SRS is typically also the sink of the
      recorded session metadata.

   Session Recording Client (SRC)  A Session Recording Client (SRC) is a
      SIP User Agent (UA) that acts as the source of the recorded media,
      sending it to the SRS.  An SRC is a logical function.  Its
      capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical
      devices.  In practice, an SRC could be a personal device (such as
      a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border
      Controller (SBC) or a SIP Media Server (MS) integrated with an
      Application Server (AS).  This specification defines the term SRC
      such that all such SIP entities can be generically addressed under
      one definition.  The SRC itself or another entity working on its
      behalf (such as a SIP Application Server) may act as the source of
      the recording metadata.

   Communication Session (CS)  A session created between two or more SIP
      User Agents (UAs) that is the target for recording.

   Recording Session (RS)  The SIP session created between an SRC and
      SRS for the purpose of recording a Communication Session.

      Figure 1 pictorially represents the relationship between a
      Recording Session and Communication Session.

3.  Scope

   The scope of the SIPREC protocol includes the establishment of the
   recording sessions and the reporting of the metadata, and extensions
   to the communication sessions.

   The following items, which is not an exhaustive list, do not
   represent the SIPREC protcol itself and are considered out of the
   scope of the SIPREC protcol:

   o  Recording policies that determine whether the CS should be
      recorded

   o  Retention policies that determine how long a recording is stored

   o  Searching and accessing the recorded media and metadata

   o  Delivering recording session metadata through non-SIP mechanism


4.  Overview of operations

   This section is informative and provides a description of SIPREC
   operations.

   As mentioned in the architecture document
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture], there are a couple of types of call
   flows based on the location of the Session Recording Client.  The
   following sample call flows provide a quick overview of the
   operations between the SRC and the SRS.

4.1.  Delivering recorded media

   When the SRC is deployed as a B2BUA, the SRC can route call requests
   from UA(A) to UA(B).  As a SIP B2BUA, the SRC has access to the SDP
   and therefore can manipulate the media path between the user agents.
   When the SRC is aware that it should be recording the conversation,
   the SRC may bridge the media between UA(A) and UA(B).  The SRC then
   establishes the Recording Session with the SRS and sends replicated
   media towards the SRS.

   An endpoint can act as the SRC, and in this case may establish the
   Recording Session to the SRS.  Since the endpoint has access to the
   media in the communication session, the endpoint can send replicated
   media towards the SRS.

   The following basic call flow shows the SRC establishing a recording
   session towards the SRS.  The call flow is essentially identical when

   the SRC is a B2BUA or as the endpoint itself.

   A conference focus may also act as an SRC since it has access to all
   the media from each conference participant.  In this example, a user
   agent may REFER the conference focus to the SRS, and the SRC may
   choose to mix media streams from all participants as a single media
   stream towards the SRS.  In order to tell the conference focus to
   start a recording session to the SRS, the user agent can include the
   srs feature tag in the Refer-To header as per [RFC4508].

4.2.  Delivering recording metadata

   Certain metadata, such as the attributes of the recorded media
   stream, are already included in the SDP of the recording session.
   This information is reused as part of the metadata.  The SRC may
   update or add additional metadata about recorded media streams in
   requests such as INVITE, reINVITE, and UPDATE in the Recording
   Session.

   The rest of the metadata will be delivered as content.  Metadata can
   also be represented as a stream of events.  There are 4 ways to
   transport metadata events as outlined in the architecture document:

   SIP INVITE Content: for a simple call recording use case where no
   mid-dialog events are required to be delivered after the RS is
   established, the SIP INVITE may include content for all the metadata
   needed for the call.

   SIP INFO Package: metadata can be provided as an INFO package
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-info-events] and sent as mid-dialog messages within
   the recording session.

          Figure 4: Delivering metadata via SIP INFO


   [OPEN ISSUE: is Event Package desired?]

   Event Package: Metadata can also be conveyed from the SRC to the SRS
   using the SIP event notification mechanism [RFC3265].  Using a
   subscription allows the SRC to deliver metadata to the SRS when the
   lifecycles of the CS and RS are different.  This also allows the SRC
   to deliver session metadata and recorded media separately, for
   example, an SRS that reports metadata for multiple recording sessions
   as a single subscription.

   Non-SIP transport: In some cases session metadata can be conveyed
   through non-SIP mechanism such as HTTP or JTAPI.  These non-SIP
   mechanisms are considered out of the scope of the SIPREC protocol,
   however, it is envisioned that a link with a URI can be provided in
   the recording session INVITE message so that the SRS can access the
   session metadata via the URI provided that the SRS supports the type
   of URI.

5.  SIP Extensions

   The following sections describe SIP extensions for the recording
   protocol.

   The From header must contain the identity of the SRC.  Participants
   information is not recorded in the From or To header; they are
   included in the metadata information.

   Note that a recording session does not have to have live within the
   scope of a single communication session.  As outline in REQ-005 of
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-req], the recording session can be established in
   the absence of a communication session.  In this case, the SRC must
   offer an SDP with zero m= lines.

   Recorded media from multiple communication sessions may be handled in
   a single recording session.  The SRC provides a reference of each
   recorded media stream to the metadata described in the next section.

   The SRC must be able to accept re-INVITE from SRS with the updated
   SDP as part of the session timer mechanism.

5.1.  Callee Capabilities Extensions for SIP Recording

   This section discusses how the callee capabilities defined in
   [RFC3840] can be extended for SIP call recording.

   SIP Callee Capabilities defines feature tags which are used to
   represent characteristics and capabilities of a UA.  From RFC 3840:

      "Capability and characteristic information about a UA is carried
      as parameters of the Contact header field.  These parameters can
      be used within REGISTER requests and responses, OPTIONS responses,
      and requests and responses that create dialogs (such as INVITE)."

   Note that feature tags are also used in dialog modifying requests and
   responses such as re-INVITE and responses to a re-INVITE, and UPDATE.
   The 'isfocus' feature tag, defined in [RFC4579] is similar
   semantically to this case: it indicates that the UA is acting as a
   SIP conference focus, and is performing a specific action (mixing) on
   the resulting media stream.  This information is available from
   OPTIONS queries, dialog package notifications, and the SIP
   registration event package.

   We propose the definition of two new feature tags: 'src' and 'srs'.

Internet-Draft               SIPREC Protocol                January 2011


5.1.1.  src Feature Tag

   The 'src' feature tag is used in Contact URIs by the Session
   Recording Client (SRC) related to recording sessions.  A Session
   Recording Server uses the presence of this feature tag in dialog
   creating and modifying requests and responses to confirm that the
   dialog being created is for the purpose of a Recording Session.  In
   addition, a registrar could discover that a UA is an SRC based on the
   presence of this feature tag in a registration.  Other SIP Recording
   extensions and behaviors can be triggered by the presence of this
   feature tag.

   Note that we could use a single feature tag, such as 'recording' used
   by either an SRC or SRS to identify that the session is a recording
   session.  However, due to the differences in functionality and
   behavior between an SRC and SRS, using only one feature tag for both
   is not ideal.  For instance, if a routing mistake resulted in a
   request from a SRC being routed back to another SRC, if only one
   feature tag were defined, they would not know right away about the
   error and could become confused.  With separate feature tags, they
   would realize the error immediately and terminate the session.  Also,
   call logs would clearly show the routing error.

5.1.2.  srs Feature Tag

   The 'srs' feature tag is used in Contact URIs by the Session
   Recording Server (SRS) related to recording sessions.  A Session
   Recording Client uses the presence of this feature tag in dialog
   creating and modifying requests and responses to confirm that the
   dialog being created is for the purpose of a Recording Session
   (REQ-30).  In addition, a registrar could discover that a UA is an
   SRS based on the presence of this feature tag in a registration.
   Other SIP Recording extensions and behaviors can be triggered by the
   presence of this feature tag.

   To ensure a recording session is redirected to an SRS, an SRC can
   utilize the SIP Caller Preferences extensions, defined in [RFC3841].
   The presence of a Accept-Contact: *;sip.srs allows a UA to request
   that the INVITE be routed to an SRS.  Note that to be completely
   sure, the SRC would need to include a Require: prefs header field
   field in the request.

5.2.  SDP handling

   SRC can include one or more media streams to the SRS.  The SRS must
   respond with the same number of media descriptors in the SDP body of
   the 200 OK.




Portman, et al.           Expires July 21, 2011                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               SIPREC Protocol                January 2011


   The SRC should use a=sendonly attribute as the SRC does not expect to
   receive media from the SRS.  As SRS only receives RTP streams from
   SRS, the 200 OK response will normally contain SDP with a=recvonly
   attribute.

   Since the SRC may send recorded media of different participants (or
   even mixed streams) to the SRS, the SDP must provide a label on each
   media stream in order to identify the recorded stream with the rest
   of the metadata.  The a=label attribute [RFC4574] will be used to
   identify each recorded media stream, and the label name will be used
   as the reference for the metadata.  Note that a participant may have
   multiple streams (audio and video) and each stream is labeled
   separately.

5.3.  Metadata

   The format of the full metadata will be described as part of the
   mechanism in [I-D.ram-siprec-metadata].

   As mentioned in the previous section, the SDP of the recording
   session is the metadata for all recorded media streams.  The label
   attribute contains a reference to the rest of the metadata
   information.

   For all basic metadata information such as communication session,
   participants, call identifiers and direction, they can be included in
   the initial INVITE request sent by the SRC.  Metadata can be included
   as content in the INVITE request.  A new "disposition-type" of

5.3.1.  Delivering Metadata as a stream of events

   Recording metadata can delivered as a stream of events.  For this
   case, the metadata events is reported as SIP INFO messages within the
   recording session.  INFO Package is chosen as the mechanism because
   the metadata events does not always have to be associated with
   changes to the recorded media that requires the use of a reINVITE.
   For example, when a new participant is joined to a recorded
   conference and the SRS is receiving the recorded media as a mixed
   audio stream, then there is no need to send a reINVITE update the
   recorded media; an INFO message with the necessary metadata to
   describe the new participant is sufficient information for the SRS.

   The Info Package name is "recording-session".  This name is used in
   both the Info-Package header as well as the Recv-Info header fields.

   The SRS must set the Recv-Info header to indicate that it is willing
   to receive INFO requests for Info Package recording-session.  The SRC
   is not required to set the Recv-Info header since it does not expect
   to receive any Info Package from the SRS.

   There is only a single payload type "application/rs-metadata" defined
   for the Info Package.  Similar to the metadata format for INVITE
   requests, the metadata format is defined in
   [I-D.ram-siprec-metadata].

   This Info Package does not impose any rate limit or throttling
   mechansim for the stream of metadata events.  A recording session is
   not expect to emit a high rate of metadata events, however, there are
   scenarios where there can be short bursts metadata events generated.
   For example, when a scheduled conference is being recorded, there can
   be a burst of participants joining the conference at the scheduled
   time and hence a burst of metadata update to the communication
   session.

5.3.1.1.  Example - indication for which the SRS is willing to receive
          INFO Package

   The SRC initiates a recording session and indicates that it is the
   SRC.

5.4.  Recording Pause and Resume

   To temporarily discontinue streaming and collection of recorded media
   from the SRC to the SRS, the SRC must send a reINVITE and set
   a=inactive for each recorded media stream to be paused.

   To resume streaming and collection of recorded media, the SRC must
   send a reINVITE and set a=sendonly for each recorded media stream to
   resume.

   Note that when a media stream in the CS is muted/unmuted, this
   information may conveyed in the metadata by the SRC.  The SRC should
   not modify the recorded media stream with a=inactive for mute since
   this operation is reserved for pausing the RS media.

8.  Error Handling

   For handling errors with session establishment of the recording
   session, error handling of a standard SIP dialog applies.

   For handling errors with the metadata content such as syntactic or
   semantic errors, it is possible to introduce another Info content as
   a response to each metadata content sent by the SRS in order to allow
   the SRS to posivitively or negatively acknowledge each metadata
   content.  [TBD - need to sync with metadata draft]

   Options parameters: none

9.3.  Info Package

   This document registers a new INFO package for transpoting recording
   session metadata.

   Info Package Name: recording-session

   Reference: [RFCXXXX]


10.  Security Considerations

   The recording session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog
   [RFC3261], therefore, the recording session can reuse any of the
   existing SIP security mechanism available for securing the recorded
   media as well as metadata.

10.1.  Authentication and Authorization

   The recording session reuses the SIP mechanism to challenge requests
   that is based on HTTP authentication.  The mechanism relies on 401
   and 407 SIP responses as well as other SIP header fields for carrying
   challenges and credentials.

   The SRS may have its own set of recording policies to authorize
   recording requests from the SRC.  The use of recording policies is
   outside the scope of the SIPREC protocol.

Internet-Draft               SIPREC Protocol                January 2011


10.2.  Privacy of metadata

   Since metadata is transported as content in SIP messages such as
   INVITE and INFO Packages, the requests can be routed through SIP
   proxies between the SRC and SRS.  If the metadata content is
   considered private, then the SRC and SRS will need to use end-to-end
   encryption such as S/MIME in addition to hop-by-hop security (SIP/
   TLS) to prevent access by proxies or B2BUAs.
