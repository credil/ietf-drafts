          Multisegment Pseudowires in Passive Optical Networks
                       draft-li-pwe3-ms-pw-pon-01

Abstract

   This document describes the application of multi-segment pseudowires
   (MS-PWs) in a Passive Optical Network (PON).

   Static configuration of at least one PW segment is a typical case for
   a MS-PW.  This is often one of the end segments and, in the case of
   mobile backhaul, it is the segment closest to the aggregation device.
   But, when MS-PW is implemented in a PON, there may be a very large
   number of PW Terminating Provider Edge nodes (T-PEs).  This makes
   provisioning a heavy burden for the network manager.

   Making use of a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (GPON)
   management protocol helps to reduce the labor of configuration,
   simplify and speed up the PW provision procedure to a great extent,
   and notify to switching PE (S-PE) (which is the Optical Line
   Termination node (OLT)) of the status of the AC at the T-PE (which is
   the Optical Network Unit (ONU)).

   This document describes how to end-to-end MPLS MS-PWs can be provided
   through the integration of MPLS and GPON provisioning and control
   protocols, and describes how the MPLS-PW can be carried by the link
   layer of the GPON.

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                      July 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5659 [RFC5659] defines the architecture for multi-segment
   pseudowires (MS-PWs) satisfying requirements in RFC 5254 [RFC5254].
   Draft-ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw [draft-ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw] provides
   more detail on MS-PW.  MS-PW is a typical technology for certain
   applications, e.g. mobile backhaul.

   Among all technologies in access and metro networks, Passive Optical
   Network (PON) provides longer distance, higher bandwidth with better
   economy than other technologies like point-to-point Ethernet or
   Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) in many scenarios.  Mobile backhaul
   with PON is already at its dawn.

   In a Passive Optical Network, the Optical Network Unit (ONU) and
   Optical Line Termination (OLT) are adjacent nodes connected by
   Optical Distribution Network (ODN), which consists of optical fibers
   and optical splitters in a tree topology.  Link between each ONU and
   OLT is simulated as point to point, and there is no redundant path
   between them.  OLT resides in the central office, while ONUs reside
   in customer premises.  ONUs are deployed with a huge number and cost
   sensitive.  Figure A depicts the physical infrastructure of an ODN
   and more information about ODN can be found in [G.984.1].

   In a mobile backhaul network, many 2G and 3G base stations still use
   legacy interfaces like TDM and ATM.  Therefore, PWs have to start
   from devices directly connected with base stations.  In the case of
   mobile backhauling with PON, ONUs connected with base stations are
   T-PEs, while OLT is the switching point.  Routing protocols and
   dynamic label allocation protocols like LDP will extremely increase
   ONUs' cost as it influences both hardware and software.  Besides
   coding and maintenance of these new protocols, a much powerful CPU
   and more memory are also necessary for them to run smoothly.

   As there is no redundant link between each ONU and the OLT, routing
   and path selection are not necessary between the ONUs and the OLT.
   This will greatly reduce the cost of an ONU when it acts as a PW PE
   node.  Therefore, static provision of PW labels between ONUs and the
   OLT is preferred.  However, if provision PW labels on ONUs by Network
   Management System directly, it requires a network manager touching
   each ONU once for each PW, and there may be very many PWs.  This
   brings a large amount of OPEX.  Additionally, there must be a concern
   that the configuration at the ONU and the OLT will be inconsistent
   because for any PW, both the ONU and the OLT must be configured.

   According to ITU-T G.984.4amd2 [G.984.4amd2] and G.988 [G.988], the
   management protocol of GPON can also configure variant PWs on a ONU.
   OMCI is a prerequisite protocol for all GPON systems.  Hereby using

   OMCI to configure PWs on an ONU doesn't require to upgrade an ONU's
   hardware and cost of coding is neglectable.  This provides a cost-
   saving method of static provisioning of PW in GPON.

   MPLS-PW may be either carried by PSNs as defined in RFC3985
   [RFC3985], or by GPON link layer according to ITU-T G.984.3amd1
   [G.984.3amd1].


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Although this document is not a protocol specification, this
   convention is adopted for clarity of description of requirements.


3.  Terminology

   The terminology specified in RFC3985 [RFC3985] and RFC5659 [RFC5659]
   applies.  In addition, we defined the following terms related with
   PON according to ITU-T G.984.1 [G.984.1]:

   o  Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (GPON): A variant of the
      Passive Optical Network (PON) access technology supporting
      transmission rates in excess of 1Gbps and based on the ITU-T G.984
      series of Recommendations.

   o  GPON Encapsulation Method (GEM).  A data frame transport scheme
      used in GPON systems that is connection-oriented and that supports
      fragmentation of the user data frames into variable sized
      transmission fragments.

   o  GEM Port.  An abstraction on GPON adaptation layer representing a
      logical connection associated with a specific client packet flow
      between the OLT and the ONU.

   o  Optical Distribution network (ODN).  In the PON context, a tree of
      optical fibers in the access network, supplemented with power or
      wavelength splitters, filters, or other passive optical devices.

   o  Optical Line Termination (OLT).  A device that terminates the
      common (root) endpoint of an ODN, implements a PON protocol, such
      as that defined by ITU-T G.984 series, and adapts PON PDUs for
      uplink communications over the provider service interface.  The
      OLT provides management and maintenance functions for the

      subtended ODN and ONUs.  In this draft, OLT is actually a network
      element with multiple PON ports and uplinks.

   o  Optical Network Termination (ONT).  A single subscriber device
      that terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an
      ODN, implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber
      service interfaces.  An ONT is a special case of an ONU.

   o  Optical Network Unit (ONU).  A generic term denoting a device that
      terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an ODN,
      implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber
      service interfaces.  In some contexts, an ONU implies a multiple
      subscriber device.

   o  ONT management and control interface (OMCI).  The management and
      control channel between OLT and ONT in PON.  The OMCI protocol
      runs across a GEM connection between the OLT Controller and the
      ONT Controller that is established at ONT initialization.  The
      OMCI protocol is asymmetric: the Controller in the OLT is the
      master and the one in the ONT is the slave.  A single OLT
      Controller using multiple instances of the protocol over separate
      control channels may control multiple ONTs.  The OMCI protocol is
      used to manage the ONT in areas of configuration, fault,
      performance and security.

   o  Passive Optical Network (PON).  An OLT connected using an ODN to
      one or more ONUs or ONTs.

4.  Multi-Segment Pseudowire over PON Network Reference Model

   RFC5659 [RFC5659] provides several pseudowire emulation edge-to-edge
   (PWE3) reference architectures for the multi-segment case, which are
   general models extended from RFC3985 [RFC3985] to enable point-to-
   point pseudowires through multiple PSN tunnels.

   A Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network consists of an Optical Line
   Termination (OLT), an Optical Distribution Network (ODN) and multiple
   Optical Network Units (ONU).  The ODN is actually a fiber tree that
   provides physical connections between the OLT and the ONUs.  GPON has
   its own physical layer and link layer.  GEM Port is a logical point-
   to-point connection between the OLT and each ONU over GPON
   Transmission Convergence (GTC) layer.  There could be more than one
   GEM port between the OLT and an ONU.  Each GEM port could be assigned
   different QoS and bandwidth.

             Figure B: MS-PW over PON Network Reference Model

   Network is partitioned into access segment and metro/core segment
   with a hub & spoke topology.  MS-PW is recommended when extending PW
   technology to ONUs.  This removes the need of full mesh.  It
   minimizes the number of PSN tunnels and signaling adjacencies
   terminating on T-PEs and reduces the routing information processed by
   T-PEs.  Thus it can enhance the scalability and lower the complexity
   of the network.  The OLT is recommended as a S-PE so that PWS can be
   optimized within each segments.

   Figure B applies the MS-PW architecture in a PON and shows the
   specific technologies usages.  The Terminating PE1 (T-PE1) is an
   Optical Network Unit (ONU), while Switching PE1 (S-PE1) is an Optical
   Line Termination (OLT).  GEM ports replace PSN tunnels between ONU
   (T-PE1) and OLT (S-PE) across Optical Distribution Network (ODN), and
   a PSN tunnel extends from S-PE to T-PE2 across PSN.

   In a Passive Optical Network, the ONUs and the OLT are adjacent nodes
   connected by Optical Distribution Network (ODN), which consists of
   optical fibers and optical splitters in a tree topology.  Routing or
   path selection is unnecessary, as there is only one unique path
   between each ONU and the OLT.

   It should be noted that all PW segments are of the same technology,
   which is packet encapsulated.  It is only the tunneling technology
   that changes at the S-PE.

5.  MS-PW in PON for Mobile Backhaul

   As stated in RFC5254 [RFC5254], when a TDM access network is replaced
   with a packet-based infrastructure, initiating PWs closer to the end-
   user and converging multiple services onto a single access network
   may reduce expenses.  Backhauling 2G Base Stations (BS) by a packet
   network is a typical use case that may benefit from moving pseudowire
   PEs closer to the end-user and requires pseudowires to be extended
   into the access network.  In case the access network is a PON,
   pseudowires are expected to extend to Optical Network Units (ONUs).
   Mobile services are backhauled from base stations all the way back to
   a mobile network Controller via pseudowires.  PEs are attached by
   base stations and the Controller on both ends respectively.  This
   means each ONU acts as an edge PE that terminates attachment circuits
   (ACs) from base stations, and encapsulates native data in them to
   pseudowires.

   MS-PW is particularly preferred in this case according to RFC5659
   [RFC5659], as an edge PE (connected to the Controller) terminates N
   PWs to/from N different remote PEs (connected to base stations),
   which attach to a single intermediate PE.  The intermediate PE
   switches PWs In the network depicted in figure A, CE1 is the base
   station and CE2 is the controller.  ONUs are PW Terminating Provider
   Edge (T-PE) where Access Circuits are attached, while OLT is the PW
   Switching Provider Edge (S-PE).

   PON is a network with a tree topology that fits the infrastructure
   described above.  The OLT aggregates a large number of ONUs, which
   terminate ACs from base stations.  For economic reasons, ONUs are
   built to be low cost and without powerful routing or IP capabilities.
   The cost of ONUs will evidently increase if they are required to
   support similar PW setup and maintenance mechanisms as that used in
   the core network.  Multi-segment PW enables PW in PON to use a
   different setup mechanism than that in the metro and core network,
   with the OLT performing an intermediate PE switching PWs between ONUs
   and the Controller.  For example, the core could use a dynamic
   control plane (T-LDP PWs over RSVP-TE tunnels), while the access
   network could be provisioned through the management plane using the
   Network Management Station.


6.  Label Provisioning for Pseudowires over PON

   In a PON with MS-PW, where OLT acts as a switching point and ONU as a
   PE, provision of PWs between OLT and ONU may be performed through
   static configuration, e.g. from a NMS.  However, it incurs heavy
   burden of management if each ONU has to be touched to set up PW from
   ONUs to OLT and configure forwarding information on ONUs.  The huge

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                      July 2010


   number of ONUs makes this method quite forbidding.

   Using a management protocol over PON to provision pseudowire labels
   on ONUs largely reduces labor of static label configuration, while
   keeping simplicity of ONU by not implementing a dynamic control
   plane.

   Thanks to the management protocol in GPON system, ONT management and
   control interface (OMCI), a semi-static mechanism could be used to
   set up PWs from ONUs to OLT.  OMCI, running between the OLT and the
   ONUs, is the channel that OLT manages and controls ONUs.  All GPON
   physical layer and data GTC layer configuration on ONUs are installed
   via OMCI.  It also has the capability to configure MPLS-PW labels and
   related forwarding information on ONUs per ITU-T G984.4amd2
   [G.984.4amd2] and G.988 [G.988].  When using OMCI to provision PWs on
   ONU, the network manager only needs to send all configurations to the
   OLT, which will send all parameters to ONUs automatically through
   OMCI.  There is no need to touch each ONU.

   OMCI now supports configuration of variant types of PWs, e.g.  TDM,
   ATM and Ethernet.  Besides, OMCI can act as a signaling mechanism
   between ONU and OLT, which enables the ONU to notify AC status to
   OLT.


7.  MPLS-PW  in PON network

   Expanding PW to the ONU requires some form of routing hierarchy.  The
   approach taken here is to divide the network into access segments and
   Metro/Core segments.  The OLT is the interconnecting point of Hub and
   Spokes.  Spoke tunnels locate PSNs or GPON in the access segment are
   spoke tunnels, while hub tunnels PSNs locate in the core segment are
   hub tunnels.

          Figure C: Protocol Stacks on OLT for PWE3 over GEM Port

   According to ITU-T G.984.3amd1 [G.984.3amd1], MPLS-PW can be carried
   by GEM Port.  Figure C illustrates protocol stacks of GPON ONU and
   OLT where MPLS-PW is carried directly by GEM Ports.

   Multiple GEM Ports are supported for each pair of OLT and ONU, which
   enables multiple PSNs for each ONU.  According to current GPON system
   specification, one GPON port supports maximum 4096 GEM Ports shared
   by all ONUs connected to it.  One GPON port can aggregate maximum 64
   ONUs, but typically no more than 8 ONUs for bandwidth reason, when
   the ONU is a Multi-Dwelling Unit (MDU) or a Multi-Tenant Unit (MTU)
   that serves multiple subscribers.  There should be no scalability
   problem for GEM Ports to carry MPLS-PWs between ONU and OLT.

   When backhauling TDM services in a packet network, almost 50% of
   payload are shorter than 64 bytes.  Reducing protocol stacks and
   overhead of packets can obviously improve transmission efficiency.

   Besides the simplified protocol stacks described in this section,
   other PSN technologies are also valid to transmit PWs in GPON.


8.  IANA Considerations

   No new options or messages are defined in this document.


9.  Security Considerations

   GPON has its own security mechanism to guarantee each ONU are
   isolated on GPON link layer.  There are no other security issues
   concerned.
