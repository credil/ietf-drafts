  The Continue Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
          draft-sinha-dispatch-sip-continuation-option-01.txt

Abstract

   Before placing a call, it is quite often useful for the Caller to  
   know whether a Callee is in favourable state to receive call or not. 
   This document defines an optional tag  "continue" and a header  
   "Continue"  to address the purpose.  The "Continue" header field is  
   to confirm the session continuity with the Callee from the Caller  
   after an option for session continuity is placed by the Callee based 
   on the unfavorable state of the Callee. This functionality is needed 
   to resolve the unwillingness of the Callee to receive any call. An  
   option is given to the Callee by the Service Provider or by the  
   Handset Manufacturer or by the Carrier to establish this requirement.

1. Introduction

   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows Caller to establish sessions
   with Callee without knowing whether Callee is in a position to accept
   session request or not. There is no means by which Caller can know  
   the favourable state of Callee. There are several reasons why the  
   Caller wants to know the favourable state of Callee before finally  
   placing the call, because Callee may be in a different time zone,  
   Callee may be in a meeting, theatre, having lunch with family/friends
   ,etc. Callee may not want to be disturbed but may like to receive 
   calls which is urgent and of good interest to him. Another example  
   Bob may not like office calls on weekends or at his personal/family  
   time, but a project which requires his consent to progress or  
   business gets affected can be treated as urgent and he would like to 
   hear them. Same in case he's in a business meeting and doesn't like  
   receiving call from family or his team but anything which requires  
   his urgent attention, it would be important for him to accept. The  
   nearest approach or solutions to such problem available till date is 
   described below along with the appropriate cause why this document is
   not considering this for implementation. These approaches are not  
   good enough to address all concerns and address the purpose of this  
   proposal, which is due to lack of messaging and current  
   implementation capability. Also it doesn't give Caller to control  
   call based on its urgency of call to establish session with the  
   Callee, provided prior info about Callee in unfavorable state to  
   receive calls, wherein Bob is willing to accept urgent calls.

Internet-Draft             SIP Continuation Option           August 2011


   o By OPTION Method - It is used to determine the capabilities of SIP
     User Agent (UA). This OPTION method allows a SIP User Agent Client
     (UAC) to discover information about the supported method, content 
     types, extensions, codec, etc for a client which is registered with
     the Server. OPTION method is given by the Caller to know either  
     Server Capabilities or Client Capabilities and not its state

   o By Priority Header - Priority Header can be used to override a 
     ongoing call, DND option or any voice feature based on the Priority  
     of the call as set by the Caller and as agreed with the Operator. 
     If Called Party supports the feature and Caller does not support  
     Priority, then this feature will be just DND. The purpose of this  
     document is not to have DND by any means. 

   o By Do Not Disturb (DND) - When user enable DND on the phone, this  
     parameter allows user to specify how the DND features handle 
     incoming calls:
	 
      -Call Reject - This option specifies that no incoming call 
       information gets presented to the user. Depending on how user  
       configure the DND Incoming Call Alert parameter, the phone may  
       play a beep or display a flash notification of the call.

      -Ringer Off - This option turns off the ringer, but incoming call 
       information gets presented to the device, so that the user can  
       accept the call.
	   
    This feature doesn't serve requirement of Caller in either of the  
    cases Callee may not notice the alerts and call will be diverted to
    voicemail. The purpose of this document is not to have DND.

    o By Presence Feature - The use of PRESENCE with UAC clients 
      restricted to higher end-mobile devices. It is also not necessary 
      that caller and callee both are in each-other's buddy's list or  
      connected to same social-networks as it is not necessary that call
      is between two known persons

    Therefore this document describes a mechanism for a Callee convey an
    information to a Caller to place a call only when call is urgent by 
    introducing "Call Continuation Option" and "Non-Dedicated Dot Not 
    Disturb (NDDND)" as two a new features in TELECOMMUNICATION.
 
Definition

    o Call Continuation Option - is a feature where an option is given 
      to the Caller after Caller dials the Callee number to confirm the 
      application whether to finally place the call or not based on  
      certain configuration at the Callee UE or at the Voice Feature 
      Service of Callee.

Internet-Draft             SIP Continuation Option           August 2011


    o Non-Dedicated Do Not Disturb (NDDND)- is a state of Callee which 
      portrays that the Callee is in a non-dedicated or slight DND mode
      with willingless to receive calls only if it is urgent. However  
      the decision is driven by the Caller whether to finally place a  
      call or not. By setting this option at the Callee UE or at voice 
      services of Callee on the operator side, it ensures that the 
      Caller gets a notification after placing its call that Callee is 
      in a unfavorable state to receive call at this moment but in a  
      position to accept any call if caller thinks its urgent. 

1.1 Terminology 

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[2].

2. Overall Operation

   Callee is willing to receive only urgent call by enabling NDDND. This
   will convey information to Caller that Callee is not in a favorable  
   state to receive calls and option will be given to Caller to place a 
   call only if it is urgent. This is achieved adding an optional tag  
   "continue" in the Require header of 182 Queued provisional response  
   from Callee. This response from Callee will be generated only if the 
   Caller has the capability to support this functionality otherwise  
   this feature at Callee would be suppressed and 180 Ringing will be 
   sent as response on receiving INVITE. 

   Caller is keen to know whether the Callee is free or not to take a  
   call. So Caller sends INVITE with option tag continue in the  
   Supported. The Callee interprets the Caller up-to-date and inline 
   capabilities and responds with 182 Queued SIP response with header  
   Require: continue if the feature NDDND is set at the Callee. This SIP
   response is interpreted at the Caller with a message popup or some in
   call information (device implementation) telling the unfavorable 
   state of Callee to receive calls but tells its availability state  
   also with an "Y" or "N" which can also be simulated by Hard Call 
   Place GREEN Button or Call Cancel RED Button as per Caller wishes to 
   perform the needful action. This is described in details in the  
   mentioned use cases in Section 7. Accordingly PRACK [3] with Continue
   header as Yes (if 'Y' option is selected or GREEN button is pressed) 
   or No (if 'N' option is selected) to be sent to Callee or the CANCEL 
   request from Caller will be initiated if Hard RED Button is pressed.

   The Caller will have following 3 options to the control session.
   (i) Continue: Yes
   
      Caller MUST inject Continue header with field value as "yes" or 
      "YES" in the PRACK to support the Require header of provisional \ 
      response.

   (ii) Continue: No

      Caller MUST inject Continue header with field value as "no" 
      or "NO" in the PRACK to support the Require header of provisional 
      response. 

   (iii) Caller Hungs Up 
  
      CANCEL is sent by Caller and normal call flows as per RFC 3261[1]  
      follows based on implementation (based on terminating leg as SIP  
      AS or Called UA) to terminate and clear this call leg.

      
    If the Caller does not act on received 182 Queued provisional 
    responses, retransmission timer implemented as per RFC 3261[1].

3. UAS Behavior

   A UAS MAY send 182 Queued provisional (by adding Require header field
   with the option tag continue) response if the initial INVITE request 
   

De_&_Sinha                    Expires March 2012                [Page 5]


Internet-Draft             SIP Continuation Option           August 2011


   contained a Supported header field with the option tag continue. If  
   the UAS is unwilling to do so, it MUST ignore the option tag continue
   and proceed as per guidelines described in RFC 3261[1].

   A UAS MUST send 182 Queued provisional (by adding Require header 
   field with the option tag continue) response if the initial INVITE 
   request contained a Require header field with the option tag continue
   .If the UAS is unwilling to do so, UAS responds with 180 Ringing.

   A UAS MUST NOT send 182 Queued provisional (by adding Require header 
   field with the option tag continue) response if the initial INVITE  
   request did not include either a Supported or Require header field  
   indicating this feature.

   A UAS MUST NOT send 182 Queued provisional (by adding Require header 
   field with the option tag continue) response if the initial INVITE  
   request include Priority header with high value.

   If more than one Continue header field is present in PRACK with two  
   different field values, the UAS MUST reject the request with a 400  
   Bad Request response.

   If a Continue header field is present in a request other than PRACK, 
   the UAS MUST reject the request with a 400 Bad Request response.


4. UAC Behavior

   When the UAC creates a new request, it can insist for Call 
   Continuation Option in the provisional response for the request. To 
   do that, it inserts a Require header with the value continue as 
   option tag in the request. A Require header with the value continue 
   MUST NOT be present in any requests except INVITE.

   If the UAC does not wish to insist on usage of Call Continuation  
   Option in the provisional response, a Supported header MUST be  
   include in the request with the option tag continue. The UAC SHOULD  
   include this in all INVITE requests.

   If a provisional response is received for an initial request and that
   response contains a Require header field containing the option tag  
   continue, the response is send in field value of Continue header in  
   PRACK message.

   If a provisional response is received for an initial request and that
   response contains a Require header field containing the option tag  
   continue and UAC is unwilling to establish a session, it MUST reject 
   with CANCEL message.

5. The Continue Header Definition

    The Call Continuation Option feature makes use of Continue header  
    which provide control to Caller on establishing the session.

    The Continue header field MAY appear as an option extension header 
    in PRACK request of the Call Continuation Option feature. The 
    syntax of Continue header field follows the standard SIP parameter 
    syntax. 

          Continue = "Continue" HCOLON continue_value
          continue_value = "YES" / "yes" / "NO" / "no"

    So ideally optionally used "Continue" header in SIP PRACK request 
    would look like

          Continue: "YES"
          Continue: "yes"
          Continue: "NO"
          Continue: "no"

    The information about Continue header field in this document in 
    relation to method and proxy is summarized in Table 1.
  

Header field where proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG PRACK REFER SUB NOT 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Continue       R     -    -   -   -   -   -   -    o     -    -   o

             

Header field where                                   INF UPD MSG PUB
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Continue       R                                     -    -   -   -   

       Table 1: Additional Table Entries for the Continue Header

    The "where" column describes the request and response types in 
    which the header field may be used.  The header may not appear in 
    other types of SIP messages.  Values in the where column is: 

          R: header field may only appear in requests.

    The last six columns relate to the presence of a header field in a 
    method:

          m: the header field is mandatory.
          o: the header field is optional.
          -: the header field is not applicable

6. Backwards Compatibility

   This feature or SIP implementation does not have any impact on 
   existing Network designs and Handsets. This draft proposes the use of
   additional header call SIP "Continue" header in order to incorporate 
   this feature of NDDND.

   Handsets or Network who do not understand this feature shall not 
   handle and normal SIP behavior follows as per RFC 3261.

   There are 3 use cases for backward compatibility:
 
   o Caller Not Updated, Callee Updated
   
   o Caller Updated, Callee Not Updated
   
   o Both Caller and Callee Not Updated

   Handling of SIP messages for the above mentioned scenarios are 
   clearly mentioned in Section 3.
 

7. Examples and Use cases

   This section contains a number of examples and use cases that 
   illustrate the use of the Continue header field. For simplicity, 
   header fields are usually shown in the same order. Usually only the 
   minimum required header field set is shown. Also, message body 
   content lengths are often not calculated, but instead shown as "..."
   where the actual octel count would be.

   Messages are identified in the figures as F1, F2, F3, etc.
   This references the message details in the table that follows the 
   figure.

   Comments in the message details are shown in the following form:
   /* Comments. */

7.1 Call is Finally Placed by Calling Party

   In this scenario, Alice has enable NDDND feature in her profile. The 
   Bob sends initial INVITE with option tag continue in Support header. 
   Alice asked for confirmation of urgent call before ringing by 182 
   Queued provisional response with option tag continue in Require 
   header. Bob confirmed as urgent call by providing yes as Continue 
   header field value. Alice's phone rings finally.

   know that Alice need confirmation about importance of call before  
   ringing, which is shown in Figure 3.

7.4 Caller does not has Call Continuation Option feature

   There might be cases when Bob doesn't support Continue header 
   but Alice has enable NDDND feature. In such a case Bob wouldn't be 
   facilitated with continue advantages. Bob sends initial INVITE  
   without option tag continue in Support or Require header and will  
   receive 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) responses. Alice phone will  
   not ring.

   NDDND feature will be overwritten and Alice phone ring if the initial

   intention of Alice is not to block urgent or emergency call but to  
   avoid unimportant call as busy.

            Figure 6: Callee does not support NDDND feature


8. Implementation Recommendation

    "Session Continuation Option" feature in SIP is a new call control 
    feature proposed in this document applicable in favour of Callee 
    that gives option to Caller requesting for a confirmation to place 
    a call to Callee based on the following new applications at the 
    Callee.

   o Callee Unfavourable Time to Receive Call (usually when the

    Callee is sleeping or travelling, based on Callee time zone 
    which is based on his location that needs to be updated by 
    Callee in case of VoIP subscriber, and manually or 
    automatically done by Mobile Service Provider based on Daylight 
    Savings for 3G/4G subscriber).
	
   o Callee has set a Non-Dedicated Do-Not-Disturb (NDDND) that is 
    DND with lower priority when the Callee is in a theatre, 
    meeting, driving, lunch/dinner, etc. - Callee is willing to 
    receive the call only when it is very urgent.

    This application is totally based on SIP Call Session Establishment 
    principles (Offer-Answer Model) with minor deviation in call flows 
    and is implementation specific and driven based on configuration at.

   o SIP UA or Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) End Device, 3G/4G 
    Handsets (Device Driven) - Device plays more important role in 
    Call Handling.

   o SIP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) server as a part of Voice 
    Feature Services given by the Service Provider (Service 
    Provider Driven) - Network plays more important role in Call 
    Handling instead of SIP Terminals or 3G/4G Handsets. 

    This Call Feature Application handling behaviour and subsequent 
    actions at the Calling and Callee and SIP AS is clearly defined 
    later using State Diagrams based on the call confirmation options 
    handled by Calling Party and relevant configurations / services 
    provided by the Network Service Provider.

    This feature can be implemented using SIP with minor changes at 
    protocol level by introducing "Continue" header in SIP PRACK 
    Request and slight changes in the basic Offer-Answer Model 
    implementation in both UAs and SIP AS based on implementation, 
    calls of which are discussed in detail later on. There will be an 
    additional need of changes in UA Application and also at SIP AS in 
    case this feature is driven by a SIP AS instead of Callee.

    This feature is fully backward compatible and doesn't have any 
    impact on existing Subscribers, Devices, Network Setup and 
    Operation. The Service Provider may need to upgrade their SIP 
    Application server in case they wish to give this new voice feature 
    as a new service to their subscribers. Similarly Device 
    Manufacturer needs to upgrade the application of their handsets or 
    introduce as a new application feature in their new Handsets or 
    Devices.

9. IANA Considerations

Internet-Draft             SIP Continuation Option           August 2011



    This document registers a new header field name with a compact form 
    and one new option tag.

9.1  IANA Registration of "Continue" SIP Header field

    Name of Header:        Continue
    Compact Form:          g

9.2  IANA Registration of "continue" SIP Option-tag

    Name of option:         continue
    Description:            Support for the SIP Continue header


10. Security Considerations
   
   The Continue header in this document does not in itself have security
   considerations.  However, as mentioned in RFC 3427, an important
   reason for the IETF to manage the extensions of SIP is to ensure that
   all extensions and parameters are able to provide secure usage.
