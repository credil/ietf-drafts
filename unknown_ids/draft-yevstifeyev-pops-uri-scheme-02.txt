1.  Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol, Version 3 (POP3), that is defined in RFC
   1939 [RFC1939], is an application-layer protocol used by local e-mail
   clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a simple TCP/IP
   connection.  However since the time of appearance of this protocol,
   it has been widely implemented over Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246] and its deprecated predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

   RFC 2384 [RFC2384] already defines the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) 'pop' scheme that is used for referencing the POP3 mailboxes. 
   However this scheme supports only usual POP3 over TCP [RFC793]
   operations; not aforementioned POP3 over TLS binding.  This document
   specifies the URI scheme used for referencing the POP3 mailboxes that
   are available using POP3 over TLS connection and the procedure the
   user agent should follow when using this scheme - POP3 over TLS
   transport binding.

   Generic URI syntax is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  Procedures
   for registration of new URI schemes are defined in RFC 4395
   [RFC4395].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The 'pops' URI Scheme

   The 'pops' URI scheme is used to designate the access to POP3
   [RFC1939] mailboxes over secure TLS connection, as described below. 
   The user agent, using 'pops' URI scheme SHALL: request the password
   (and user name, if not given in the URI) in the case this is required
   by the used authentication method; establish the TCP [RFC793]
   connection to the TCP port, given in URI (or 995, if not given
   there), of the endpoint, identified as <host> in the URI; perform the
   TLS handshake, as described in RFC 5246 [RFC5246] (all data now SHALL
   be sent under TLS layer); open the POP3 transaction and authenticate
   itself using the chosen authentication method using the credentials
   requested before; begin exchanging POP3 commands and responses.  This
   procedure is called POP3 over TLS transport binding.

   There is already the 'pop' URI scheme used for referencing the POP3
   mailboxes over usual TCP connection [RFC2384].  Since the 'pops' URI
   scheme defined by this document is used to provide the access to the
   same resources as 'pop' one (i. e. POP3 mailboxes), only using
   different connections, the syntax of these schemes are the same
   either, except the 'scheme' part.  The 'pops' URI is described using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] as follows:

   pops-uri    = pops-scheme ":" pops-hier-part
   pops-scheme = "pops"
   pops-hier-part = "//" [user-auth "@"] host [":" port] ["/"]
   user-auth   = user [auth]
   user        = 1*achar
   auth        = ";AUTH=" ("*" / auth-type)
   auth-type   = auth-sasl / auth-ext
   auth-sasl   = 1*achar
   auth-ext    = "+" ("APOP" / 1*achar)
   achar       = ALPHA / DIGIT / pct-encoded / "$" / "-" / "_" / "." 
                / "+" / "!" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "," / "=" / "*" / "~" 
                / "&"

   The <host>, <port> and <pct-encoded> rules are described in
   Appendix A of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  The core rules <ALPHA> and <DIGIT>
   are used as described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

     Note: The <achar> rule contains the <userinfo> production of RFC
     3986 [RFC3986] except the ";" character.  This is made in order not
     to create confusion with <auth> part, that uses ";" as the
     delimiter.

   If <port> part is omitted, it SHALL default to 995.  If the
   characters, not listed in the <achar> rule, appear in the <user>
   part, they MUST be percent-encoded.  The final character "/" MAY be

   omitted.

   The <auth> part of the 'pops' URIs allows to choose what
   authentication mechanism will be used after the establishing the
   connection.  The ";AUTH=*" assumes that no special authentication
   mechanism SHOULD be used - i. e. the user name and password SHOULD be
   transmitted via the USER and PASS commands, respectively.  If another
   authentication type is assumed, it SHOULD be used after the
   establishing the connection, as described below. 

   If the <auth-type> part does not starts with "+", the Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] SHOULD be used for
   authentication.

   If the <auth-type> part starts with "+", that APOP or other specified
   external authentication mechanism SHOULD be assumed to be used.  

   Please note that the user agent MAY use another authentication
   mechanism than defined in the 'pops' URI if it is properly set.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   The 'pops' URI designates the secure TLS connection for POP3
   transaction.  Moreover, it allows to choose what authentication
   mechanism SHOULD be used for user authentication over such
   connection.

   More security issues may be added by other authentication mechanisms
   for POP3.  These mechanism are not discussed by this memo.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'pops' URI scheme using the following
   template (see RFC 4395 [RFC4395]):

     URI scheme name: pops

     Status: Permanent

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme encoding considerations: Generic encoding considerations
     for URI schemes, defined in Section 2 of [RFC3986], concern 'pops'
     one as well.  Non-ASCII characters are to be mapped as defined in
     Section 3.1 of RFC 3987 [RFC3987].  Note that there are the
     restrictions for usage of some characters in the <user> part of the
     URI - see Section 2

     Protocols that use the scheme: POP3 over TLS connections, as
     described in RFC xxxx

     Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC xxxx
