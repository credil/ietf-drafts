Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is standardized to provide network-based mobility
   management for a regular IPv6 mobile node. This document introduces
   an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 for multihoming MN. Through
   extending the binding relationship between HNP and MAG in BCE, and
   synchronizing this information between LMA and MAGs, LMA can deliver
   data having the same HNP through multiple MAGs. Thus the MN attaching
   in a PMIPv6 domain can receive data packets with the same destination
   through its multiple network interfaces attaching to different MAGs
   simultaneously.

   1. Problem Statement

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6
   MN without requiring its participation in any mobility-related
   signaling [1]. If the MN has multiple interfaces, it is hoped that
   these interface can work coordinately, so that a proper interface can
   be chosen to deliver the data.

   In PMIP domain, the LMA is responsible for assigning the MN's home
   network prefix(es) and managing the MN's binding state. LMA will
   assign different HNPs to multiple interfaces of the MN, and it will
   be several Binding Cache Entries for the MN based on the HNPs in LMA.
   The problem is if LMA receives data with HNP1 as the destination,
   according to the BCE of HNP1, it will send the data to IF1 through
   MAG1, although IF2 of MN can also deliver the data, see figure 1. In
   that case, the multihoming MN cannot benefit from its multiple
   interfaces.

Internet-Draft         PMIP multihoming extension          October 2009

   To solve this problem, it is proposed to extend BCE to bind the HNP
   to several proxy-CoA related to the same MN, and synchronize this
   information between LMA and MAGs, then the data can be transferred
   through all of the interfaces. Several benefits can be achieved by
   doing that multihoming extension:

   1) Enable the flow mobility. That means the flow aiming a certain IF
      can be transferred to other IFs because of the user preference,
      operator policy, network load, etc.

   2) Enable the load sharing. The traffic to a certain IF of MN can be
      separated among different Ifs, and less loaded IFs can be selected.
      And when the bandwidth of an IF is limited, other IFs can be used
      to help deliver the data together.

   2. Scenario of the multihoming extension

   As shown in Figure 2, the multihoming MN has two network interfaces
   IF1 and IF2, attaching to the MAG1 (IF1) and MAG2 (IF2) respectively.

                          +-----+
                          | CN  |
                          +-----+

                             |              MN: HNP1 ---> {MAG1, MAG2}
                          +-----+             : HNP2 ---> MAG2

               (         //    \\             ) PMIPv6 domain
               (        //      \\            )
                +------//--------\\----------+
                      //          \\
                     //            \\
                  +----+          +----+
                  |MAG1|          |MAG2|
                  +----+          +----+
                    |                |
                    |                |
                    | IF1        IF2 |
                    +------[MN]------+

                  Figure 2 Scenario of the multihoming extension

   Assuming the IF1 of the MN which attaches to MAG1 turns on first, the
   LMA assigns the HNP1 to the IF1. The MN initiates a video telephony
   call with the CN, sending and receiving traffic addressed to HNP1 via
   IF1. Then the performance of IF1 degrades significantly, and the IF2
   becomes available which attaches to MAG2.

   The bandwidth of any of IF1 or IF2 is not enough to maintain the
   video telephony traffic, so a possible solution is to enable the MN
   to send and receive the traffic addressed to HNP1 via IF1 and IF2
   simultaneously. Such a solution would make best use of the multiple
   interfaces of the MN and improve the user's experience.

   Figure 2 shows the signaling call flow of the multiple interface
   attach  procedures.  The  detailed  explanations  of  the  signaling
   procedures are as follows.

   1)-4) It is the standard procedure defined in RFC5213.

   5) Upon receiving the PBU message from the MAG2, the LMA does a
      lookup in MN's the binding cache. If a binding cache entry exists
      with MN-ID field matching the identifier in the received MN-ID
      option, MN-LL-ID field not matching the identifier in the received
      MN-LL-ID option, the LMA will assign the new HNP2 to the IF2.The
      LMA creates the new binding cache entry including the MN-ID, MN-
      LL-ID (for IF2), HNP2 field with additional "Quantity of MAG"
      field set to 1.The LMA also updates the existing binding cache
      entry of HNP1 with "Quantity of MAG" field increased to 2, default
      Proxy-CoA for MAG1 and standby Proxy-CoA for MAG2.

    6)           The LMA returns a PBA message including HNP1 and HNP2 for IF2 to
      the MAG2.

    7)           The bi-directional tunnel2 between MAG2 and LMA is set up to
      forward the traffic addressed to HNP1 and HNP2.

   Thus, the MN could receive the traffic addressed to HNP1 via IF1 and
   IF2, and only receive the traffic addressed to HNP2 via IF2.

   The mapping between IP flow and MAG can be based on Service Flow
   Identifier specified in draft-hui-netext-service-flow-identifier ,
   and the binding policy is out of the scope of this document.

   4. PMIPv6 Multihoming Extension

   This section introduces PMIPv6 multihoming extensions that are
   necessary for supporting data transmission through multiple MAGs, and
   then interfaces, simultaneously.

   4.1. Binding Cache and Binding Update list Extension

   The binding is conceptually stored in the binding cache entry and
   binding update list entry of the local mobility anchor and mobile
   access gateway. Besides the standard field (HNP, MN-ID, etc), it
   should be extended to include the following parameters:

   O Quantity of MAG: an additional field, an integer indicating the
   number of the MAGs that the home network prefix is associated with.

   O MAG Parameter Sets: modified field sets, each of which is
   associated with a MAG that the home network prefix is associated with.
   The following parameters are included in a set:

     1) Service Flow Identifier, an additional sub-field. A service
   flow identifier is used to indicate one of the flows binding to the
   MAG associated with the set. When flows are binding to the MAG, the
   sub-field would include multiple flow identifiers. The detailed
   format of service flow Identifier is out of the scope of this
   document, more information can be found in [draft-hui-netext-service-
   flow-identifier].

     2) The link-layer identifier of the mobile node's connected
   interface on the access link, described in Section 5.1 of [RFC5213].

     3) The link-local address of the mobile access gateway on the
   point-to-point link shared with the mobile node, described in Section
   5.1 of [RFC5213].

     4) The tunnel interface identifier (tunnel-if-id) of the bi-
   directional tunnel between the local mobility anchor and the mobile
   access gateway where the mobile node is currently anchored, described
   in Section 5.1 of [RFC5213].

     5) The access technology type, by which the mobile node is
   currently attached, described in Section 5.1 of [RFC5213].

Internet-Draft         PMIP multihoming extension          October 2009

     6) The 64-bit timestamp value of the most recently accepted Proxy
   Binding Update message sent for this mobile node, described in
   Section 5.1 of [RFC5213].





   4.2. Data Forwarding Operation

   In order to receive the traffic addressed to specific interface at
   any other interfaces, the MN MUST follows the Weak host model [2].

      LMA lookup:

       When the LMA receives data packet from a CN, it makes a lookup in
       its binding cache with the lookup key - the destination address
       of the data packet.

       Case 1. If there exists a binding cache entry, with the HNP field
       matching the destination address, and the Quantity of MAG is set
       to 1, then the corresponding bi-directional tunnel will be used
       to forward the data packets to the MAG.

       Case 2. If there exists a binding cache entry, with the HNP field
       matching the destination address, and the Quantity of MAG is
       greater than 1, then the LMA will select the most suitable MAG
       based on service flow identifier which is binding to the MAG and
       matches the data packet.

         If there doesn't exist such a service flow identifier, the LMA
         should select the MAG corresponding to the first parameter set
         in the entity, which is named as preferred MAG and the others
         as reserved MAG(s).

       In both cases, the corresponding bi-directional tunnel will be
       used to forward the data packets to the selected MAG.

      Synchronization of binding status between LMA and MAG

      The extend BCE in LMA stores the information binding the HNP to
      several proxy-CoAs related to the same MN. And according to RFC
      5213, LMA sends one HNP or multiple HNPs in a PBA message to MAG.
      Thus LMA can insert HNP(s) into PBA message to indicate that the
      data packets with any of the HNPs should be forwarded to the MN
      through the MAG.

Internet-Draft         PMIP multihoming extension          October 2009

      The MAGs do not need to perceive the existence of the multihoming
      extension of PMIPv6 and the detailed information of binding status
