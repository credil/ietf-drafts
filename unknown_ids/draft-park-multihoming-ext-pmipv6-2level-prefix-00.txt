Internet-Draft  PMIPv6 multihoming using 2-level prefixes      July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility management
   protocol.  In here, Mobile Host (MH) does not know the changes of
   network access caused by MH movement.  That is, Mobile Access
   Gateways (MAGs) and Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) support the whole
   mobiltiy management.  However, they do not define the protocol
   procedures for supporting interface and flow handover for MH with
   multiple interfaces.

   This document clarifies the type of handover. and describes the
   protocol procedures about multihoming extensin of PMIPv6 in multiple
   prefix model.  In addition, Layer 2 hints are figured out even though
   these hints are only considered in horizontal handover (ex.  WLAN-to-
   WLAN handover).


2.  Types of handover

   Even though this classification is not common, this document
   describes the types of handover to understand the protocol procedures
   easily.

   o  Inter-access Handover

   o  Inter-interface Handover

   o  Partial Flow Handover

   o  Full Flow Handover

   First, Inter-access Handover (IAHO) occurs between MAGs.  That is,
   MN's interface is not changed.  The attached MAG is only changed.

   Secondly, Inter-interface Handover (IIHO) considers the MH with
   multiple interfaces.  IIHO occurs among multiple interfaces in the
   same MH.

   Lastly, Paritial and Full Flow Handover (PFHO/FFHO) are used in case
   of simulteneous attachment between MAGs and multiple interfaces in
   MH.  PFHO means partial transfer among application and service flows.
   FFHO means all flow transfer.  The difference between IIHO and FFHO

   is the policy of keeping the mobility session, which has been
   transfed all flows.  FFHO keeps the mobility session because of the
   possibility of reverse flow handover.

   In this document, new prefix will be used to support the flow
   handover.  The next section will describe in detain.

3.  New 2-level prefix model

   This document defines and uses 2-level prefix model like the
   following figure.  In here, pref_AA and pref_AB are called by level 1
   prefix.  It is allocated and managed by LMA.  Especially, pref_AA is
   a permanent prefix, which is indicated by flag(P).  It is used to
   support inter-interface and inter-access handover.  On the other
   hand, pref_AB is a temporal prefix, which is indicated by flag(T).
   It is used to support flow handover. pref_AB will be allocated by LMA
   to MAGs before initiation of mobility sessiion.  Each MAG already
   knows the other's temporal prefixes.  And then, pref_BA, called by
   level 2 prefix, will be allocated for MH.  Pref_BA will be allocated
   and managed by each MAG or LMA.

                        +---------+---------+------+
                        | For_LMA | For_MAG | Flag |
                        +=========+=========+======+
                        | pref_AA |    -    |   P  |
                        +---------+---------+------+
                        | pref_AB | pref_BA |   T  |
                        +---------+---------+------+

                      Figure 5: 2-level Prefix Model

   In the following section, HNP_x(P) and HNP_x_y(T) notation will be
   used.  In here, x means inteface identifer and y means level 2 prefix
   identifer and P/T is flag, which distinguishs the prefix.  As
   mensioned before, P means permanent prefix and T means temporal
   prefix.  The following examples will be used in this document.

   o  HNP_1(P) = pref_AA_1 + alpha

   o  HNP_1(T) = pref_AB_1

   o  HNP_1_1(T) = pref_AB_1 + pref_BA_1 + alpha

   o  HNP_1_2(T) = pref_AB_1 + pref_BA_2 + alpha

   o  HNP_2(P) = pref_AA_2 + alpha

   o  HNP_2(T) = pref_AB_2

   o  HNP_2_1(T) = pref_AB_2 + pref_BA_1 + alpha

4.  Usage scenarios for the 2-level prefix model

   This document considers the MH with multiple interface, each
   interface of whose has multiple prefixes.  This section describes the
   simultaneous use and horizontal handover in multiple prefix model.

4.1.  Scenario 1 - simultaneous attachment

   This scenario considers the nearly same attachement of multiple
   interfaces.

4.1.1.  Initial Stage in scenario 1

   Initial attachment procedures of each interface is operated
   independently.  The following functions will be performed between MH
   and MAG or between MAG and LMA.

   o  The mobility session for all interfaces in MH

   o  Prefix allocation and maintenance in LMA and MAG

   o  Flow id generation and Distribution in LMA

                   Figure 6: Scenario 1 - Initial Stage

   The initial attach procedures are following:

   1.  The if1 will be attached the network through MAG1.

   2.  MAG1 sends the PBU to the LMA.  In here, HI option is 1 (initial
       attachment).

   3.  LMA allocates the HNP_1(P) for if1 of MH.  LMA sends PBA with
       HNP_1(P) option.

   4.  MAG1 sends RA message with HNP_1(P) and HNP_1_1(T).  In here,
       HNP_1(P) has been obtained from PBA message.  HNP_1_1(T) will be
       allocated by MAG1 using HNP_1(T) prefix, which has been
       distributed from LMA.

   5.  MH configures the HNP_1(P) and HNP_1_1(T) to the if1.

   6.  The if2 also does the above preocedures.  After then, MH
       configures the HNP_2(P) and HNP_2_1(T) to the if2.

   7.  MH allocates HNP Address for Virtual Interface (VI).  HNP_1(P) or
       HNP_2(P) is randomly selected.

   8.  Application services will be started.  VoIP and web services have
       been started through if1.  IPTV service has been also started
       through if2.  In here, VoIP service has been assigned to flow1 by
       LMA.  The flow1 is flow identifier for VoIP service. flow2 for
       web service and flow3 for IPTV service is also assigned by LMA.

4.1.2.  Second Stage in scenario 1

   After initial stage, the following handover will be occured in
   according to network changes or user requirement.

   o  Inter-access Handover from MAG1 to MAG2

      *  MH: if1 is attached to network through the MAG2.

      *  L2 Hints: To support the fast handover, L2 entity uses over-
         the-DS Fast basic service set Transition (FT) protocol in an
         RSN or non-RSN.  First, MN's L2 entity informs explicitly to
         MAG1 using the FT request/response protocol. if L2 entity want
         to inform MAG1 that this is the inter-access handover, it
         include explicitly Target AP address (ex.  MAG2 address) in FT
         request message.  And then, remote request/response procedures
         will be used between MAG1 and MAG2 in order to give the MH's

         if1 information.  Therefore, MAG2 easily know the current
         state(ex. inter-access handover).

      *  MAG1: After receiving L2 hints, new tunnel is configured
         between MAG1 and MAG2.  This tunnel is used to transfer the
         data, which are targeted to if1 through MAG1.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends PBU with HI(3) to the LMA.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU with HNP_1(P), all if1-related
         entries will be changed to the if2.  In addtion, LMA sends the
         PBA with HNP_1(P).

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, new BCE with if1 will be added.

   o  Inter-interface Handover from if1 and if2

      *  MH: No action.

      *  L2 Hints: To support the fast handover, MN's L2 entity informs
         explicitly to MAG1 using the FT request/response protocol. if
         L2 entity is likely to inform MAG1 that this is the inter-
         interface handover, it include Null Target AP address (ex.
         MAG2 address) in FT request message.  It is a signal that MH
         want to support the inter-interface handover.  And then, remote
         request/response procedures will be used between MAG1 and MAG2
         in order to give the MH's if1 information.  Therefore, MAG2

      *  MAG1: After receiving L2 hints, new tunnel is configured
         between MAG1 and MAG2.  This tunnel is used to transfer the
         data, which are targeted to if1 through MAG1.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends PBU with HI(2) to the LMA.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU with HNP_1(P) from MAG2, all if1-
         related entries will be changed to the if2.  LMA sends the PBA
         with HNP_1(P).

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, new BCE with HNP_1(P) will be
         added.

      *  L2 Hints: FT resource request, response, confirm and ack
         protocol may be used to support flow handover.  Especially,
         Over-the-DS FT Resource Request Protocol in a RSN and non-RSN
         will be prfered.

      *  MAG1: After receiving the L2 hints, MAG1 and MAG2 know the user
         requirement about the partial flow handover.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends the PBU with HI(5).  In addition, PBU has a
         HNP option.  In HNP option, HNP_1_2(T) will be included in
         order to inform the flow handover.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU(HI=5) with HNP option, LMA updates
         the BCE using HNP option.  That is, LMA knows the change of web
         service flow.

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, MAG2's BCE will be changed.

         HNP_2_1(T) for IPTV service are used as the flow identifier.
         In this scenario, all services from if1 will be transfered to
         if2.

      *  L2 Hints: FT resource request, response, confirm and ack
         protocol may be used to support flow handover.  Especially,
         Over-the-DS FT Resource Request Protocol in a RSN and non-RSN
         will be prfered.

      *  MAG1: After receiving the L2 hints, MAG1 and MAG2 know the user
         requirement about the full flow handover.

      *  MAG2: MAG2 sends the PBU with HI(5).  In addition, PBU has the
         HNP options.  In HNP options, HNP_1_1(T) and HNP_1_2(T) will be
         included in order to inform the full flow handover.

      *  LMA: After receiving the PBU(HI=5) with HNP options, LMA
         updates the BCE using HNP options.  That is, LMA knows the
         transfer of all service flows.  In this case, original mobility
         session for if1 will be kept to support the reverse partial or
         full flow handover.

      *  MAG2: After receiving the PBA, MAG2's BCE will be changed.
