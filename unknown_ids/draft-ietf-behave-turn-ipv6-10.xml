This document adds IPv6 support to Traversal Using Relays around NAT
(TURN). IPv6 support in TURN includes IPv4-to-IPv6, IPv6-to-IPv6, and
IPv6-to-IPv4 relaying. This document defines the
REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute for TURN. The REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY
attribute allows a client to explicitly request the address type the
TURN server will allocate (e.g., an IPv4-only node may request the
TURN server to allocate an IPv6 address).

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) <xref
target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> is a protocol that allows for an
element behind a NAT to receive incoming data over UDP or TCP. It is
most useful for elements behind NATs without Endpoint-Independent Mapping <xref
  target="RFC4787"/> that wish to be on the receiving end of a connection to a
single peer.
</t>
<t>
The base specification of TURN <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>
only defines IPv4-to-IPv4 relaying. This document adds IPv6 support to
TURN, which includes IPv4-to-IPv6, IPv6-to-IPv6, and IPv6-to-IPv4
relaying. This document defines the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute,
which is an extension to TURN that allows a client to explicitly
request the address type the TURN server will allocate (e.g., an
IPv4-only node may request the TURN server to allocate an IPv6
address). This document also defines and registers new error
response codes.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Overview of Operation">
<t>
When a user wishes a TURN server to allocate an address of a specific
type, it sends an Allocate Request to the TURN server with a
REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute. TURN can run over UDP and TCP, and it
allows for a client to request address/port pairs for receiving both
UDP and TCP.
</t>
<t>
After the request has been successfully authenticated,
the TURN server allocates a transport address of the type indicated in
the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute. This address is called the
relayed transport address.
</t>
<t>
The TURN server returns the relayed transport address in the response to the
Allocate Request. This response contains a XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS
attribute indicating the IP address and port that the server allocated
for the client.
</t>
<t>
TURN servers allocate a single relayed transport address per
allocation request. Therefore, Allocate Requests cannot carry more
than one REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute. Consequently, a client that
wishes to allocate more than one relayed transport address at a TURN server (e.g., an
IPv4 and an IPv6 address) needs to perform several allocation requests
(one allocation request per relayed transport address).
</t>
<t>
A TURN server that supports a set of address families is assumed to be
able to relay packets between them. If a server does not support the
address family requested by a client, the server returns a 440
(Address Family not Supported) error response.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Creating an Allocation">
<t>
The behavior specified here affects the processing defined in Section
6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>.
</t>

<section title="Sending an Allocate Request">
<t>
A client that wishes to obtain a relayed transport address of a specific
address type includes a REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute, which is
defined in <xref target="sec-attribute"/>, in the Allocate Request
that it sends to the TURN server. Clients MUST NOT include more than one
REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute in an Allocate Request. The
mechanisms to formulate an Allocate Request are described in Section
6.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>.
</t>
<t>
Clients MUST NOT include a REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute in an
Allocate request that contains a RESERVATION-TOKEN attribute.
</t>

<section title="The REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY Attribute"
anchor="sec-attribute">
<t>
The REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute is used by clients to request the
allocation of a specific address type from a server. The following is
the format of the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute. Note that
TURN attributes are TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoded, with a 16 bit
type, a 16 bit length, and a variable-length value.

</figure>
<t>
Type: the type of the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute is 0x0017.  As
specified in <xref target="RFC5389"/>, attributes
with values between 0x0000 and 0x7FFF are comprehension-required, 
which means that the client or server cannot successfully process the
message unless it understands the attribute.
</t>
<t>
Length: this 16-bit field contains the length of the attribute in
bytes. The length of this attribute is 4 bytes.
</t>
<t>
    Family: there are two values defined for this field and specified in <xref
        target="RFC5389"/>, Section 15.1: 0x01 for IPv4 addresses and 0x02 for IPv6 addresses.
</t>
<t>
Reserved: at this point, the 24 bits in the reserved field MUST be
set to zero by the client and MUST be ignored by the server.
</t>
<t>
The REQUEST-ADDRESS-TYPE attribute MAY only be present in Allocate
Requests.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Receiving an Allocate Request">
<t>
Once a server has verified that the request is authenticated and has not been tampered with,
the TURN server processes the Allocate request. If it contains both a
RESERVATION-TOKEN and a REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY, the server replies with a 400
(Bad Request) Allocate Error Response. Following the rules in <xref
    target="RFC5389"/>, if the server does not understand the
REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute, it generates an Allocate Error Response,
which includes an ERROR-CODE attribute with response code 420 (Unknown
Attribute). This response will contain an UNKNOWN-ATTRIBUTE attribute listing
the unknown REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute.
</t>
<t>
If the server can successfully process the request, it allocates a
transport address for the TURN client, called the relayed transport
address, and returns it in the response to the Allocate Request.
</t>
<t>
As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>, the Allocate
Response contains the same transaction ID contained in the Allocate
Request and the XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attribute is set to the relayed transport
address.
</t>
<t>
The XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attribute indicates the allocated IP address
and port.  It is encoded in the same way as the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS
<xref target="RFC5389"/>.
</t>
<t>
If the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute is absent, the server MUST
allocate an IPv4 relayed transport address for the TURN client. If allocation of IPv4
addresses is disabled by local policy, the server returns a a 440 (Address
Family not Supported) Allocate Error Response.
</t>
<t>
If the server does not support the address family requested by the client, 
it MUST generate an Allocate Error Response, and it MUST include an 
ERROR-CODE attribute with the 440 (Address Family not Supported)
response code, which is defined in <xref target="sec-440"/>.

<section title="Packet Translations">
<t>
The TURN specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> describes
how TURN relays should relay traffic consisting of IPv4 packets (i.e.,
IPv4-to-IPv4 translations). The relay translates the IP addresses and
port numbers of the packets based on the allocation's state data. How
to translate other header fields is also specified in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>. This document addresses IPv4-to-IPv6,
IPv6-to-IPv4, and IPv6-to-IPv6 translations.
</t>
<t>
TURN relays performing any translation MUST translate the IP addresses
and port numbers of the packets based on the allocation's state
information as specified in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>. The following sections specify how to
translate other header fields.
</t>
<t>
As discussed in Section 2.6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>,
translations in TURN are designed so that a TURN server can be
implemented as an application that runs in userland under commonly
available operating systems and that does not require special
privileges. The translations specified in the following sections
follow this principle.
</t>
<t>The descriptions below have two parts: a preferred behavior and an alternate
  behavior.  The server SHOULD implement the preferred behavior.  Otherwise, the
  server MUST implement the alternate behavior and MUST NOT do anything else.</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t>
Note that the use of the behaviors specified in the following sections
is at the "should" level. Having its use at the "should" level instead
of at the "must" level makes it possible to use different translation
algorithms that may be developed in the future.

<section title="Security Considerations">
  <t>Translation between IPv4 and IPv6 creates a new way for clients to obtain
    IPv4 or IPv6 access which they did not have before. For example, an
    IPv4-only client having access to a TURN server implementing this
    specification is now able to access the IPv6 internet. This needs to be
    considered when establishing security and monitoring policies.</t>
  <t>The loop attack described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> Section
    17.1.7 may be more easily done in cases where address spoofing is easier to
    accomplish over IPv6. Mitigation of this attack over IPv6 is the same as for
    IPv4.</t>
<t>
All the security considerations applicable to STUN <xref target="RFC5389"/> and
TURN <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> are applicable to this document as well.
</t>
<section title="Tunnel Amplification Attack">
  <t>An attacker might attempt to cause data packets to loop numerous times
    between a TURN server and a tunnel between IPv4 and IPv6. The attack goes
    as follows.</t>
  <t>Suppose an attacker knows that a tunnel endpoint will forward encapsulated
    packets from a given IPv6 address (this doesn't necessarily need to be the
    tunnel endpoint's address).  Suppose he then spoofs two packets from this
    address:
    <list style="numbers">
      <t>An allocate request asking for a v4 address, and</t>
      <t>A ChannelBind request establishing a channel to the IPv4 address of the
        tunnel endpoint</t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>Then he has set up an amplification attack:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>The TURN relay will re-encapsulate IPv6 UDP data in v4 and send it to
        the tunnel endpoint</t>
      <t>The tunnel endpoint will decapsulate packets from the v4 interface and
        send them to v6</t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>So if the attacker sends a packet of the following form...
    <figure>
      <artwork>
  IPv6: src=2001:DB9::1 dst=2001:DB8::2
  UDP:  &lt;ports&gt;
  TURN: &lt;channel id&gt;
  IPv6: src=2001:DB9::1 dst=2001:DB8::2
  UDP:  &lt;ports&gt;
  TURN: &lt;channel id&gt;
  IPv6: src=2001:DB9::1 dst=2001:DB8::2
  UDP:  &lt;ports&gt;
  TURN: &lt;channel id&gt;
  ...
      </artwork>
    </figure>
    Then the TURN relay and the tunnel endpoint will send it back and forth
    until the last TURN header is consumed, at which point the TURN relay will
    send an empty packet, which the tunnel endpoint will drop.</t>
  <t>The amplification potential here is limited by the MTU, so it's not huge:
    IPv6+UDP+TURN takes 334 bytes, so you could get a four-to-one amplification
    out of a 1500-byte packet.  But the attacker could still increase traffic
    volume by sending multiple packets or by establishing multiple channels
    spoofed from different addresses behind the same tunnel endpoint.</t>
  <t>The attack is mitigated as follows. It is RECOMMENDED that TURN relays not
    accept allocation or channel binding requests from addresses known to be
    tunneled, and that they not forward data to such addresses.  In particular,
    a TURN relay MUST NOT accept Teredo or 6to4 addresses in these requests.</t>
