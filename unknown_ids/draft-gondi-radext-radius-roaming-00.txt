   to provide new functionalities for radius server in wireless and 
   cellular networks. In this draft we are proposing to extend the 
   functionalities of Radius to extend it to roaming and handover 
   support for the mobile terminals. Using this mechanism the mobile 
   terminal initially gets access to the network and then when there is 
   a possibility of handover and roaming with the other access 
   networks, mobile terminal communicates with the home radius server 
   and creates the pre authentication information. In this process 
   different mechanisms essential for roaming and handover are 
   addressed such as Network Selection, Handover Initiation, Security 
   Context Management, and Mobility Management. Using this mechanism 
   the latency for handover and roaming can be reduced with higher 
   level control mobility of the terminal during handover and roaming.

1. Introduction 

   With the increase in the usage of different  access technologies 
   networks there is a need for access networks to support the mobile 
   terminal to decide and transfer details during roaming and handover. 
   By introducing this support the long lasting issues of Network 
   Selection (NS), handover initiation (HO), Security context 
   management (SC) for low delay during authentication, and mobility 
   management (MM) can be addressed. In this draft we are proposing to

Internet-Draft   Roaming Extensions for radius server     February 2008 
    

   extend the functionalities by adding new modules in the Radius 
   server for all the mentioned above processes. Ultimately the main 
   aim of this is to provide network centric mobile terminal management 
   to provide seamless roaming services during mobility.   

   As mentioned above by introducing new modules of NS, etc.. Radius 
   server can be extended to support roaming and handover before the 
   mobile terminal does moves into new access network. A mobile 
   terminal before moving into another network, using any transfer 
   mechanism (in this case we proposed new EAP HO method) it can 
   initiate the radius roaming support using the present connected 
   network. Mobile terminal sends the NS request to the Radius server, 
   radius server responds with the available access networks. The other 
   processes like HO, SC, MM also can be transferred from the client to 
   radius server and radius server to client and radius server 
   negotiating with the other radius server for the allocation of 
   resources or SC or MM to create the session even the mobile terminal 
   moving to another access networks. 

   In section 2 of this draft we explain detail process mechanisms with 
   the new extensions to the radius server. Section 3 deals with the 
   radius server interaction with the client and with another radius 
   server. Section 4 provides information about the different modules 
   used in the radius roaming extensions in detailed with the packet 
   formats the attributes.  

2. Mobility and Roaming Support for Radius servers 

   In this draft we have proposed to add new functionalities with the 
   existing ones where the Radius server can listen to requests from 
   the mobile terminal and also to communicate with the other radius 
   servers, network entities of the access networks for roaming and 
   handover support. In this mechanism Network Selection is done on the 
   access network as well as on the terminal. In this process the 
   client terminal sends a request for NS with the list of available 
   networks, the radius server with the NS extension listens to the 
   request and reads the data sent by the mobile terminal, according to 
   the user policy required QoS etc.. The radius server selects the 
   access networks in the order of priority and sends back to the 
   terminal. The terminal after receiving the reply selects the best 
   access network and sends a request for handover initiation to the 
   radius server.  

   After receiving the request for handover initiation the radius 
   server sends a request to the visiting access network for handover 
   init, the visiting radius server checks the available resources on 
   that AP or BS and SLA with the request server sends the reply as ok

   or resources not available. After receiving the reply the home 
   radius server sends the reply to client to initiate the handover 
   mechanisms. With the init from the server the mobile terminal sends 
   the request for the SC and MM request, the server creates the 
   temporary keys and re-authentication ID and forwards to the visiting 
   server and also as a reply to the mobile terminal with the details 
   of SC. With the MM the radius server sends the details of mobile 
   terminal for MM like the SPI, home address, and home agent address 
   to the other visiting server. The visiting server after receiving 
   the request forwards the user details to the MPA or FA of that 
   access network to create the MM context for that SPI and after 
   successful context creation the server acknowledges with success as 
   reply to the home server. 

   When these details are transferred to the mobile terminal, the 
   terminal does start the re-authentication with the visiting network. 
   With the SCM details from the home radius server during pre 
   authentication it initiates the authentication and tries to access 
   directly to the visiting network. By using this context transfer 
   mechanism and pre authentication information exchange for NA, HO, SC 
   and MM the total latency during the re-authentication can be reduced 
   drastically in a controlled environment.  

3. Radius server interactions 

3.1. Mobile terminal Interactions 

   The mobile terminal sends the request to the radius server in this 
   case using new EAP-HO method which we are proposing in parallel with 
   this draft. This EAP-HO sends the request for different mechanisms 
   proposed in this draft as sub type. The information of NS, HO, SC 
   and MM can be transferred using this EAP-HO. On the other side the 
   Radius server has to be modified to accommodate this EAP method and 
   constantly listens to the requests from the clients. After 
   processing the different mechanisms (NS, HO, SC, MM), information 
   these methods has to be transferred to the mobile terminal using 
   EAP-HO as reply to the client. Not only EAP but also any mechanism 
   which is compatible with Radius server in layer 2 and layer 3 can be 
   used to transfer information.  

3.2. Interactions with visiting networks Radius server 

   New attributes and modules are developed so that when there is any 
   information exchange for different processes using these extensions 
   it can be achieved. The home and visiting radius server can interact 
   with the new attributes proposed in this draft for different 
   functionalities.

4. Handover and roaming extensions 

4.1. Network Selection 

   The server constantly scans on the ports mentioned in the 
   configuration for any requests. It differentiates the requests from 
   clients as well as from servers. In the NS procedure whenever there 
   is any request from the client, the NS procedure checks the user 
   policy and QoS to provide the access to users. If ever the user 
   doesn't have any policy to roaming the server responds with no 
   privileges to access network, if the user have provision then the 
   server responds with the priority list according to the visiting 
   networks and send back to the client. 

   When the mobile terminal sends a request for NS with the home Radius 
   server with the target network IDs, home AAA differentiates with the 
   Local networks or visiting networks. After this home Radius server 
   sends a request with NS extensions to the visiting networks radius 
   server. Visiting network process the available information and sends 
   the available target ID as a reply back to the home Radius server. 
   If ever the request failed it sends NS failure as code value of the 
   packet. 

4.1.1. Packet format 

   In this section we explain details of the extended functionalities 
   of Radius with the NS with a new attribute valued pairs and codes.

4.2. Handover Initiation 

   In this process when the client sends the HO initiation request for 
   the target ID, the home radius server sends the request to the

4.3. Security Context Management 

   In this process the home radius server derives the re-authentication 
   ID and temporary keys for mobile terminal requests for security 
   initiation. These details are transferred to the client as well as 
   to the visiting network using security extensions. Upon receiving 
   the details from the home network the visiting network configures 
   the details in the server for that user id, if there is any problem 
   during configuration or the data sent by the server, visiting sends 
   a failure response, if ever the configuration is good the server 
   responds with success.

   Type (1 byte) = NS_Request_Attribute = TBD (IANA consideration) 
   Length (2 bytes) = Length of the message 
   User's reauthentication ID: (256 bytes) home radius server assign 
   this id and forwards this to the visiting networks radius server and 
   as well as to client. 
   Validity (1 byte) = the valid time of the key and the re 
   authentication id. 
   Key (64 bytes) = temporary key which is derived in the home radius 
   server 
    
   the visiting radius server reply to the home radius server with SC 
   Accept message.   
   Code = SC_Accept = TBD (IANA consideration) 
    
   If there is any failure in the packet or the details of SC 
   configuration on the visiting server, it sends the faliure to the 
   home radius server. 
    
   Code = SC_Reject = TBD (IANA consideration) 
    
4.4. Mobility Management 

   When the Radius server receives the MM request from the client the 
   home radius server prepares a request for mobility and sends the 
   packet to the visiting network AAA server. This packet contains the 
   details of mobile terminal, SPI, keys, Home address of the mobile 
   terminal and the home agent address. The transfer of these details 
   to the network entities such as MPA or HA or FA is out of this draft 
   context.

   The visiting radius server reply to the home radius server with 
   Mobility Accept message, the Code field for this message is:  

   Mobility_Accept = TBD (IANA consideration) 

   If there is faliure in retreiving and processing the data the 
   visiting radius server must reply the home radius server with a 
   Mobility Reject message, with Code   

   Mobility_Reject = TBD (IANA consideration) 

5. Security Considerations 

   The information exchanges between the client and the radius server 
   proposed in this architecture must be secured, the information 
   exchange between the radius servers must support security for every 
   modules proposed in this draft for roaming and handover support. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   The codes and attributes discussed in the above sections are to be 
   assigned by the IANA. There will be different codes which are to be 
   assigned individually for every single extensions proposed in this 
   draft. 

7. Conclusions 

   The proposed extensions for radius support different functionalities 
   to provide seamless services during mobile terminal movement. Most 
   of the issues of the network selection, security context management 
   and MM are addressed in this draft. Even though the proposed 
   solution in this draft is robust and efficient there are still 
   issues to be solved such as security, privacy and policy of the 
   access networks.
