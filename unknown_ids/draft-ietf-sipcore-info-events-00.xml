    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides new semantics for the SIP INFO method of RFC
      2976. These new semantics defined here are fully backwards compatible
      with the old semantics. Core to the new semantics is a mechanism for
      defining, negotiating and exchanging Info Packages that use the INFO
      method. Applications that need to exchange session-related information
      within a SIP INVITE-created session, also known as application level
      information, use these INFO requests. This draft addresses issues and
      open items from RFC 2976 and replaces it.</t>
    </abstract>

    <note title="Conventions Used in this Document">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>. The terminology in this document
      conforms to the <xref target="RFC4949">Internet Security
      Glossary</xref>.</t>

      <t>Be aware this document strictly follows <xref target="RFC3261">RFC
      3261</xref> for the definition of the terms User Agent Server (UAS) and
      User Agent Client (UAC). Specifically, the UAC issues a SIP request and
      the UAS responds. This terminology may be confusing when one combines
      the INFO case with the INVITE case. For an INVITE, the initiator of the
      session is the UAC and the target of the session is the UAS. However, it
      is possible for the target UA of the session, the UAS of the INVITE
      transaction, to send an INFO to the initiating UA of the session, the
      UAC of the INVITE transaction. From the perspective of the INFO, the
      target UA of the session (INVITE UAS) is, in fact, the UAC (sender) of
      the INFO request. Likewise, from the perspective of the INFO, the
      initiating UA of the session (INVITE UAC) is the UAS (recipient) of the
      INFO request. Since this document strictly follows RFC 3261, we refer to
      the UA that issues the INVITE as the "initiating UA" and the UA that
      responds to the INVITE as the "target UA" to remove any confusion.</t>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>The <xref target="RFC3261">SIP protocol</xref> defines session
      control messages used to setup and tear down a SIP controlled session.
      In addition, a SIP User Agent (UA) can use the re-INVITE and UPDATE
      methods during a session to change the characteristics of the session.
      Most often, this is to change the properties of media flows related to
      the session or to update the <xref target="RFC4028">SIP session
      timer</xref>. The purpose of the <xref target="RFC2976">INFO
      message</xref> is to carry application level information along the SIP
      signaling path. Note the INFO method does not change the SIP session
      state. It may, however, change application state for applications using
      the SIP session.</t>

      <t>While INFO has been widely adopted for specific application use
      cases, such as ISUP and DTMF exchange, <xref target="RFC2976">RFC
      2976</xref> neither defined a negotiation mechanism nor a means by which
      to explicitly indicate the type of application information contained in
      the INFO message. This led to problems associated with static
      configuration. In addition, the industry realized there was a potential
      for interoperability problems due to undefined content syntax and
      semantics. This draft addresses these deficiencies and provides a
      framework for explicit negotiation of capabilities and content context
      using "Info Packages".</t>

      <t>The INFO method as defined by RFC 2976 did not provide any context
      for the information the request carried. While it may sometimes be clear
      what the content is based on the Content-Type, this is only true where
      there is only one contextual usage of the content-type. For example, if
      the Content-Type is "image/jpeg", the MIME-attached content is a JPEG
      image. However, there are many useful ways a UAS can render an image.
      Said differently, there are different contexts for an image in SIP. The
      image could be a caller-id picture, a contact icon, a photo for sharing,
      and so on. The sender does not know which image to send to the receiver
      if the receiver supports an image content type. Likewise, the receiver
      does not know the context of an image the client is sending if the
      receiver supports receiving more than one image content type. Thus, we
      need a well defined and documented statement of what the information
      sent is for. This situation is identical to the <xref
      target="RFC3458">context issue in Internet Mail</xref>. RFC 3458 goes
      into this and other issues in detail.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3265">Event Packages</xref> perform the role of
      disambiguating the context of a message for subscription-based events.
      This document provides a similar framework for INVITE-based application
      level information exchange. However, while the mechanism described here
      is similar to subscription-based events, there is no formal relationship
      between this mechanism and the subscription mechanism. In particular,
      when a UAC issues a SUBSCRIBE, it creates a dialog usage.</t>

      <t>The mechanism defined here creates neither a separate subscription
      dialog nor a subscription usage within an existing session. Instead, it
      uses the INVITE method and its responses to indicate supported Info
      Packages and the INFO method to convey the Info Packages.</t>

      <t>Each UA enumerates which Info Packages it can receive. If a first UA
      indicates it can receive a package and a second UA can send the package,
      the second UA can send INFO methods containing the payload for that
      package. The Recv-Info header indicates which packages a UA is willing
      to receive. The Info-Package header indicates which package a particular
      INFO method request belongs to. There is a reserved Info Package, "nil",
      which indicates the UA conforms to this document, but does not wish to
      receive Info Packages. This enables other UAs that conform to this
      document to detect legacy UAs. A legacy UA will not include a Recv-Info
      header in their SIP session establishment or modification requests.
      Conversely, a UA that supports Info Packages will have a Recv-Info
      header. <xref target="S.Nego"></xref> describes Info Package
      advertisement in detail.</t>

      <t>This document does not describe any specific Info Package type
      extensions. One must extend this protocol by other documents, herein
      referred to as "Info Packages". <xref target="S.Package"></xref>
      describes guidelines for creating these extensions.</t>

      <t>The INFO method does not change the state of SIP calls or the
      parameters of the sessions SIP initiates. It merely sends optional
      application layer information, generally related to the session.</t>

      <t>Applications need to be aware that application level information
      transported by the INFO method constitutes mid-session signaling. These
      messages traverse the post-session-setup SIP signaling path. This is the
      path taken by SIP re-INVITEs, BYEs, and other SIP requests within an
      individual session. SIP proxy servers will receive, and potentially act
      on, mid-session signaling information. Application designers need to
      understand this can be a feature, as when the User Agents are exchanging
      information that elements in the SIP signaling path need to be aware of.
      Conversely, this can be a problem, as messages these network elements
      have no interest in can also put a significant burden on those element's
      ability to process other traffic. Moreover, such network elements may
      not be able to read end-to-end encrypted INFO bodies.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability">
      <t>This document replaces the <xref target="RFC2976">SIP INFO method
      document</xref> to include explicit negotiation of supported Info
      Packages in the INVITE transaction and indication of the Info Package to
      use by using a new header field in the INFO request. As described in
      <xref target="S.Requests"></xref>, the mechanism described here is
      backwards compatible with legacy, RFC 2976 INFO mechanisms.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="S.Nego" title="Info Package Behavior">
      <t>As stated in the Conventions section, the term UAC refers to the UAC
      (sender) of the INFO method and UAS refers to the recipient of the INFO
      method. "Initiating UA" refers to the sender of an initial INVITE to
      establish a session and "target UA" refers to the recipient of that
      INVITE request.</t>

      <section anchor="S.UA" title="UAS Behavior">
        <t>A UAS supporting this document MUST advertise the set of Info
        Packages it is willing to receive in Recv-Info header(s) in dialog
        usage requests and responses for session establishment or target
        refresh. This includes INVITE, UPDATE, PRACK, ACK, and their
        non-failure responses (101-199 and 2xx only).</t>

        <t>Once a UAS indicates support for an Info Package by sending a
        Recv-Info header with one or more package names, the UAS MUST be
        prepared to receive an INFO containing that package. Note this may
        occur before dialog negotiation completes.</t>

        <t>Recall the UAC of an INVITE may choose to receive (be a UAS for)
        INFO methods. This UA may chose not to offer any packages in the
        initial INVITE and subsequently advertise packages from the target
        UA's subsequent responses, in order to support <xref
        target="RFC3725">third-party call control</xref>.</t>

        <t>A UAS lists multiple packages by enumerating the package name(s),
        separated by commas, as values for the Recv-Info header in the session
        establishment exchange. A UAS may also list multiple packages by
        including multiple Recv-Info headers. The UAS may also combine
        multiple Recv-Info headers with one or more packages in each header
        value. If the UAS prefers to receive one package over another, the UAS
        MUST list the preferred Info Package lexically earlier in the message.
        That is, by listing it earlier in a list within a given Recv-Info
        header or listing it in a previous Recv-Info header in a given
        message. The UAS MUST NOT list a package more than once. This order is
        only a hint to the UAC, as there is no meaningful way of enforcing the
        use of a preferred package at the UAC.</t>

        <t>There is an important issue to consider when the UAS advertises
        support for multiple packages that one might interpret to be similar
        or equivalent. The UAC has no method of knowing whether the UAS would
        like the UAC to send a single INFO request with the preferred package
        or for the UAC to send multiple INFO requests with the same or similar
        information. The behavior is entirely up to the UAC and the rules
        specified by the package definitions.</t>

        <t>If a UAS does not wish to receive any Info Packages, the UAS MUST
        indicate this by including one and only one Recv-Info header with the
        value 'nil'. This enables the UAC to discern the difference between a
        UAS that understands Info Packages but does not wish to receive any
        from a legacy UAS that does not understand Info Packages. A UAC
        conforming to this document can always send or receive legacy INFO
        usages without packages.</t>

        <t>Info Package capability advertisement occurs within the context of
        a session negotiation exchange. The Info Package capability set
        received by the UAC within the last exchange is the one the UAC will
        use to chose Info Packages from. Also note that due to glare, an INFO
        request may be in flight prior to the UAC receiving an updated
        capability set removing a given Info Package. Thus, the UAS MUST be
        prepared to handle an INFO request with an Info Package payload with a
        newly delisted Info Package. Proper handling does include rejecting
        the request with a 469. See <xref target="S.Responses"></xref> for
        more on this topic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="UAC Behavior">
        <t>A UAC MUST NOT send INFO requests for a given INFO package until
        the UAC receives an "INVITE dialog usage" request or response (for
        session establishment or target refresh) with a Recv-Info header
        listing the given Info Package.</t>

        <t>At any time during an "INVITE dialog usage" request or response, if
        a UAS sends one or more Recv-Info headers, the UAC MUST replace the
        old set of supported Info Packages with the collection of Info
        Packages enumerated by the current message.</t>

        <t>If the UAS does not send any Recv-Info headers in a message, then
        the list of supported Info Packages does not change.</t>

        <t>A UAC MUST cease sending INFO requests for a given INFO package
        when the UAC receives an "INVITE dialog usage" request or response
        (for session establishment or target refresh) that does not contain a
        Recv-Info header listing the given Info Package. Note the UAC MUST be
        prepared to receive a <xref target="S.Responses">469 response</xref>
        at any time, even if the UAS advertised it could receive the Info
        Package. This situation can occur if the UAC sends the INFO request at
        the same time the UAS advertises it no longer supports the Info
        Package in question.</t>

        <t>If the UAC receives a Recv-Info header with the value 'nil', the
        UAC MUST NOT send any INFO methods that contain Info Packages.</t>

        <t>The UAS may advertise support for multiple Info Packages. If some
        of these packages have similar or equivalent functionality and the UAC
        supports multiple such packages, the UAC SHOULD chose to send Info
        Package payload(s) from the Info Package listed lexically earlier in
        the last Recv-Info advertisement the UAC received from the UAS. This
        document cannot make this protocol action a must strength, as the
        concept of "similar or equivalent" is highly Info Package
        specific.</t>

        <t>INFO itself does not necessitate the use of Require or
        Proxy-Require headers. There is no token defined for "Supported"
        headers. If necessary, clients may probe for the support of this
        version of INFO using the OPTIONS request defined in <xref
        target="RFC3261">SIP</xref>. One could envision a particular Info
        Package implementation that relied on either of these headers. See
        <xref target="S.Package"></xref> for more on this issue.</t>

        <t>The presence of the Recv-Info header in a message is sufficient to
        indicate support for this version of INFO. The "methods" parameter for
        <xref target="RFC3841">Contact</xref> is not sufficient to determine
        if the endpoints support Info Packages, as the INFO method supported
        might be the obsolete <xref target="RFC2976">RFC 2976</xref>
        version.</t>

        <t>For Info Packages, this draft does not provide a means of requiring
        support for a specific Info Package. If the UAS does not indicate
        support for an Info Package that the UAC requires, and the UAC
        requires the use of that package, the UAC can use any supported <xref
        target="RFC3261">RFC3261</xref> method to terminate the session.</t>

        <t>A UAC MAY send a legacy <xref target="RFC2976">INFO</xref> method
        at any time.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Package Versions">
        <t>The protocol mechanism described herein does not provide for a
        package versioning mechanism. This is for two reasons. The first is
        that if an Info Package has a capability for forward and backward
        compatibility in the Info Package payload, then that compatibility
        comes from the application level semantics of the information. This
        means it is the responsibility of the application to handle such
        compatibility and not the INFO framework. For example, one could use
        XML versioning techniques in the payload to indicate versions of the
        Info Package.</t>

        <t>The second reason we do not have a package versioning system is not
        all payloads have sufficient capability to carry payload versions. In
        this situation, it is highly unlikely payloads will be backwards
        compatible. That is, what one really is defining is a new Info
        Package. This is more especially so when one considers User Agents can
        advertise package support but cannot advertise package version
        support. Even if we did allow for package versioning, as a parameter
        to the Recv-Info header value, for example, it is lexically equivalent
        to having a new Info Package.</t>

        <t>UACs MUST NOT depend on any lexical parsing of the Info Package
        name for versioning, such as "fooV1" and "fooV2" or "foo.1" and
        "foo.2".</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Advertisement Example">
        <t>Here is an INVITE. The initiating UA advertises the following.</t>

    <section title="The INFO Method Request">
      <section anchor="S.Requests" title="INFO Requests">
        <t>The INFO method provides additional, application level information
        that can further enhance a SIP application. It is important to note
        there are some types of application information for which using INFO
        messages are inappropriate. See <xref target="S.info-packages"></xref>
        for a discussion of this.</t>

        <t>The UAC MUST include the Info-Package header field when it sends an
        INFO request carrying an Info Package. The Info-Package header field
        value in an INFO request MUST contain a single Info Package token.
        That Info Package token MUST match one of the Info Packages the UAS
        indicated support for during the negotiation described in <xref
        target="S.Nego"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The UAC MAY send an INFO in a legacy usage context. See <xref
        target="S.legacy"></xref> for examples of legacy usages. In general, a
        legacy usage is where there is no Info-Package header. In this case,
        if the UAS has never offered a Recv-Info header or never offered a
        Recv-Info header with a package of a similar function to the legacy
        INFO usage, the UAC MAY send an INFO without an Info-Package header
        field and a body appropriate to the said legacy usage.</t>

        <t>A UAC MUST NOT use the INFO method outside an INVITE dialog usage.
        The INFO method has no lifetime or usage of its own, as it is
        inexorably linked to that of the INVITE. When the INVITE-created
        session terminates, that signals the termination of the negotiated
        Info Packages. A UAS that receives an INFO message after the INVITE
        dialog usage terminates MUST respond with a 481 Call Does Not
        Exist.</t>

        <t>The session identifiers defined in <xref target="RFC3261">RFC
        3261</xref> must match those of the provisional or final responses to
        the INVITE. As a result, INFO requests cannot fork. The UAC may send
        INFO requests once the UAS has sent the Recv-Info header field value,
        indicating what the UAS supports.</t>

        <t>The converse is not true during initial session establishment. The
        initiating UA of the first INVITE MUST be prepared to receive multiple
        INFO requests, as the first INVITE may fork. Since session negotiation
        has not completed, and we allow early INFO requests, multiple target
        UAs may respond. This initial session establishment phase is the only
        time the UAS need be prepared to receive multiple INFO requests, as
        one would expect there may be messages from non-authoritative forked
        dialogs prior to their termination.</t>

        <t>The construction of the INFO request is the same as any other
        request within an existing INVITE-initiated session. A UAC MAY send an
        INFO request on both an early and confirmed session.</t>

        <t>The INFO request MUST NOT carry a Recv-Info header. The UAC can
        only negotiate Info Packages using the procedures of <xref
        target="S.Nego"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The signaling path for the INFO method is the signaling path
        established as a result of the session setup. This can be direct
        signaling between the calling and called user agents or a signaling
        path involving SIP proxy servers that were involved in the call setup
        and added themselves to the Record-Route header on the initial INVITE
        message.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="INFO Request Body">
        <t>The purpose of the INFO request is to carry application level
        information between SIP user agents. The INFO message body SHOULD
        carry this information, unless the message headers carry the
        information of interest. Note this is not an invitation to invent SIP
        headers for the purposes of application level information exchange.
        Rather, one could envision circumstances where existing SIP headers
        already convey the information the application has interest in.</t>

        <t>If the Info Package defines a payload, and the package
        specification indicates it is appropriate to include a payload with
        the request, the UAC MUST include the payload with the MIME type
        specified by the Info Package.</t>

        <t>If the Info Package definition directs the UAC to send a request
        without a payload, the UAC MUST send the INFO request without a
        body.</t>

        <t>Some SIP extensions, which are orthogonal to INFO, may insert body
        parts unrelated to the INFO payload. User Agents MUST conform to RFC
        3261 as updated by <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-sip-body-handling">body-handling</xref> to support
        multipart MIME handling. If there are bodies unrelated to the Info
        Package, and the Info Package also has a payload, the UAC MUST bundle
        these elements into a multipart MIME body. In this case, the UAS needs
        a means to unambiguously identify the body part belonging to the Info
        Package. To do this, the UAC MUST identify the Info Package payload
        MIME body part with a Content-Disposition of 'Info-Package'.</t>

        <t>If the payload of an Info Package is already a multipart MIME body,
        the UAC MUST identify the payload with a Content-Disposition of
        'Info-Package' in the headers for the appropriate MIME body part.</t>

        <t>If there is no payload in the INFO request unrelated to the Info
        Package and the payload of the Info Package is not a multipart MIME,
        the UAC MUST identify the message, at the SIP header level, with a
        Content-Disposition of 'Info-Package'.</t>

        <t>If there is no payload for the Info Package, they UAC MAY omit the
        Content-Disposition header.</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>NOTE: We could be lazy and even save 33 octets by allowing the
            UAC to construct a non-multipart MIME payload without a
            Content-Disposition header. However, mandating the presence makes
            parsing considerably easier, and it is easier to have it required
            now than run into a problem later.</t>

            <t></t>

            <t>NOTE: One could offer that the Info-Package header is
            redundant, as we could have the Info Package name be a parameter
            for Content-Disposition. However, there could be corner cases with
            legacy INFO usage that makes this a poor choice.</t>

      <section anchor="S.Responses"
               title="Responses to the INFO Request Method">
        <t>If a UAS receives an INFO request, it MUST send a final response. A
        UAS MUST send a 200 OK response for an INFO request with no message
        body and no Info-Package header if the UAS received the INFO request
        on an existing session. This protocol action supports legacy use of
        INFO as a keep-alive mechanism.</t>

        <t>If the UAS receives an INFO request with an Info-Package the UAS
        advertised with a Recv-Info in the last session state update and the
        body of the INFO request is an appropriate MIME type for the Info
        Package, the UAS MUST send a 200 OK response.</t>

        <t>If the INFO request contains a body the server does not understand
        then, in the absence of Info Package associated processing rules for
        the body, including the absence of an Info-Package header, the server
        MUST respond with a 415 Unsupported Media Type message.</t>

        <t>If the INFO request indicates an Info Package type the server does
        not understand, then the server MUST respond with a 469 Bad INFO
        Package. In the terminology of <xref target="RFC5057">Multiple Dialog
        Usages</xref>, this represents a Transaction Only failure.</t>

        <t>If a server receives an INFO request with a body it understands,
        but the request has no Info-Package header, the UAS MAY use the body
        as it sees fit. If the UAS accepts the INFO request, the UAS MUST
        respond to the INFO request with a 200 OK. This enables legacy use of
        INFO. If the UAS needs to enforce strict compliance with the current
        INFO framework described here, the UAS MUST reject the request with a
        469.</t>

        <t>The UAS MUST send a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist message
        if the INFO request does not match any existing INVITE-initiated
        session.</t>

        <t>The UAS MAY send other responses, such as Request Failure (4xx),
        Server Failure (5xx) and Global Failure (6xx) as appropriate for the
        request.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Behavior">
        <t>Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the INFO request
        governing the usage of tags, Route and Record-Route, retransmission
        and reliability, CSeq incrementing and message formatting follow those
        in <xref target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref> as defined for the BYE
        request.</t>

        <t>The INFO message MUST NOT change the state of the SIP session. Of
        course, outside the INFO machinery specific failure responses as
        documented in <xref target="RFC5057">the SIP dialog usages
        document</xref>, may cause the INVITE session to terminate.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Behavior of Registrars">
        <t>Registrars receiving a REGISTER request that includes Recv-Info
        headers MAY store such information and use it for routing purposes.
        How the registrar uses this information is beyond the scope of this
        document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="OPTIONS Processing">
        <t>A UAC, the sender of the OPTIONS request, SHOULD include Recv-Info
        headers, populated appropriately for the packages the UAC supports.
        The UAS SHOULD include its set of Recv-Info packages. These strictures
        are of "should" strength because local policy might restrict the
        advertisement of full capabilities, the UA may know the best choice of
        equivalent packages to list from local configuration, and so on.</t>

        <t>The UAS and UAC MUST NOT consider the OPTIONS request to be part of
        a capabilities negotiation. The OPTIONS request is purely a probe. For
        the UAC or UAS to renegotiate package support, they must use the
        procedures described in <xref target="S.Nego"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Order of Delivery">
        <t>The INFO method does not define mechanisms for ensuring in-order
        delivery for overlapping INFO requests. That is, the UAC can send
        another INFO request before receiving a transaction response from the
        UAS to a prior INFO request. While the UAC will increment the CSeq
        header upon the transmission of new INFO messages, the UAS cannot use
        the CSeq to determine the sequence of INFO information. All a UAS can
        determine is the UAC sent one INFO message after another. This is due
        to the fact that there could be gaps in the INFO message CSeq count
        caused by a user agent sending re-INVITES or other SIP messages.</t>

        <t>It is up to the individual Info Package definition to specify what
        happens when there are overlapping INFO requests. However, since it is
        legal SIP to have overlapping requests, the application must be able
        to handle the reception of overlapping requests. Overlapping requests
        can occur even if the particular instance of an application (Info
        Package) does not allow it, as the mechanism described here is
        package-agnostic. Thus, the Info Package needs to define the
        appropriate response. This is more especially so given the UAC could
        send from multiple Info Packages. Some of those packages may allow
        overlapping INFO requests, while others do not. In this situation, it
        would be hard to tell if the non-overlapping packages were being
        violated or not.</t>

          <t>For the purposes of matching Info Package types indicated in

    <section title="Legacy Uses of INFO">
      <t>Several RFC-defined and other standards-defined uses of <xref
      target="RFC2976">RFC 2976 INFO</xref> exist and are in use, as well as
      numerous proprietary uses. <xref target="S.legacy"></xref> describes
      some of these usages. By definition, identifying such uses has relied on
      either static local configuration or implicit context determination
      based on the body Content-Type or Content-Disposition value or some
      proprietary mechanism. This draft cannot forbid nor avoid such uses,
      since local configuration can always override standardized
      mechanisms.</t>

      <t>To maintain backward compatibility with the extant standardized uses
      of INFO, a server MAY interpret an INFO request with no "Info-Package"
      header as being of such legacy use.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that such legacy use will not "break" the
      mechanism in this draft. For example, if a UA supports <xref
      target="RFC3372">SIP-T</xref>, it does so based on static local
      configuration or based on acceptance of the application/isup body. If it
      adds support for this draft's Info Package negotiation mechanism, the
      local configuration still applies, and the UA will send/receive INFO
      messages based on SIP-T regardless of the Info Package negotiation. It
      will also be able to send/receive INFO messages based on the Info
      Packages it negotiated. If, at some future time, an Info Package is
      defined for SIP-T, the UA can indicate such in the negotiation, and
      again local configuration would supersede if need be. The UA would not
      lose the ability to use SIP-T with legacy devices. Rather, it would gain
      the ability to use it with devices which support this draft and with
      which it did not have such local configuration set, and could avoid
      failures related to unsupported bodies.</t>

      <t>It is the hope of this draft's authors that vendors that implement
      proprietary INFO uses submit their mechanisms as Info Package extension
      documents, and follow the Info Package negotiation mechanism defined in
      this draft.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="S.Package" title="Info Package Requirements">
      <t>Info Packages SHOULD NOT reiterate any of the behavior described in
      this document, unless required for clarity or emphasis. However, such
      packages MUST describe the behavior that extends or modifies the
      behavior described in this document.</t>

      <t>Info Packages MUST NOT weaken any behavior designated with "SHOULD"
      or "MUST" in this document. However, Info Packages MAY strengthen
      "SHOULD", "MAY", or "RECOMMENDED" requirements to "MUST" strength if the
      application requires it.</t>

      <t>In addition to the normal sections expected in standards-track RFCs
      and SIP extension documents, authors of Info Packages need to address
      each of the issues detailed in the following subsections, whenever

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>This section, which MUST be present, describes why any of the other
        established user-to-user data transfer protocols are not appropriate
        for the given Info Package. Common reasons can be a requirement for
        SIP Proxies or back-to-back User Agents (B2BUAs) to see the
        application level information. Consideration in this section MUST
        describe what happens if one or both endpoints encrypt the

        designates the Info Package. The name MUST conform to the token ABNF
        production described in <xref target="S.ABNF"></xref>. It MUST include
        the information that appears in the IANA registration of the token.
        For information on registering such types, see <xref

      <section title="Info Package Parameters">

      <section title="Info Package Tags">
        <t>If useful for the Info Package to have SIP option tags, this is the

        expected in INFO requests. Such packages MUST specify or cite detailed
        specifications for the syntax and semantics associated with such a
        body.</t>

        <t>The UAS MUST enumerate every MIME type associated with the Info
        Packages advertised in the UAS' Recv-Info header the UAS is willing to
        receive. If a UAC sends a body that includes something not enumerated
        by the UAS, this is a protocol error and the UAS MUST respond
        appropriately.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="UAC generation of INFO requests">
        <t>Each Info Package MUST describe the process by which a UA generates
        and sends an INFO request. This includes detailed information about
        what events cause the UA to send an INFO request.</t>

        <t>If the Info Package does not allow overlapping (outstanding) INFO
        requests, the Info Package MUST disclose this in the section
        describing UA generation of INFO requests. Note the generic protocol
        machinery of the INFO method has no way of enforcing such a
        requirement. <xref target="S.UAS_proc"></xref> describes this
        situation.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="S.UAS_proc" title="UAS processing of INFO requests">
        <t>The Info Package MAY describe the process followed by the UA upon
        receipt of an INFO request. Since INFO does not change SIP state, and
        may not even change application state, there may be no useful guidance
        required in the Info Package specification for UA processing.</t>

        <t>If the info Package does not permit overlapping INFO requests, it
        is important to note the issuance of overlapping INFO requests is an
        application-layer protocol failure and not an INFO method failure.
        Therefore, in the event a UAC issues overlapping INFO requests for an
        Info Package, the UAS MUST NOT return an error response as a result of
        the overlapping INFO request. Of course, if there are other problems
        with the request that results in a failure, the UAC issues the
        appropriate response code. This section of the Info Package
        specification MUST describe the application level response to
        overlapping INFO requests. Examples include a new INFO request back to
        the offending UAC indicating an application error, ignoring the
        overlapping request and processing it to the UAS' best effort, or
        terminating the entire SIP session.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Rate of INFO Requests">
        <t>Each Info Package MUST define a requirement of MUST strength which
        defines an absolute maximum on the rate at which an Info Package of a
        given type can generate INFO messages by a UA in a session.</t>

        <t>If possible, a package MUST define a throttle mechanism that allows
        UAs to further limit the rate of INFO messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IANA Registrations">
        <t>The Info Package MUST have an IANA Considerations section that
        includes definitions for the Info Package Name and, if needed,
        supported MIME types.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>The INFO mechanism transports application level information. One
        implication of this is INFO messages may require a higher level of
        protection than the underlying SIP-based session signaling. If the
        application transports sensitive information, such as credit card
        numbers, health history, personal identifiers, and so on, the Info
        Package MUST document security procedures that exceed the default
        procedures presented in this document. In most circumstances, it is
        not sufficient for a package to attempt to mandate TLS for the
        signaling channel to secure the data carried by the INFO.
        Intermediaries will have access to the payload and past the first hop,
        there is no way to assure subsequent hops will not transmit the
        payload in clear text. The only way to ensure secure transport at the
        application level is to have the security at the application level.
        The most common method of achieving this is to use end-to-end security
        techniques such as <xref target="RFC3851">S/MIME</xref>. If the
        application demands this level of security, the Info Package
        definition MUST indicate such.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Examples">
        <t>We RECOMMEND Info Packages include several demonstrative message
        flow diagrams paired with several typical, syntactically correct, and
        complete messages.</t>

        <t>Documents describing Info Packages MUST clearly indicate the
        examples are informative and not normative, with instructions that
        implementers refer to the main text of the document for exact protocol
        details.</t>

    <section title="Modifications to SIP Change Process">
      <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC3427">RFC 3427</xref> to add a
      process for registering new Info Packages. The process for registering
      new Info Packages follows the process outlined in Section 4.3 of RFC
      3427 for the registration of SIP Event Packages. Namely, the
      registration of a new SIP Info Package requires the DISPATCH chairs to
      assign an individual to perform expert review of the proposal if the
      work is not a RAI work item in itself.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>By eliminating multiple uses of INFO messages without adequate
      community review and by eliminating the possibility for rogue SIP User
      Agents from confusing another User Agent by purposely sending unrelated
      INFO messages, we expect this document's clarification of the use of
      INFO to improve the security of the Internet. Whilst rogue UACs can
      still send unrelated INFO messages, this framework provides mechanisms
      for which the UAS and other security devices can filter for approved
      Info Packages.</t>

      <t>If the content of the Info Package payload is private, User Agents
      will need to use end-to-end encryption, such as S/MIME, to prevent
      access to the content. This is particularly important as transport of
      INFO is likely not to be end-to-end, but through SIP proxies and
      back-to-back user agents (B2BUA's), which the user may not trust.</t>

      <t>The INFO mechanism transports application level information. One
      implication of this is INFO messages may require a higher level of
      protection than the underlying SIP-based session signaling. In
      particular, if one does not protect the SIP signaling from eavesdropping
      or authentication and repudiation attacks, for example by using TLS
      transport, then the INFO request and its contents will be vulnerable, as
      well. Even with SIP/TLS, any SIP hop along the path from UAC to UAS can
      view, modify, or intercept INFO requests, as they can with any SIP
      request. This means some applications may require end-to-end encryption
      of the INFO payload, beyond, for example, hop-by-hop protection of the
      SIP signaling itself. Since the application dictates the level of
      security required, individual Info Packages have to enumerate these
      requirements. In any event, the INFO Framework described by this
      document provides the tools for such secure, end-to-end transport of
      application data.</t>

      <t>One interesting property of Info Package use is one can reuse the
      same digest-challenge mechanism used for INVITE-based authentication for
      the INFO request. For example, one could use a quality-of-protection
      (qop) value of authentication with integrity (auth-int), to challenge
      the request and its body, and prevent intermediate devices from
      modifying the body. However this assumes the device which knows the
      credentials in order to perform the INVITE challenge is still in the
      path for the INFO, or that the far-end UAS knows such credentials.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants
            and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been
            defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be
            assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption
            or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such
            quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all
            implementations, their assignment must be administered by a
            central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by
            the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt;
            In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs
            guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be
            assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If
            IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace,
            IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that
            role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in
            formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and
            provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be
            included in documents that place demands on
            IANA.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This
            document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
            Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
            improvements.</t>

            Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate
            telecommunication networks (also known as enterprise networks).
            SIP is an Internet application-layer control (signalling) protocol
            for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more
            participants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone
            calls. QSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying, and
            terminating circuit-switched calls (in particular, telephone
            calls) within Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG
            is specified in a number of Ecma Standards and published also as
            ISO/IEC standards. This document specifies an Internet Best
            Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests

          <abstract>
            <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
            protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
            systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used
            for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers
            and distributed object management systems, through extension of
            its request methods, error codes and headers . A feature of HTTP
            is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing
            systems to be built independently of the data being
            transferred.</t>

            <t>HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
            initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
            referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .</t>

            <t>Third party call control refers to the ability of one entity to
            create a call in which communication is actually between other
            parties. Third party call control is possible using the mechanisms

            there are several possible approaches, each with different
            benefits and drawbacks. This document discusses best current
            practices for the usage of SIP for third party call control. This

            <t>This memo documents a process intended to apply architectural
            discipline to the future development of the Session Initiation
            Protocol (SIP). There have been concerns with regards to new SIP
            proposals. Specifically, that the addition of new SIP features can
            be damaging towards security and/or greatly increase the
            complexity of the protocol. The Transport Area directors, along
            with the SIP and Session Initiation Proposal Investigation
            (SIPPING) working group chairs, have provided suggestions for SIP
            modifications and extensions. This document specifies an Internet

          <abstract>
            <t>Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages
            between users in near real-time. These messages are usually, but
            not required to be, short. IMs are often used in a conversational
            mode, that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast
            enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.
            This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the
            Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of
            Instant Messages. Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to
            SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of
            that protocol. MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of
            MIME body parts. MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP
            dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much
            like pager messages. MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context
            of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS

            <t>In SIP-based networks, there is a need to provide basic network

            applications. In order to have interoperability between servers
            offering these building blocks (also known as Media Servers) and

            messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader
            applications.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; SCTP is a reliable transport
            protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such
            as IP. It offers the following services to its
            users:&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; -- acknowledged error-free
            non-duplicated transfer of user data,&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; -- data
            fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU
            size,&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; -- sequenced delivery of user messages
            within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival
            delivery of individual user messages,&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; --
            optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP
            packet, and&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; -- network-level fault tolerance
            through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an
            association.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; The design of SCTP includes

          <abstract>
            <t>Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can
            create an association between endpoints known as a dialog. Some of
            these methods can also create a different, but related,
            association within an existing dialog. These multiple
            associations, or dialog usages, require carefully coordinated
            processing as they have independent life-cycles, but share common
            dialog state. Processing multiple dialog usages correctly is not
            completely understood. What is understood is difficult to
            implement.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This memo argues that multiple
            dialog usages should be avoided. It discusses alternatives to
            their use and clarifies essential behavior for elements that
            cannot currently avoid them.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This is an
            informative document and makes no normative statements of any
            kind. This memo provides information for the Internet
            community.</t>

            <t>The MRCPv2 protocol allows client hosts to control media
            service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers,
            verifiers and identifiers residing in servers on the network.
            MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol - it relies on other
            protocols, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to rendezvous
            MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and
            the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover and
            exchange capabilities. It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish
            the media sessions and associated parameters between the media
            source or sink and the media server. Once this is done, the MRCPv2
            protocol exchange operates over the control session established
            above, allowing the client to control the media processing
            resources on the speech resource server.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and
            invoke many different types of services on IP Media Servers.
            Clients can use it to define how multimedia sessions interact on a
            Media Server and to apply services to individuals or groups of
            users. MSML can be used, for example, to control Media Server
            conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing,
            create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the
            properties of media streams. As well, clients can use MSML to
            define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of
            application interactions with users or conferences. Transformation
            of media streams to and from users or conferences as well as IVR
            dialogs are examples of such interactions, which are specified
            using MSML. MSML clients may also invoke dialogs with individual
            users or with groups of conference participants using
            VoiceXML.</t>

    <section anchor="S.info-packages" title="Info Package Considerations">
      <t>This section covers several issues that one should take into
      consideration when proposing new Info Packages.</t>

      <section anchor="nil" title="Appropriateness of Usage">
        <t>When designing an Info Package using the method described in this
        document for application level information exchange, it is important
        to consider: is INFO and, more importantly, is signaling within a SIP
        session, an appropriate mechanism for the problem set? Is it because
        it is the most reasonable and appropriate choice, or merely because
        "it's easy"?</t>

        <t>These are difficult issues to consider, especially when presented
        with real-world deadlines and implementation cost issues. However,
        choosing to use INFO for inappropriate uses *will* lead to issues in
        the real world, not the least of which are certain types of
        middleboxes which will remove the device from the network if it is
        found to cause damage to other SIP nodes.</t>

        <t>Therefore, the following sections provide consideration guidelines
        and alternatives to INFO use.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Dialog Fate-Sharing">
        <t>INFO, by design, is a method within an INVITE dialog usage. <xref
        target="RFC5057">RFC 5057</xref> enumerates the problems with using
        dialogs for multiple usages, and we strongly urge the reader to review
        RFC 5057. The most relevant issue is a failure of transmission or
        processing of an INFO request may render the INVITE session
        terminated, depending on the type of failure. Prior to RFC 5057, it
        was not clear if the INFO usage was a separate usage or not. RFC 5057
        clarifies the INFO method is always part of the INVITE usage.</t>

        <t>Some uses of INFO can tolerate this fate sharing of the INFO
        message over the entire session. For example, in the SIP-T usage, it
        may be acceptable for a call to fail, or to tear down the call, if one
        cannot deliver the associated SS7 information. The same is usually
        true for DTMF. However, it may not be acceptable for a call to fail
        if, for example, a DTMF buffer overflows. Then again, for some
        services, that may be the exact desired behavior.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Messaging Rates and Volume">
        <t>There is no throttling mechanism for INFO. Consider that most call
        signaling occurs on the order of 7-10 messages per 3 minutes, although
        with a burst of 5-7 messages in one second during call setup. DTMF
        tones occur in bursts at a rate of up to 20 messages per second. This
        is a considerably higher rate than for call signaling. Sending
        constant GPS location updates, on the other hand, would incur an undue
        burden on SIP Proxies along the path.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, SIP messages tend to be relatively small, on the order
        of 500 Bytes to 32K Bytes. SIP is a poor mechanism for direct exchange
        of bulk data beyond these limits, especially if the headers plus body
        exceed the <xref target="RFC0768">UDP MTU</xref>. Appropriate
        mechanisms for such traffic include <xref
        target="RFC4975">MSRP</xref>, <xref target="RFC4145">COMEDIA</xref>,
        or <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Is there a better alternative?">
        <t>The first alternative for application level interaction is SIP
        Events, also known as <xref target="RFC3265">SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY</xref>.
        In this model, a user agent requests state information, such as key
        pad presses from a device to an application server or key map images
        from an application server to a device. The SUBSCRIBE creates a new
        session that does not share the fate of the related INVITE-initiated
        session. Moreover, using the SUBSCRIBE model enables multiple
        applications to receive state updates. These applications can be
        outside the media path and potentially outside the INVITE-initiated
        session's proxy path. In fact, SIUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY is your only option
        if you need to exchange data outside a communications session.</t>

        <t>SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages pass through the SIP signaling
        infrastructure, such as SIP Proxies and B2BUAs. Application designers
        need to understand this can be a feature, as when the User Agents are
        exchanging information that elements in the SIP signaling path need to
        be aware of. Conversely, this can be a problem, as messages these
        network elements have no interest in can put a significant burden on
        those element's ability to process other traffic. Moreover, such
        network elements may not be able to read end-to-end encrypted
        SUBSCRIBE or NOTIFY bodies.</t>

        <t>Implementers do need to be aware the price of having a protocol
        that works in all cases, can scale, can easily load balance, and will
        not mysteriously fail a session in the event of state synchronization
        failure does come at a cost. Session establishment is a minimum of two
        messages in addition to the INVITE session establishment. If the
        SUBSCRIBE application is co-resident with the INVITE application, the
        application will have to manage two SIP sessions instead of one.
        Tracking the application level state dominates memory and processing
        for some applications, and as such, the doubling of SIP sessions is
        not an issue. However, for other applications, this may be an
        issue.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="RFC3428">MESSAGE method</xref> defines one-time
        instant message exchange, typically for sending MIME contents for
        rendering to the user.</t>

        <t>Another model for application level information exchange is to
        establish a communication channel in the media plane. One model for
        this is <xref target="I-D.ietf-speechsc-mrcpv2">MRCPv2</xref>. Here,
        the INVITE-initiated session establishes a separate reliable,
        connection-oriented channel, such as a <xref
        target="RFC0793">TCP</xref> or <xref target="RFC4960">SCTP</xref>
        stream. One uses SIP to locate the remote endpoint, but uses a direct
        connection for the UUI. One then can create whatever protocol one
        wishes, whether from scratch (as in MRCPv2) or using a substrate such
        as <xref target="RFC3080">BEEP</xref>.</t>

        <t>A low latency requirement for the exchange of information is one
        strong indicator for using a media channel. Exchanging information
        through the SIP routing network can introduce hundreds of milliseconds
        of latency. In addition, if there will be a lot of information
        exchanged, and there is no need for the SIP routing network to examine
        the information, one should use a separate media channel.</t>

        <t>Another model is to use a totally externally signaled channel, such
        as <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref>. In this model, the user agent
        knows about a rendezvous point to direct HTTP requests to for the
        transfer of information. Examples include encoding of a prompt to
        retrieve in the SIP Request URI in <xref target="RFC4240">RFC
        4240</xref> or the encoding of a SUBMIT target in a <xref
        target="W3C.REC-voicexml21-20070619">VoiceXML</xref> script.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4975">MSRP</xref> defines session-based instant
        messaging as well as bulk file transfer and other such large-volume
        uses. It is part of an INVITE-based session, similar to other media.
        Unlike INFO, MSRP follows a direct media path, rather than through the
        network elements composing the SIP signaling path.</t>

        <t>A common reason people in the past used INFO for application level
        information exchange is the negotiation is very lightweight compared
        to SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY. This is more especially so if it is not certain
        if there will be application level information exchange. The
        SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY machinery requires the user agents to exchange rich
        capabilities and maintain state for additional SIP sessions. However,
        this is a weak argument if there is a high likelihood of application
        level information exchange. In this case, we recommend the use of a
        more robust application level information exchange protocol.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="S.Alternatives"
               title="Alternatives for Common INFO Use">
        <t>What alternatives to INFO are there for UA-to-UA application
        session signaling? As noted above, there are three broad classes of
        session signaling available. The choice depends on the circumstances.
        Following is a list of situations that have used INFO in the
        past.<list style="symbols">
            <t>State updates</t>

            <t>User stimulus</t>

            <t>Direct signaling channel</t>

            <t>Proxy-aware signaling</t>

            <t>Dialog probe</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="State Updates">
          <t>This is the broad class of one User Agent updating another with
          changes in state. The design goal of the <xref
          target="RFC3265">SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY</xref> event framework is to meet
          just this need.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="User Stimulus: Touch Tones and Others">
          <t>This is the class of the user entering stimulus at one User
          Agent, and the User Agent transporting that stimulus to the other. A
          key thing to realize is key presses on the telephone keypad is user
          stimulus. Thus, the appropriate mechanism to use here is <xref
          target="RFC4730">KPML</xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Direct Signaling Channel">
          <t>State updates and user stimulus tend to have relatively few
          messages per session. Sometimes, User Agents need to exchange a
          relatively high number of messages. In addition, User Agents may
          have a need for a relatively low-latency exchange of messages. In
          this latter case, the User Agent may not be able to tolerate the
          latency introduced by intermediate proxies. Likewise, the
          intermediate proxies may have no interest in processing all of that
          data.</t>

          <t>In this case, establishing a separate, direct control channel, as
          in <xref target="RFC4975">MSRP</xref> or <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-speechsc-mrcpv2">MRCPv2</xref> is appropriate.</t>

          <t>In addition, not every situation requires a SIP solution. Some
          signaling is really just one-shot to third-party endpoints. That
          situation may better be handled using an appropriate protocol, such
          as <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Proxy-Aware Signaling">
          <t>Sometimes, one does want proxies to be in the signaling path for
          UA-to-UA application signaling. In this case, the use of a SIP
          request is appropriate. To date, there are no mechanisms for
          completely disambiguating INFO requests. For example, one could
          create a registry of INFO packages. The definition of the package
          would define the contexts for the various MIME Content-Types, as
          well as the context of the request itself. However, a package can
          have multiple content types. Moreover, having the context, or
          package identifier, at the SIP level precludes bundling multiple
          contexts responding in the same INFO request. For example, a User
          Agent might want to bundle two different responses in a
          multipart/mixed MIME body type.</t>

          <t>Because there is no difference in either the protocol machinery
          or registration process due to these factors, we will not create an
          INFO framework. If one needs a SIP User Agent-to-SIP User Agent
          application session signaling transport protocol that touches all
          Record-Route proxies in a path, one MUST create a new SIP method as
          described in Section 27.4 of <xref target="RFC3261">RFC
          3261</xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Dialog Probe">
          <t>Some implementations in the wild use INFO to probe if an
          INVITE-initiated session is alive. While this works, it is NOT
          RECOMMENDED. In particular, <xref target="RFC4028">RFC 4028</xref>
          describes how to ensure an INVITE-initiated session is alive.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Malicious Indicator">
          <t>Take the case of Malicious Indicator. This is where a subscriber
          receives a call, realizes it is a malicious call (threatening, SPIT,
          etc.). They then press the SPIT button (or press *xx), which tells
          their service provider to mark the UAC as a bad actor. One might be
          tempted to think that INFO would be a great option for this service.
          It follows the return path of the INVITE, and so the INFO will hit
          the caller's inbound proxy, which it can learn the caller is
          (statistically) a bad actor. That way the inbound proxy can do stuff
          like notify law enforcement, add a vote to "this is a SPIT source,"
          or other useful action.</t>

          <t>However, consider a few issues. First, since INFO lives
          exclusively within an established session, there is no way to assert
          this message after the call completes. Second, this mechanism relies
          on an active service provider topology. If there is no proxy in the
          chain that will eat the INFO, the caller will see the "this is a bad
          guy" message, which may have consequences in the real world. Third,
          there is no a'priori way for the UAS to know whether it can issue
          the INFO. The caller certainly will not advertise, "please tell me
          if I am bad, particularly I know in advance that I *am* a bad
          actor."</t>

          <t>One approach is for the service provider's proxy to SUBSCRIBE for
          the SPIT event at the UAS. At this point, life is good,
          interoperable, and works across networks. This enables events after
          the session is torn down, as presumably the SPIT event will refer
          not to, "this session," which does not exist, but to "that session
          identifier," which exists (and is theoretically unique) forever.</t>

          <t>Another approach that saves considerably on the overhead of
          subscriptions would be for the service provider to insert a HTTP URI
          in the initial INVITE, noting it is for reporting malicious
          behavior. When the subscriber presses the SPIT button, an HTTP POST
          gets executed, delivering the call information to the service
          provider. The service provider can encode basic call information in
          the HTTP URI and can instruct the device to send whatever arbitrary
          data is necessary in the POST. This method has the added benefit of
          being entirely outside the real-time SIP proxy network.</t>

      <t>We are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jonathan Rosenberg did
      the original "INFO Considered Harmful" Internet Draft on 26 December
      2002, which influenced the work group and this document. Likewise, Dean
      Willis influenced the text from his Internet Draft, "Packaging and
      Negotiation of INFO Methods for the Session Initiation Protocol" of 15
      January 2003. Four paragraphs come from Jonathan Rosenberg's INFO Litmus
      draft. My, we have been working on this for a long time!</t>

      <t>This and other related drafts have elicited well over 450 messages on
      the SIP list. People who have argued with its thesis, supported its
      thesis, added to the examples, or argued with the examples, include the
