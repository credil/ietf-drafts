Abstract

   This memo defines a new Media Feature Tag "text-turntaking" for use
   in SIP registration and session establishment.  This is used to
   indicate if a device capable of text communication has limitations in
   its capabilities requiring the users to apply some turn-taking
   habits.

Internet-Draft     'Text-turntaking' Media Feature Tag     November 2007


1.  Introduction

   Media feature tags for use in SIP headers are introduced in RFC 3840
   [1].  They are used with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

   When interworking with legacy telecommunication devices through a
   gateway, an IP based text phone using SIP may be required to limit
   its capabilities to match those devices.  For example, V.21 based
   textphones are full duplex in transport, but have varying handling of
   the presentation.  Some types merge the two sources in one window.
   Some have a kind of irc-like display with labels in front of the text
   from different participants.  And yet some do a split in two windows
   of real-time text from each direction.

   In order for a SIP-based text capable device to display an
   appropriate user interface when interacting with one of these legacy
   devices, it is necessary to convey a parameter indicating the limited
   capability of the legacy device.  It is also of interest to route
   calls to the most capable device.

   When it is interacting with a legacy device, an IP text phone may
   receive an offer that contains the 'text-turntaking' tag indicating
   some restriction.  That tag then acts as a cue to configure the user
   interface appropriately, although there is nothing in the generated
   answer to indicate that this has been done.  Similiarly, if an answer
   is received that contains a 'text-turntaking' tag, that indicates
   that the remote device has limited capabilities, and the user-
   interface should present some indication of this to the user.

   More information on handling of real-time text is found in Framework
   for real-time text over IP using the Session Initiation Protocol [1].
   This memo defines such a parameter.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].


3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a Media Feature tag 'text-turntaking'.
   Its formatting in SIP headers is described in the following:

   Media Feature Tag name: sip.text-turntaking

Internet-Draft     'Text-turntaking' Media Feature Tag     November 2007


   ASN.1 Identifier: y.y.

   Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: The sip.text-
   turntaking media feature tag indicates whether a communications
   device can simultaneously handle the real-time text medium and audio
   in its user interface or towards attached devices, or if limitations
   must be applied by users who communicate with the device.

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: Token with an
   equality relationship.

   Defined values are:

   no:  The device can handle real-time text simultaneously in both
      directions and if it supports audio, it can also be handled
      simultaneously. (default)

   unspecified:  The device requires some ordered turn-taking to take
      place.  It is not specified how strict this turntaking must be,
      and it is left to the users to figure out what level of turntaking
      signaling is needed.

   soft:  The device can handle simultaneous transmission of text in
      both directions, but there is a risk that the display is made in
      one window so that it requires "soft" turntaking indications in
      order to get a readable display.  Simultaneous transmission can be
      used for interruptions and alerting.  If audio is supported, it is
      handled alternating with text.

   strict:  The device cannot handle real-time text transmission in both
      directions in its user interface or towards attached devices.
      Strict turntaking must be applied by the users and is usually
      signalled by agreed turntaking indicators in the text medium.  If
      audio is supported, it shall only be used alternating with text.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This
   feature tag is most useful in a communications application for
   describing the capabilities of a PSTN textphone gateway, connecting
   SIP devices with legacy textphones, with the intention both to
   support routing of the call and indication to the SIP device user if
   turntaking must be applied.

   Examples of typical use: Choosing to communicate with a native, real-
   time text capable device rather than a legacy textphone behind a
   gateway, when a selection is possible.  Instruct the user of the SIP
   device about the need to apply turntaking habits as used with legacy
   textphones when the call is made through a gateway with that kind of

   Related standards or documents: RFC XXXX.

   Security Considerations: Security considerations for this media
   feature tag are discussed in Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.


4.  Example

   The following example shows the use of the 'text-turntaking' tag in a
   SIP message.


       REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0
    From: sip:user@example.com;tag=asd98
    To: sip:user@example.com
    Call-ID: hh89as0d-asd88jkk@host.example.com
    CSeq: 9987 REGISTER
    Max-Forwards: 70
    Via: SIP/2.0/UDP host.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKnashds8
    Contact: <sip:user@host.example.com>;audio;text;text-turntaking=soft
    Content-Length: 0


5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for this media feature tag are discussed in
   Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.
