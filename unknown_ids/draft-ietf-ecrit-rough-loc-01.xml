      <t>Emergency calling works best when precise location is available for
      emergency call routing. However, there are situations in which a
      location provider is unable or unwilling to provide precise location,
      yet still wishes to enable subscribers to make emergency calls. This
      document describes the level of location accuracy that providers must
      provide to enable emergency call routing. In addition, we descibe how
      emergency services and non-emergency services can be invoked by an
      endpoint that does not have access to its precise location.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Information about the location of an emergency caller is a critical
      input to the process of emergency call establshment. Endpoint
      location is used to determine which Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
      should be the destination of the call. (The entire emergency calling
      process is described in detail in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"></xref>.) This process is most likely
      to work properly when the endpoint is provided with the most accurate and
      precise information available about its location. Using location
      information with maximal precision and accuracy minimizes the chance
      that a call will be mis-routed. In addition, when that location is provided to
      the endpoint, the endpoint is able to verify that the location is
      correct (to the extent of the endpoint's knowledge of its own location)
      prior to an emergency call, and is able to perform emergency call
      routing functions on its own, providing redundancy for network-provided
      functions.</t>

      <t>However, there may be situations in which it is not feasible for
      endpoints to be provided with maximally precise and accurate location.
      These cases may arise when computing precise location is an expensive or
      time-consuming operation (e.g., in the case of wireless triangulation),
      and location is needed quickly, as is often the case in emergency
      situations. Or they may arise because the policy of a location
      provider does not allow precise location to be provided to the endpoint.
      While it is undesirable to use
      imprecise location for emergency call routing, the possibility that
      precise location may not be available to the calling device must be
      accomodated in order to make emergency calling possible in the largest
      possible set of circumstances.</t>

      <t>This document is concerned with imprecise location only in the context of
      routing emergency calls, i.e., for determining the correct PSAP to
      receive a given call (e.g., via a LoST query <xref
      target="RFC5222"></xref>).  Depending on the the structure of the local emergency service network, the location information provided to the endpoint may also be used to route the call to an entity that is authorized to request precise location, e.g., an Emergency Services Routing Proxy.  The requirements and processes described in this document are the same for both cases.
      </t>
      
      <t>Location information may also be
      used in the emergency calling framework to direct the dispatch of
      emergency responders. This usage is treated separately from call routing
      for purposes of this document, and this document does not place
      requirements on the location provided for dispatch, although it should
      obviously be as precise as possible. The only provision for dispatch in
      this document is a recommendation that the location provider supply
      endpoints with a URI that can be used by a PSAP or other emergency
      authority to obtain a different location for use in dispatch, hopefully
      more precise than the one used for routing.</t>

      <t>This document describes the use of imprecise location information in
      the emergency call routing system. <xref target="det-section"></xref>
      describes how location providers can determine the precision necessary
      to support emergency call routing, and how they can use this information to optimize location delivery. <xref target="lbs-section"></xref>
      describes how emergency calls are placed in such an environment, and how
      non-emergency services can be invoked when precise location is not
      available to the endpoint by value.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>We consider in this document patterns of interaction as described in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"></xref>. The two main parties of
      interest are endpoints and location providers. Endpoints are hosts
      connected to the Internet that originate emergency calls in the
      emergency calling architecture, while location providers are entities
      that supply location information that is used for emergency calling. In
      addition, we will discuss how these parties interact with the LoST
      mapping infrastructure <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-mapping-arch"></xref>, and with emergency and
      non-emergency location-based service providers.</t>
      
      <t>For convenience, we say that location information, either in LoST queries or in service boundaries, is provided "in geodetic form" if it is provided in the "geodetic-2d" LoST location profile, and "in civic form" if it is provided in the "civic" profile.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="det-section"
             title="Determining sufficient location precision">
      <t>A location provider wishing to provide location information usable
      for emergency call routing requires a mechanism for determining when a
      description of location (e.g., a polygon) is precise enough to be used
      for emergency call routing. This mechanism might be used to decide when
      to terminate a positioning process that converges over time, or to
      choose a polygon larger than the known location of the endpoint (in
      order to obscure the known location of the endpoint), while preserving
      the utility of the location for emergency call routing.</t>

      <t>There are three basic requirements for a location to be usable for
      emergency call routing: <list style="numbers">
          <t>The location SHOULD be sufficiently precise that a LoST request
          with the location and any service URN will return a unique URI
          mapping value. This may not be possible in all cases, e.g., because
          of overlapping service boundaries creating areas with non-unique mappings, or because of  positioning limitations that prevent sufficiently precise positioning.</t>

          <t>When the location of the endpoint is known by the provider to
          greater precision than is being provided, the provided location MUST
          return the same mappings from LoST, for all service URNs, as the
          known location.</t>
          
          <t>When the location of the endpoint is known by the provider to
          greater precision than is being provided, the provided location MUST  
          contain the precise location (as a geographic subset).</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      
      <t>These requirements lead naturally to the idea of a "location filter".  
      A location filter is a collection of geographical regions satisfying the 
      following criteria:
      <list style="numbers">
          <t>For any location value that is a subset of a filter region, a LoST 
          request for any service will return a unique mapping result.</t>
          <t>Any two locations within the same filter region receive the same 
          LoST results for all services</t>
        </list>
      Given a location filter, it is easy to determine when a given location value
      is sufficiently precise, or to create a less precise version of location that 
      is still precise enough.  Namely, a location value is precise enough when
      if fits within a given filter region, and any superset of a location value 
      (e.g., a polygon containing a point) can be used as a less precise version of
      the location value as long as it still fits within the same filter region.
      </t>

      <t>
      For example, a simple fuzzing algorithm that maintains sufficient precision for 
      emergency services is to replace a given location value with the filter region
      that contains it.  This way, the server can compute the filter off-line (as 
      described below), then provision the location of each possible target by 
      storing a pointer to the filter region that contains the target's location.
      </t>
      
      <t>The remainder of this section discusses the concept of location filtering in more detail, and  describes how a location server can construct and maintain a location filter based on information from the LoST mapping infrastructure.</t>

      <section anchor="filter-use-section" title="Location filtering">
        <t>With each service-to-URI mapping, a LoST query provides a service
        boundary that represents the set of locations in which that mapping is
        valid. A consequence of this is that given a set of service boundaries
        for different services, the intersection of those service
        boundaries is the region in which two mappings are valid. If one service 
        boundary corresponds to the area where "urn:service:sos.fire" is served by 
        "sip:fire@example.com" and another maps "urn:service:sos.police" to
        "sip:police@example.com", then the intersection is the are where both of 
        these mappings are valid
        ("urn:service:sos.fire" maps to "sip:fire@example.com" and
        "urn:service:sos.police" maps to "sip:police@example.com"). Outside
        that area, one or more of the mappings is invalid. So as was suggested above,
        the intersection of two service boundaries defines a set of mappings, 
        and any two locations within that intersection are equivalent for the 
        purpose of LoST mapping (i.e., emergency call routing).</t>

        	</artwork>
        </figure>


        <t>The regions in a location filter can thus be constructed by taking 
        intersections of service boundaries.  <xref target="filter-fig"/> shows 
        a simple location filter: Starting with a set of four service boundaries
        for two different services.  The filter that results from taking intersections
        of these boundaries has three regions:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>A region where police calls are directed to A and fire calls are directed to C.</t>
          <t>A region where police calls are directed to A and fire calls are directed to D.</t>
          <t>A region where police calls are directed to B and fire calls are directed to D.</t>
        </list>
        These regions satisfy the criteria for a location filter because each one 
        has a unique set of mappings and those mappings are valid across the entire 
        region. The service regions for B and C do not overlap -- there is no place where 
        police calls go to B and fire calls to C -- so there is no (B,C) region.  
        </t> 
        
        <t>More generally, a filter region is the intersection of the service boundaries 
        for all services available within the region. A filter can used to determine whether a
        location is usable for emergency call routing in the following
        way:<list style="numbers">
            <t>The location SHOULD be contained in exactly one of the regions
            in the filter. This guarantees that LoST mappings are unique.</t>

            <t>When the precise location of the endpoint is known, the provided
            location MUST be contained in the same region(s) of the filter as
            the known location. This guarantees that LoST queries with the
            provided location return the same results as those done with the
            known location.</t>

            <t>When the precise location of the endpoint is known, the provided 
            location MUST contain the precise location (as a geographic subset).</t>
          </list>
        Filter regions can be deduced constructed from LoST mappings for a sample location 
        by intersecting all the service boundaries for services available at that point.  
        <xref target="sample-fig"></xref> illustrates how the filter region containing the 
        point X is the intersection of the service boundaries for police and fire 
        services that serve X. </t>
        
        <t>If the server also stores the lists of URN-URI mappings for each region, x
        then the filter can also be used as a cache for LoST mappings; the
        LoST mappings for a location are the mappings bound to the
        region(s) containing it. </t>

        <t>When the location of the endpoint is known to more precision than
        the location provided to the endpoint, although any location meeting
        the two criteria above is equivalent to the known location for
        purposes of LoST, the provided location MUST contain the known
        location in order to avoid errors if the location is used for other
        purposes in the course of an emergency (e.g., if the location is
        provided to first responders for dispatch). This guarantee also allows
        the endpoint to do some course verification that the provided location
        is correct (in order to prevent very gross errors in routing).
        Thus, any location that (1) contains the known location and (2)
        is contained in the same filter region as the known location is
        allowable.  Locations that also are contained in only one filter region
        are preferred.  Adding randomness to the provided locations may have
        privacy benefits in some cases, as discussed in the security
        considerations below.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Constructing location filters">
        <t>For simplicity, we assume that the entity performing filtering will
        only be using the filter to test locations contained within a
        particular geographic "coverage area".  In principle, this coverage area
        could be the entire world, but assuming a more limited coverage area allows
        for a filter to be built more quickly. </t>

        <t>Given a coverage area and the ability 
        to act as a LoST client, a location service provider can autonomously compute a
        location filter by constructing regions around 
        sample points until it has a collection of filter regions that collectively 
        cover its service region.  (The process for an individual point is 
        illustrated in <xref target="sample-fig"></xref>.)</t>
        
        <t>In order to ensure that all services boundaries are taken into account, 
        the server starts by issuing a &lt;listServicesByLocation&gt; query, and
        caching the list of services that it returns, along with the corresponding 
        service list boundary <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost-servicelistboundary"></xref>.
        The server then samples points within that service list boundary, retrieving
        mappings with service boundaries for each service in the service list and 
        intersecting the service boundaries to obtain a new filter region.  In 
        pseudocode, the algorithm is as follows:</t>
                
        <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
Set FILTER = the empty set
While filter does not cover LS coverage area
    Choose a random uncovered point X in the LS coverage area
    Perform a LoST <listServicesByLocation> query for X 
        Set SL = <serviceList> from LoST response
        Set SLB = <serviceListBoundary> from LoST response
	    If SLB is not provided, choose new point X and re-query
	    If more than 100 points X have been tried
	    	Set R = uncovered area
	    	Add R to FILTER
	    	END
    While filter does not cover SLB
        Choose a random uncovered point Y in SLB
        Set R = SLB
        For each service S in SL
            Perform a LoST <findService> query for Y and S 
                Set SB = <serviceBoundary> from LoST response
            If SB is not provided, return an error
            Else set R = intersection( R, SB(S,Y) )
        Add R to FILTER 
        ]]>
        </artwork>
        </figure>

		<t>If the LoST servers have been provisioned properly then this 
		algorithm will terminate successfully.  If LoST mapping do not cover 
		part of the service region, then the &lt;serviceListBoundary&gt; will not
		be returned, and the algorithm will give up after 100 queries. This 
		limit on queries introduces some risk that a small covered area will
		be left out of the filter and marked as uncovered; if this is a concern,
		then the query limit can be increased.  </t>
		
		<t>Of course, if the location server operator has information about service
		boundaries through some channel other than LoST, then the LoST queries
		above can be replaced by queries to a local store of mapping information. 
		The choice of random points can also be guided to ensure that all mapped
		areas are covered even if there are some uncovered areas.  The location
		server can also cache service boundaries acquired during the algorithm
		to avoid unnecessary LoST queries.</t>
        
        
        <section title="Civic address considerations"> 
        <t>This algorithm actually results in two filters -- one for geodetic service 
        boundaries and one for civic service boundaries -- since civic and geodetic 
        boundaries cannot be directly compared or intersected.  It is RECOMMENDED that
        location servers always compute a geodetic filter for use with emergency
        services, since the notion of civic service boundaries have some inherent
        ambiguity.</t>       
 
        <t>Indeed, the notion of intersection of civic service boundaries has 
        some dependence on the jurisdiction within which the service boundaries are 
        defined.  Civic service boundaries are comprised of a set of &lt;civicAddress&gt;
        elements, each defining a set of civic addresses that are within the boundary,
        namely those that match the civic elements provided.</t>
        
        <t>When computing the intersection of two civic service boundaries, any 
        &lt;civicAddress&gt; elements that are shared between the two service 
        boundaries MUST be included in the resulting intersection.  When two 
        &lt;civicAddress&gt; elements in the service boundaries being compared are
        different from each other, then their intersection must be computed according
        to local addressing standards.</t> 
        
        <t>Note that the resulting filter regions SHOULD still cover the location 
        server's coverage area, i.e., there should be a filter region that contains 
        every civic address within the coverage area.  In particular, the server 
        SHOULD NOT use a specific address to represent a filter region: Such an 
        address would not include many points in the service region (i.e., it would 
        not meet the third rules from the lists of rules above).  If the server 
        creates a PIDF-LO document describing a civic address that does not 
        contain the precise location of the target, then it MUST set the 'method' 
        element of the PIDF-LO it returns to value 'area-representative' registered 
        in <xref target="iana-sec"></xref>.   </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Maintaining location filters">
        <t>As the LoST mappings that underlie the filter change, the filter
        will need to be updated. The entity maintaining the filter MUST obtain
        a new mapping for a region when an existing mapping expires. The
        service boundary from the new mapping is compared to the service
        boundary from the old mapping: If they are the same, then the filter
        need not be updated. If they differ, then regions in the filter that
        intersect either the old service boundary or the new service
        boundary will need to be recomputed. Note that since this operation
        only requires the server to determine if two service boundaries are
        identical, the server need only store a hash of the old boundary to
        which it can compare a hash of the new boundary.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Applying location filters">
        <t>
      	After constructing a location filter, a location server can use it to 
      	optimize how it delivers location.  When the location server is using a 
      	positioning algorithm that grows more accurate with time, the filter 
      	tells it how long to run the algorithm.  Namely, the algorithm can be 
      	terminated when the estimated location (that is, an uncertainty region
      	containing the target's location) is within one of the regions in the filter.
      	</t>
      	
      	<t>
      	When the location provider knows the precise location of the caller, a 
      	location filter can also be used as a "location cache".  That is, the 
      	location provider can simply look up which of the filter regions contains 
      	the caller's precise location and return that region as the caller's 
      	location, or some subset that contains the precise location. 
      	</t> 
      	
      	<t>
      	This caching strategy allows an additional optimization in some cases: 
      	If the location server knows that the caller's precise location will be 
      	within the same region for a period of time, it can instruct the client 
      	not to re-query in that time.  For instance, if the server is delivering 
      	location over HELD, then it can use the HTTP cache-control headers (e.g., 
      	Expires).  However, the location server MUST NOT instruct the client to 
      	wait for longer than the current filter is valid; the expiry time of the 
      	location MUST be before the earliest expiry of a LoST mapping used 
      	in the filter.

    <section anchor="lbs-section" title="Requesting emergency and non-emergency services">
      <t>When a location provider wishes to deliver endpoints location information that
      is below its maximum available precision while still supporting emergency
      calling, it MUST provide to the endpoint both a location (by value) that
      is sufficient for emergency call routing (as defined above) and a location
      reference (i.e., a URI) that can subsequently be used by authorized
      parties to obtain more precise information about the location of the
      endpoint. The endpoint then can then use both the location value and the
      location reference to request emergency services and other location-based 
      services (LBS).</t>

      <section title="Emergency calling">
        <t>The overall procedure for placing an emergency call is identical to 
        that described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"></xref>. In
        particular, the endpoint requirements in Sections 8 and 9 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"></xref> still apply to an endpoint
        that receives imprecise location.</t>

        <t>In addition, an endpoint that receives
        location both by value and by reference from its location provider
        MUST include both the location value and the location reference in the
        SIP INVITE message that initiates an emergency call, as specified in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance"></xref>. When the
        endpoint supports LoST, it MUST use the location value to obtain a
        PSAP URI for LoST queries before attempting to dereference the
        location reference.  Note that the caller would also have to add the "used-for-routing"
        parameter to the geolocation header that points to the location value
        as inserted into the INVITE message. Note that this process crucially
        relies on the location value having sufficient precision for routing
        emergency calls (see <xref target="det-section"></xref> for techniques
        to ensure the location value is suitable for emergency call
        routing).</t>

        <t>When a PSAP receives a SIP INVITE that contains both a location
        value and a location reference, and the value is too imprecise for use
        in dispatch then the PSAP SHOULD dereference the LbyR to obtain more
        precise information. In turn, the location provided by the location
        provider MUST allow access by all PSAPs whose service boundaries
        overlap with the region served by the location provider. This means
        that either the provider must supply a reference that can be
        dereferenced by any party, or else the provider must establish
        explicit authentication and authorization relationships with all PSAPs
        in its service area.  It is RECOMMENDED that location providers establish
        similar relationships with other PSAPs in adjoining jursidictions --
        even if their service regions do not overlap with the location provider's
        -- in case such a PSAP needs access to precise location information,
        for example, if it is acting as a backup for one of the location provider's
        normal PSAPs.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non-emergency services">
        <t>Non-emergency LBSs may require more precise information
        than is required for emergency call routing. Therefore, when
        requesting a non-emergency LBS, the endpoint SHOULD include the
        location reference provided by its location provider, and MAY
        additionally provide the location value. If the provided location
        value is not sufficiently precise to deliver the requested service, then
        the LBS provider should then dereference the location value to request
        location information of sufficient precision from the location
        provider. If the dereference fails, then the request for service may
        fail as well.</t>

        <t>Note that when the location reference provided by the location
        provider is access-controled, this dereference may require a
        pre-existing authentication and authorization agreement between the
        LBS provider and the location provider. In such a case, the endpoint
        may not know whether a given non-emergency service is authorized to
        obtain the endpoint's precise location using the location reference.
        The endpoint is always capable of requesting services without knowing
        whether they are authorized; in this way, the endpoint can discover
        authorized services by trial and error. In order to simplify this
        process, a location provider may supply the endpoint with references
        to authorized service providers, although there is currently no
        standard protocol for this transaction.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>This document generalizes the concept of "rough location" that was
      originally discussed in the context of the location hiding problem. This
      concept was put forward by Henning Schulzrinne and Andy Newton, among
      many others, in a long-running ECRIT discussion. </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The use of imprecise location provides a security trade-off for location
      providers.  When location providers are required to provide location in 
      support of emergency services, they have to balance that requirement against
      the risk that location information will be disclosed to an unauthorized party.
      The use of location configuration protocols inherently introduces some risk 
      that an entity other than the target will be able to masquerade as the target
      (e.g., another host behind the same NAT or malicious software on the host) 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"></xref>.
      In some cases, the location provider may not authorize the target itself
      to access precise location.  At the same time, because endpoints can roam
      between networks, it is not generally possible to have strong client 
      authentication for LCPs.</t>
      
      <t>Using of rough location to support emergency calling enables a location
      provider to provide low-precision location with low assurance (e.g., without
      client authentication)and high-precision location with higher assurance.  
      Because lower-precision location generally has lower value
       -- to location providers and LBS providers as a commercial asset, and to 
      targets as private information -- this trade-off allows a location provider 
      to avoid the cost of protecting location with high-assurance access controls 
      when this location has low value. </t>
      
      <t>However, in order to support emergency services, location providers cannot
      provide only low-precision location; they also have to provide PSAPs with
      access to high-precision location information.  Because PSAPs require 
      high-precision location for emergency response, a location provider
      that normally provides imprecise location to clients MUST also provide them 
      a location URI that a PSAP can use to obtain high-precision location.  
      This constraint means that the provided URI MUST have either no
      access control at all or a policy that allows access by appropriate PSAPs 
      and other emergency response systems, e.g., ESRPs.  That is, if such a 
      location URI is access controlled, then the
      location provider MUST be able to authenticate requests from PSAPs.</t>
      
      <t>The use of location by reference introduces some risk that the reference
      will be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the target's 
      location.  These risks are not specific to emergency service, however; 
      general risks and mitigations for location by reference are discussed in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"></xref></t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="filter-use-section"></xref> above, the
      location provider choosing to provide a less precise location than a
      known location has a significant amount of choice in deciding which
      location to provide: Any location that contains the known location and
      is in the same filter region will do. When the provider is reducing
      precision for privacy purposes, there is a some privacy benefit to
      choosing a random location meeting these criteria. If a watcher is
      interested in whether or not the endpoint is moving, an imprecise
      location may still reveal that fact if it is constant when the endpoint
      is at rest. If the provided location is randomized each time it is
      provided, then the watcher is unable to obtain even this level of
      information.  An algorithm for securely fuzzing a target's location 
      can be found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy"></xref>; for 
      emergency services, the additional constraint must be added that the 
      fuzzed location must remain in the same filter region as the original.</t>
