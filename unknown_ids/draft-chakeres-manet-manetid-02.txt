Abstract

   This document defines a message TLV named MANET INSTANCE_ID.  The
   INSTANCE_ID TLV is used by a (DYMO) process to identify information
   as belonging to a particular (DYMO) instance.  This specification
   enables multiple instances of (DYMO) to run independently on the same
   node.

Internet-Draft                  MANET-ID                    January 2008


1.  Introduction

   This specification enables multiple instances of (DYMO
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo]) to run independently on the same node.  This
   document specifies a message TLV structure named MANET INSTANCE_ID
   for [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].  This TLV is used by a (DYMO) process
   to identify its information.  On reception of a routing protocol
   message, if the value of the INSTANCE_ID TLV is different from the
   (DYMO) routing process's Instance ID value, then the message is
   discarded without processing.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].

   In this document, we define the following terminology:

   Process
      A (DYMO) process is a running instantiation of the (DYMO) routing
      protocol.

   Instance
      A (DYMO) instance is a separate protocol instance complete with
      its own protocol data structures (e.g. routing table), protocol
      state machines, and protocol processes (e.g. route discovery).

   Instance ID
      The Instance ID enables multiple instances of a (DYMO) routing
      protocol to be run independently on the same node.  Received
      messages whose Instance ID value is not equal to the routing
      protocol instance's Instance ID value are discarded without
      processing.

   Process's Instance ID Value (<p_instance_id>)
      The Instance ID value associated with a (DYMO) routing process is
      referred to as its <p_instance_id>.

   TLV's Instance ID Value (<t_instance_id>)
      The Instance ID value associated with a (DYMO) routing protocol
      message is referred to as its <t_instance_id>.

3.  MANET INSTANCE_ID TLV

   The MANET INSTANCE_ID TLV is a message TLV.  The INSTANCE_ID TLV is a
   single value TLV as defined in [I-D.ietf-manet-packetbb].

   The maximum length of an INSTANCE_ID TLV value is 1-octet.


4.  (DYMO) Protocol Operation

   This section describes specific (DYMO) routing protocol behavior
   based on <p_instance_id> and <t_instance_id>.

4.1.  (DYMO) Configuration

   A (DYMO) routing protocol instance must be administratively
   configured to only process messages with a specific INSTANCE_ID
   value, <p_instance_id>.

4.2.  Message Reception

   When a message is received without an INSTANCE_ID TLV, the message's
   INSTANCE_ID value (<t_instance_id>) is assumed to be zero (0).

   When a message is received with more than one INSTANCE_ID TLV, it is
   invalid and MUST NOT be processed.

   When a message is received with one INSTANCE_ID TLV, <t_instance_id>
   is contained.

   If <p_instance_id> == <t_instance_id>, then the message is processed
   normally.  Otherwise, the message MUST NOT be not processed.

4.3.  Sending Control Messages

   When a (DYMO) process with a configure <p_instance_id> sends routing
   protocol control messages, the information MUST be identified by
   tagging it with an INSTANCE_ID TLV containing <p_instance_id>.

   If the (DYMO) process does not have a configured <p_instance_id>,
   then it SHOULD NOT include an INSTANCE_ID TLV.  If an INSTANCE_ID TLV
   is included the value MUST be set to zero (0).
