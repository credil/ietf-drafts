Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for G.711.1           April 2008


1.  Introduction

   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendation
   G.711.1 [1] is an embedded wideband extension of the Recommendation
   G.711 [9] audio codec.  This document specifies a payload format for
   packetization of G.711.1 encoded audio signals into the Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT","RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].


2.  Background

   G.711.1 is a G.711 embedded wideband speech and audio coding
   algorithm operating at 64, 80, and 96 kbps.  At 64 kbps, G.711.1 is
   fully interoperable with G.711.  Hence, an efficient deployment in
   existing G.711 based VoIP infrastructures is foreseen.

   The codec operates on 5 ms frames, and the default sampling rate is
   16 kHz.  Input and output at 8 kHz are also supported for narrowband
   modes.

   The encoder produces an embedded bitstream structured in three layers
   corresponding to three available bit rates: 64, 80, and 96 kbps.  The
   bitstream can be truncated at the decoder side or by any component of
   the communication system to adjust "on the fly" the bit rate to the
   desired value.

   The following table gives more details on these layers.

               +-------+------------------------+---------+
               | Layer | Description            | Bitrate |
               +-------+------------------------+---------+
               | L0    | G.711 compatible       | 64 kbps |
               | L1    | narrowband enhancement | 16 kbps |
               | L2    | wideband enhancement   | 16 kbps |
               +-------+------------------------+---------+

                        Table 1: Layers description

   The combinations of these 3 layers results in the definition of 4
   modes, as per the following table.

3.  RTP Header Usage

   The format of the RTP header is specified in RFC 3550 [3].  The
   payload format defined in this document uses the fields of the header
   in a manner consistent with that specification.

   The RTP timestamp clock frequency is the same as the default sampling
   frequency: 16 kHz.

   G.711.1 has also the capability to operate with 8 kHz sampled input/
   output signals.  It does not affect the bitstream, and the decoder
   does not require a priori knowledge about the sampling rate of the
   original signal at the input of the encoder.  Therefore, depending on
   the implementation and the audio acoustic capabilities of the
   devices, the input of the encoder and/or the output of the decoder
   can be configured at 8 kHz; however, a 16 kHz RTP clock rate MUST
   always be used.

   The duration of one frame is 5 ms, corresponding to 80 samples at 16
   kHz.  Thus the timestamp is increased by 80 for each consecutive
   frame.

   G.711.1 does not define anything specific regarding Discontinuous
   Transmission (DTX), a.k.a. silence suppression.  Codec-independant
   mechanisms may be used, like the generic comfort noise payload format
   defined in RFC 3389 [10].  For applications which send either no
   packets or occasional comfort-noise packets during silence, the first
   packet of a talkspurt, that is, the first packet after a silence
   period during which packets have not been transmitted contiguously,
   SHOULD be distinguished by setting the marker bit in the RTP data
   header to one.  The marker bit in all other packets is zero.  The
   beginning of a talkspurt MAY be used to adjust the playout delay to
   reflect changing network delays.  Applications without silence
   suppression MUST set the marker bit to zero.

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is

   outside the scope of the document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile under which this payload format
   is being used will assign a payload type for this codec or specify
   that the payload type is to be bound dynamically (see Section 5.3).


4.  Payload Format

   To take into account the foreseen usages of G.711.1, two sub-formats
   are defined: dynamic mode and fixed mode.  Only one format is allowed
   per RTP payload type.  See Section 5 for configuration details.

4.1.  Dynamic Mode Payload Format

   In this configuration, the mode can be changed between payloads, but
   not within a payload.

   The complete payload consists of a payload header of 1 octet,
   followed by one or more consecutive G.711.1 audio frames of the same
   mode.

4.1.1.  Payload Header

   The payload header is illustrated below.

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |0 0 0 0 0|  MI |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The 5 most significant bits are reserved for further extension and
   MUST be set to zero.

   The MI field (3 bits) gives the mode of the following frame(s) as per
   the table:

                +------------+--------------+------------+
                | Mode Index | G.711.1 mode | Frame size |
                +------------+--------------+------------+
                |      1     |      R1      |  40 octets |
                |      2     |      R2a     |  50 octets |
                |      3     |      R2b     |  50 octets |
                |      4     |      R3      |  60 octets |
                +------------+--------------+------------+

                     Table 3: Modes in payload header

   All other values of MI are reserved for future used and MUST NOT be

   used.

   Payloads received with an undefined MI value MUST be discarded.

4.1.2.  Audio Data

   After this payload header, the audio frames are packed in order of
   time, that is, oldest first.  All frames MUST be of the same mode,
   indicated by the MI field of the payload header.

   Within a frame, layers are always packed in the same order: L0 then
   L1 for mode R2a, L0 then L2 for mode R2b, L0 then L1 then L2 for mode
   R3.  This is illustrated bellow.

         +-------------------------------+
     R1  |              L0               |
         +-------------------------------+

         +-------------------------------+--------+
     R2a |              L0               |   L1   |
         +-------------------------------+--------+

         +-------------------------------+--------+
     R2b |              L0               |   L2   |
         +-------------------------------+--------+

         +-------------------------------+--------+--------+
     R3  |              L0               |   L1   |   L2   |
         +-------------------------------+--------+--------+

   The size of one frame is given by the mode, as per Table 3, and the
   actual number of frames is easy to infer from the size of the audio
   data part:

      nb_frames = (size_of_audio_data) / (size_of_one_frame).

   Only full frames must be considered.  So if there is a remainder to
   the division above, the corresponding remaining bytes in the received
   payload MUST be ignored.

4.2.  Fixed Mode Payload Format

   In this configuration, the G.711.1 mode is fixed by the signaling.
   So an RTP payload type is attached to a single mode.

   The payload simply consists of one or more consecutive G.711.1 audio
   frames of the fixed mode.  There is no payload header.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for G.711.1           April 2008


   The audio frames are packed in order of time, that is, oldest first.

   The layer packing within a frame, and the frame count considerations,
   are the same as in Section 4.2


5.  Payload Format Parameters

   This section defines the parameters that may be used to configure
   optional features in the G.711.1 RTP transmission.

   Both A-law and mu-law G.711 are supported in the core layer L0, but
   there is no interoperability between A-law and mu-law.  So two media
   types with the same parameters will be defined: audio/PCMA-WB for
   A-law core, and audio/PCMU-WB for mu-law core.  This is consistent
   with the audio/PCMA and audio/PCMU media types separation for G.711
   audio.

   The parameters are defined here as part of the media subtype
   registrations for the G.711.1 codec.  A mapping of the parameters
   into the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [5] is also provided for
   those applications that use SDP.  In control protocols that do not
   use MIME or SDP, the media type parameters must be mapped to the
   appropriate format used with that control protocol.

5.1.  PCMA-WB Media Type Registration

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of RFC XXXX by
   the RFC number assigned to this document]

   This registration is done using the template defined in RFC 4288 [6]
   and following RFC 4855 [7].

   Type name: audio

   Subtype name: PCMA-WB

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters:

   fixed-mode:  the fixed mode of the stream.  Possible values are 1, 2,
      3, or 4 (see Table 3 of RFC XXXX).  If fixed-mode is specified,
      the fixed mode payload format MUST be used (see Section 4.2 of RFC
      XXXX), and frames encoded with other modes than fixed-mode MUST
      NOT be sent in any payload.  If fixed-mode is not present, the
      dynamic mode payload format (see Section 4.1 of RFC XXXX) MUST be
      used.

5.3.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [5], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions employing the G.711.1 codec, the mapping is
   as follows:

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The media subtype ("PCMA-WB" or "PCMU-WB") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap"
      as the encoding name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST be
      16000 for G.711.1.

   o  The parameter "fixed-mode" goes in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying it as a "fixed-mode=<value>" string.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

5.3.1.  Offer-Answer Model Considerations

   The following considerations apply when using SDP offer-answer
   procedures [8] to negotiate the use of G.711.1 payload in RTP:

   o  Since G.711.1 is an extension of G.711, the offerer SHOULD
      announce G.711 support in its "m=audio" line, with G.711.1
      preferred.  This will allow interoperability with both G.711.1 and
      G.711-only capable parties.

      Below is an example part of such an offer:

         m=audio 54874 RTP/AVP 96 8
         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000
         a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000

      As a reminder, the payload format for G.711 is defined in Section
      4.5.14 of RFC 3551 [4].

   o  The parameter "fixed-mode" is bi-directional, i.e., the restricted
      mode applies to media both to be received and sent by the
      declaring entity.  If a mode is supplied in the offer, the
      answerer MUST return the same mode or remove the payload type.  If
      "fixed-mode" is not present in the offer, the anwerer may return a
      "fixed-mode" to restrict the possible mode.  In any cases, the
      mode in the answer then applies for both offerer and answerer.
      The offerer MUST NOT send frames of a mode (i.e. a payload type)
      that has been removed by the answerer.

      For multicast sessions, if "fixed-mode" is supplied in the offer,
      the answerer SHALL only participate in the session if it supports
      the offered mode.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" will in most cases not
      affect interoperability.  The SDP offer-answer handling of the

      parameter MUST be handled in the same way.

   o  Any unknown parameter in an offer MUST be ignored by the receiver
      and MUST NOT be included in the answer.


   Below are some example parts of SDP offer-answer exchanges.

   o  Example 1

      Offer: dynamic mode
         m=audio 54874 RTP/AVP 96
         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000


      Answer: dynamic mode accepted
         m=audio 59452 RTP/AVP 96
         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000

   o  Example 2

      Offer: dynamic mode
         m=audio 54874 RTP/AVP 96
         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000


      Answer: wants only mode R3
         m=audio 59452 RTP/AVP 96
         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000
         a=fmtp:96 fixed-mode=4

   o  Example 3

      Offer: two fixed modes, R2b and R3, with R3 preferred
         m=audio 54874 RTP/AVP 96 97
         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000
         a=fmtp:96 fixed-mode=4
         a=rtpmap:97 PCMA-WB/16000
         a=fmtp:97 fixed-mode=3


      Answer: accepted
         m=audio 59452 RTP/AVP 96 97
         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000
         a=fmtp:96 fixed-mode=4
         a=rtpmap:97 PCMA-WB/16000

         a=fmtp:97 fixed-mode=3


      If the answerer wanted to restrict to one mode, it would have
      removed the unwanted payload type.

5.3.2.  Declarative SDP Considerations

   For declarative use of SDP, nothing specific is defined for this
   payload format.  The configuration given by the SDP MUST be used when
   sending and/or receiving media in the session.


6.  Congestion Control

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550
   [3] and any appropriate profile (for example, RFC 3551 [4]).

   The embedded nature of G.711.1 audio data can be helpful for
   congestion control, since a coding mode with a lower bit rate can be
   selected when needed.  When using the dynamic mode payload format, it
   is can be done directly.  When using the fixed mode payload format,
   it can be done by switching to another payload type, if several modes
   were negociated.

   The number of frames encapsulated in each RTP payload influences the
   overall bandwidth of the RTP stream, due to the header overhead.
   Packing more frames in each RTP payload can reduce the number of
   packets sent and hence the header overhead, at the expense of
   increased delay and reduced error robustness.


7.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in the
   RTP specification [3] and any appropriate profile (for example, RFC
   3551 [4]).

   As this format transports encoded speech/audio, the main security
   issues include confidentiality, integrity protection, and
   authentication of the speech/audio itself.  The payload format itself
   does not have any built-in security mechanisms.  Any suitable
   external mechanisms, such as SRTP [11], MAY be used.

   This payload format and the G.711.1 encoding do not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-end computational load and
   thus are unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the

   receipt of pathological datagrams.


8.  IANA Considerations

   It is requested that two new media subtype (audio/PCMA-WB and audio/
   PCMU-WB) are registered by IANA, see Section 5.1 and Section 5.2.
