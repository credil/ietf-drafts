    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes that DNS SRV records that can be
	  trusted via DNSSEC signatures may be used to generate a list of
	  acceptable names to check on server certificates offered by TLS.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>XMPP uses SRV records for clients and servers to find servers
      for a given domain.  Today, since the SRV record cannot be
      trusted, the server has to offer a TLS certificate that matches
      the original domain name, rather than one for the hostname in
      the SRV record.  Deployment of delegated hosts would be much
      easier if the host could offer a certificate with the host name,
      rather than having to offer a certificate with the original
      domain name.</t>

	  <t>This document proposes that the server may offer a cert with
	  any of the names generated from looking up trusted DNS
	  entries.</t>

	  <t>Note: this document is only intended as a placeholder; it
	  will be dramatically expanded later.  As well it is likely that
	  this approach is useful for protocols other than XMPP.</t>

    <section title="Conventions Used In This Document">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview">
	  <t>The following steps are followed by a provider hosting
	  "example.com" on the server "host1.example.net":</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
		<t>The owner of "example.com" serves an SRV record for
		"_xmpp-server._tcp.example.com" and
		"_xmpp-client._tcp.example.com", for example "0 1 5269
		host1.example.net." might be used for each.</t>
		<t>The owner of "example.com" MUST ensure that "example.com" is
		signed using DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4035"/>, and that the SRV
		record is also signed using DNSSEC.</t>
		<t>The hosting provider at "host1.example.net" generates a
		<xref target="RFC5280"/> PKIX certificate and has it signed by
		a widely-trusted Certificate Authority.</t>
		<t>The hosting provider offers the generated certificate to
		anyone who connects and wants to talk to "example.com".</t>
	  </list></t>

	  <t>The following steps are followed by an initiating entity
	  connecting to "example.com":</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
		<t>The initiator starts with an empty name list L.</t>
		<t>The initiator adds the original domain name ("example.com"
		here) to L</t>
		<t>The initiator does the normal SRV lookup, asking its
		resolver for DNSEC trust information.</t>
		<t>For each hostname, CNAME, A or AAAA record that the
		initiator finds which is fully trustable according to DNSSEC,
		that name or IP address is added to L.</t>
		<t>The initiator connects to the server as specified in XMPP
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-xmpp-3920bis"/>, specifying
		"example.com" in the stream to attribute.  Other protocols
		might use SNI <xref target="RFC4366"/> to indicate the desired
		host name.</t>
		<t>The initiator MUST check each name in L against the certificate
		offered by the responder, using the rules specified in section
		13.7.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-xmpp-3920bis"/> (or the
		equivalent rules for the target protocol).</t>
