MPLS Transport Profile User-to-Network and Network-to-Network Interfaces
                     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-uni-nni-00

Abstract

   The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] provides
   reference models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and
   an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network interface (NNI).  This document updates
   those reference models to show detailed reference points for these
   interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional
   architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
   (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
   of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subjet to an IETF
   Last Call.

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and
   insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published
   RFC has IETF onsensus.]

1.  Introduction

   The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] provides
   reference models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and
   an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network interface (NNI).  This document updates
   those reference models to show detailed reference points for these
   interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional
   architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

1.1.  Updates to the MPLS-TP UNI and NNI

   The transport service interfaces for MPLS-TP are defined in Section
   3.4.3 of [RFC5921].  These definitions are illustrated by showing
   MPLS-TP PEs containing a UNI and an NNI.  The figures illustrate the
   UNI and the NNI as a span.  However, it is more conventional to
   illustrate these interfaces as reference points.  Furthermore, in the
   case of a UNI, it is useful to illustrate the distribution of UNI
   functions between the CE side and the PE side of the UNI (the UNI-C
   and UNI-N).

   This document provides updated illustrations of the MPLS-TP UNI and
   MPLS-TP NNI to show these additional details.  These illustrations
   are intended to obsolete the corresponding ones in [RFC5921].  This
   document also defines additional terminology referenced in the
   illustrations.  No other updates are proposed by this document.

1.2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The terminology and abbreviations of [RFC5921] apply.

   The following additional terminology is used in this document.

   CP    Control Plane
   NNI   Network-to-Network Interface
   TSI   Transport Service Instance

   UNI-N User-to-Network Interface, PE Side

2.  MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface

   The MPLS-TP User-Network interface (UNI) is illustrated in Figure 1.
   This figure obsoletes Figure 3 of [RFC5921].  Note that the term MPLS
   UNI is to be interpreted as a UNI to an MPLS-TP network and does not
   refer to the protocol transiting the UNI.
