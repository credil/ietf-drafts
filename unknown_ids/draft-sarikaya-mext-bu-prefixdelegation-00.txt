Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support         September 2008


Abstract

   This document defines prefix delegation support for a mobile network.
   Mobile Router dynamically requests its Mobile Network Prefixes from
   its Home Agents using Binding Update both at the home link and at the
   visited links.  Home agents get the prefixes delegated using DHCPv6
   Prefix Delegation and reply to the Mobile Router with Binding
   Acknowledgement.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support         September 2008


1.  Introduction

   Nemo Basic Support Protocol requires that IPv6 prefixes called Home
   Network Prefix(es) delegated to a Mobile Router and advertized in the
   Mobile Network [RFC3963].  However the protocol does not provide any
   means of provisioning Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs) dynamically.

   Prefix delegation is widely discussed in IETF 16NG, MEXT, and NETLMM
   Working Groups.  Corresponding solutions are also introduced.  NEMO
   deals with synchronization of Mobile Network prefixes between a
   Mobile Router and a Home Agent, while the method is agnostic to the
   way that a Home Agent gets prefixes from back end servers.

   [RFC3633] defines Prefix Delegation options and procedures to provide
   a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

   In [RFC5213] home network prefix (HNP) is used by MN to assign a home
   address.  Mobility access gateway (MAG) needs to emulate MN's home
   network on the access link and therefore needs to learn HNP.  The
   design decision was made to learn this from the proxy binding
   acknowledgement message sent by the local mobility agent (LMA) (See
   Section 6.7 in [RFC5213]).  For this purpose, proxy binding update
   and acknowledgement messages are extended with Home Network Prefix
   Option to carry HNP and its length.  However, how LMA gets prefixes
   is not currently defined yet.

   In Nemo MNP provisioning problem, MR, like MAG needs to get MNP, like
   HNP from HA, like LMA in order for MR to advertise MNP on its
   downstream link(s).  Because of this similarity, this document
   proposes to use the binding update/acknowledgement, like proxy
   binding update/acknowledgement messages exchanged with HA to carry
   MNPs.  DHCPv6 prefix delegation (PD) is proposed to be used for HA to
   get prefixes from DHCP server with HA as the requesting router (RR)
   and DHCP server as the delegating router (DR) [RFC3633].

   When MR is on the home link, MR gets authenticated first and then
   gets the configuration settings including MNPs from the policy store.
   This document describes an IKEv2 and EAP authentication based home
   link configuration but other solutions are also possible.  MR uses
   IKEv2 exchanges to receive prefixes for its home link only and not
   for MNPs.

   MR requests MNP from HA using the binding update message as in the
   visited link.  A successful EAP authentication can trigger MR to send
   BU with Home Link Exchange flag set to HA.  HA then uses DHCPv6 PD
   interactions to get MNPs and send them to MR using BA.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3315], [RFC3633],
   [RFC4886], [RFC3775], [RFC4306] and [RFC5213].


3.  Nemo Prefix Delegation Using DHCPv6

   We assume that the prefixes are managed by an authority that owns the
   Home Network and subnets it into MNPs that it assigns to the MRs.  An
   MNP can be preassigned to the associated MR (e.g. manually or
   automatically with a provisioning system), or assigned dynamically by
   a server such as a DHCP Prefix Delegation server.  In this
   architecture, HA is the requesting router and the DHCP Server is the
   delegating router.  HA needs to be collocated with a DHCP Client to
   solicit/request prefixes from the DHCP Server.  The delegating router
   could be a backend DHCP Server.

   In a visited link, Mobile Router(MR) requests its Mobile Network
   Prefixes from its Home Agents dynamically using Binding Update
   message.  When BU message contains one or more Home Network Prefix
   Options, this triggers HA to start DHCPv6 PD with DHCP Server.
   Figure 1 shows the process that a Mobile Router requests prefixes
   from a Home Agent.


          MR       HA   DHCP Server
          |        |        |
          |------->|        |      1. BU with Home Network Prefix Option
          |        |------->|      2. DHCP Solicit
          |        |<-------|      3. DHCP Advertise
          |        |------->|      4. DHCP Request (MNP)
          |        |<-------|      5. DHCP Reply (MNP)
          |<-------|        |      6. BA with Home Network Prefix Option


                    Figure 1: Prefix Delegation in NEMO

   1.  Home Network Prefix option defined in [RFC5213] included in the
       Binding Update(BU) and R flag in the binding update are used to
       indicate to the Home Agent (HA) that the MR wishes to get new
       prefixes assigned to it for use as Mobile Network Prefixes.
   2.  DHCP Client at the HA initiates DHCP Solicit procedure to request
       prefixes for the MN.  HA creates and transmits a Solicit message
       as described in sections 17.1.1, "Creation of Solicit Messages"
       and 17.1.2, "Transmission of Solicit Messages" of RFC 3315.  HA
       creates an IA_PD and assigns it an IAID.  HA MUST include the
       IA_PD option in the Solicit message.

   3.  The DHCP server sends an Advertise message to HA in the same way
       as described in section 17.2.2, "Creation and transmission of
       Advertise messages" of RFC 3315.
   4.  HA uses the same message exchanges as described in section 18,
       "DHCP Client-Initiated Configuration Exchange" of RFC 3315 to
       obtain or update prefixes from a DHCP server.  HA and the DHCP
       server use the IA_PD Prefix option to exchange information about
       prefixes in much the same way as IA Address options are used for
       assigned addresses.
   5.  HA stores the prefix information including prefix lifetime it
       received in the Reply message in the Prefix Table.
   6.  HA sends the prefixes received to MR in a Binding Acknowledgement
       message.  Home Network Prefix option defined in [RFC5213] is
       included in the Binding Acknowledgement.  One Home Network Prefix
       option is included for each prefix received.

   MR sets prefix length and home network prefix values to ALL_ZERO in
   Home Network Prefix option of BU MR sends to HA.  If MR bootstrapped
   in the home link MR sets prefix length and home network prefix values
   to the values received in the BA with Home Link Exchange Flag (C
   flag) defined in [I-D.devarapalli-mext-mipv6-home-link] set as in
   Section 4.  In subsequent BUs, MR sets these fields to the values
   received in the previous BA from HA.

   When advertizing MNPs in Router Advertisement messages, MR MAY set
   the prefix lifetime value to any value chosen at its own discretion.
   The value may be bound to the lifetime of MR's binding with HA.  The
   value may also be set by a value taken from MR's policy profile.
   Prefixes MUST be refreshed by MR sending a BU that contains one or
   more Home Link Prefix Options.


4.  Home Link Support

   If MR boots in the home link, DHCPv6 prefix delegation operation is
   as shown in Figure 2.

   1.   An MR boots up in the network.  DHCP Server in Figure 2 is not
        involved in the network entry procedures.
   2.   MR starts IKEv2 procedures [RFC4306] to establish a security
        association with the HA [I-D.ietf-dime-mip6-split].
   3.   MR requests prefix(es) to configure its home link using
        CFG_REQUEST payload in the message.  MR includes a zero length
        INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attribute in the CFG_REQUEST payload to
        request a prefix.  MR MUST include multiple instances of
        INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attribute to request multiple prefixes to be
        assigned by HA.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support         September 2008


   4.   MR and HA authenticate each other using EAP.
   5.   If authentication succeeds HA is ready to assign prefix(es)
        using DHCP PD.
   6.   HA includes the prefixes for MR's home link in the payload in
        CGF_REPLY.  CFG_REPLY contains more than one instances of
        INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attribute each containing home link prefix
        and its length.  MR uses these prefixes for its home link.
   7.   MR sends BU with Home Link Exchange (C) Flag on and includes
        Home Network Prefix Option in order to get MNPs from HA.
   8.   HA as the requesting router starts DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
        exchange with the Delegating Router.  Step 2 in Figure 1.
   9.   Step 3 in Figure 1.
   10.  Step 4 in Figure 1.
   11.  Step 5 in Figure 1.
   12.  HA sends BA back to MR.  BA has Home Link Exchange (C) Flag set
        and it contains Home Network Prefix Option containing MNPs for
        the mobile devices in the NEMO.

5.  Miscellaneous Considerations

5.1.  Rapid Commit Option

   4-way exchange between HA as requesting router (RR) and DHCP server
   as delegating router (DR) in Figure 1 and Figure 2 MAY be reduced
   into a two message exchange using the Rapid Commit option [RFC3315].
   HA includes a Rapid Commit option in the Solicit message.  DR then
   sends a Reply message containing one or more prefixes.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation Support         September 2008


5.2.  Implicit/Explicit Modes

   MRs operate in implicit mode, i.e.  MR MUST not include Mobile
   Network Prefix option in BUs.  This is because MRs following this
   specification will include Home Network Prefix Option instead.

5.3.  Advertising Delegated Prefixes

   HA should broadcast the prefix(es) dynamically upstream as the route
   information of all the MRs connected to this HA.  This might cause
   high routing protocol traffic (IGMP, OSPF, etc.) due to large number
   of prefixes.  To solve the problem, route aggregation SHOULD be used.
   For example, each HA can be assigned a /48 or /32 prefix (aggregate
   prefix) while each interface of MR can be assigned a /64 prefix.  The
   /64 prefix is an extension of /48 one, for example, an HA's /48
   prefix is 3FFE:FFFF:0::/48, an interface of MR is assigned 3FFE:FFFF:
   0:2::/64 prefix.  The HA only broadcasts it's /48 or /32 prefix
   information to Internet.

5.4.  DHCP Server Issues

   The delegating router should normally be located in Home Agent's
   network.  In that case HA needs only a DHCP Client to communicate
   with DHCP server.

   If the delegating router is not local HA needs DHCP Relay Agent to
   forward multicast packets to DHCP server.  DHCP Relay Agent should be
   located in the same link as HA and it needs to be configured with the
   address of DHCP server.


6.  Message Formats

   This document requires CFG_REQUEST and CFG_REPLY defined in [RFC4306]
   contain one or more INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET attributes.

   This document requires Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
   messages defined in [RFC3775] to contain one or more Home Network
   Prefix Options defined in [RFC5213].

   This document requires Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
   messages defined in [RFC3775] to contain the Home Link Exchange (C)
   flag defined in [I-D.devarapalli-mext-mipv6-home-link] when BU and
   BAs are exchanged at the home link.  C flag MUST be set to one when
   MR is at the home link.  C flag MUST be set to zero when BU and BAs
   are exchanged at the visited links.
