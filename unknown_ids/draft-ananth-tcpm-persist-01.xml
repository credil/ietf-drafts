    <abstract>
      <t>This document attempts to clarify the notion of the Zero Window
      Probes (ZWP) described in RFC 1122 <xref target="RFC1122"></xref>. In
      particular, it clarifies the actions that can be taken on connections
      which are experiencing the ZWP condition. The motivation for this
      document stems from the belief that TCP implementations strictly
      adhering to the current RFC language have the potential to become
      vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>According to RFC 1122 <xref target="RFC1122"></xref> Section
      4.2.2.17: A TCP MAY keep it's offered receive window closed
      indefinitely. As long as the receiving TCP continues to send
      acknowledgments in response to the probe segments, the sending TCP MUST
      allow the connection to stay open. It is important to remember that ACK
      (acknowledgement) segments that contain no data are not reliably
      transmitted by TCP. Therefore zero window probing SHOULD be supported to
      prevent a connection from hanging forever if ACK segments that re-opens
      the window is lost. The condition where the sender goes into the ZWP
      mode is typically known as the persist condition.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discussion on RFC 1122 Requirement">
      <t>It needs to be emphasised that TCP MUST NOT take any action of its
      own when a particular connection is in persist state for a long time. As
      per RFC 1122 as long as the ACK's are being received for window probes,
      it can continue to stay in persist mode. This is important because
      typically applications would want the TCP connection to stay open unless
      it explicitly closes the connection. For example take the case of user
      running a print job and the printer ran out of paper waiting for the
      user intervention. It would be premature for TCP to take action on its
      own. Hence TCP cannot act as a resource manager and it is the system or
      application's responsibility to take appropriate action.</t>

      <t>At the same time, many existing TCP implementations that adhere
      strictly to the above verbiage of RFC 1122, may fall victim to DOS
      attacks, if appropriate measures are not followed. For example, if we
      take the case of a busy server where multiple clients can advertise a
      zero forever (by reliably acknowledging the ZWP's), it could eventually
      lead to the resource exhaustion in the system. In such cases the system
      would need to take appropriate action on the TCP connection to reclaim
      the resources. The document is not intended to provide any advice on any
      particular resource management scheme that can be implemented to
      circumvent DOS issues arising due to the connections stuck in the
      persist state. The problem is applicable to TCP and TCP derived
      transport protocols like SCTP.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Description of Attack">
      <t>If TCP implementations strictly follow RFC 1122 and there is no
      instruction on what to do in persist condition, connections will
      encounter an indefinite wait. To illustrate this, consider the case
      where the client application opens a TCP connection with a HTTP <xref
      target="RFC2616"></xref> server, sends a GET request for a large page
      and stops reading the response. This would cause the client TCP to
      advertise a zero window to the server. For every large HTTP response,
      the server is left holding on to all the response data in it's send
      queue. If the client never clears the persist condition, the server will
      continue to hold that data indefinitely. Multiple such TCP connections
      stuck in the same scenario on the server would cause resource depletion
      resulting in a DoS situation on the server.</t>

      <t>Applications on the sender can transfer all the data to the TCP
      socket and subsequently close the socket leaving the connection in
      orphaned state. If the application on the receiver refuses to read the
      data, the orphaned connection will be left holding the data indefinitely
      in its send queue.</t>

      <t>If the above scenario persists for an extended period of time, it
      will lead to TCP buffers and connection blocks starvation causing
      legitimate existing connections and new connection attempts to fail.</t>

      <t>CERT is putting a advisory in this regard<xref
      target="VU723308"></xref> and is making vendors aware of this DoS
      scenario.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Clarification Regarding RFC 1122 Requirements">
      <t>A consequence of adhering to the above requirement mandated by RFC
      1122 is that multiple TCP receivers advertising a zero window to a
      server could exhaust the connection and buffer resources of the sender.
      In such cases, and specially when the receiver is reliably acknowledging
      zero window probe, to achieve robustness, the system should be able to
      take appropriate action on those TCP connections and reclaim resources.
      A possible action could be to terminate the connection and such an
      action is in the spirit of RFC 1122.</t>

      <t>In order to accomplish this action, TCP MAY provide a feedback
      regarding the persist condition to the application if requested to do so
      or the application or the resource manager can query the health of the
      TCP connection which would allow it to take the desired action. All such
      actions are in complete compliance of RFC 793 and RFC 1122.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusion">
      <t>The document addresses the fact that terminating TCP connections
      stuck in the persist condition does not violate RFC 1122 or RFC 793. It
      also suggests that TCP MUST not abort any connection until either
      explicitly requested by the application to do so. The implementation
      guidelines of the request and the action are documented in Section 7,
      and the details of mitigating the DoS attack are left to the
      implementer.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Acknowledgments">
      <t>This document was inspired by the recent discussions that took place
      regarding the TCP persist condition issue in the TCPM WG mailing list
      <xref target="TCPM"></xref>. The outcome of those discussions was to
      come up with a draft that would clarify the intentions of the ZWP
      referred by RFC 1122. We would like to thank Mark Allman and David
      Borman for clarifying the objective behind this draft.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Programming Considerations">
      <t>To enable a server to clear connections in persist condition and
      reclaim resources, a socket interface needs to be defined. Note, this
      condition is mutually exclusive from a persist condition where we are
      not getting zero windows acknowledgement for the probes.</t>

      <t>PERSIST_TIMEOUT</t>

      <t>Format: setsockopt(fd, SOL_TCP, PERSIST_TIMEOUT,
      persist_timeout_value)</t>

      <t>The interface allows applications to inform TCP that when the local
      connection stays in persist condition it can be cleared after a set
      time. Note that the default value of this option is indefinite.</t>

      <t>TCP sender will save the current time in the connection block when it
      receives a zero window ACK. This time is referred to as the persist
      entry time. Thereafter every time the probe timer expires and before it
      sends another probe or an ACK carrying zero window is received a check
      will be done to see how long the connection has been in persist
      condition by comparing the current time to the persist entry time. If
      the timeout has been exceeded, the connection will be aborted.</t>

      <t>Any time a ACK is received that advertises a non-zero window, the
      persist entry time is cleared to take the connection out of persist
      condition.</t>
