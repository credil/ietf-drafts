Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                      March 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document presents a few use-case of web applications that are
   executed in a browser and use real-time communication capabilities.
   Based on the use-cases, the document derives requirements related to
   the browser and the API used by web applications in the browser.

   The document focuses on requirements related to real-time media
   streams.  Requirements related to privacy, signalling between the
   browser and web server etc are currently not considered.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   TBD


4.  Use-cases

4.1.  Introduction

   This section describes web based real-time communication use-cases,
   from which requirements are later retrieved.

4.2.  Use-case: Simple Video Communication Service

4.2.1.  Description

   In the service the users have loaded, and logged into, a video
   communication web application into their browsers, provided by the
   same service provider.  The web service publishes information about
   user login status, by pushing updates to the web application in the
   browsers.  By selecting an online peer user, a 1-1 video
   communication session between the browsers of the peers is initiated.
   The invited user might accept or reject the session.

   When the session has been established, a self-view, as well as the
   video sent from the remote peer, are displayed.  The users can change
   the display sizes during the session.  The users can also pause
   sending of media (audio, video, or both), and mute incoming media.

Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                      March 2011


   Any session participant can end the session at any time.

   One participant has an unreliable internet connection.  It sometimes
   has packet losses, and is sometimes goes down completely.

   One participant is located behind a Network Address Translator (NAT).

4.3.  Use-case: Multiparty video communication

4.3.1.  Description

   In this use case the simple video communication service is extended
   by allowing multiparty sessions.  No central server is involved - the
   browser of each participant sends and receives streams to and from
   all other session participants.

   The audio sent by each participant is a mono stream.  However, in
   order to enhance intelligibility, the web application pans the audio
   from different participants differently when rendering the audio.
   This is done automatically, but users can change how the different
   participants are placed in the (virtual) room.

   Each video stream received is by default displayed in a thumbnail
   frame within the browser, but users can change the display size.

4.4.  Use-case: Multiparty on-line game with voice communication

4.4.1.  Description

   In this use-case, the voice part of the multiparty video
   communication application is used in the context of an on-line game.
   The received voice audio media is rendered together with game sound
   objects.  For example, the sound of a tank moving from left to right
   over the screen must be rendered and played to the user together with
   the voice media.

4.5.  Use-case: Video conferencing system with central server

4.5.1.  Description

   An organization uses a video communication system that supports the
   establishment of multiparty video sessions using a central conference
   server.

   The browsers of all participants send an audio stream (mono or stereo
   depending on the equipment of a participant) to the central server.
   The central server mixes the audio streams and sends towards the
   participants a mixed stereo stream.

   All participants send two video streams towards the server, one low
   resolution and one high resolution.  At each participant one high
   resolution video is displayed in a large window, while a number of
   low resolution videos are displayed in smaller windows.  The server
   selects what video streams to be forwarded as main- and thumbnail
   videos, based on speech activity.

   The organization has an internal network set up with an aggressive
   firewall handling access to the internet.  If users can not
   physically access the internal network, they can establish a Virtual
   Private Network (VPN).

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

4.6.  Use-case: Hockey game viewer

4.6.1.  Description

   An ice-hockey club uses an application that enables talent scouts to,
   in real-time, show and discuss games and players with the club
   manager.  The talent scouts use a mobile phone with two cameras, one
   front-facing and one rear facing.

   The club manager uses a desktop for viewing the game and discussing
   with the talent scout.  The video stream captured by the front facing
   camera (that is capturing the game) of the mobile phone is shown in a
   big window on the desktop screen, while a thumbnail of the rear
   facing camera is overlaid.

   Most of the mobile phone screen is covered by a self view of the
   front facing camera.  A thumbnail of the rear facing cameras view is
   overlaid.

4.7.  Use-case: Telephony terminal

4.7.1.  Description

   A mobile telephony operator allows its customers to use a web browser
   to access their services.  After a simple log in the user can place
   and receive calls in the same way as when using a normal mobile
   phone.  When a call is received or placed, the identity will be shown
   in the same manner as when a mobile phone used.

5.1.  General

   This section contains requirements, derived from the use-cases in
   section 4.

   NOTE: Whether the capabilities to implement specific browser
   requirements are implemented by the browser application, or are
   provided to the browser application by the underlying Operating
   System (OS), is outside the scope of this document.

   A3              The web application MUST be able to control the
                   local layout streams (locally generated streams
                   and streams received from a peer).
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

                   media format (codec) to be used for the streams
                   sent to a peer.

                   NOTE: The level of control depends on whether
                   the codec negotiation is handled by the browser
                   or the web application.

                   format for streams sent to a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A7              The web application MUST be made aware of
                   whether the establishment of a stream with a
                   peer was successful or not.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A8              The web application MUST be able to

   A11             The web application MUST be able to cease
                   processing and rendering of a stream received
                   from a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A12             The web application MUST be informed when a
                   stream from a peer is no longer received.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A13             The web application MUST be informed when high

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A14             It MUST be possible for the web application to
                   control panning, mixing and other processing for
                   individual streams.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Introduction

   A malicious web application might use the browser to perform Denial
   Of Service (DOS) attacks on NAT infrastructure, or on peer devices.
   Also, a malicious web application might silently establish outgoing,
   and accept incoming, streams on an already established connection.

   Based on the identified security risks, this section describes
   security considerations for the browser and web application.

7.2.  Browser Considerations

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for getting user
   consent to use device resources such as camera and microphone.

7.3.  Web Application Considerations

   The web application is expected to ensure user consent in sending and
   receiving media streams.
