                  draft-george-sieve-vacation-time-00

Abstract

   This document describes a further extension to the Sieve Vacation

Internet-Draft       Sieve Vacation: Time parameter         January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Sieve [RFC5228] Vacation extension [RFC5230] defines a mechanism
   to generate automatic replies to incoming email messages.  Through
   the ":days" parameter, it limits the number of auto-replies to the
   same sender to one per [n] days, for a specified number of days.  But
   there are cases when one needs more granularity, if one would like to
   generate "vacation" replies for shorter-term situations ("in a
   meeting", for example, or "out to lunch").

   This extension defines a ":time" parameter to provide more
   granularity for such situations.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Time Parameter

   The purpose of the ":time" parameter is to specify the minimum time
   interval (in seconds) between consecutive auto-replies to a given
   sender.  The ":time" value, if specified, is used instead of the
   ":days" value, and works in a similar way (see the Vacation extension
   [RFC5230] for details).  Only one of ":days" and ":time" is allowed
   -- both MAY NOT be specified (it is a compile-time error to do so).

   The capability string associated with this extension is "vacation-
   time".

   The time value is specified in seconds, and MUST be greater than or
   equal to 0 and less than 2**31.  All valid values MUST be accepted
   without error, but sites MAY define a minimum value to actually be
   used if a smaller value is specified.  If 0 is specified and used, it
   means that all auto-replies are sent, and no attempt is made to
   suppress consecutive replies.

   If ":time" and ":days" are both omitted, a site-defined interval is
   used (see [RFC5230]).



   Usage: vacation [":days" number | ":time" number] [":subject" string]
                   [":from" string] [":addresses" string-list]
                   [":mime"] [":handle" string]
                   <reason: string>

3.  Example

   This example will automatically reply to senders with a message that
   the recipient is in a meeting.  Multiple replies to the same sender
   will only be sent every half hour (1800 seconds).


   require ["vacation", "vacation-time"];
   vacation :addresses ["tjs@example.edu", "ts4z@landru.example.edu"]
            :time 1800
            "I am in a meeting, and do not have access to email.";



4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the Sieve Vacation extension [RFC5230]
   apply equally here.  In addition, implementations SHOULD consider the
   number of auto-replies that might be generated by allowing small
   values of ":time" (including 0).


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of Sieve Extension

   To:  iana@iana.org
   Subject:  Registration of new Sieve extension
   Capability name:  vacation-time
   Description:  adds the ":time" parameter to the Sieve Vacation
      extension.  Implementations that support this MUST also support
      "vacation".
   RFC number:  this RFC
   Contact address:  The Sieve discussion list
