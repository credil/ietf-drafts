  Filtering Location Notifications in the Session Initiation Protocol
                                 (SIP)
                 draft-ietf-geopriv-loc-filters-10.txt

Abstract

   This document describes filters that limit asynchronous location
   notifications to compelling events, designed as an extension to RFC
   4661, an XML-based format for event notification filtering, and based
   on RFC 3856, the SIP presence event package.  The resulting location
   information is conveyed in existing location formats wrapped in the
   Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO).

Internet-Draft              Location Filters                  March 2010


1.  Introduction

   Conveying location information encapsulated with a PIDF-LO [RFC4119]
   document within SIP is described in
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-location-conveyance].  An alternative signaling
   approach, which uses asynchronous communication, is available with
   the SIP event notification mechanisms (see RFC 3265 [RFC3265]).  This
   document focuses on the event notification paradigm.  Event
   notifications are technical more complex since location may be
   measured as a continuous gradient and unlike notifications using
   discrete-valued quantities, it is difficult to know when a change in
   location is large enough to warrant a notification.  Event
   notifications [RFC3265] can be used with filters (see RFC 4661
   [RFC4661]) that allows the number of notifications to be reduced.
   The mechanism described in this document defines an extension to RFC
   4661 [RFC4661], which limits location notification to events that are
   of relevance to the subscriber.  These filters persist until they are
   changed with a replacement filter.

   The frequency of notifications necessary for various geographic
   location applications varies dramatically.  The subscriber should be
   able to get asynchronous notifications with appropriate frequency and
   granularity, without having to issue a large number of notifications
   that are not important to the application.

   This document defines a new event filters and describes others using
   existing mechanisms that may be relevant to a subscriber in the
   context of location filtering:

   1.  the Device moves more than a specified distance since the last
       notification (see Section 3.1).

   2.  the Device exceeds a specified speed (see Section 3.2).

   3.  the Device enters or exits a region, described by a circle or a
       polygon (see Section 3.4).

   4.  one or more of the values of the specified address labels have
       changed for the location of the Device (see Section 3.3).  For
       example, the value of the <A1> civic address element has changed
       from 'California' to 'Nevada'.

   5.  the type of location information being requested (see
       Section 3.5).

   6.  the rate at which location information delivery is desired (see
       Section 3.6).

3.  Filter Definitions

   This specification builds on top of a number of other specifications,
   as noted in Section 1.  In order to reduce the number of options (and
   thereby decrease the chance of interoperability problems), the
   functionality of [RFC4661] listed in the sub-sections below MUST be
   implemented, namely the <ns-bindings> (see Section 3.3 of [RFC4661]),
   the <filter> (Section 3.4 of [RFC4661]), and the <trigger> (Section
   3.6 of [RFC4661] excluding the functionality of the <added> and
   <removed> element).

3.1.  Movement

   The <moved> element MUST contain a value in meters indicates the
   minimum distance that the resource must have moved from the location
   of the resource since the last notification was sent in order to
   trigger this event.  Note that the condition could be met by a change
   in any axis including altitude.  The distance MUST be measured in
   meters absolutely from the point of last notification.  The <moved>
   element MUST NOT appear more than once as a child element of the
   <filter> element.

       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-filter"

           <trigger>
               <lf:moved>300</lf:moved>
           </trigger>
       </filter>
   </filter-set>

                     Figure 1: Movement Filter Example

3.2.  Speed Changes

   Speed changes can be filtered by combining functionality from RFC
   4661 with the PIDF-LO extensions for spatial orientation, speed,
   heading, and acceleration defined in
   [I-D.singh-geopriv-pidf-lo-dynamic].  The value of the <speed>
   element from [I-D.singh-geopriv-pidf-lo-dynamic] MUST be defined in
   meters per second.  Note that the condition could be met by a change
   in any axis including altitude.

   Figure 2 shows an example for a trigger that fires when the speed of
   the Target changes by 3 meters per second.

                      Figure 2: Speed Change Example

   An implementation MUST support the functionality as shown in Figure 2
   with <ns-bindings> replacing the prefix.  No other variant is
   supported.  The <changed> element comes with a few attributes but
   only the 'by' attribute MUST be implemented by this specification.

3.3.  Element Value Changes

   Changes in values, for example related to civic location information,
   is provided by the base functionality offered with RFC 4661 utilizing
   the <changed> element.

   Figure 3 shows an example where a notification is sent when the civic
   address tokens A1, A2, A3, or PC change (all four must change in
   order to let the <trigger> element evaluate to TRUE).

                  Figure 3: Element Value Change Example

   In times where it is desireable to know if any one element of a list
   of CAtypes changes, then they have to be put into separate <changes>
   filters to ensure you are notified when any of the element values
   change.  Figure 4 shows such an example that illustrates the
   difference.

   The following example illustrates a filter that triggers when the
   Target's location changes from 'FR' (France) to some other country.


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <filter-set xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:simple-filter">
       <ns-bindings>
           <ns-binding prefix="ca"
               urn="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr"/>
       </ns-bindings>
       <filter id="123" uri="sip:presentity@example.com">
           <trigger>
               <changed from="FR">//ca:country</changed>
           </trigger>
       </filter>
   </filter-set>

          Figure 5: Element Value Change Example (Country Change)

   An implementation MUST support the functionality as shown in Figure 3
   with <ns-bindings> replacing the prefix.  No other variant is
   supported.  The <changed> element comes with a few attributes and the
   'by', 'to' and 'from' attribute MUST be implemented to support this
   specification.

3.4.  Entering or Exiting a Region

   The <enterOrExit> condition is satisfied when the Target enters or
   exits a named 2-dimensional region described by a polygon (as defined
   in Section 5.2.2 of [RFC5491]), or a circle (as defined in Section
   5.2.3 of [RFC5491]).  The <enterOrExit> element MUST contain either a
   polygon or a circle as a child element.  The <enterOrExit> element
   MUST NOT have more than one polygon and/or circle.

   If the Target was previously outside the region, the notifier sends a
   notification when the Target's location is within the region with at
   least 50% confidence.  Similarly, when a Target starts within the
   region, a notification is sent when the Target's location moves
   outside the region with at least 50% confidence.

   Note that having 50% confidence that the Target is inside the area
   does not correspond to 50% outside.  The confidence that the location
   is within the region, plus the confidence that the location is
   outside the region is limited to the confidence of the location.  The
   total confidence depends on the confidence in the location, which is
   always less than 100% (95% is recommended in [RFC5491]).  The benefit
   of this is that notifications are naturally limited: small movements
   at the borders of the region do not trigger notifications.

   geodetic:  The Notifier SHOULD return a location by value in the form
      of a geodetic location.

   civic:  The Notifier SHOULD return a location by value in the form of
      a civic address.

   The Notifier SHOULD return the requested location type or types.  The
   location types the Notifier returns also depends on the setting of
   the optional 'exact' attribute.  If the 'exact' attribute is set to
   "true" then the Notifier MUST return either the requested location
   type or no location information.  The 'exact' attribute does not
   apply (is ignored) for a request for a location type of "any".

   In the case of a request for specific locationType(s) and the 'exact'
   attribute is "false", the Notifier MAY provide additional location
   types, or it MAY provide alternative types if the request cannot be
   satisfied for a requested location type.

   If the <locationType> element is absent, a value of "any" MUST be
   assumed as the default.

   The Notifier SHOULD provide location in the response in the same
   order in which they were included in the "locationType" element in
   the request.  Indeed, the primary advantage of including specific
   location types in a request when the 'exact' attribute is set to
   "false" is to ensure that one receives the available locations in a
   specific order.  For example, a subscription for "civic" (with the
   'exact' attribute set to "false") could yield any of the following
   location types in the response:

   o  civic

   o  civic, geodetic

   o  geodetic (only if civic is not available)

   The default value of "false" for the 'exact' attribute allows the
   Notifier the option of returning something beyond what is specified,
   such as a set of location URIs when only a civic location was
   requested.

   An example is shown in Figure 8 that utilizes the <locationType>
   element with the 'exact' and the 'responseTime' attribute.

3.6.  Rate Control

   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-event-rate-control] extends the SIP events
   framework by defining the following three "Event" header field
   parameters that allow a subscriber to set a minimum, a maximum and an
   average rate of event notifications generated by the notifier.  This
   allows a subscriber to have overall control over the stream of
   notifications, for example to avoid being flooded.  Two of the
   parameters, namely "min-interval" (which specifies a minimum
   notification time period between two notifications, in seconds) and
   "max-interval" (which specifies a maximum notification time period
   between two notifications, in seconds.) are used by this document.
   The implementation of only these two attributes is required from the
   complete set of attributes defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-event-rate-control].  Whenever the time since the
   most recent notification exceeds the value in the "max-interval"
   parameter, the current state would be sent in its entirety, just like
   after a subscription refresh.

   If complete state is not immediately available, then an empty NOTIFY
   is sent immediately and subsequently a separate NOTIFY containing
   location is generated some time between the time included in 'min-
   interval' and the time in 'max-interval'.  An important use case for
   location based applications focuses on the behavior of the initial
   NOTIFY message(s) and the information it returns, for example in case
   of emergency call routing.  When an initial NOTIFY is transmitted it
   might not include complete state.

          |-------200(3)----->|
          |<-----NOTIFY(4)----|     Return current state information
          |--------200------->|

               Figure 9: SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY with Rate Control

   Figure 9 shows a SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY exchange.  The initial SUBSCRIBE
   message (1) has filters attached and contains a 'max-interval' rate
   control parameter.  In certain situations it is important to obtain
   some amount of location information within a relatively short and
   pre-defined period of time even if the obtained location information
   contains a high amount of uncertainty and location information with
   less uncertainty at a later point in time.  An example is emergency
   call routing where a emergency services routing proxy may need to
   obtain location information suitable for routing rather quickly and
   subsequently a Public Safety Answering Point requests location
   information for dispatch.

   To obtain location information in a timely fashion using the
   SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY mechanism, it is RECOMMENDED that the initial
   SUBSCRIBE contains a 'max-interval' rate control parameter (with a
   small value) that is in a later message updated to a more sensible
   value.  The 'max-interval' for this first request is therefore much
   lower than thereafter.  Updating the 'max-interval' for the
   subscription can be performed in the 200 response (see message 3) to
   the NOTIFY that contains state.  Depending on the value in the 'max-
   interval' parameter the Notifier may create a NOTIFY message (see
   message 2) immediately in response to the SUBSCRIBE that might be
   empty in case no location information is available at this point in
   time.  The desired location information may then arrive in the
   subsequent NOTIFY message (see message 4).

5.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies one piece, namely filters, utilized in larger
   system.  As such, this document builds on a number of specifications
   for the security of the complete solution, namely

   o  the SIP event notification mechanism, described in RFC 3265
      [RFC3265], defining the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages.

   o  the presence event package, described in RFC 3856 [RFC3856], which
      is a concrete instantiation of the general event notification
      framework.

   o  the filter framework, described in RFC 4661 [RFC4661], to offer
      the ability to reduce the amount of notifications being sent.

   Finally, this document indirectly (via the SIP presence event
   package) relies on PIDF-LO, described in RFC 4119 [RFC4119], as the
   XML container that carries location information.

   Each of these documents listed above comes with a security
   consideration section but the security and privacy aspects are best
   covered by the SIP presence event package, see Section 9 of
   [RFC3856], and with the GEOPRIV architectural description found in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch].

   The functionality offered by authorization policies to limit access
   to location information are provided by other protocols, such Common
   Policy [RFC4745], Geolocation Policy [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy] or
   more recent work around HELD context
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context].  Although
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy] defines a standardized format for
   geolocation authorization policies it does not define specific
   policies for controlling filters.

   The functionality described in this document extends the filter
   framework with location specific filters.  Local policies might be
   associated with the usage of certain filter constructs and with the
   amount of notifications specific filter settings might cause.
   Uploading filters have a significant effect on the ways in which the
   request is handled at a server.  As a result, it is especially
   important that messages containing this extension be authenticated
   and authorised.  RFC 4661 [RFC4661] discusses this security threat
   and proposed authentication and authorization solutions applicable by
   this specification.
