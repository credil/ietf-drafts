  <abstract>
    <t>
      This document describes the function and responsibilities
      of the RFC Independent Stream Editor (ISE).
      The Independent Stream is one of the Stream Producers
      that create draft RFCs,
      with the ISE as its Stream Approver.
      The ISE is overall responsible for activities within
      the Independent Stream, working with draft editors and 
      reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production Center
      and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor.
      The ISE is appointed by the IAB, and also interacts
      with the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC).

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
<!--
      The Independent Submissions Editor roles and responsibilities
      were documented in "RFC Editor Model (version 1)"
      <xref target="RFC5620"/>.
      In the light of experience, we see that having it there gave
      rise to some confusion as to where and how the ISE fits into
      the RFC Editor model.
      To reduce that confusion, the ISE material has been moved
      into this document.
-->
      The RFC Editor Model <xref target="I-D.iab-rfc-editor-model-v2"/>
      Defines a set of Streams that produce draft RFCs, which are
      submitted for publication. This document defines the management
      function for the Independent Stream, specifically the role of
      Independent Stream Editor. (This document derives from a section
      of <xref target="RFC5620"/>.)

    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Independent Submission Editor">
    <t>
      The Independent Submission Editor (ISE) is 
      an individual who is responsible for the
      Independent Submission Stream of RFCs, as defined by 
      <xref target="RFC4844"/>.
      <!-- The accountability of all RFC Streams Editors is to the
      body that appoints them -->
      The Independent Stream and the
      Independent Submission Editor are not under the authority or
      direction of the RSE or the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC).
      As noted below, the ISE is appointed by and is responsible
      directly to the IAB.
    </t>

    <section title="Qualifications">
      <t>
        The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for
        which the following qualifications are desired:
        <list style="numbers">
  	  <t>Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience
	    and perspective across a wide range of Internet
	    technologies and applications, and also the
	    ability to work effectively with portions of that spectrum
	    in which they have no personal expertise.</t>
	  <t>Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.</t>
	  <t>An ability to define and constitute advisory and
	    document review arrangements.  If those arrangements
	    include an Editorial Board similar to the current one or
	    some equivalent arrangement, the ability to assess the
            technical competence of potential Editorial Board members
            (see <xref target="editorial_board" />)</t>
	  <t>Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond
	    the IETF.
          </t>
	  <t> Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the
	    English language, and demonstrated history of being able
	    to work effectively with technical documents and materials
	    created by others.</t>
	  <t>The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor
	    environment with divided authority and responsibility
	    similar to that described in
            <xref target="I-D.iab-rfc-editor-model-v2"/>.
	  </t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Responsibilities">
      <t> 
        The Independent Submission Editor is an individual who may
        have assistants and who is responsible for:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission
            stream.</t>
          <t>Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.</t>
	  <t>Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission stream
            to the RFC Production Center.</t>
          <t>Defining and developing the scope of the Independent Submission
            stream as a part of the overall RFC editor function
            <xref target="I-D.iab-rfc-editor-model-v2"/>.</t>
	  <t>Reviewing and approving Independent Submissions RFC errata.</t>
	  <t>Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series
	    policies as specified by the IAB and RSE.</t>
	  <t> Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the
            RSE and/or IAOC.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The ISE may choose to select individuals to participate in
         an Advisory Board for assistance in special topics as the
         ISE deems appropriate.  Such an Advisory Board Board exists
         at the pleasure of the ISE, and its members serve at the
         pleasure of the ISE. 
<!--	The Independent Submission Editor may create and seek support
        from an advisory board (see <xref target="RFC4846"/>).
        Such a board would provide advice to the ISE on any aspect
        of the Independent Stream and its activities. -->
      </t><t>
  	The individual with the listed qualifications is
	selected by the IAB after input has been collected from the
	community. An approach similar to the one used by the IAB
	to select an IAOC member every other year as described in
	<xref target="RFC4333"/> should be used.
      </t><t>
        While the ISE itself is considered a volunteer function, the
	IAB considers maintaining the Independent Submission stream
	part of the IAB's supported activities, and that the IAOC
	should include these costs in the IASA budget.
      </t>

  <section title="Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board"
      anchor="editorial_board">
    <t>
      The Independent Submission Editor is supported by an Editorial
      Board for the review of Independent Submission stream documents.
      This board is known as the Independent Submission Stream Editorial
      Board.  This volunteer Editorial Board exists at the pleasure of
      the ISE, and its members 
      serve at the pleasure of the ISE. The existence of this board is
      simply noted within this model, and additional discussion of
      such is considered out of scope of this document.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>
     This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
     values in existing registries; no IANA action is required.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
      This document has no specific security implications.
