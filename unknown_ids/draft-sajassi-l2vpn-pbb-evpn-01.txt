   1.        Introduction 
    
   [E-VPN] introduces a solution for multipoint L2VPN services with 
   advanced multi-homing capabilities using BGP for distributing 
   customer/clinent MAC address reach-ability information over the core 
   MPLS/IP network. [802.1ah] defines an architecture for Ethernet 
   Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB), where MAC tunneling is employed to 
   improve service instance and MAC address scalability in Ethernet 
   networks and in VPLS networks [PBB-VPLS]. 
    
   In this document, we discuss how PBB can be combined with E-VPN in 
   order to reduce the number of BGP MAC advertisement routes by 
   aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-MAC) addresses via Provider 
   Backbone MAC address (B-MAC), provide client MAC address mobility 
   using C-MAC aggregation and B-MAC sub-netting, confine the scope of 
   C-MAC learning to only active flows, offer per site policies and 
   avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology changes. The combined 
   solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN.

   4.        Requirements 
    
   The requirements for PBB-EVPN include all the requirements for E-VPN 
   that were described in [EVPN-REQ], in addition to the following: 
    
   4.1.          MAC Advertisement Route Scalability 
    
   In typical operation, an [E-VPN] MES sends a BGP MAC Advertisement 
   Route per customer/client MAC (C-MAC) address. In certain 
   applications, this poses scalability challenges, as is the case in 
   virtualized data center environments where the number of virtual 
   machines (VMs), and hence the number of C-MAC addresses, can be in 
   the millions. In such scenarios, it is required to reduce the number 
   of BGP MAC Advertisement routes by relying on a MAC 'summarization' 
   scheme, as is provided by PBB. Note that the MAC sub-netting 
   capability already built into E-VPN is not sufficient in those 
   environments, as will be discussed next. 
    
   4.2.          C-MAC Mobility with MAC Sub-netting 
    
   Certain applications, such as virtual machine mobility, require 
   support for fast C-MAC address mobility. For these applications, it 
   is not possible to use MAC address sub-netting in E-VPN, i.e. 
   advertise reach-ability to a MAC address prefix. Rather, the exact 
   virtual machine MAC address needs to be transmitted in BGP MAC 
   Advertisement route. Otherwise, traffic would be forwarded to the 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                            [Page 4] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   wrong segment when a virtual machine moves from one Ethernet segment 
   to another. This hinders the scalability benefits of sub-netting. 
    
   It is required to support C-MAC address mobility, while retaining 
   the scalability benefits of MAC sub-netting. This can be achieved by 
   leveraging PBB technology, which defines a Backbone MAC (B-MAC) 
   address space that is independent of the C-MAC address space, and 
   aggregate C-MAC addresses via a B-MAC address and then apply sub-
   netting to B-MAC addresses. 
    
   4.3.          C-MAC Address Learning and Confinement 
    
   In E-VPN, all the MES nodes participating in the same E-VPN instance 
   are exposed to all the C-MAC addresses learnt by any one of these 
   MES nodes because a C-MAC learned by one of the MES nodes is 
   advertise in BGP to other MES nodes in that E-VPN instance. This is 
   the case even if some of the MES nodes for that E-VPN instance are 
   not involved in forwarding traffic to, or from, these C-MAC 
   addresses. Even if an implementation does not install hardware 
   forwarding entries for C-MAC addresses that are not part of active 
   traffic flows on that MES, the device memory is still consumed by 
   keeping record of the C-MAC addresses in the routing table (RIB). In 
   network applications with millions of C-MAC addresses, this 
   introduces a non-trivial waste of MES resources. As such, it is 
   required to confine the scope of visibility of C-MAC addresses only 
   to those MES nodes that are actively involved in forwarding traffic 
   to, or from, these addresses. 
    
   4.4.          Interworking with TRILL and 802.1aq Access Networks with C-MAC 
  Address Transparency 
    
   [TRILL] and [802.1aq] define next generation Ethernet bridging 
   technologies that offer optimal forwarding using IS-IS control 
   plane, and C-MAC address transparency via Ethernet tunneling 
   technologies. When access networks based on TRILL or 802.1aq are 
   interconnected over an MPLS/IP network, it is required to guarantee 
   C-MAC address transparency on the hand-off point and the edge (i.e. 
   MES) of the MPLS network. As such, solutions that require 
   termination of the access data-plane encapsulation (i.e. TRILL or 
   802.1ah) at the hand-off to the MPLS network do not meet this 
   transparency requirement, and expose the MPLS edge devices to the 
   MAC address scalability problem. 
    
   PBB-EVPN supports seamless interconnect with these next generation 
   Ethernet solutions while guaranteeing C-MAC address transparency on 
   the MES nodes. 
    
   4.5.          Per Site Policy Support 
    
   In many applications, it is required to be able to enforce 
   connectivity policy rules at the granularity of a site (or segment). 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                            [Page 5] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   This includes the ability to control which MES nodes in the network 
   can forward traffic to, or from, a given site. PBB-EVPN is capable 
   of providing this granularity of policy control. In the case where 
   per C-MAC address granularity is required, the EVI can always 
   continue to operate in E-VPN mode. 
    
   4.6.          Avoiding C-MAC Address Flushing 
 
   It is required to avoid C-MAC address flushing upon link, port or 
   node failure for multi-homed devices and networks. This is in order 
   to speed up re-convergence upon failure. 
    
   5.        Solution Overview 
    
   The solution involves incorporating IEEE 802.1ah Backbone Edge 
   Bridge (BEB) functionality on the E-VPN MES nodes similar to PBB-
   VPLS PEs where BEB functionality is incorporated in PE nodes. The 
   MES devices would then receive 802.1Q Ethernet frames from their 
   attachment circuits, encapsulate them in the PBB header and forward 
   the frames over the IP/MPLS core. On the egress E-VPN MES, the PBB 
   header is removed following the MPLS disposition, and the original 
   802.1Q Ethernet frame is delivered to the customer equipment.

   The MES nodes perform the following functions: 
   - Learn customer/client MAC addresses (C-MACs) over the attachment 
   circuits in the data-plane, per normal bridge operation. 
    
   - Learn remote C-MAC to B-MAC bindings in the data-plane from 
   traffic ingress from the core.

   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   - Advertise local B-MAC address reach-ability information in BGP to 
   all other MES nodes in the same set of service instances. Note that 
   every MES has a set of local B-MAC addresses that uniquely identify 
   the device. More on the MES addressing in section 5. 
    
   - Build a forwarding table from remote BGP advertisements received 
   associating remote B-MAC addresses with remote MES IP addresses. 
    
    
   6.        BGP Encoding 
    
   PBB-EVPN leverages the same BGP Routes and Attributes defined in [E-
   VPN], adapted as follows: 
    
   6.1.          BGP MAC Advertisement Route 
    
   The E-VPN MAC Advertisement Route is used to distribute B-MAC 
   addresses of the MES nodes instead of the C-MAC addresses of end-
   stations/hosts. This is because the C-MAC addresses are learnt in 
   the data-plane for traffic arriving from the core. The MAC 
   Advertisement Route is encoded as follows: 
     
   -The RD is set to a Type 1 RD RD [RFC4364]. The value field encodes 
   the IP address of the MES (typically, the loopback address) followed 
   by 0.  The reason for such encoding is that the RD cannot be that of 
   a single EVI since the same B-MAC address can span across multiple 
   EVIs. 
   -The MAC address field contains the B-MAC address. 
   -The Ethernet Tag field is set to 0. 
    
   The route is tagged with the set of RTs corresponding to all EVIs 
   associated with the B-MAC address. 
    
   All other fields are set as defined in [E-VPN]. 
 
   6.2.          Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route 
    
   The Ethernet A-D Route is used in PBB-EVPN to advertise reach-
   ability of Ethernet segments. The route is encoded as follows: 
    
   -The RD is set to a Type 1 RD RD [RFC4364]. The value field encodes 
   the IP address of the MES (typically, the loopback address) followed 
   by 0.  The reason for such encoding is that the RD cannot be that of 
   a single EVI since the same Ethernet segment can be associated with 
   multiple EVIs. 
   -The Ethernet Tag field is always set to 0. 
   -The MPLS label is downstream assigned and identifies the Ethernet 
   segment (i.e. B-MAC address) on the advertising MES. 
     
   The Ethernet A-D Route is tagged with the set of RTs corresponding 
   to all EVIs associated with the B-MAC address. 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                            [Page 7] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
    
   All other fields are set as defined in [E-VPN]. 
    
   6.3.          Per VPN Route Targets 
    
   PBB-EVPN uses the same set of route targets defined in [E-VPN]. More 
   specifically, the RT associated with a VPN is set to the value of 
   the I-SID associated with the service instance. This eliminates the 
   need for manually configuring the VPN-RT.  
    
    
   Note that all other BGP messages and/or attributes are used as 
   defined in [E-VPN]. 
    
   7.        Operation 
    
   This section discusses the operation of PBB-EVPN, specifically in 
   areas where it differs from [E-VPN]. 
 
   7.1.          MAC Address Distribution over Core 
    
   In PBB-EVPN, host MAC addresses (i.e. C-MAC addresses) need not be 
   distributed in BGP. Rather, every MES independently learns the C-MAC 
   addresses in the data-plane via normal bridging operation. Every MES 
   has a set of one or more unicast B-MAC addresses associated with it, 
   and those are the addresses distributed over the core in MAC 
   Advertisement routes. Given that these B-MAC addresses are global 
   within the provider's network, there's no need to advertise them on 
   a per service instance basis. 
    
   7.2.          Device Multi-homing 
    
   7.2.1.            MES MAC Layer Addressing & Multi-homing 
    
   In [802.1ah] every BEB is uniquely identified by one or more B-MAC 
   addresses. These addresses are usually locally administered by the 
   Service Provider. For PBB-EVPN, the choice of B-MAC address(es) for 
   the MES nodes must be examined carefully as it has implications on 
   the proper operation of multi-homing. In particular, for the 
   scenario where a CE is multi-homed to a number of MES nodes with 
   all-active redundancy and flow-based load-balancing, a given C-MAC 
   address would be reachable via multiple MES nodes concurrently. 
   Given that any given remote MES will bind the C-MAC address to a 
   single B-MAC address, then the various MES nodes connected to the 
   same CE must share the same B-MAC address. Otherwise, the MAC 
   address table of the remote MES nodes will keep flip-flopping 
   between the B-MAC addresses of the various MES devices. For example, 
   consider the network of Figure 1, and assume that MES1 has B-MAC BM1 
   and MES2 has B-MAC BM2. Also, assume that both links from CE1 to the 
   MES nodes are part of an all-active multi-chassis Ethernet link 
   aggregation group. If BM1 is not equal to BM2, the consequence is 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                            [Page 8] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   that the MAC address table on MES3 will keep oscillating such that 
   the C-MAC address CM of CE1 would flip-flop between BM1 or BM2, 
   depending on the load-balancing decision on CE1 for traffic destined 
   to the core. 
    
   Considering that there could be multiple sites (e.g. CEs) that are 
   multi-homed to the same set of MES nodes, then it is required for 
   all the MES devices in a Redundancy Group to have a unique B-MAC 
   address per site. This way, it is possible to achieve fast 
   convergence in the case where a link or port failure impacts the 
   attachment circuit connecting a single site to a given MES.

   Figure 2: B-MAC Address Assignment 
    
   In the example network shown in Figure 2 above, two sites 
   corresponding to CE1 and CE2 are dual-homed to MES1/MES2 and 
   MES2/MES3, respectively. Assume that BM1 is the B-MAC used for the 
   site corresponding to CE1. Similarly, BM2 is the B-MAC used for the 
   site corresponding to CE2. On MES1, a single B-MAC address (BM1) is 
   required for the site corresponding to CE1. On MES2, two B-MAC 
   addresses (BM1 and BM2) are required, one per site. Whereas on MES3, 
   a single B-MAC address (BM2) is required for the site corresponding 
   to CE2. All three MES nodes would advertise their respective B-MAC 
   addresses in BGP using the MAC Advertisement routes defined in [E-
   VPN]. The remote MES, MESr, would learn via BGP that BM1 is 
   reachable via MES1 and MES2, whereas BM2 is reachable via both MES2 
   and MES3. Furthermore, MESr establishes via the normal bridge 
   learning that C-MAC M1 is reachable via BM1, and C-MAC M2 is 
   reachable via BM2. As a result, MESr can load-balance traffic 
   destined to M1 between MES1 and MES2, as well as traffic destined to 
   M2 between both MES2 and MES3. In the case of a failure that causes, 
   for example, CE1 to be isolated from MES1, the latter can withdraw 
   the route it has advertised for BM1. This way, MESr would update its 
   path list for BM1, and will send all traffic destined to M1 over to 
   MES2 only.

   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   For single-homed sites, it is possible to assign a unique B-MAC 
   address per site, or have all the single-homed sites connected to a 
   given MES share a single B-MAC address. The advantage of the first 
   model over the second model is the ability to avoid C-MAC 
   destination address lookup on the disposition PE (even though source 
   C-MAC learning is still required in the data-plane). Also, by 
   assigning the B-MAC addresses from a contiguous range, it is 
   possible to advertise a single B-MAC subnet for all single-homed 
   sites, thereby rendering the number of MAC advertisement routes 
   required at par with the second model.  
    
   In summary, every MES may use a unicast B-MAC address shared by all 
   single-homed CEs or a unicast B-MAC address per single-homed CE, and 
   in addition a unicast B-MAC address per dual-homed CE. In the latter 
   case, the B-MAC address MUST be the same for all MES nodes in a 
   Redundancy Group connected to the same CE. 
     
   7.2.1.1.              Automating B-MAC Address Assignment 
    
   The MES B-MAC address used for single-homed sites can be 
   automatically derived from the hardware (using for e.g. the 
   backplane's address). However, the B-MAC address used for multi-
   homed sites must be coordinated among the RG members. To automate 
   the assignment of this latter address, the MES can derive this B-MAC 
   address from the MAC Address portion of the CE's LACP System 
   Identifier by flipping the 'Locally Administered' bit of the CE's 
   address. This guarantees the uniqueness of the B-MAC address within 
   the network, and ensures that all MES nodes connected to the same 
   multi-homed CE use the same value for the B-MAC address. 
    
   Note that with this automatic provisioning of the B-MAC address 
   associated with mult-homed CEs, it is not possible to support the 
   uncommon scenario where a CE has multiple bundles towards the MES 
   nodes, and the service involves hair-pinning traffic from one bundle 
   to another. This is because the split-horizon filtering relies on B-
   MAC addresses rather than Site-ID Labels (as will be described in 
   the next section). The operator must explicitly configure the B-MAC 
   address for this fairly uncommon service scenario. 
    
   Whenever a B-MAC address is provisioned on the MES, either manually 
   or automatically (as an outcome of CE auto-discovery), the MES MUST 
   transmit an MAC Advertisement Route for the B-MAC address with a 
   downstream assigned MPLS label that uniquely identifies the address 
   on the advertising MES. The route is tagged with the RTs of the 
   associated EVIs as described above. 
    
   7.2.2.            Split Horizon and Designated Forwarder Election 
    
   [E-VPN] relies on access split horizon, where the Ethernet Segment 
   Label is used for egress filtering on the attachment circuit in 
   order to prevent forwarding loops. In PBB-EVPN, the B-MAC source 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 10] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   address can be used for the same purpose, as it uniquely identifies 
   the originating site of a given frame. As such, Segment Labels are 
   not used in PBB-EVPN, and the egress filtering is done based on the 
   B-MAC source address. It is worth noting here that [802.1ah] defines 
   this B-MAC address based filtering function as part of the I-
   Component options, hence no new functions are required to support 
   split-horizon beyond what is already defined in [802.1ah]. 
   Given that the Segment label is not used in PBB-EVPN, the MES sets 
   the Label field in the Ethernet Segment Route to 0. 
    
   The Designated Forwarder election procedures remain unchanged from 
   [E-VPN]. 
    
   7.3.          Frame Forwarding 
    
   The frame forwarding functions are divided in between the Bridge 
   Module, which hosts the [802.1ah] Backbone Edge Bridge (BEB) 
   functionality, and the MPLS Forwarder which handles the MPLS 
   imposition/disposition. The details of frame forwarding for unicast 
   and multi-destination frames are discussed next. 
    
   7.3.1.            Unicast 
    
   Known unicast traffic received from the AC will be PBB-encapsulated 
   by the MES using the B-MAC source address corresponding to the 
   originating site. The unicast B-MAC destination address is 
   determined based on a lookup of the C-MAC destination address (the 
   binding of the two is done via transparent learning of reverse 
   traffic). The resulting frame is then encapsulated with an LSP 
   tunnel label and the MPLS label which uniquely identifies the B-MAC 
   destination address on the egress MES. If per flow load-balancing 
   over ECMPs in the MPLS core is required, then a flow label is added 
   as the end of stack label.   
    
   For unknown unicast traffic, the MES forwards these frames over MPLS 
   core. When these frames are to be forwarded, then the same set of 
   options used for forwarding multicast/broadcast frames (as described 
   in next section) are used. 
    
   7.3.2.            Multicast/Broadcast 
    
   Multi-destination frames received from the AC will be PBB-
   encapsulated by the MES using the B-MAC source address corresponding 
   to the originating site. The multicast B-MAC destination address is 
   selected based on the value of the I-SID as defined in [802.1ah]. 
   The resulting frame is then forwarded over the MPLS core using one 
   out of the following two options: 
    
   Option 1: the MPLS Forwarder can perform ingress replication over a 
   set of MP2P tunnel LSPs. The frame is encapsulated with a tunnel LSP 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 11] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   label and the E-VPN ingress replication label advertised in the 
   Inclusive Multicast Route. 
    
   Option 2: the MPLS Forwarder can use P2MP tunnel LSP per the 
   procedures defined in [E-VPN]. This includes either the use of 
   Inclusive or Aggregate Inclusive trees.  
    
   Note that the same procedures for advertising and handling the 
   Inclusive Multicast Route defined in [E-VPN] apply here. 
 
    
   8.        Solution Advantages 
    
   In this section, we discuss the advantages of the PBB-EVPN solution 
   in the context of the requirements set forth in section 3 above. 
    
   8.1.          MAC Advertisement Route Scalability 
    
   In PBB-EVPN the number of MAC Advertisement Routes is a function of 
   the number of segments (sites), rather than the number of 
   hosts/servers. This is because the B-MAC addresses of the MESes, 
   rather than C-MAC addresses (of hosts/servers) are being advertised 
   in BGP. And, as discussed above, there's a one-to-one mapping 
   between multi-homed segments and B-MAC addresses, whereas there's a 
   one-to-one or many-to-one mapping between single-homed segments and 
   B-MAC addresses for a given MES. As a result, the volume of MAC 
   Advertisement Routes in PBB-EVPN is multiple orders of magnitude 
   less than E-VPN. 
    
   8.2.          C-MAC Mobility with MAC Sub-netting 
    
   In PBB-EVPN, if a MES allocates its B-MAC addresses from a 
   contiguous range, then it can advertise a MAC prefix rather than 
   individual 48-bit addresses. It should be noted that B-MAC addresses 
   can easily be assigned from a contiguous range because MES nodes are 
   within the provider administrative domain; however, CE devices and 
   hosts are typically not within the provider administrative domain. 
   The advantage of such MAC address sub-netting can be maintained even 
   as C-MAC addresses move from one Ethernet segment to another. This 
   is because the C-MAC address to B-MAC address association is learnt 
   in the data-plane and C-MAC addresses are not advertised in BGP. To 
   illustrate how this compares to E-VPN, consider the following 
   example: 
    
   If a MES running E-VPN advertises reachability for a MAC subnet that 
   spans N addresses via a particular segment, and then 50% of the MAC 
   addresses in that subnet move to other segments (e.g. due to virtual 
   machine mobility), then in the worst case, N/2 additional MAC 
   Advertisement routes need to be sent for the MAC addresses that have 
   moved. This defeats the purpose of the sub-netting. With PBB-EVPN, 
   on the other hand, the sub-netting applies to the B-MAC addresses 
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 12] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   which are statically associated with MES nodes and are not subject 
   to mobility. As C-MAC addresses move from one segment to another, 
   the binding of C-MAC to B-MAC addresses is updated via data-plane 
   learning.   
      
   8.3.          C-MAC Address Learning and Confinement 
    
   In PBB-EVPN, C-MAC address reachability information is built via 
   data-plane learning. As such, MES nodes not participating in active 
   conversations involving a particular C-MAC address will purge that 
   address from their forwarding tables. Furthermore, since C-MAC 
   addresses are not distributed in BGP, MES nodes will not maintain 
   any record of them in control-plane routing table.  
    
   8.4.          Interworking with TRILL and 802.1aq Access Networks with C-MAC 
  Address Transparency 
    
   Consider the scenario where two access networks, one running MPLS 
   and the other running 802.1aq, are interconnected via an MPLS 
   backbone network. The figure below shows such an example network. 
    
    
                               +--------------+ 
                               |              | 
               +---------+     |     MPLS     |    +---------+ 
       +----+  |         |   +----+        +----+  |         |  +----+ 
       | CE |--|         |   |MES1|        |MES2|  |         |--| CE | 
       +----+  | 802.1aq |---|    |        |    |--|  MPLS   |  +----+ 
       +----+  |         |   +----+        +----+  |         |  +----+ 
       | CE |--|         |     |   Backbone   |    |         |--| CE | 
       +----+  +---------+     +--------------+    +---------+  +----+ 
    
   Figure 3: Interoperability with 802.1aq 
    
   If the MPLS backbone network employs E-VPN, then the 802.1aq data-
   plane encapsulation must be terminated on MES1 or the edge device 
   connecting to MES1. Either way, all the MES nodes that are part of 
   the associated service instances will be exposed to all the C-MAC 
   addresses of all hosts/servers connected to the access networks. 
   However, if the MPLS backbone network employs PBB-EVPN, then the 
   802.1aq encapsulation can be extended over the MPLS backbone, 
   thereby maintaining C-MAC address transparency on MES1. If PBB-EVPN 
   is also extended over the MPLS access network on the right, then C-
   MAC addresses would be transparent to MES2 as well. 
    
   Interoperability with TRILL access network will be described in 
   future revision of this draft.   
    
   8.5.          Per Site Policy Support 
    
    
     
   Sajassi, et al.                                           [Page 13] 
    
    
   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-01.txt  March 2011 
    
   In PBB-EVPN, a unique B-MAC address can be associated with every 
   site (single-homed or multi-homed). Given that the B-MAC addresses 
   are sent in BGP MAC Advertisement routes, it is possible to define 
   per site (i.e. B-MAC) forwarding policies including policies for E-
   TREE service. 
    
   8.6.          Avoiding C-MAC Address Flushing 
    
   With PBB-EVPN, it is possible to avoid C-MAC address flushing upon 
   topology change affecting a multi-homed segment. To illustrate this, 
   consider the example network of Figure 1. Both MES1 and MES2 
   advertize the same B-MAC address (BM1) to MES2. MES2 then learns the 
   C-MAC addresses of the servers/hosts behind CE1 via data-plane 
   learning. If AC1 fails, then MES3 does not need to flush any of the 
   C-MAC addresses learnt and associated with BM1. This is because MES1 
   will withdraw the MAC Advertisement routes associated with BM1, 
   thereby leading MES3 to have a single adjacency (to MES2) for this 
   B-MAC address. Therefore, the topology change is communicated to 
   MES3 and no C-MAC address flushing is required.
