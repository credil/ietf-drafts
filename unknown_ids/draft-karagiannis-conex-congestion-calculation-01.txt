        Non-TCP based Feedback for Congestion Exposure
       draft-karagiannis-conex-congestion-calculation-01


Abstract

   This document describes a solution used to feedback congestion 
   information calculated at the receiver, back to the sender using 
   non-TCP based protocols. The main advantage of this approach is that 
   applications that are not using the TCP protocol as transport 
   protocol could also apply the Conex concept to rely congestion 
   experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network.

Internet-Draft Congestion exposure using non-TCP        July 2011

1.  Introduction

   The ConEx working group is defining how IP packets will carry 
   additional ConEx information. This document describes a solution 
   used to feedback congestion information calculated at the receiver, 
   back to the sender using non-TCP based protocols.
   
   In [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01] a method is described on (1) 
   using ECN marks and packet drops to calculate the end-to-end path 
   congestion at the receiver, (2) feedback this congestion information 
   back to the sender using the TCP transport protocol, see also [draft-
   kuehlewind-conex-accurate-ecn-00] (3) relaying the congestion that 
   has been experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network 
   in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion is 
   visible to all IP devices along the path. 

   This draft specifies a solution used to feedback congestion 
   information calculated at the receiver, back to the sender using non-
   TCP based protocols, instead of using the TCP transport protocol. The 
   main advantage of this approach is that applications that are not 
   using the TCP protocol as transport protocol could also apply the 
   Conex concept to rely congestion experienced on the end-to-end path 
   back into the network.
   This solution uses three main steps: (1) using ECN marks and packet 
   drops to calculate the end-to-end path congestion at the receiver, 
   (2) feedbacking congestion information calculated at the receiver, 
   back to the sender by using non-TCP based protocols, for example DCCP 
   (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol)(3) relaying the congestion 
   that has been experienced on the end-to-end path back into the 
   network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of 
   congestion is visible to all IP devices along the path, (identical to 
   the same step specified in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]).

   2. Method of using non-TCP related feedback for congestion exposure 

   
   This document provides a method, see Figure 1, on (1) using ECN marks 
   and packet drops to calculate the end-to-end path loss event rate at 
   the receiver, which is identical to the one specified in [draft-ietf-
   conex-abstract-mech-01]), (2) feedbacking congestion information 
   calculated at the receiver, back to the sender by using non-TCP based 
   protocols, for example DCCP [RFC4340], [RFC5622], [RFC4342], (3) 
   relaying the congestion that has been experienced on the end-to-end 
   path back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the 
   total level of congestion is visible to all IP devices along the 
   path, which identical to the one specified in [draft-ietf-conex-
   abstract-mech-01]).

   During the first step used by this method the end-to-end path 
   loss event rate at the receiver is calculated using ECN marks 
   and packet drops. This loss event rate can be calculated using 
   different algorithms. As example we mention the use of loss event 
   rate calculation specified in [RFC5348] (in combination with 
   [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in combination with [RFC5622]). For a 
   normative specification of the loss event rate see (Section 5 of) 
   [RFC5348] and [RFC4828].

   During the second step used by this method the receiver sends the 
   calculated congestion rate to the sender using a non-TCP transport 
   protocol. For example, if the non-TCP transport protocol is DCCP then 
   this step can be realized by the specification given in [RFC5622] or 
   [RFC4342]. In this case the receiver reports in DCCP-Ack packets, 
   among others, also the number of loss event rate by using the Loss 
   event rate option described in Section 8.5 of [RFC4342].  

   During the third step the congestion rate at the sender side needs to 
   be calculated from the received congestion information carried by the 
   feedback protocol. The description of how this congestion rate is 
   calculated is out of the scope of this I-D. After that the congestion 
   rate is calculated, an identical procedure is used as the one 
   specified in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01] to encode the 
   Congestion exposure signals and to relay them back into the network 
   in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion is 
   visible to all IP devices along the path,
   {More details will be included in a next version of this draft.}

2.1.  Requirements for the ConEx Signal

      The following requirements apply to the Conex exposure signal, 
      which are in line with most of the requirements presented in 
     [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]:

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be visible to internetwork layer 
          devices along the entire path from the transport sender to the 
          transport receiver.  

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be useful under only partial 
          deployment.

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be timely.  

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be accurate (i.e., such that the 
          signaled congestion is represented accurately).

2.2.  Codepoint Encoding

   An identical encoding is used as the one specified in [draft-ietf-
   conex-abstract-mech-01]. 

2.3. Conex Components
  
   The same Conex enabled devices can be used as the ones specified in   
  [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01].

Internet-Draft Congestion exposure using non-TCP        July 2011

2.3.1 Modified Senders 

   The senders SHOULD support the protocol that is carrying the 
   congestion information from the receiver to the sender. Moreover, the 
   sender should implement an algorithm that can use the feedback 
   congestion information to calculate the congestion rate at the 
   sender. As example, if DCCP in combination with the TCP-Friendly Rate 
   Control (TFRC) is used, then the solutions specified in e.g., 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]) SHOULD be supported. 
   In addition, the sender MUST be able to encode the calculated 
   congestion rate at the sender into Conex Exposure Signals. This 
   latter procedure is the same as the same procedure used by [draft-
   ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01].

2.3.2 Intermediate Conex Enabled Devices

   The same intermediate Conex enabled devices could be used as the 
   intermediate Conex enabled devices specified in [draft-ietf-conex-  
   abstract-mech-01], e.g., Policer and Audit. 

2.3.3 Modified Receivers 

   The receiver SHOULD be able to calculate the congestion rate at the 
   receiver, which needs to be forwarded at the sender.

   Moreover, the receivers should be able to support the same transport 
   protocol supported by the sender used to feedback the calculated 
   congestion information from the receiver to the sender. 
   As example, if DCCP in combination with the TCP-Friendly Rate 
   Control (TFRC) is used then the solutions specified in e.g., 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]) SHOULD be applied.
