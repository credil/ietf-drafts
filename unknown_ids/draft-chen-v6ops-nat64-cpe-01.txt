                     draft-chen-v6ops-nat64-cpe-01

Abstract

   The document has proposed an approach of NAT64-CPE mode, which would
   give residential service opportunities to be accessed by remote
   subscribers going through IPv6 networks.  The document captures the
   fundamental NAT64 Functionalities with special cares to fit into CPE
   scenarios and don't need cooperate with DNS64 any more.  In addition,
   the CPE mode also allows IPv4 residential hosts to access IPv6
   service.  It will compatible with legacy residential hosts/servers
   and no further updates requirements to public DNS system.

Internet-Draft                  NAT64-CPE                     March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Recently,IPv6 transition is fairly prevalent due to the depletion of
   IPv4 soon enough.  However, the large number of installed CPE is
   IPv4-only based and likely to remain for several years.  Considering
   the existing deployment approaches, majority of ISP assigned private
   IPv4 address to their customers,including residential servers and
   hosts.  The nature of private IPv4 would block the end-to-end bi-
   directional communications.  On the other hand, the goal of Internet
   services is to offer users ubiquitous experiences.  User will be
   certainly supposed to able to enjoy such conveniences regardless of
   where we are.  Therefore, ISP would take advantage of the
   accessibilities of residential services to provide plenty of
   services.  Fortunately, IPv6 will get ISP end-to-end benefits.
   During IPv6 migration period, NAT64-CPE mode could overcome the
   obstacles to achieve final goals.

   The document is aimed at proposing an approach of NAT64-CPE mode,
   which would give residential service opportunities to be accessed by
   remote subscribers going through IPv6 networks.  The document
   captures the fundamental NAT64[NAT64] functionalities with special
   cares to fit into CPE scenarios.  In these scenarios, the NAT64-CPE
   don't need cooperate with DNS64[DNS64] any more, whereby this
   mechanism allows an IPv6-only client (i.e. either a host with only
   IPv6 stack, or a host with both IPv4 and IPv6 stack, but only with
   IPv6 connectivity or a host running an IPv6 only application) to
   initiate communications to an IPv4-only residential service server.

   In addition, such CPE mode also allows IPv4 residential hosts to be
   capable of accessing IPv6 service.  The packages generated by IPv4
   hosts can be translated by NAT64-CPE, which will communicate with
   IPv6 servers.

   The document is structured as follows.  Section 2 describes
   appropriate scenario the NAT64-CPE mode fit to.  Section 3 enumerates
   various functional parts for NAT64-CPE operation.  Section 4 focus on
   the benefits the NAT64-CPE could bring.  Section 5 is further
   securities consideration.

   Figure 1 illustrates a possible network scenario where an IPv6-only
   client attached to a dual-stack network, but the destination server
   is running on a private site where there is NAT64-CPE numbered with
   public IPv6 addresses and private IPv4 addresses.  DNS is located in

   This scenario could allow legacy IPv4 host to access IPv6 services.
   There are no additional requirements for IPv4 host.


3.  NAT64-CPE Mode Operation

   The whole process of NAT64-CPE operation involves CPE, DNS and
   addressing mechanism.  This section illustrates different parts of
   functionalities for each scenario.

3.1.  NAT64-CPE Operations for Scenario 1

3.1.1.  CPE Functionalities Description

   Two kinds of functions the NAT64-CPE would take on.  First, it will
   perform the functionalities that normal CPE does except NAT44
   forwarding, like assigning private IPv4 address to their attached
   residential servers.  Additionally, CPE will allocate private IPv4
   address to the servers depending on the server MAC address.
   Therefore, the server could always get constant private IPv4 address.

   Second, CPE should carry NAT64 capable mode without integrating
   DNS64.  According to normative handing, NAT64-CPE translates in-
   coming IPv6 destination address by striping NAT64 IPv6-prefix and
   maintains a IPv4 pool for translating IPv6 sources address.  Therein,
   the NAT64 IPv6 prefix will be NSP specified in IPv6 Addressing of
   IPv4/IPv6 Translators.  And, ISP will reserve distinct NSP for each
   CPE.

   The prerequisite here is that NAT64-CPE should maintain address

   mapping between inner IP address and outer IP address.  PCP [PCP]
   could handle such problems.  But that goes beyond the scope of this
   draft.  Also, NAT64-CPE would install ALG, but it is optional.

3.1.2.  DNS Configuration Consideration

   Each residential services should be represented by FQDN format so as
   to users could easily remember and understand.  The corresponding
   naming resource record should be stored as AAAA.  The record's IPv6
   address is synthesized by NAT64 prefix and private IPv4 address.  The
   IPv6 format is compliant with assembling IPv6 address in DNS64.

   The deployed DNS just follow regular DNS handling.  There are no
   demands for performing DNS64 process.

3.1.3.  NAT64-CPE Flow Example for Scenario 1

   Figure 3 demonstrates the NAT64-CPE Mode operation flow, in which
   IPv6 host initiate service interaction with residential server
   remotely.  The detailed actions that different entities performed was
   described afterwards.

   (1) NAT64-CPE should be configured with NAT64 prefix, which is
   allocated by ISP.  In that case, the NAT64 prefix is 2001::/64.
   NAT64-CPE assign private IPv4 address to the servers depending on the
   server MAC address.  And, NAT64-CPE already has maintained the

   mapping between inner IP address and outer IP address.

   (2)IPv6-only host initiates AAAA query for resolving service name,
   for example, that is household.cam.

   (3)DNS response AAAA record to the previous query.  The IPv6 address
   of this service is synthesized by NAT64 prefix and assigned private
   IPv4 address.  That is 2001::a01:101

   (4)IPv6-only host send IPv6 traffic targeting to 2001::a01:101.  The
   IPv6 traffic is routed to CPE.

   (5)NAT64-CPE detects incoming IPv6 packets and algorithmically
   translated to IPv4 addresses by using the algorithm defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The translated IPv4 traffic is
   headed to IPv4-only residential server and perform somehow process.

   (6)The residential IPv4 server responses these requests by IPv4
   traffic, which will be sent to CPE.  CPE performes reversed algorithm
   to translate IPv4 to IPv6 based on the maintained mapping
   information.  And then, CPE generate IPv6 traffic and transmit to
   IPv6-only Host.

3.2.  NAT64-CPE Operations for Scenario 2

3.2.1.  CPE Functionalities Description

   In this scenario, CPE is integrated with DNS-ALG, which will accept
   IPv4 DNS A query and translated into A and AAAA.  After name-
   resolving is finished in IPv6 network, DNS-ALG take different actions
   according to DNS responses.

   o  DNS response only contains AAAA response.  DNS-ALG will translate
      AAAA into A response.  Meanwhile, a private IPv4 is required to be
      assigned to DNS A response. while, NAT64-CPE creates corresponding
      IPv6->IPv4 mapping in NAT6-CPE.

   o  DNS response contains AAAA and A response.  DNS-ALG will return A
      response to IPv4 hosts.  There are no additional states NAT64-CPE
      need to create.

   o  DNS response only contains A response.  DNS-ALG will return A
      response to IPv4 hosts.  There are no additional states NAT64-CPE
      need to create.

   When IPv4 hosts get DNS responses through NAT64-CPE, it would create
   packets to communicate with remote servers.  When the packet reaches
   the CPE box, CPE would recognize if the flow is belonging to existing

   IP address mapping by determining IPv4 destination address and port.
   if CPE found matching records in NAT cache, NAT64-CPE would assign
   IPv6 address and port to translate the tuple of (Source Address,
   Source TCP port).  Otherwise, NAT64-CPE will do NAT44 forwarding.

   Internal IPv4 host initiate service interaction with remote IPv6
   server.

4.  NAT64-CPE Approach Discussion

   Considering above description, NAT64-CPE has following specific
   features.

   o  NAT64-CPE is capable of making residential server to be accessed,
      by means of which users could visit the IPv4-only server remotely.

   o  NAT64-CPE is a solely NAT64 deployed solution in CPE environment.
      It will compatible with legacy residential servers and no further
      updates requirements to DNS.  Therefore, it's liable to be
      deployed.

   o  NAT64-CPE allows legacy IPv4 hosts to access IPv6 service.  There
      are no additional requirements for IPv4 hosts.


5.  Security Considerations

   Essentially, there are strong demands to have thorough security
   mechanism to prevent privacy invasion in CPE scenario.  The detailed
   considerations need to be further identified.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
