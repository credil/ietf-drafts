      <t>Flow selection is the process of selecting a subset of flows from all
   flows observed at an observation point. Flow selection reduces the effort of 
   post-processing flow data and transferring flow records.  
   This document describes motivations for flow
   selection and presents flow selection techniques. It 
   provides an information model for configuring flow selection
   techniques and discusses what information about a flow selection
   process should be exported.</t>

    <section title="Scope" toc="default">
      <t>This document describes flow selection techniques for traffic
   measurements. A flow is defined as a set of packets with common properties as described in <xref target="RFC5101"></xref>. 
   Flow selection can be done to limit the resource demands for capturing, storing, exporting and
   post-processing of flow records. It also can be used to select a particular set of flows that are of interest to a specific application. This document provides a cathegorization of flow selection techniques and describes configuration and reporting parameters for them. In order to be compliant with this document, at least one of proposed flow selection schemes MUST be implemented. That means that the configuration parameters as well as the reporting information elements for this particular scheme MUST be supported.
   </t>
   
   <t>This document also addresses configuration and reporting parameters for flow-state dependent packet selection as described in <xref target="RFC5475"></xref>, although the technique is categorized as packet selection. The reason is, thta flow-state dependent packet selection techniques often aim at the reduction of resources for flow capturing and flow processing. Furthermore, they were only briefly discussed in <xref target="RFC5475"></xref>. Therefore we included configuration and reporting considerations for such techniques in this document. 
      </t>
    </section>
    
  
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document is consistent with the terminology introduced in <xref target="RFC5101"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5470"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5475"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3917"></xref>.
	  As in <xref target="RFC5101"></xref> and <xref target="RFC5476"></xref>, the first letter of each IPFIX-specific and PSAMP-specific term is capitalized along with the flow selection specific terms defined here.</t>
	  
	 <t>* Classification </t>  
		<t><list style="empty">
          <t> Classification is a process in which packets are mapped to specific
      flow records based on packet properties.  These properties
      make up the flow key (e.g. header information, packet content, AS
      number).  In case a flow record for a specific flow key already
      exists the flow record is updated, otherwise a new flow record is
      created. 
		  </t>
		  
     </list></t>  
	  
	<t>* Flow Selection Process</t>
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>A Flow Selection Process takes classified packets, flow cache entries or flow records as its input and selects a 
          subset of that set as its output. A Flow Selection Process MAY run on several instances within 
          the IPFIX architecture. A Flow Selection Process MAY be part of an IPFIX metering process, 
          exporting process or as an Intermediate Selection Process running on an IPFIX Mediator.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>* Flow Selection State</t>
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>A Flow Selection Process SHOULD maintain state information for use
          by the Flow Selector. At a given time, the Flow Selection State may depend on 
          flows and packets observed at and before that time, as well as other variables. Examples include:<list hangIndent="8"
              style="hanging">
              <t hangText="  (i)">sequence number of packets and accounted flow records;</t>
   
              <t hangText="  (ii)">number of selected flows;</t>
			  
			  <t hangText="  (iii)">number of observed flows;</t>
			  
			  <t hangText="  (iv)">current flow cache occupancy;</t>
			  
			  <t hangText="  (v)">flow specific counters, lower und upper bounds</t>
			  
			  <t hangText="  (vi)">flow selection timeout intervals</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

     <t>* Flow Selector</t>
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>A Flow Selector defines the action of a Flow Selection Process on
          a single flow of its input. The Flow Selector can make use of the
          following information in order to establish whether a flow has to be 
          selected or not:<list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
              <t hangText="  (i)">the content of the flow record;</t>

              <t hangText="  (ii)">any state information related to the metering or exporting process;</t>

              <t hangText="  (iii)">any Flow Selection State that may be maintained by the Flow Selection Process.</t>
		  
            </list></t>
        </list></t>
		
		
	<t>* Complete Flow </t>
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t> A Complete Flow consists of all packets within the flow time-Out interval that enter the Flow Selection Process and belong to the same flow as defined by the flow definition. For this definition only packets are considered that arrive at the Flow Selection Process. That means, packets that are not observed at the Flow Selection Process because of prior packet selection or packet loss are not considered as belonging to the Complete Flow. </t>
        </list></t>
		
		
	<t>* Flow Filtering</t>
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t> Flow Filtering selects flows based on a deterministic function on the flow record content, flow state, external properties (e.g. ingress interface) or external events (e.g violated Access Control List). If the relevant parts of the flow record content can be already observed at packet level (e.g. flow keys from packet header fields) Flow Filtering can be performed at packet level by property match packet filtering as described in <xref target="RFC5475"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>
	
	<t>* Flow Sampling</t>
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t> Flow Sampling selects flows based on flow record sequence or arrival times (e.g. position in flow cache, arrival time at exporter or mediator). The selection can be systematic (e.g. every n-th record) or based on a random functions (e.g. select each record with probability p, or randomly select n out of N records). </t>
        </list></t>
		
		
	<t>* Aggregation Process</t>
      <t><list style="empty">
          <t> In the IPFIX metering process the aggregation process aggregates packet data into flow data and forms the flow cache entries or flow records. After the aggregation step only the aggregated flow information is available. Information about individual packets is lost.  </t>
        </list></t>
		
    </section>




    <section title="Difference between Flow Selection and Packet Selection">
      <t> Flow selection differs from packet selection described in <xref target="RFC5475"></xref>. Packet selection techniques consider packets as basic element and the parent population consists of all packets observed at an observation point. In contrast to this the basic elements 
  in flow selection are the flows. The parent population consists of all observed flows and the selection process operates on the flows. The major characteristics of flow selection are the following: </t>
  <t>
  <list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
    <t hangText="- ">Flow selection takes flows as basic elements. For packet selection, packets are considered as basic elements.</t>
    <t hangText="- ">Flow selection can only take place after classification, because the classification rules determine to which flow a packet belongs. Packet selection can be applied before or after classification.</t>
    <t hangText="- ">Flow selection operates on complete flows. That means that after the flow selection process either all packets of the flow are kept or all packets of the flow are discarded. All packets of the flow here means all packets that enter the flow selection process. That means that if the flow selection is preceded by a packet selection process the complete flow consists only of the packets that where not discarded during the packet selection.</t>
</list>
</t>
	<t>There are some techniques that are difficult to unambiguously categorize into one of the categories. We here give some guidance how to categorize such techniques: 
	
	 <list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
    <t hangText="- ">Techniques that can be considered as both, packet and flow selection: Some packet selection techniques result in the selection of whole flows and therefore can be considered as packet or as flow selection at the same time. An example is property match filtering of all packets to a specific destination address. If flows are defined based on destination addresses, such a packet selection also results in a flow selection and can be considered as packet or flow selection.</t>
    <t hangText="- "> Flow-state dependent packet selection (as described in <xref target="RFC5475"></xref>): There exist techniques that select packets based on the flow state, e.g. based on the number of already observed packets belonging to the flow. Examples of these techniques from the literature are  "Sample and Hold" <xref target="EsVa01"></xref> "Fast Filtered Sampling" <xref target="MSZC10"></xref> or the "Sticky Sampling" algorithm presented in <xref target="MaMo02"></xref>. Such techniques can be used to influence which flows are captured (e.g.  increase the selection of packets belonging to large flows) and reduce the number of flows that need to be stored in the flow cache. Nevertheless, such techniques do not necessarily select Complete Flows, because it is not ensured that all packets of a selected flow are captured. Therefore flow-state dependent packet selection methods that do not ensure that either all or no packets of a flow are selected strictly speaking have to be considered as packet selection technique and not as flow selection.

        </figure> 
		In contrast to packet selection, flow selection is always
      applied after the packets are classified into flows. Flows can be
      selected at different stages of the measurement chain: 
      <list  style="numbers">
          <t>during Metering Process before aggregation</t>
          <t>during Metering Process after aggregation;</t>
          <t>during Exporting Process</t>
          <t>in an Intermediate Selection Process on a Mediator</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Flow selection in the Metering Process before Aggregation">
        <t> In the aggregation process the packet information is used to update the flow entries in the flow cache. Flow selection that is applied before aggregation equals a packet selection process. The flow still consists of individual packets. Those are then selected based on the classification 
information, i.e. based on the flow they belong to. Flow selection before aggregation can be based on the fields of the flow key (also on a hash value over these fields), but not based on characteristics that are only available after aggregation (e.g. flow size, flow duration). Flow selection before aggregation is applied to reduce resources for all succeeding processes (aggregation, exporting process) or select specific flows of interest in case such flow characteristics are already observable at packet level (e.g. flows to specific IPs).  In contrast, flow state dependent packet selection is a packet selection method, because it does not necessarily select Complete Flows. Flow selection before aggregation and flow state dependent packet selection can be applied in arbitrary order.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Flow selection in the Metering Process after Aggregation">
        <t>Flow selection after aggregation is usually applied to reduce the flows to those that are of interest to a particular application and to unload flow export 
        and flow postprocessing. Since the flow cache entries are already generated by the aggregation process flow selection after aggregation can also depend on flow characteristics 
        that are only visible after the aggregation of packets, such as flow size and flow duration. </t>
	</section> 
    
	  <section title="Flow selection during the Exporting Process">
        <t>The Exporting Process may implement policies for exporting only a
   subset of the flow records which have been stored in the system
   memory. Flow selection in the exporting process may select only the subset of flow records which are of interest to the users application, or select only as many flow records than can be handled by the available resources ( e.g. limited flow cache size and export link capacity). 

</t>
    </section>

     <section title="Flow selection as a function of the IPFIX Mediator">
      <t>As shown in <xref target="flowselection"></xref>, flow
      selection can be performed as an intermediate process within an IPFIX
      Mediator <xref target="RFC6183"></xref>.  The Intermediate Selection Process takes a flow record stream as its input and retrieves a record stream.
	  The Intermediate Selection Process can again apply a flow selection technique to obtain flows of interest for the application. Further the Intermediate Selection Process can 
	  base its selection decision on the correlation of data from different observation points, e.g by only selecting flows that were at least recorded on two observation points.   
   </t>
    </section>
	</section>


    <section title="Flow Selection Techniques">
      <t> A flow selection technique selects either all packets or none of a flow, otherwise the technique has to be considered as packet selection. We distinguish between Flow Filtering and Flow Sampling. 
	  </t>
	 <section title="Flow Filtering">
	 <t>
	  Flow Filtering is a deterministic function on the IPFIX flow record content. In case that the relevant flow characteristics are already observable at packet level (e.g. flow keys) Flow Filtering can be applied before aggregation at packet level. 
	  </t>
	  <section title="Property Match Filtering">
	  <t>Flow Filtering can be done similarly to Property Match Filtering for packet selection described in <xref target="RFC5475"></xref>. 
	  The difference is that, instead of packet fields, flow record fields are here used to derive the selection decision. Property Match Filtering is typically used to select a specific subset of the flows that are of interest to a particular application (e.g. all flows to a specific destination, all large flows, etc.). Properties on which the filtering is based can be for example flow keys, the flow size in bytes, 
	  the number of packets in the flow, the observation time of the first or last packet, or the maximum packet length. The selection criteria can be a specific value or an interval. Property match filtering can be applied before aggregation in case the properties are already observable at the packet level (e.g. flow key fields). 
	  </t>
	  <t>There are content based Property Match filtering techniques that require a compution on the current flow cache. An example is the selection of the k largest flows or a percentage of flows with the longest livetime. This type of Property Match Filtering is also used in flow selection techniques that react on external events (e.g. resource constraint). For example in case the flow cache is full, the flow cache entry with the lowest flow volume per current flow live time is deleted. 
	  </t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Hash-based Flow Filtering">
	  <t> Hash-based Flow Filtering uses a Hash Function h to map the flow key c onto a Hash Range R.  A flow is selected if the hash value h(c) is within the Hash Selection Range S, which is
	  a subset of R. Hash-based Flow Filtering can be used to emulate a random sampling process but still enable the correlation between selected flow subset at different 
	  observation points. Hash-based Flow Filtering is similar to Hash-based Packet Selection, and in fact is identical when Hash-based Packet Selection uses the flow key that define the flow as the Hash Input. 
	  Nevertheless there MAY be the incentive to apply Hash-based Flow Selection not on the packet level before aggregation, for example when the size of the Selection Range and therefore the 
	  sampling probability is dependent on the number of observed flows.
	  </t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Flow State Dependent Flow Filtering">
	  <t> Flow state dependent filtering does not base the selection decision on fields of the current flow record content but on the flow state which may be kept additionally for each of the flows. External processes may update counters, bounds and timers for each of the flow records and the flow selection process utilises this information for the selection decision. A review of flow state dependent filtering techniques that aim at the selection of the most frequent items by keeping additional flow state information can be found in <xref target="CoHa08"></xref>. Flow state dependent flow filtering can only be applied after aggregation, when a packet has been assigned to a flow cache. The selection process then decides based upon the flow state for each flow if it is kept in the flow cache or not. 
	  Two flow dependent flow filtering techniques are here described: </t>
	  
	<t> The Frequent Algorithm <xref target="KaPS03"></xref> is a technique that aims at the selection of all flows that at least exceed a 1/k fraction of the observed packet stream. The algorithm has only a flow cache of size k-1 and each flow in the cache has an additional counter. The counter is incremented each time a packet belonging to the flow in the flow cache is observed. In case the observed packet does not belong to any flow all counters are decremented and if any of the flow counters have a value of zero the flow is replaced with the new flow. </t> 

	<t>Lossy Counting is a selection technique that identifies all flows whose packet count exceeds a certain percentage of the whole observed packet stream (e.g. 5% of all packets) with a certain estimation error e. Lossy Counting seperates the observed packet stream in windows of size N=1/e, where N is an amount of consecutive packets. For each observed flow an additional counter will be held in the flow state. The counter is incremented each time a packet belonging to the flow is observed and all counters are decremented at the end of each window and all flows with a counter of zero will be removed from the flow cache. </t>
	</section>
</section>
	  <section title="Flow Sampling">
	  <t>
	  Flow sampling operates on flow record sequence or arrival times. It can use a systematic or a random functions for the selection process. Flow sampling usually aims at the selection of a representative subset of all flows in order to estimate characteristics of the whole set (e.g. mean flow size in the network).
	    </t>
	  <section title="Systematic Sampling">
	  <t>Systematic sampling is a deterministic selection function. Systematic sampling may be a periodic
	  selection of the k-th flow record which arrives at the exporting or mediator process. Systematic Sampling can also be applied before aggregation. An example would be to use an additional data structure that saves the flow keys of the not selected flows. Then one can create a flow cache entry for the k-th observed packet that has yet no flow cache entry and is not within the data structure containing the not selected flows. 
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  Systematic sampling can also be time-based. Systematic Sampling is applied by only creating flows that are observed between time-based start and stop triggers. The time interval may be applied at packet level or after aggregation level, e.g. by selecting every k seconds a flow arriving at the export process. 
	  </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Random Sampling">
	  <t>
	  Random flow sampling is based on a random process which requires the calculation of random numbers. One can differentiate between n-out-N and probabilistic sampling. 
	  The sampling probability of individual flows records MAY be adjusted according to the flow record content or external events like the available export resources. 
	  Non-uniform random sampling approaches can be applied similar to the ones defined in <xref target="RFC5475"></xref>. An example would be to prefer large volume flows over small volume flows. Random flow sampling can also be applied before aggregation when additional flow state about non selected flows is kept. 
	  </t>  	  
	  </section>
	</section>
				
		
	<section title="Flow-state Dependent Packet Selection">
	  <t> As explained above Flow-state Dependent Packet Selection is not a Flow Selection Technique but a packet selection. Nevertheless we will describe configuration and reporting parameters for this technique in this document. An example is the the "Sample and Hold" algorithm <xref target="EsVa01"></xref> that tries to prefer large volume flows in the selection. When a packet arrives it is selected when already a flow cache entry for this packet exists. In case there is no flow cache entry, the packet is selected by a certain probability that is dependent on the packet size.

    <section title="Information Model for Flow Selection Reporting">
      <t>In this section we describe Information Elements (IEs) that SHOULD be exported by a flow selection process in order to support the interpretation of measurement results from flow measurements where only some flows are selected. The information is mainly used to report how many packets and flows have been observed in total and how many of them where selected. This helps for instance to calculate the attained sampling fraction, which is an important parameter to provide an accuracy statement. 
	  The IEs can provide reporting information about flow records, flow cache entries, packets or bytes. The reported metrics are number of total and the number of selected elements. From this the number of dropped elements can be derived. All counters are delta counters and SHOULD be exported and reset when a new measurement interval starts. Additional IEs may be useful for future flow selection techniques. Those can be defined additionally if needed.

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document introduces several new information elements as an
      extension to the IPFIX information model. Values TBD1-TBD10 in this document 
should be replaced with the assigned numbers by IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>In this section security issues concerning an IPFIX device performing
   flow selection are pointed out.  In case the flow selection function
   is activated an IPFIX device might be exposed to security threats.
   Since flow selection implies analysing flow packets, associating them
   to a specific traffic flow and selecting flow records, a malicious
   user who was able to gain control of an IPFIX device might access
   both packet and flow data, thus violating their confidentiality.</t>
   
	  <t>Furthermore, the intruder might be attracted by the possibility of
   altering the flow selection process by modifying the criteria used to
   select flow records.  In this case, the IPFIX device would export
   flow data which are different from the ones that the Collector
   expects to receive.</t>
   
	  <t>It is apparent that these security threats can be mitigated by
   authenticating entities that interact with the IPFIX device and
   keeping information for flow selection configuration confidential.</t>
