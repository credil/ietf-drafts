Internet-Draft                PANA Key Wrap                 October 2010


1.  Introduction

   PANA [RFC5191] as a UDP-based protocol to perform EAP authentication
   between a PaC (PANA Client) and a PAA (PANA Authentication Agent).

   This document specifies an extension for PANA [RFC5191] to securely
   distribute keys from a PAA (PANA Authentication Agent) to a PaC (PANA
   Client) using AES Key Wrap with Padding algorithm [RFC5649].  A
   typical usage for this extension is group key distribution.  For
   example, a ZigBee Network Key is a group key that is shared among
   members of a ZigBee network and used for bootstrapping IEEE 802.15.4
   link-layer ciphering between adjacent ZigBee nodes.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Basic Operation

   Upon successful PANA authentication, a key wrap AVP MAY be placed in
   the PAR message, which will have the header 'C' (Complete) bit set
   and contain a Result-Code AVP indicating PANA_SUCCESS.  A key wrap
   AVP MUST be of type OctetString, MUST contain exactly one key of a
   specific type, and MAY be defined as a standard or vendor-specific
   AVP.  A distinct AVP code MUST be defined for each key type.


3.  Key Encryption Key

   PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY is used for encrypting a key to be delivered to teh
   PaC.  AES Key Wrap with Padding algorithm as specified in [RFC5649]
   is used as the key encryption algorithm.  PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY is derived
   from MSK as follows.

   PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY = the first 256 bits of
         prf+(MSK, "Key Encryption Key" | SID | KID)
         where | denotes concatenation.

   o  The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC4306].  The pseudo-
      random function used for the prf+ function is specified in the
      PRF-Algorithm AVP carried in a PANA-Auth-Request message with 'S'
      (Start) bit set.

   o  "Key Encryption Key" is the ASCII code representation of the non-
      NULL terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   o  SID is a four-octet Session Identifier [RFC5191].

   o  KID is the content of the Key-ID AVP [RFC5191] associated with the
      MSK.


4.  ZigBee-Network-Key AVP

   The ZigBee-Network-Key AVP (Vendor-Id to be allocated by IANA for
   "ZigBee Alliance", AVP Code 1) is a vendor-specific key wrap AVP,
   carrying an encrypted 128-bit Network Key used in the ZigBee IP
   network over which PANA is operating.


5.  Security Considerations

   Implementations must protect the PANA_KEK_ENC_KEY.  Implementations
   must not use the PANA_KEK_ENC_KEY for other purposes than wrapping
   keys in key wrap AVPs and must not use wrapped keys for other
   purposes than their intended usages.  Compromise of the
   PANA_KEK_ENC_KEY may result in the disclosure of all keys that have
   been wrapped with the PANA_KEK_ENC_KEY, which may lead to the
   compromise of all traffic protected with those wrapped keys.

   According to [RFC5649], the effective security provided to data
   protected with the wrapped key is determined by the weaker of the
   algorithm associated with the key encryption key and the algorithm
   associated with the wrapped key.  PANA_KEY_ENC_KEY is the key
   encryption key and associated with AES-256.  For ZigBee Network Key
   as the wrapped key, the length of the Network Key is 128 bits, and
   therefore at most 128 bits protection is provided to any data that
   depends on the Network Key.


6.  IANA Considerations

   A new SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code [ianaweb] for
   "ZigBee Alliance" needs to be allocated for Vendor-Id field of
   ZigBee-Network-Key AVP.

Appendix A.  Example Usage - ZigBee

   In this section, we show how PRE is used in ZigBee IP use case.

   In ZigBee IP, Joining Node (JN) is the PaC, Parent Node (PN) is the
   PRE (PANA Relay Element) [I-D.ohba-pana-relay] and 6LBR
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] is the PAA.  IPv6 link-local addresses of these
   nodes are generated from their EUI-64 MAC addresses.  The overall
   ZigBee IP bootstrapping procedure using PANA with PRE is shown in
   Figure 1.

    Figure 1: Example Call Flow for Bootstrapping ZigBee IP using PANA
                              and Network Key

   Step 1: JN performs network discovery and selection based on IEEE
   802.15.4 beacon request and response exchange through which PN's
   EUI-64 MAC address is known to JN.

   Step 2: JN performs IPv6 Router Discovery and obtains a global prefix
   of the ZigBee IP network.  Router Soliciatation and Router
   Advertisement messages are unprotected.

   Step 3: JN performs PANA authentication through PN as the PRE.  JN
   uses its IPv6 link-local address for PANA.  The PRE uses its IPv6
   link-local address to communicate with the PaC (JN) and uses its IPv6
   global address to communicate with the PAA (6LBR).  Upon successful
   PANA authentication, Network Key, or a group key to bootstrap link-
   layer ciphering is securely transported from 6LBR to JN.  Network Key
   is encrypted in a ZigBee-Network-Key AVP in a PAR message sent from
   PAA with the 'C' (Complete) bit set and a Result-Code AVP indicating
   PANA_SUCCESS.

   Step 4: Link-layer ciphering is enabled between JN and PN using
   Network Key. Note that PN also has Network Key that was obtained when

   PN joined the ZigBee IP network and perfomed PANA authentication as a
   JN.

   Step 5: Once link-layer ciphering is enabled between JN and PN, JN
   configures an IPv6 global address using the prefix obtained in Step
   2, and performs an IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor
   Advertisement exchange of 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] to regesiter the global address with PN.  IP
   traffic using the global address of JN can go through PN after
   successful registration.
