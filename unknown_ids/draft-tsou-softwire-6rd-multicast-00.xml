<abstract>
	<t>This document describes how IPv6 multicast can be extended across 
	an IPv4 network to an IPv6 host, using the native multicast capabilities
	of the IPv4 network.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>6rd (<xref target="RFC5569"/>, <xref target="RFC5969"/>) provides 
	a means to connect IPv6 hosts to the IPv6 Internet across an IPv4 provider
	network. Unicast traffic is carried through IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels. It
	is possible to carry multicast traffic from the IPv6 network through
	the IPv4 network in the same way, but if multiple customers wish access
	to the same multicast channels, the failure to use the native multicast
	capabilities of the IPv4 network wastes resources in that network.  </t>

	<t>This document describes a solution use the native multicast capabilities
	of the IPv4 network to acquire and forward multicast traffic from IPv6
	Internet to an IPv6 host attached to the IPv4 network. Typically this
	solution will operate in combination with 6rd for unicast traffic. However,
	no IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling is required for signalling, only the ability to 
	interwork between IPv4 and IPv6 at the 6rd Customer Equipment (6rd CE) and 
	the 6rd Border Relay (BR). </t>

		<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
		"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document

</section> <!-- intro -->

<section anchor="sol" title="Description of the Solution">

	<t>A number of problems have to be solved to allow an IPv6 host attached
	to an IPv4 network to request and receive a multicast stream originating
	in a neighbouring IPv6 network and passing through the IPv4 network using
	the native multicast facilities of that network. These problems are 
	described in detail in the course of presenting proposed solutions to
	them.</t>
	
	<section anchor="arch" title="Assumed Architecture">
	
		<t>This document assumes an architecture similar to that of 6rd 
		<xref target="RFC5569"/>, <xref target="RFC5969"/>, with additional
		capabilities for the 6rd CE and the 6rd Border Relay. In addition,
		it postulates a multicast source discovery and translation function,
		which MAY be collocated with the BR. See <xref target="fig_mularch"/>.</t>

	<section anchor="solSteps" title="Steps In the Proposed Solution">
	
		<t>1. Initial discovery and Join request</t>

		<t>The IPv6 Host discovers the &lt;Source, Group> address pair of a multicast
		stream the user wants to receive. The discovery is by means outside 
		the scope of this specification (e.g., via the web). The IPv6 Host 
		sends an MLDv2 <xref target="RFC3810"/> request to the 6rd CE to 
		acquire the stream.</t>

      ------->
      MLD/IPv6
			</artwork>
		</figure>

		<t>2. &lt;Source, Group> Address Mapping At 6rd CE</t>

		<t>The 6rd CE checks its cache of mappings to see if it already has a
		mapping between the IPv6 &lt;Source, Group> address pair received in 
		the MLD request and a corresponding pair of IPv4 addresses. Failing
		to find a mapping, it sends a request for the required mapping to the
		Translator. The Translator in turn checks whether it has already
		created the mapping. If not, it assigns unicast and multicast IPv4 
		addresses from its pool and records the mapping for further use. In
		either case it returns the requested mapping to the 6rd CE, which caches
		it. [Editor's Note: The transaction is carried out over a protocol to be 
		specified in a later version of this document.]</t>

                   ----------------------------->
                      TBD protocol / IPv4
			</artwork>
		</figure>
	
		<t>3. Propagation Of the Join Request Into the IPv4 Network</t>
		
		<t>The 6rd CE interworks between the MLDv2 request it received and an 
		IGMPv3 <xref target="RFC3376"/> request which it forwards to the 
		Provider IP Edge. It uses the address pair mapping it received from
		the Translator as part of this interworking.</t>
		
		<t>The Provider IP Edge acts on the IGMP request by forwarding a PIM 
		<xref target="RFC3973"/> or <xref target="RFC4601"/> request into the
		IPv4 network, indicating the IPv4 &lt;Source, Group> address pair it 
		was given and ensuring that it is on the multicast tree for the stream
		concerned. [Editor's note: details later.]</t>
		
		<t>Eventually the PIM request finds its way to the 6rd Border Relay.
		[Editor's note: details needed here to make sure this happens. 
		Alternatively, we could recast this as using any Border Router and not
		a 6rd Relay in particular, but we would end up with possibly different
		paths for the multicast packets and the returning unicast RTCP feedback. Maybe
		that doesn't matter.]</t>

		<t>4. Remapping the &lt;Source, Group> Address Pair At the 6rd BR</t>
		
		<t>The 6rd BR needs to map from the IPv4 &lt;Source, Group> address
		pair it received back to the corresponding IPv6 address pair before
		propagating the PIM request into the IPv6 network. It sends a request
		to the Translator to provide that mapping. The Translator already 
		has this mapping, as a result of the original 6rd CE request, and 
		returns it to the 6rd BR. [Editor's note: protocol again to be specified
		later. It can probably be the same as the one used by the 6rd CE, since
		both nodes are operator-managed even if the 6rd CE is more likely to 
		have been hacked. Have to work out the security considerations.] </t>

		</figure>
 
		<t>5. Propagation Of the PIM Request Into the IPv6 Network</t>
		
		<t>The 6rd BR propagates translates the PIM request from IPv4 to IPv6 
		using the mapping it received. It propagates the request into the IPv6
		network to complete the construction of the path for the requested 
		multicast stream. [Editor's note: probably don't have to go this far
		if there are already other listeners attached to the IPv4 network.
		Have to insert corresponding text in previous steps. Also, if PIM 
		can return errors, the 6rd BR should notify the Translator so it can
		mark the IPv6 address pair as bad (so it doesn't get remapped) while 
		releasing the assigned IPv4 addresses.]</t>

 		<t>6. Transport of Multicast Media and Unicast RTCP Feedback</t> 
 		
 		<t>If the 6rd BR receives a multicast packet from the IPv6 network, it
 		translates the source and group addresses to IPv4 using the mapping it
 		has retained from Step 4. It then forwards it to the next hop in the
 		multicast tree for that stream.</t>

 		<t>When the 6rd CE receives a multicast packet from the IPv4 network,
 		it translates the packet to IPv4 using the mapping which it has 
 		retained from Step 2.</t>
 		
 		<t>When the IPv6 Host sends unicast RTCP <xref target="RFC3550"/> 
 		feedback toward the source, the packets are treated by the 6rd CE and
 		6rd BR like any other unicast packets. That is, they are encapsulated
 		at the 6rd CE, transported across the IPv4 network as IPv6-in-IPv4, and
 		decapsulated at the 6rd BR before forwarding into the IPv6 network.</t>
 		
 		<t>Finally, if the IPv6 Host emits multicast packets destined for an
 		any-source multicast group, the 6rd CE and 6rd BR translate the packets
 		from IPv6 to IPv4 and back again using the mappings they have retained.</t>
