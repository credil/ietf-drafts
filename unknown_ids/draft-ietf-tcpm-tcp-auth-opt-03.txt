Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document specifies the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), which 
   obsoletes the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC-2385 (TCP MD5). TCP-AO 
   specifies the use of stronger Message Authentication Codes (MACs), 
   protects against replays even for long-lived TCP connections, and 
   provides more details on the association of security with TCP 
   connections than TCP MD5. TCP-AO is compatible with either static 
   master key configuration or an external, out-of-band master key 
   management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects 
   connections when using the same master key across repeated instances 
   of a connection, using connection keys derived from the master key. 
   The result is intended to support current infrastructure uses of TCP 
   MD5, such as to protect long-lived connections (as used, e.g., in BGP 
   and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other 
   system and operational changes. TCP-AO uses its own option 
   identifier, even though used mutually exclusive of TCP MD5 on a given 
   TCP connection. TCP-AO supports IPv6, and is fully compatible with 
   the requirements for the replacement of TCP MD5.

1. Contributors 

   This document evolved as the result of collaboration of the TCP 
   Authentication Design team (tcp-auth-dt), whose members were 
   (alphabetically): Mark Allman, Steve Bellovin, Ron Bonica, Wes Eddy, 
   Lars Eggert, Charlie Kaufman, Andrew Lange, Allison Mankin, Sandy 
   Murphy, Joe Touch, Sriram Viswanathan, Brian Weis, and Magnus 
   Westerlund. The text of this document is derived from a proposal by 
   Joe Touch and Allison Mankin [To06] (originally from June 2006), 
   which was both inspired by and intended as a counterproposal to the 
   revisions to TCP MD5 suggested in a document by Ron Bonica, Brian 
   Weis, Sriran Viswanathan, Andrew Lange, and Owen Wheeler [Bo07] 
   (originally from Sept. 2005) and in a document by Brian Weis [We05]. 

   Russ Housley suggested L4/application layer management of the TSAD. 
   Steve Bellovin motivated the KeyID field. Eric Rescorla suggested the 
   use of ISNs in the connection key computation and ESNs to avoid 
   replay attacks, and Brian Weis extended the computation to 
   incorporate the entire connection ID and provided the details of the 
   connection key computation. 

2. Introduction 

   The TCP MD5 Signature (TCP MD5) is a TCP option that authenticates 
   TCP segments, including the TCP IPv4 pseudoheader, TCP header, and 
   TCP data. It was developed to protect BGP sessions from spoofed TCP 
   segments which could affect BGP data or the robustness of the TCP 
   connection itself [RFC2385][RFC4953]. 

   There have been many recent concerns about TCP MD5. Its use of a 
   simple keyed hash for authentication is problematic because there

   have been escalating attacks on the algorithm itself [Wa05]. TCP MD5 
   also lacks both key management and algorithm agility. This document 
   adds the latter, but notes that TCP does not provide a sufficient 
   framework for cryptographic key management, because SYN segments lack 
   sufficient remaining space to support key coordination in-band (see 
   Section 8.6). This document obsoletes the TCP MD5 option with a more 
   general TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), to support the use of 
   other, stronger hash functions, provide replay protection for long-
   lived connections and across repeated instances of a single 
   connection, and to provide a more structured recommendation on 
   external key management. The result is compatible with IPv6, and is 
   fully compatible with requirements under development for a 
   replacement for TCP MD5 [Be07]. 

   This document is not intended to replace the use of the IPsec suite 
   (IPsec and IKE) to protect TCP connections [RFC4301][RFC4306]. In 
   fact, we recommend the use of IPsec and IKE, especially where IKE's 
   level of existing support for parameter negotiation, session key 
   negotiation, or rekeying are desired. TCP-AO is intended for use only 
   where the IPsec suite would not be feasible, e.g., as has been 
   suggested is the case to support some routing protocols, or in cases 
   where keys need to be tightly coordinated with individual transport 
   sessions [Be07].  

   Note that TCP-AO obsoletes TCP MD5, although a particular 
   implementation may support both for backward compatibility. For a 
   given connection, only one can be in use. TCP MD5-protected 
   connections cannot be migrated to TCP-AO because TCP MD5 does not 
   support any changes to a connection's security algorithm once 
   established. 

2.1. Executive Summary 

   This document replaces TCP MD5 as follows [RFC2385]: 

   o  TCP-AO uses a separate option Kind for TCP-AO (TBD-IANA-KIND). 

   o  TCP-AO allows TCP MD5 to continue to be used concurrently for 
      legacy connections. 

   o  TCP-AO replaces MD5's single MAC algorithm with MACs specified in 
      a separate document and allows extension to include other MACs.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   o  TCP-AO allows rekeying during a TCP connection, assuming that an 
      out-of-band protocol or manual mechanism coordinates the key 
      change. In such cases, a key ID allows the efficient concurrent 
      use of multiple keys. Note that TCP MD5 does not preclude rekeying 
      during a connection, but does not require its support either. 
      Further, TCP-AO supports rekeying with zero packet loss, whereas 
      rekeying in TCP MD5 can lose packets in transit during the 
      changeover or require trying multiple keys on each received 
      segment during key use overlap because it lacks an explicit key 
      ID. 

   o  TCP-AO provides automatic replay protection for long-lived 
      connections using an extended sequence number. 

   o  TCP-AO ensures per-connection keys as unique as the TCP connection 
      itself, using TCP's ISNs for differentiation, even when static 
      master keys are used across repeated instances of a socket pair. 

   o  This document provides detail in how this option interacts with 
      TCP's states, event processing, and user interface. 

   o  The TCP-AO option is 3 bytes shorter than TCP MD5 (15 bytes 
      overall, rather than 18) in the default case (using a 96-bit MAC). 

   This document differs from an IPsec/IKE solution in that TCP-AO as 
   follows [RFC4301][RFC4306]: 

   o  TCP-AO does not support dynamic parameter negotiation. 

   o  TCP-AO uses TCP's socket pair (source address, destination 
      address, source port, destination port) as a security parameter 
      index, rather than using a separate field as a primary index 
      (IPsec's SPI). 

   o  TCP-AO forces a change of computed MACs when a connection 
      restarts, even when reusing a TCP socket pair (IP addresses and 
      port numbers) [Be07]. 

   o  TCP-AO does not support encryption. 

   o  TCP-AO does not authenticate ICMP messages (some ICMP messages may 
      be authenticated via IPsec, depending on the configuration).

2.2.1. New in draft-ietf-tcp-auth-opt-03 

   o  Added a placeholder to discuss key change coordination in Section 
      9. 

   o  Moved discussion of required MAC algorithms and PRF to a separate 
      document, indicated as RFC-TBD until assigned. Included the PRF in 
      the TSAD master key tuple so that TCP-AO is PRF algorithm agile, 
      and updated general PRF input format. 

   o  Revised the description the TSAD and impact to the TCP user 
      interface. Removed the description of the TSAD API. Access to the 
      API is assumed specific to the implementation, and not part of the 
      protocol specification. 

   o  Clarified the different uses of the term key; includes master key 
      (from the TSAD) and connection key (per-connection key, derived 
      from the master via the PRF). 

   o  Explained the ESN pseudocode operation in detail. 

   o  Added a contributors section up front. 

   o  Update discussion of requirements to be sufficiently stand-alone; 
      update list to correlate more directly to Be07 (so that Be07 can 
      be dropped from consideration for publication). 

   o  Provided detail on size of typical options (motivating a small 
      option). 

   o  Confirmed WG consensus on IETF-72 topic - no algorithm ID and T-
      bit (options excluded) locations in the header. 

   o  Confirmed WG consensus on IETF-72 topic - no additional header 
      bits for in-band key change signaling (the "K" bit from [Bo07]). 

2.2.2. New in draft-ietf-tcp-auth-opt-02 

   o  List issue - Replay Protection: incorporated extended sequence 
      number space, not using KeyID space. 

   o  List issue - Unique Connection Keys: ISNs are used to generate 
      unique connection keys even when static keys used for repeated 
      instances of a socket pair.  

   o  List issue - Header Format and Alignment: Moved KeyID to front.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   o  List issue - Reserved KeyID Value: Suggestion to reserve a single 
      KeyID value for implementation optimization received no support on 
      the WG list, so this was not changed. 

   o  List issue - KeyID Randomness: KeyIDs are not assumed random; a 
      note was added that nonce-based filtering should be done on a 
      portion of the MAC (incorporated into the algorithm), and that 
      header fields should not be assumed to have cryptographic 
      properties (e.g., randomness). 

   o  List issue - Support for NATs: preliminary rough consensus 
      suggests that TCP-AO should not be augmented to support NAT 
      traversal. Existing mechanisms for such traversal (UDP support) 
      can be applied, or IPsec NAT traversal is recommended in such 
      cases instead. 

   o  IETF-72 topic - providing algorithm ID and T-bit (options 
      excluded) locations in the header: (No current consensus was 
      reached on this topic, so no change was made.) 

   o  IETF-72 topic - providing additional header bits for in-band key 
      change signaling (draft-bonica's "K" bit): (No current consensus 
      was reached on this topic, so no change was made.) 

   o  Clarified TCP-AO as obsoleting TCP MD5. 

   o  Clarified the MAC Type as referring to the IANA registry of IKEv2 
      transforms, not the RFC establishing that registry. 

   o  Added citation to the Wang/Yu paper regarding attacks on MD5 Wa05 
      to replace reports in Be05 and Bu06. 

   o  Explained why option exclusion can't be changed during a 
      connection. 

   o  Clarified that AO explicitly allows rekeying during a TCP 
      connection, without impacting packet loss. 

   o  Described TCP-AO's interaction with reboots more clearly, and 
      explained the need to clear out old state that persists 
      indefinitely. 

2.2.3. New in draft-ietf-tcp-auth-opt-01 

   o  Require KeyID in all versions. Remove odd/even indicator of KeyID 
      usage.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   o  Relax restrictions on key reuse: requiring an algorithm for nonce 
      introduction based on ISNs, and suggest key rollover every 2^31 
      bytes (rather than using an extended sequence number, which 
      introduces new state to the TCP connection). 

   o  Clarify NAT interaction; currently does not support omitting the 
      IP addresses or TCP ports, both of which would be required to 
      support NATs without any coordination. This appears to present a 
      problem for key management - if the key manager knows the received 
      addrs and ports, it should coordinate them (as indicated in Sec 
      8). 

   o  Options are included or excluded all-or-none. Excluded options are 
      deleted, not just zeroed, to avoid the impact of reordering or 
      length changes of such options. 

   o  Augment replay discussion in security considerations. 

   o  Revise discussion of IKEv2 MAC algorithm names. 

   o  Remove executive summary comparison to expired documents. 

   o  Clarified key words to exclude lower case usage. 

2.2.4. New in draft-ietf-tcp-auth-opt-00 

   o  List of TBD values, and indication of how each is determined. 

   o  Changed TCP-SA to TCP-AO (removed 'simple' throughout). 

   o  Removed proposed NAT mechanism; cited RFC-3947 NAT-T as 
      appropriate approach instead. 

   o  Made several changes coordinated in the TCP-AUTH-DT as follow: 

   o  Added R. Bonica as co-author. 

   o  Use new TCP option Kind in the core doc. 

   o  Addresses the impact of explicit declines on security. 

   o  Add limits to TSAD size (2 <= TSAD <= 256). 

   o  Allow 0 as a legitimate KeyID. 

   o  Allow the WG to determine the two appropriate required MAC 
      algorithms.

   o  Add TO-DO items. 

   o  Added discussion at end of Introduction as to why TCP MD5 
      connections cannot be upgraded to TCP-AO. 

2.2.5. New in draft-touch-tcp-simple-auth-03 

   o  Added support for NAT/NAPT. 

   o  Added support for IPv6. 

   o  Added discussion of how this proposal satisfies requirements under 
      development, including those indicated in [Be07]. 

   o  Clarified the byte order of all data used in the MAC. 

   o  Changed the TCP option exclusion bit from a bit to a list. 

2.2.6. New in draft-touch-tcp-simple-auth-02 

   o  Add reference to Bellovin's need-for-TCP-auth doc [Be07]. 

   o  Add reference to SP4 [SDNS88]. 

   o  Added notes that TSAD to be externally implemented; this was 
      compatible with the TSAD described in the previous version. 

   o  Augmented the protocol to allow a KeyID, required to support 
      efficient overlapping keys during rekeying, and potentially useful 
      during connection establishment. Accommodated by redesigning the 
      TSAD. 

   o  Added the odd/even indicator for the KeyID. 

   o  Allow for the exclusion of all TCP options in the MAC calculation. 

2.2.7. New in draft-touch-tcp-simple-auth-01 

   o  Allows intra-session rekeying, assuming out-of-band coordination. 

   o  MUST allow TSAD entries to change, enabling rekeying within a TCP 
      connection. 

   o  Omits discussion of the impact of connection reestablishment on 
      BGP, because added support for rekeying renders this point moot. 

   o  Adds further discussion on the need for rekeying.

3. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation 
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be 
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance. 

4. The TCP Authentication Option 

   The TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) uses a TCP option Kind value 
   of TBD-IANA-KIND. 

4.1. Review of TCP MD5 Option 

   For review, the TCP MD5 option is shown in Figure 1. 

                +---------+---------+-------------------+ 
                | Kind=19 |Length=18|   MD5 digest...   | 
                +---------+---------+-------------------+ 
                |                                       | 
                +---------------------------------------+ 
                |                                       | 
                +---------------------------------------+ 
                |                                       | 
                +-------------------+-------------------+

                +-------------------+ 
    
                   Figure 1 The TCP MD5 Option [RFC2385] 

   In the TCP MD5 option, the length is fixed, and the MD5 digest 
   occupies 16 bytes following the Kind and Length fields, using the 
   full MD5 digest of 128 bits [RFC1321]. 

   The TCP MD5 option specifies the use of the MD5 digest calculation 
   over the following values in the following order: 

   1. The TCP pseudoheader (IP source and destination addresses, 
      protocol number, and segment length). 

   2. The TCP header excluding options and checksum. 

   3. The TCP data payload.

   4. The connection key. 

4.2. TCP-AO Option 

   The new TCP-AO option provides a superset of the capabilities of TCP 
   MD5, and is minimal in the spirit of SP4 [SDNS88]. TCP-AO uses a new 
   Kind field, and similar Length field to TCP MD5, as well as a KeyID 
   field as shown in Figure 2.

                        Figure 2 The TCP-AO Option 

   The TCP-AO defines the following fields: 

   o  Kind: An unsigned 1-byte field indicating the TCP-AO Option. TCP-
      AO uses a new Kind value of TBD-IANA-KIND. Because of how keys are 
      managed (see Section 7), an endpoint will not use TCP-AO for the 
      same connection in which TCP MD5 is used. 
       
      >> A single TCP segment MUST NOT have more than one TCP-AO option. 

   o  Length: An unsigned 1-byte field indicating the length of the TCP-
      AO option in bytes, including the Kind, Length, KeyID, and MAC 
      fields.  
       
      >> The Length value MUST be greater than or equal to 3.  
       
      >> The Length value MUST be consistent with the TCP header length; 
      this is a consistency check and avoids overrun/underrun abuse.  
       
      Values of 3 and other small values are of dubious utility (e.g., 
      for MAC=NONE, or small values for very short MACs) but not 
      specifically prohibited.

   o  KeyID: An unsigned 1-byte field is used to support efficient key 
      changes during a connection and/or to help with key coordination 
      during connection establishment, and will be discussed further in 
      Section 4. Note that the KeyID has no cryptographic properties - 
      it need not be random, nor are there any reserved values. 

   o  MAC: Message Authentication Field. Its contents are determined by 
      the particulars of the security association. Typical MACs are 96-
      128 bits (12-16 bytes), but any length that fits in the header of 
      the segment being authenticated is allowed. 

      >> Required support for TCP-AO MACs as defined in RFC-TBD; other 
      MACs MAY be supported [RFC2403]. 

   The MAC is computed over the following fields in the following order: 

   1. The extended sequence number (ESN), in network-standard byte 
      order, as follows (described further in Section 5): 

                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
                   |                ESN                | 
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
    
                     Figure 3 Extended sequence number 

      The ESN for transmitted segments is locally maintained from a 
      locally maintained SND.ESN value, for received segments, a local 
      RCV.ESN value is used. The details of how these values are 
      maintained and used is described in Sections 5, 8.4, and 8.5. 

   2. The TCP pseudoheader: IP source and destination addresses, 
      protocol number and segment length, all in network byte order, 
      prepended to the TCP header below. The pseudoheader is exactly as 
      used for the TCP checksum in either IPv4 or IPv6 
      [RFC793][RFC2460]: 

                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
                   |           Source Address          |

   3. The TCP header, by default including options, and where the TCP 
      checksum and TCP-AO MAC fields are set to zero, all in network 
      byte order 

   4. TCP data, in network byte order 

   Note that the connection key is not included here; the MAC algorithm 
   indicates how to use the connection key, e.g., as HMACs do in general 
   [RFC2104][RFC2403]. The connection key is derived from the TSAD 
   entry's master key as described in Sections 7, 8.4, and 8.5. 

   By default, TCP-AO includes the TCP options in the MAC calculation 
   because these options are intended to be end-to-end and some are 
   required for proper TCP operation (e.g., SACK, timestamp, large 
   windows). Middleboxes that alter TCP options en-route are a kind of 
   attack and would be successfully detected by TCP-AO. In cases where 
   the configuration of the connection's security association state 
   indicates otherwise, the TCP options can be excluded from the MAC 
   calculation. When options are excluded, all options - including TCP-
   AO - are skipped over during the MAC calculation (rather than being 
   zeroed).

   The TCP-AO option does not indicate the MAC algorithm either 
   implicitly (as with TCP MD5) or explicitly. The particular algorithm 
   used is considered part of the configuration state of the 
   connection's security association and is managed separately (see 
   Section 7). 

5. Preventing replay attacks within long-lived connections 

   TCP uses a 32-bit sequence number which may, for long-lived 
   connections, roll over and repeat. This could result in TCP segments 
   being intentionally and legitimately replayed within a connection. 
   TCP-AO prevents replay attacks, and thus requires a way to 
   differentiate these legitimate replays from each other, and so it 
   adds a 32-bit extended sequence number (ESN) for transmitted and 
   received segments. 

   The ESN extends TCP's sequence number so that segments within a 
   single connection are always unique. When TCP's sequence number rolls 
   over, there is a chance that a segment could be repeated in total; 
   using an ESN differentiates even identical segments sent with 
   identical sequence numbers at different times in a connection. TCP-AO 
   emulates a 64-bit sequence number space by inferring when to 
   increment the high-order 32-bit portion (the ESN) based on 
   transitions in the low-order portion (the TCP sequence number). 

   TCP-AO thus maintains SND.ESN for transmitted segments, and RCV.ESN 
   for received segments, both initialized as zero when a connection 
   begins. The intent of these ESNs is, together with TCP's 32-bit 
   sequence numbers, to provide a 64-bit overall sequence number space. 

   For transmitted segments SND.ESN can be implemented by extending 
   TCP's sequence number to 64-bits; SND.ESN would be the top (high-
   order) 32 bits of that number. For received segments, TCP-AO needs to 
   emulate the use of a 64-bit number space, and correctly infer the 
   appropriate high-order 32-bits of that number as RCV.ESN from the 
   received 32-bit sequence number and the current connection context. 

   The implementation of ESNs is not specified in this document, but one 
   possible way is described here that can be used for either RCV.ESN, 
   SND.ESN, or both. 

   Consider an implementation with two ESNs as required (SND.ESN, 
   RCV.ESN), and additional variables as listed below, all initialized 
   to zero, as well as a current TCP segment field (SEG.SEQ): 

   o  SND.PREV_SEQ, needed to detect rollover of SND.SEQ 

 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 14] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   o  RCV.PREV_SEQ, needed to detect rollover of RCV.SEQ 

   o  SND.ESN_FLAG, which indicates when to increment the SND.ESN 

   o  RCV.ESN_FLAG, which indicates when to increment the RCV.ESN 

   When a segment is received, the following algorithm (written in C) 
   computes the ESN used in the MAC; an equivalent algorithm can be 
   applied to the "SND" side: 

         # 
         # ROLL is just shorthand 
         ROLL = (RCV.PREV_SEQ > 0x7fff) && (SEG.SEQ < 0x7fff); 
         # 
         # set the flag when the SEG.SEQ first rolls over 
         if ((RCV.ESN_FLAG == 0) && (ROLL)) { 
               RCV.ESN = RCV.ESN + 1; 
               RCV.ESN_FLAG = 1; 
         } 
         # 
         # decide which ESN to use during rollover after incremented 
         if ((RCV.ESN_FLAG == 1) && (ROLL)) { 
            ESN = RCV.ESN - 1; # use the pre-increment value 
         } else { 
            ESN = RCV.ESN; # use the current value 
         } 
         # 
         # reset the flag in the *middle* of the window 
         if ((RCV.PREV_SEQ < 0x7fff) && (SEG.SEQ > 0x7fff)) { 
            RCV.ESN_FLAG = 0; 
         } 
         # 
         # save the current SEQ for the next time through the code 
         RCV.PREV_SEQ = SEG.SEQ; 
    
   In the above code, ROLL is true in the first line when the sequence 
   number rolls over, i.e., when the new number is low (in the bottom 
   half of the number space) and the old number is high (in the top half 
   of the number space). The first time this happens, the ESN is 
   incremented and a flag is set. The flag prevents the ESN from being 
   incremented again until the flag is reset, which happens in the 
   middle of the window (when the old number is in the bottom half and 
   the new is in the top half). Because the receive window is never 
   larger than half of the number space, it is impossible to both set 
   and reset the flag at the same time - outstanding packets, regardless 
   of reordering, cannot straddle both regions simultaneously.

6. Computing connection keys from TSAD entries 

   TSAD entries, described in Section 7, include master keys which are 
   used in conjunction with a TCP's connection ISNs to generate unique 
   connection keys. This allows a static master key to be reused across 
   different connections, or across different instances of connections 
   within a socket pair, while maintaining unique connection keys. 
   Unique connection keys are generated without relying on external key 
   management properties. 

   Given a master key tuple, the TCP socket pair, and the connection 
   ISNs, the connection key used in the MAC algorithm is computed as 
   follows, truncated to the same length as the master key, using a 
   pseudorandom function (PRF): 

      Conn_key = PRF(TSAD_master_key, input) 
      where 
         input = 0 + "TCP-AO" + connblock + TSAD_master_key_len 
    

   The components of the input are concatenated as a single byte string 
   (the string concatenation operator is shown here as "+"). The initial 
   zero of the input is a single byte, "TCP-AO" is a null-terminated 
   string, connblock is defined below, and TSAD_master_key_len is the 
   length of the TSAD master key in bytes, as stored in the TSAD entry. 
   The PRF to be used for a given master key is indicated in the TDAD 
   master key tuple, and details of the PRF are provided in [RFC-TBD]. 

   The connection block (connblock) is defined as follows (IP addresses 
   are correspondingly longer for IPv6 addresses): 

                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
                   |             Source IP             | 
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
                   |           Destination IP          | 
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
                   |   Source Port   |    Dest. Port   | 
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
                   |            Source ISN             | 
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
                   |          Destination ISN          | 
                   +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
    
       Figure 6 Connection block used for connection key generation 

   "Source" and "destination" are defined by the direction of the 
   segment being MAC'd; for incoming packets, source is the remote side, 
 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 16] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   whereas for outgoing packets source is the local side. This further 
   ensures that connection keys generated for each direction are unique. 

   For SYN segments (segments with the SYN set, but the ACK not set), 
   the destination ISN is not known. For these segments, the connection 
   key is computed using the connection block shown above, in which the 
   Destination ISN value is zero. For all other segments, the ISN pair 
   is used when known. If the ISN pair is not known, e.g., when sending 
   a RST after a reboot, the segment should be sent without 
   authentication; if authentication was required, the segment cannot 
   have been MAC'd properly anyway and would have been dropped on 
   receipt. 

   >> TCP-AO SYN segments (SYN set, no ACK set) MUST use a destination 
   ISN of zero (whether sent or received); all other segments use the 
   known ISN pair. 

   >> Segments sent in response to connections for which the ISNs are 
   not known SHOULD NOT use TCP-AO.  

   Once a connection is established, a connection key would typically be 
   cached to avoid recomputing it on a per-segment basis (e.g., in the 
   TCP Transmission Control Block, i.e, the TCB [RFC793]). The use of 
   both ISNs in the connection key computation ensures that segments 
   cannot be replayed across repeated connections reusing the same 
   socket pair (provided the ISN pair does not repeat, which is unlikely 
   because both endpoints should select ISNs pseudorandomly [RFC1948], 
   their 32-bit space avoids repeated use except under reboot, and reuse 
   assumes both sides repeat their use on the same connection). 

   In general, a SYN would be MAC'd using a destination ISN of zero 
   (whether sent or received), and all other segments would be MAC'd 
   using the ISN pair for the connection. There are other cases in which 
   the destination ISN is not known, but segments are emitted, such as 
   after an endpoint reboots, when is possible that the two endpoints 
   would not have enough information to authenticate segments. In such 
   cases, TCP's timeout mechanism will allow old state to be cleared to 
   enable new connections, except where the user timeout is disabled; it 
   is important that implementations are capable of detecting excesses 
   of TCP connections in such a configuration and can clear them out if 
   needed to protect its memory usage [Je07].  

7. Security Association Management 

   TCP-AO relies on a TCP Security Association Database (TSAD), which 
   indicates whether a TCP connection requires TCP-AO, and its 
   parameters when so. The TSAD is described as an explicit component of 
 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 17] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   TCP-AO to enable external (master) key management mechanisms - 
   automatic or manual - to interact with TCP-AO as needed. 

   TSAD entries are assumed to exist at the endpoints where TCP-AO is 
   used, in advance of the connection: 

   1. TCP connection identifier (ID), i.e., socket pair - IP source 
      address, IP destination address, TCP source port, and TCP 
      destination port [RFC793]. TSAD entries are uniquely determined by 
      their TCP connection ID, which is used to index those entries. A 
      TSAD entry may allow wildcards, notably in the source port value. 
       
      >> There MUST be no more than one matching TSAD entry per 
      direction for a fully-instantiated (no wildcards) TCP connection 
      ID. 

   2. For each of inbound (for received TCP segments) and outbound (for 
      sent TCP segments) directions for this connection (except as 
      noted): 

       a. TCP option flag. When 0, this flag allows default operation, 
          i.e., TCP options are included in the MAC calculation, with 
          TCP-AO's MAC field zeroed out.  When 1, all options (including 
          TCP-AO) are excluded from all MAC calculations (skipped over, 
          not simply zeroed). 

          >> The TCP option flag MUST default to 0 (i.e., options not 
          excluded). 

          >> The TCP option flag MUST NOT change during a TCP 
          connection. 
           
          The TCP option flag cannot change during a connection because 
          TCP state is coordinated during connection establishment. TCP 
          lacks a handshake for modifying that state after a connection 
          has been established. 

       b. An extended sequence number (ESN). The ESN enables each 
          segment's MAC calculation to have unique input data, even when 
          payload data is retransmitted and the TCP sequence number 
          repeats due to wraparound. The ESN is initialized to zero upon 
          connection establishment. Its use in the MAC calculation is 
          described in Section 4.2, and its management is described in 
          Section 5.

       c. An ordered list of zero or more master key tuples. Each tuple 
          is defined as the set <KeyID, MAC type, master key length, 
          master key, PRF> as follows: 
           
          >> Components of a TSAD master key tuple MUST NOT change 
          during a connection. 
           
          Keeping the tuple components static ensures that the KeyID 
          uniquely determines the properties of a packet; this supports 
          use of the KeyID to determine the packet properties. 
           
          >> The set of TSAD master key tuples MAY change during a 
          connection, but KeyIDs of those tuples MUST NOT overlap. I.e., 
          tuple parameter changes MUST be accompanied by master key 
          changes. 

           i. KeyID. The value as used in the TCP-AO option; used to 
               differentiate connection keys in concurrent use that are 
               derived from different master keys. 
                
               >> A TSAD implementation MUST support at least two KeyIDs 
               per connection per direction, and MAY support up to 256.

          ii. MAC type. Indicates the MAC used for this connection, as 
               defined in [RFC-TBD]. This includes the MAC algorithm 
               (e.g., HMAC-SHA1, AES-CMAC, etc.) and the length of the 
               MAC as truncated to (e.g., 96, 128, etc.). 
                
               >> A MAC type of "NONE" MUST be supported, to indicate 
               that authentication is not used in this direction; this 
               allows asymmetric use of TCP-AO.

               a non-"NONE" MAC in practice, but this MUST NOT be 
               strictly required by an implementation.  
                
               >> When the outbound MAC is set to values other than 
               "NONE", TCP-AO MUST occur in every outbound TCP segment

               exists, TCP-AO MUST NOT occur in those segments. 
                
               >> When the inbound MAC is set to values other than

               exists, TCP-AO SHOULD NOT be added to those segments, but 
               MAY occur and MUST be ignored. 

         iii. Master key length. Indicates the length of the master key 
               in bytes.  

          iv. Master key. A byte sequence used for generating 
               connection keys, this may be derived from a separate 
               shared key by an external protocol over a separate 
               channel. This sequence is used in network-standard byte 
               order in the connection key generation algorithm 
               described in Section 6. 

           v. PRF. A pseudorandom function used for the geneation of a 
               connection key from the master key tuple, as described in 
               Section 6. The specific functions used are described in 
               [RFC-TBD]. 

   It is anticipated that TSAD entries for TCP connections in states 
   other than CLOSED can be indexed in the TCP TCB for convenience, but 
   that the index would reference a separate database with entries for 
   all connections to an IP address (see Section 9.1 for notes on the 
   latter. This means that for a particular endpoint (i.e., IP address) 
   there would be exactly one database that is consulted by all pending 
   connections, the same way that there is only one table of TCBs (a 
   database can support multiple endpoints, but an endpoint is

   represented in only one database). Multiple databases could be used 
   to support virtual hosts, i.e., groups of interfaces. 

   Note that the TCP-AO fields omit an explicit algorithm ID; that 
   algorithm is already specified by the TCP connection ID and stored in 
   the TSAD. 

   Also note that this document does not address how TSAD entries are 
   created by users/processes; it specifies how they must be destroyed 
   corresponding to connection states, but users/processes may destroy 
   entries as well. It is presumed that a TSAD entry affecting a 
   particular connection cannot be destroyed during an active connection 
   - or, equivalently, that its parameters are copied to TSAD entries 
   local to the connection (i.e., instantiated) and so changes would 
   affect only new connections. The TSAD could be managed by a separate 
   application protocol. 

8. TCP-AO Interaction with TCP 

   The following is a description of how TCP-AO affects various TCP 
   states, segments, events, and interfaces. This description is 
   intended to augment the description of TCP as provided in RFC-793, 
   and its presentation mirrors that of RFC-793 as a result [RFC793]. 

8.1. TCP User Interface 

   The TCP user interface supports active and passive OPEN, SEND, 
   RECEIVE, CLOSE, STATUS and ABORT commands. TCP-AO does not alter this 
   interface as it applies to TCP, but some commands or command 
   sequences of the interface need to be modified to support TCP-AO. 
   TCP-AO does not specify the details of how this is achieved. 

   TCP-AO requires the TCP user interface be extended to allow the TSAD 
   to be configured, as well as to allow an ongoing connection to manage 
   which KeyID tuples are active. The TSAD needs to be configured prior 
   to connection establishment, and possibly changed during a 
   connection: 

   >> TCP OPEN, or the sequence of commands that configure a connection 
   to be in the active or passive OPEN state, MUST be augmented so that 
   a TSAD entry can be configured.  

   >> A TCP-AO implmentation MUST allow TSAD entries for ongoing TCP 
   connections (i.e., not in the CLOSED state) to be modified. 
   Parameters not used to index a connection MAY be modified; parameters 
   used to index a connection MUST NOT be modified. 

 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 21] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   The TSAD information of a connection needs to be available for 
   confirmation; this includes the ability to read the connection key: 

   >> TCP STATUS SHOULD be augmented to allow the TSAD entry of a 
   current or pending connection to be read (for confirmation). 

   Senders need to be able to determine when the outgoing KeyID changes; 
   this change immediately affects all subsequent outgoing segments 
   (i.e., it need not be synchronized with the data of the SEND call, if 
   indicated therein): 

   >> TCP SEND, or a sequence of commands resulting in a SEND, MUST be 
   augmented so that the KeyID of a TSAD entry can be indicated. 

   It may be useful to change the sender-side active KeyID even when no 
   data is being sent, which can be achieved by sending a zero-length 
   buffer or by using a non-send interface (e.g., socket options in 
   Unix), depending on the implementation. 

   It is also useful for the receive side to indicate the recent KeyID 
   received; although there could be a number of such KeyIDs, the KeyIDs 
   are not expected to change quickly so any recent sample of a received 
   KeyID is sufficient: 

   >> TCP RECEIVE, or the sequence of commands resulting in a RECEIVE, 
   MUST be augmented so that the KeyID of a recently received segment is 
   available to the user out-of-band (e.g., as an additional parameter 
   to RECEIVE, or via a STATUS call). 

8.2. TCP States and Transitions 

   TCP includes the states LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED, ESTABLISHED, 
   FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT, and 
   CLOSED. 

   >> A TSAD entry MAY be associated with any TCP state. 

   >> A TSAD entry MAY underspecify the TCP connection for the LISTEN 
   state. Such an entry MUST NOT be used for more than one connection 
   progressing out of the LISTEN state.  

8.3. TCP Segments 

   TCP includes control (at least one of SYN, FIN, RST flags set) and 
   data (none of SYN, FIN, or RST flags set) segments. Note that some 
   control segments can include data (e.g., SYN).

   >> All TCP segments MUST be checked against the TSAD for matching TCP 
   connection IDs. 

   >> TCP segments matching TSAD entries with non-NULL MACs without TCP-
   AO, or with TCP-AO and whose MACs and KeyIDs do not validate MUST be 
   silently discarded. 

   >> TCP segments with TCP-AO but not matching TSAD entries MUST be 
   silently accepted; this is required for equivalent function with TCPs 
   not implementing TCP-AO.  

   >> Silent discard events SHOULD be signaled to the user as a warning, 
   and silent accept events MAY be signaled to the user as a warning. 
   Both warnings, if available, MUST be accessible via the STATUS 
   interface. Either signal MAY be asynchronous, but if so they MUST be 
   rate-limited. Either signal MAY be logged; logging SHOULD allow rate-
   limiting as well. 

   All TCP-AO processing occurs between the interface of TCP and IP; for 
   incoming segments, this occurs after validation of the TCP checksum. 
   For outgoing segments, this occurs before computation of the TCP 
   checksum. 

   Note that the TCP-AO option is not negotiated. It is the 
   responsibility of the receiver to determine when TCP-AO is required 
   and to enforce that requirement.  

8.4. Sending TCP Segments 

   The following procedure describes the modifications to TCP to support 
   TCP-AO when a segment departs. 

   1. Check the segment's TCP connection ID against the TSAD 

   2. If there is NO TSAD entry, omit the TCP-AO option. Proceed with 
      computing the TCP checksum and transmit the segment.  

   3. If there is a TSAD entry with zero master key tuples, omit the 
      TCP-AO option. Proceed with computing the TCP checksum and 
      transmit the segment. 

   4. If there is a TSAD entry and a master key tuple and the outgoing 
      MAC is NONE, omit the TCP-AO option. Proceed with computing the 
      TCP checksum and transmit the segment. 

   5. If there is a TSAD entry and a master key tuple and the outgoing 
      MAC is not NONE:

       a. Augment the TCP header with the TCP-AO, inserting the 
          appropriate Length and KeyID based on the indexed TSAD entry. 
          Update the TCP header length accordingly. 

       b. Determine SND.ESN as described in Section 5. 

       c. Determine the connection key from the indexed TSAD entry as 
          described in Section 6. 

       d. Compute the MAC using the indexed TSAD entry and data from the 
          segment as specified in Section 4.2, including the TCP 
          pseudoheader and TCP header. Include or exclude the options as 
          indicated by the TSAD entry's TCP option exclusion flag. 

       e. Insert the MAC in the TCP-AO field. 

       f. Proceed with computing the TCP checksum on the outgoing packet 
          and transmit the segment. 

8.5. Receiving TCP Segments  

   The following procedure describes the modifications to TCP to support 
   TCP-AO when a segment arrives. 

   1. Check the segment's TCP connection ID against the TSAD. 

   2. If there is NO TSAD entry, proceed with TCP processing.  

   3. If there is a TSAD entry with zero master key tuples, proceed with 
      TCP processing. 

   4. If there is a TSAD entry with a master key tuple and the incoming 
      MAC is NONE, proceed with TCP processing. 

   5. If there is a TSAD entry with a master key tuple and the incoming 
      MAC is not NONE: 

       a. Check that the segment's TCP-AO Length matches the length 
          indicated by the indexed TSAD. 

           i. If Lengths differ, silently discard the segment. Log 
               and/or signal the event as indicated in Section 8.3. 

       b. Use the KeyID value to index the appropriate connection key 
          for this connection.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

           i. If the TSAD has no entry corresponding to the segment's 
               KeyID, silently discard the segment. 

       c. Determine the segment's RCV.ESN as described in Section 5. 

       d. Determine the segment's connection key from the indexed TSAD 
          entry as described in Section 6. 

       e. Compute the segment's MAC using the indexed TSAD entry and 
          portions of the segment as indicated in Section 4.2. 
           
          Again, if options are excluded (as per the TCP option 
          exclusion flag), they are skipped over (rather than zeroed) 
          when used as input to the MAC calculation. 

           i. If the computed MAC differs from the TCP-AO MAC field 
               value, silently discard the segment. Log and/or signal 
               the event as indicated in Section 8.3. 

       f. Proceed with TCP processing of the segment. 

   It is suggested that TCP-AO implementations validate a segment's 
   Length field before computing a MAC, to reduce the overhead incurred 
   by spoofed segments with invalid TCP-AO fields. 

   Additional reductions in MAC validation overhead can be supported in 
   the MAC algorithms, e.g, by using a computation algorithm that 
   prepends a fixed value to the computed portion and a corresponding 
   validation algorithm that verifies the fixed value before investing 
   in the computed portion. Such optimizations would be contained in the 
   MAC algorithm specification, and thus are not specified in TCP-AO 
   explicitly. Note that the KeyID cannot be used for connection 
   validation per se, because it is not assumed random. 

8.6. Impact on TCP Header Size 

   The TCP-AO option typically uses a total of 17-19 bytes of TCP header 
   space. TCP-AO is no larger than and typically 3 bytes smaller than 
   the TCP MD5 option (assuming a 96-bit MAC).  

   Note that TCP option space is most critical in SYN segments, because 
   flags in those segments could potentially increase the option space 
   area in other segments. Because TCP ignores unknown segments, 
   however, it is not possible to extend the option space of SYNs 
   without breaking backward-compatibility. 


 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 25] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   TCP's 4-bit data offset requires that the options end 60 bytes (15 
   32-bit words) after the header begins, including the 20-byte header. 
   This leaves 40 bytes for options, of which 15 are expected in current 
   implementations (listed below), leaving at most 20 for TCP-AO. 
   Assuming a 96-bit MAC, TCP-AO consumes 15 bytes, leaving up to 10 
   bytes for other options (depending on implementation dependant 
   alignment padding, which could consume another 2 bytes at most). 

   o  SACK permitted (2 bytes) [RFC2018][RFC3517] 

   o  Timestamps (10 bytes) [RFC1323] 

   o  Window scale (3 bytes) [RFC1323] 

   Although TCP option space is limited, we believe TCP-AO is consistent 
   with the desire to authenticate TCP at the connection level for 
   similar uses as were intended by TCP MD5. 

9. Connection Key Establishment and Duration Issues 

   The TCP-AO option does not provide a mechanism for connection key 
   negotiation or parameter negotiation (MAC algorithm, length, or use 
   of the TCP-AO option), or for coordinating rekeying during a 
   connection. We assume out-of-band mechanisms for master key 
   establishment, parameter negotiation, and rekeying. This separation 
   of master key use from master key management is similar to that in 
   the IPsec security suite [RFC4301][RFC4306]. 

   We encourage users of TCP-AO to apply known techniques for generating 
   appropriate master keys, including the use of reasonable master key 
   lengths, limited connection key sharing, and limiting the duration of 
   master key use [RFC3562]. This also includes the use of per-
   connection nonces, as suggested in Section 4.2. 

   TCP-AO supports rekeying in which new master keys are negotiated and 
   coordinated out-of-band, either via a protocol or a manual procedure 
   [RFC4808]. New master key use is coordinated using the out-of-band 
   mechanism to update the TSAD at both TCP endpoints. When only a 
   single master key is used at a time, the temporary use of invalid 
   master keys could result in packets being dropped; although TCP is 
   already robust to such drops, TCP-AO uses the KeyID field to avoid 
   such drops. The TSAD can contain multiple concurrent master keys, 
   where the KeyID field is used to identify the master key that 
   corresponds to the connection key used for a segment, to avoid the 
   need for expensive trial-and-error testing of master keys in 
   sequence. 

 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 26] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   TCP-AO does not currently provide an explicit key coordination 
   mechanism. Such a mechanism is useful when new keys are installed, or 
   when keys are changed, to determine when to commence using installed 
   keys. Note that because TCP-AO uses directional keys, the receive-
   side keys can be installed in advance of the send side, avoiding the 
   need for tight coordination between endpoints. 

   The KeyID field is also useful in coordinating master keys used for 
   new connections. A TSAD entry may be configured that matches the 
   unbound source port, which would return a set of possible master 
   keys. The KeyID would then indicate the specific master key, allowing 
   more efficient connection establishment; otherwise, the master keys 
   could have been tried in sequence. See also Section 9.1. 

   Users are advised to manage master keys following the spirit of the 
   advice for key management when using TCP MD5 [RFC3562], notably to 
   use appropriate key lengths (12-24 bytes), to avoid sharing master 
   keys among multiple BGP peering arrangements, and to change master 
   keys every 90 days. This requires that the TSAD support monitoring 
   and modification. 

9.1. Master Key Reuse Across Socket Pairs 

   Master keys can be reused across different socket pairs within a 
   host, or across different instances of a socket pair within a host. 
   In either case, replay protection is maintained.  

   Master keys reused across different socket pairs cannot enable replay 
   attacks because the TCP socket pair is included in the MAC, as well 
   as in the generation of the connection key. Master keys reused across 
   repeated instances of a given socket pair cannot enable replay 
   attacks because the connection ISNs are included in the connection 
   key generation algorithm, and ISN pairs are unlikely to repeat over 
   useful periods. 

9.2. Master Key Use Within a Long-lived Connection 

   TCP-AO uses extended sequence numbers (ESNs) to prevent replay 
   attacks within long-lived connections. Explicit master key rollover, 
   accomplished by external means and indexed using the KeyID field, can 
   be used to change keying material for various reasons (e.g., 
   personnel turnover), but is not required to support long-lived 
   connections. 

10. Obsoleting TCP MD5 and Legacy Interactions 

   TCP-AO obsoletes TCP MD5. As we have noted earlier: 
 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 27] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   >> TCP implementations MUST support TCP-AO. 

   Systems implementing TCP MD5 only are considered legacy, and ought to 
   be upgraded when possible. In order to support interoperation with 
   such legacy systems until upgrades are available: 

   >> TCP MD5 SHOULD be supported where interactions with legacy systems 
   is needed. 

   >> A system that supports both TCP-AO and TCP MD5 MUST use TCP-AO for 
   connections unless not supported by its peer, at which point it MAY 
   use TCP MD5 instead.  

   >> A TCP implementation MUST NOT use both TCP-AO and TCP MD5 for a 
   particular TCP connection, but MAY support TCP-AO and TCP MD5 
   simultaneously for different connections (notably to support legacy 
   use of TCP MD5). 

   The Kind value explicitly indicates whether TCP-AO or TCP MD5 is used 
   for a particular connection in TCP segments.  

   It is possible that the TSAD could be augmented to support TCP MD5, 
   although use of a TSAD-like system is not described in RFC2385.  

   It is possible to require TCP-AO for a connection or TCP MD5, but it 
   is not possible to require 'either'. When an endpoint is configured 
   to require TCP MD5 for a connection, it must be added to all outgoing 
   segments and validated on all incoming segments [RFC2385]. TCP MD5's 
   requirements prohibit the speculative use of both options for a given 
   connection, e.g., to be decided by the other end of the connection. 

11. Interactions with Middleboxes 

   TCP-AO may interact with middleboxes, depending on their behavior 
   [RFC3234]. Some middleboxes either alter TCP options (such as TCP-AO) 
   directly or alter the information TCP-AO includes in its MAC 
   calculation. TCP-AO may interfere with these devices, exactly where 
   the device modifies information TCP-AO is designed to protect. 

11.1. Interactions with non-NAT/NAPT Middleboxes 

   TCP-AO supports middleboxes that do not change the IP addresses or 
   ports of segments. Such middleboxes may modify some TCP options, in 
   which case TCP-AO would need to be configured to ignore all options 
   in the MAC calculation on connections traversing that element. 


 
 
Touch                  Expires August 16, 2009                [Page 28] 

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   Note that ignoring TCP options may provide less protection, i.e., TCP 
   options could be modified in transit, and such modifications could be 
   used by an attacker. Depending on the modifications, TCP could have 
   compromised efficiency (e.g., timestamp changes), or could cease 
   correct operation (e.g., window scale changes). These vulnerabilities 
   affect only the TCP connections for which TCP-AO is configured to 
   ignore TCP options. 

11.2. Interactions with NAT/NAPT Devices 

   TCP-AO cannot interoperate natively across NAT/NAPT devices, which 
   modify the IP addresses and/or port numbers. We anticipate that 
   traversing such devices will require variants of existing NAT/NAPT 
   traversal mechanisms, e.g., encapsulation of the TCP-AO-protected 
   segment in another transport segment (e.g., UDP), as is done in IPsec 
   [RFC2766][RFC3947]. Such variants can be adapted for use with TCP-AO, 
   or IPsec NAT traversal can be used instead in such cases [RFC3947]. 

12. Evaluation of Requirements Satisfaction 

   TCP-AO satisfies all the current requirements for a revision to TCP 
   MD5, as summarized below [Be07]. 

   1. Protected Elements 
       
      A solution to revising TCP MD5 should protect (authenticate) the 
      following elements. 
       
      This is supported - see Section 4.2.  

       a. TCP pseudoheader, including IPv4 and IPv6 versions.  
           
          Note that we do not allow optional coverage because IP 
          addresses define a connection. If they can be coordinated 
          across a NAT/NAPT, the sender can compute the MAC based on the 
          received values; if not, a tunnel is required, as noted in 
          Section 11.2. 

       b. TCP header.  
           
          Note that we do not allow optional port coverage because ports 
          define a connection. If they can be coordinated across a 
          NAT/NAPT, the sender can compute the MAC based on the received 
          values; if not, a tunnel is required, as noted in Section 
          11.2.

       c. TCP options.  
           
          Note that TCP-AO allows exclusion of TCP options from 
          coverage, to enable use with middleboxes that modify options 
          (except when they modify TCP-AO itself). See Section 11. 

       d. TCP payload data. 

   2. Option Structure Requirements 
       
      A solution to revising TCP MD5 should use an option with the 
      following structural requirements.  
       
      This is supported - see Section 4.2. 

       a. Privacy. 
           
          The option should not unnecessarily expose information about 
          the TCP-AO mechanism. The additional protection afforded by 
          keeping this information private may be of little value, but 
          also helps keep the option size small. 
           
          TCP-AO exposes only the master key index, MAC, and overall 
          option length on the wire. Note that short MACs could be 
          obscured by using longer option lengths but specifying a short 
          MAC length (this is equivalent to a different MAC algorithm, 
          and is specified in the TSAD entry). See Section 4.2.  

       b. Allow optional per connection.  
           
          The option should not be required on every connection; it 
          should be optional on a per connection basis. 
           
          This is supported - see Sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5.  

       c. Require non-optional.  

          The option should be able to be specified as required for a 
          given connection. 
           
          This is supported - see Sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

       d. Standard parsing.  
           
          The option should be easily parseable, i.e., without 
          conditional parsing, and follow the standard RFC 793 option 
          format. 
           
          This is supported - see Section 4.2.  

       e. Compatible with Large Windows and SACK. 
           
          The option should be compatible with the use of the Large 
          Windows and SACK options. 
           
          This is supported - see Section 8.6. The size of the option is 
          intended to allow use with Large Windows and SACK. See also 
          Section 2.1, which indicates that TCP-AO is 3 bytes shorter 
          than TCP MD5 in the default case, assuming a 96-bit MAC. 

   3. Cryptography requirements 
       
      A solution to revising TCP MD5 should support modern cryptography 
      capabilities. 

       a. Baseline defaults.  
           
          The option should have a default that is required in all 
          implementations. 
           
          TCP-AO uses a default required algorithm as specified in [RFC-
          TBD], as noted in Section 4.2.   

       b. Good algorithms.  
           
          The option should use algorithms considered accepted by the 
          security community, which are considered appropriately safe. 
          The use of non-standard or unpublished algorithms should be 
          avoided. 
           
          TCP-AO uses MACs as indicated in [RFC-TBD]. The PRF is also 
          specified in [RFC-TBD]. The PRF input string follows the 
          typical design (in Section 6).

       c. Algorithm agility.  
           
          The option should support algorithms other than the default, 
          to allow agility over time. 
           
          TCP-AO allows any desired algorithm, subject to TCP option 
          space limitations, as noted in Section 4.2. The TSAD allows 
          separate connections to use different algorithms, both for the 
          MAC and the PRF. 

       d. Order-independent processing.  
           
          The option should be processed independently of the proper 
          order, i.e., they should allow processing of TCP segments in 
          the order received, without requiring reordering. This avoids 
          the need for reordering prior to processing, and avoids the 
          impact of misordered segments on the option. 
           
          This is supported - see Sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5. Note that 
          pre-TCP processing is further required, because TCP segments 
          cannot be discarded solely based on a combination of 
          connection state and out-of-window checks; many such segments, 
          although discarded, cause a host to respond with a replay of 
          the last valid ACK, e.g. [RFC793]. See also the derivation of 
          the ESN, which is reconstituted at the receiver using a 
          demonstration algorithm that avoids the need for reordering 
          (in Section 5). 

       e. Security parameter changes require key changes.  
           
          The option should require that the key change whenever the 
          security parameters change. This avoids the need for 
          coordinating option state during a connection, which is 
          typical for TCP options. This also helps allow "bump in the 
          stack" implementations that are not integrated with endpoint 
          TCP implementations. 
           
          TSAD parameters that should not change during a connection (by 
          defininition, e.g., TCP connection ID, receiver TCP connection 
          ID, TCP option exclusion list) cannot change. Other parameters 
          change only when a master key is changed, using the master key 
          tuple mechanism in the TSAD. See Section 7.

   4. Keying requirements.  
       
      A solution to revising TCP MD5 should support manual keying, and 
      should support the use of an external automated key management 
      system (e.g., a protocol or other mechanism). 
       
      Note that TCP-AO does not specify a master key management system, 
      but does indicate a proposed interface to the TSAD, allowing a 
      completely separate master key system, as noted in Section 7. 

       a. Intraconnection rekeying.  
           
          The option should support rekeying during a connection, to 
          avoid the impact of long-duration connections. 
           
          This is supported by the KeyID and multiple master key tuples 
          in a TSAD entry; see Section 7.  

       b. Efficient rekeying.  
           
          The option should support rekeying during a connection without 
          the need to expend undue computational resources. In 
          particular, the options should avoid the need to try multiple 
          keys on a given segment. 
           
          This is supported by the use of the KeyID. See Section 9.  

       c. Automated and manual keying.  
           
          The option should support both automated and manual keying. 
           
          The use of a separate TSAD allows external automated and 
          manual keying. See Section 9. This capability is enhanced by 
          the generation of unique per-connection keys, which enables 
          use of manual master keys with automatically generated 
          connection keys as noted in Section 6. 

       d. Key management agnostic.  
           
          The option should not assume or require a particular key 
          management solution. 
           
          This is supported by use of a separate TSAD. See Section 9.1.

   5. Expected Constraints 
       
      A solution to revising TCP MD5 should also abide by typical safe 
      security practices. 

       a. Silent failure.  
           
          Receipt of segments failing authentication must result in no 
          visible external action and must not modify internal state, 
          and those events should be logged. 
           
          This is supported - see Sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5.  

       b. At most one such option per segment.  
           
          Only one authentication option can be permitted per segment. 
           
          This is supported by the protocol requirements - see Section 
          4.2.  

       c. Outgoing all or none.  
           
          Segments out of a TCP connection are either all authenticated 
          or all not authenticated. 
           
          This is supported - see Section 8.4.  

       d. Incoming all checked.  
           
          Segments into a TCP connection are always checked to determine 
          whether their authentication should be present and valid. 
           
          This is supported - see Section 8.5.  

       e. Non-interaction with TCP MD5.  
           
          The use of this option for a given connection should not 
          preclude the use of TCP MD5, e.g., for legacy use, for other 
          connections. 
           
          This is supported - see Section 10.

       f. Optional ICMP discard.  
           
          The option should allow certain ICMPs to be discarded, notably 
          Type 3, Codes 2-4. 
           
          This is supported - see Section 13.  

       g. Maintain TCP connection semantics, in which the socket pair 
          alone defines a TCP association and all its security 
          parameters.  
           
          This is supported - see Sections 7 and 11. 

13. Security Considerations 

   Use of TCP-AO, like use of TCP MD5 or IPsec, will impact host 
   performance. Connections that are known to use TCP-AO can be attacked 
   by transmitting segments with invalid MACs. Attackers would need to 
   know only the TCP connection ID and TCP-AO Length value to 
   substantially impact the host's processing capacity. This is similar 
   to the susceptibility of IPsec to on-path attacks, where the IP 
   addresses and SPI would be visible. For IPsec, the entire SPI space 
   (32 bits) is arbitrary, whereas for routing protocols typically only 
   the source port (16 bits) is arbitrary. As a result, it would be 
   easier for an off-path attacker to spoof a TCP-AO segment that could 
   cause receiver validation effort. However, we note that between 
   Internet routers both ports could be arbitrary (i.e., determined a-
   priori out of band), which would constitute roughly the same off-path 
   antispoofing protection of an arbitrary SPI. 

   TCP-AO, like TCP MD5, may inhibit connectionless resets. Such resets 
   typically occur after peer crashes, either in response to new 
   connection attempts or when data is sent on stale connections; in 
   either case, the recovering endpoint may lack the connection key 
   required (e.g., if lost during the crash). This may result in time-
   outs, rather than more responsive recovery after such a crash. As 
   noted in Section 6, such cases may also result in persistent TCP 
   state for old connections that cannot be cleared, and so 
   implementations should be capable of detecting an excess of such 
   connections and clearing their state if needed to protect memory 
   utilization [Je07].  

   TCP-AO does not include a fast decline capability, e.g., where a SYN-
   ACK is received without an expected TCP-AO option and the connection 
   is quickly reset or aborted. Normal TCP operation will retry and 
   timeout, which is what should be expected when the intended receiver 
   is not capable of the TCP variant required anyway. Backoff is not

   optimized because it would present an opportunity for attackers on 
   the wire to abort authenticated connection attempts by sending 
   spoofed SYN-ACKs without the TCP-AO option. 

   TCP-AO is intended to provide similar protections to IPsec, but is 
   not intended to replace the use of IPsec or IKE either for more 
   robust security or more sophisticated security management. 

   TCP-AO does not address the issue of ICMP attacks on TCP. IPsec makes 
   recommendations regarding dropping ICMPs in certain contexts, or 
   requiring that they are endpoint authenticated in others [RFC4301]. 
   There are other mechanisms proposed to reduce the impact of ICMP 
   attacks by further validating ICMP contents and changing the effect 
   of some messages based on TCP state, but these do not provide the 
   level of authentication for ICMP that TCP-AO provides for TCP [Go07]. 

   >> A TCP-AO implementation MUST allow the system administrator to 
   configure whether TCP will ignore incoming ICMP messages of Type 3 
   (destination unreachable) Codes 2-4 (protocol unreachable, port 
   unreachable, and fragmentation needed - 'hard errors') intended for 
   connections that match TSAD entries with non-NONE inbound MACs. An 
   implementation SHOULD allow ignored ICMPs to be logged.  

   This control affects only ICMPs that currently require 'hard errors', 
   which would abort the TCP connection [RFC1122]. This recommendation 
   is intended to be similar to how IPsec would handle those messages 
   [RFC4301]. 

   TCP-AO includes the TCP connection ID (the socket pair) in the MAC 
   calculation. This prevents different concurrent connections using the 
   same connection key (for whatever reason) from potentially enabling a 
   traffic-crossing attack, in which segments to one socket pair are 
   diverted to attack a different socket pair. When multiple connections 
   use the same master key, it would be useful to know that packets 
   intended for one ID could not be (maliciously or otherwise) modified 
   in transit and end up being authenticated for the other ID. The ID 
   cannot be zeroed, because to do so would require that the TSAD index 
   was unique in both directions (ID->key and key->ID). That requirement 
   would place an additional burden of uniqueness on master keys within 
   endsystems, and potentially across endsystems. Although the resulting 
   attack is low probability, the protection afforded by including the 
   received ID warrants its inclusion in the MAC, and does not unduly 
   increase the MAC calculation or master key management system. 

   The use of any security algorithm can present an opportunity for a 
   CPU DOS attack, where the attacker sends false, random segments that 
   the receiver under attack expends substantial CPU effort to reject.

Internet-Draft   The TCP Simple Authentication Option     February 2009 
    

   In IPsec, such attacks are reduced by the use of a large Security 
   Parameter Index (SPI) and Sequence Number fields to partly validate 
   segments before CPU cycles are invested validated the Integrity Check 
   Value (ICV). In TCP-AO, the socket pair performs most of the function 
   of IPsec's SPI, and IPsec's Sequence Number, used to avoid replay 
   attacks, isn't needed in all cases due to TCP's Sequence Number, 
   which is used to reorder received segments. TCP already protects 
   itself from replays of authentic segment data as well as authentic 
   explicit TCP control (e.g., SYN, FIN, ACK bits, but even authentic 
   replays could affect TCP congestion control [Sa99]. TCP-AO does not 
   protect TCP congestion control from such attacks due to the 
   cumbersome nature of layering a windowed security sequence number 
   within TCP in addition to TCP's own sequence number; when such 
   protection is desired, users are encouraged to apply IPsec instead. 

   Further, it is not useful to validate TCP's Sequence Number before 
   performing a TCP-AO authentication calculation, because out-of-window 
   segments can still cause valid TCP protocol actions (e.g., ACK 
   retransmission) [RFC793]. It is similarly not useful to add a 
   separate Sequence Number field to the TCP-AO option, because doing so 
   could cause a change in TCP's behavior even when segments are valid. 

14. IANA Considerations 

   [NOTE: This section be removed prior to publication as an RFC] 

   The TCP-AO option defines no new namespaces. 

   The TCP-AO option requires that IANA allocate a value from the TCP 
   option Kind namespace, to be replaced for TCP-IANA-KIND throughout 
   this document. 

   To specify MAC and PRF algorithms, TCP-AO refers to a separate 
   document that may involve IANA actions [RFC-TBD].
