1. Introduction 

   As described in [RFC4206], H-LSP (Hierarchical LSP) can be used for 
   carrying one or more other LSPs. [LSP-Hierarchy-bis] further mentions 
   the implementation of H-LSP. In packet networks, e.g. MPLS networks, 
   H-LSP mechanism can be implemented by MPLS label stack. In non-packet 
   networks where the label is implicit, label stacks are not possible, 
   and H-LSPs rely on the ability to nest switching technologies. Thus, 
   for example, a lambda switch capable (LSC) LSP can carry a time 
   division multiplexing (TDM) LSP, but cannot carry another LSC LSP.  

   S-LSP (LSP Stitching), which is defined in [RFC5150], is an LSP that 
   represents a segment of another LSP, i.e., the S-LSP is viewed as one 
   hop by another LSP. As described in [LSP-Hierarchy-bis], in the data 
   plane the LSPs are stitched so that there is no label stacking or 
   nesting. Thus, an S-LSP must be of the same switching technology as 
   the end-to-end LSP that it facilitates.  

   Therefore, H-LSP mechanism can be used in both multi-domain and 
   multi-layer scenarios and S-LSP mechanism can only be used in multi-
   domain scenario.  

   Both of the H-LSP and S-LSP can be advertised as a TE link in a GMPLS 
   routing instance for path computation purpose. As described in [LSP-

   Hierarchy-bis], if the LSP (H-LSP or S-LSP) is advertised in the same 
   instance of the control plane that advertises the TE links from which 
   the LSP is constructed, the LSP is called an FA.  

   In multi-domain or multi-layer context, the path information of an 
   LSP may not be provided to the ingress node for confidential reasons 
   and the ingress node may not run the same routing instance with the 
   intermediate nodes traversed by the path. In such scenarios, the 
   ingress node can not get the SRLG information of the path information 
   which the LSP traverse.  

   Even if the ingress node has the same routing instance with the 
   intermediate nodes traversed by the path, the path information of the 
   H-LSP or S-LSP may not be provided to the ingress node. Hence the 
   ingress node may also not know the SRLG of the path the LSP traverses.  

   In the case that the ingress node does not get the SRLG of the path 
   the LSP traverses(i.e. H-LSP or S-LSP), there are disadvantages as 
   follows: 

   o SRLG-disjoint path, for instance in case of end-to-end path 
   protection, cannot be calculated  

   o Intermediate nodes of a pre-planned shared restoration LSP cannot 
   correctly decide on the SRLG-disjointness between two PPRO 
   (PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE Object) 

   o In case that an LSP is advertised as a TE-Link, the ingress node 
   cannot provide the correct SRLG for the TE-Link automatically  

   In case that an LSP is advertised as a TE-Link, the SRLG information 
   of the TE link needs to be configured manually or automatically. 
   However, for manually configuration, there are some disadvantages 
   (e.g., require configuration coordination and additional management; 
   manual errors may be introduced) mentioned in Section 1.3.4 of [LSP-
   Hierarchy-bis].   

   In addition, Section 1.2 of [LSP-Hierarchy-bis] describes it is    
   desirable to have a kind of automatic mechanism to advertise the FA    
   (i.e., to signal an LSP and automatically coordinate its use and    
   advertisement in any of the ways with minimum involvement from an    
   operator).   

   Thus, in order to provide the SRLG information to the TE link 
   automatically when an LSP (H-LSP or S-LSP) is advertised as a TE link, 
   allow disjoint path calculation at ingress and allow correct pre-

   planned shared LSP to correctly share resource, this document 
   provides an automatic mechanism to collect the SRLG used by a LSP 
   automatically. 

2. RSVP-TE Requirements  

2.1. SRLG Collection Indication 

   The head nodes of the LSP must be capable of indicating whether the 
   SRLG information of the LSP should be collected during the signaling 
   procedure of setting up an LSP.   

2.2. SRLG Collecting  

   The SRLG information can be collected during the setup of an LSP. 
   Then the endpoints of the LSP can get the SRLG information and use it 
   for routing, sharing and TE link configuration purposes.  

2.3. SRLG Update 

   When the SRLG information changes, the endpoints of the LSP need to 
   be capable of updating the SRLG information of the path. It means 
   that the signaling needs to be capable of updating the newly SRLG 
   information to the endpoints.   

3. RSVP-TE Extensions 

3.1. SRLG Collection Indication  

   In order to indicate nodes that SRLG collection is desired, a new 
   flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE is needed: 

     0x08   SRLG recording desired 

   This flag indicate that SRLG information should be recorded along the 
   LSP. 

3.2. SRLG Information Object  

   An SRLG information object is defined to carry the SRLG information 
   of the LSP. The Class-Num and the C-Type of the SRLG Information 
   Object need to be assigned by the IANA.

   The SRLG ID list carries the SRLG information of the LSP. This object 
   can be carried in a Path/Resv message.  

   The SRLG ID can be added to the SRLG Information Object in a 
   Path/Resv message hop by hop. Then the endpoints of the LSP can get 
   the SRLG information of the path.  

3.3. Signaling Procedures 

   When an LSP head node determines that it needs to get the SRLG  
   information of the LSP, it sets the ''SRLG recording desired'' in the 
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE when it sends the Path message to the downstream 
   node. The downstream nodes record the SRLG information in the SRLG 
   Information Object hop by hop. Then the tail node of the LSP can get 
   the SRLG information from the SRLG Information Object.  

   When the tail node of the LSP receives the Path message and the ''SRLG 
   recording desired'' is set in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object, it can get 
   the SRLG information from the SRLG Information Object of the Path 
   message. Hence it can add the collected SRLG information into the 
   SRLG Information Object of a Resv message which will be forwarded hop 
   by hop in the upstream direction until it arrives the head node. Then 
   the head node can also get the SRLG information of the LSP from the 
   SRLG Information Object in the Resv message.  

   Based on the above procedure, the endpoints can get the SRLG 
   information automatically. Then the endpoints can for instance 
   configure the SRLG information and advertise it as a TE link to the 
   routing instance based on the procedure described in [LSP-Hierarchy-
   bis].
