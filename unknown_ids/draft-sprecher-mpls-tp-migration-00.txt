Migration Considerations and Techniques to Multiprotocol Label Switching
             Transport  Profile based Networks and Services
                draft-sprecher-mpls-tp-migration-00.txt

Abstract

   MPLS-TP defines a packet-based network architecture and a
   comprehensive set of tools that allow service providers to reliably
   deliver next generation services and applications, in a simple,
   scalable, and cost-effective way.  Such services are BW-hungry based
   and require strict guaranteed SLA.  Delivering next generation
   services over MPLS-TP based network in an economic way, enables
   service providers to increase their revenue while remaining
   competitive.

   This document presents the motivations for migrating from different
   transport networks and services to MPLS-TP, and discusses the
   considerations and startegies for the migration.

   The document also proposes specific activities and techniques needed
   to ensure smooth migration path from the different tranmsport
   networks and services to MPLS-TP

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview of MPLS-TP

   The Transport Profile for MPLS (MPLS-TP) is being specified in the
   IETF as part of a joint effort with the ITU-T to develop a definition
   of the MPLS network that will fulfill the strict requirements for
   transport networks that are accepted by the ITU-T.  This profile will
   be based on the definitions of the MPLS, MPLS Traffic Engineering,
   and Multi-Segment Pseudo-Wire architectures defined in [RFC3031],
   [RFC3985], and [RFC5659].

   The requirements for MPLS-TP are detailed in [RFC5654].  These
   requirements were developed in full cooperation between the IETF and
   ITU-T, and reflect the needs to adhere to the architecture of MPLS
   while including the enhanced level of service transparency, and
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functionality
   required for stable transport networks.  The requirements for the OAM
   functionality are further developed and defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM],
   providing the list of OAM procedures to be supported by MPLS-TP.

   The architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in [MPLS-TP-FWK] and builds
   on the experience of the MPLS architecture.  The architecture is
   defined to allow MPLS-TP networks to operate whether the
   configuration was implemented by use of control-plane signalling or
   through use of a management application.  In addition, the MPLS-TP
   architecture is designed to support networks that may not be using IP
   forwarding and addressing.  The framework defines the different
   service structures supported by MPLS-TP and the interworking between
   these service structures and existing MPLS services.  Also defined
   are the characteristics of the profile that defines MPLS-TP.  This
   synergy of architectures guarantees the service provider the ability
   to provide services with guaranteed and strict Service Level
   Agreements in a highly scalable robust network while reducing
   operational costs.

   A main focus of MPLS-TP is the definition of OAM functionality for

   MPLS data paths that support the transport services.  MPLS-TP
   provides a comprehensive set of OAM tools for fault management and
   performance monitoring, supporting the network and the services at
   different nested levels (i.e. at the end-to-end level, a segment of a
   path, and link level).  The OAM tools may be used to monitor the
   network infrastructure, to enhance the general behavior, and
   performance level of the network.  The tools may also be used to
   monitor the service level offered to the end customer, allowing
   verification of the SLA parameters, and enabling rapid response in
   the event of a failure or service degradation.  The OAM tools help
   reduce OPEX, minimizing the overhead of trouble shooting, and
   enhancing customer satisfaction which, in turn, helps to enable the
   delivery of high-margin premium services.

   The architectural constructs and the methodology of the OAM
   functionality is defined by [MPLS-TP-OAM-Fwk].  This includes the
   definition of the transport entities that are monitored by the OAM
   procedures and detailed description of how the the OAM procedures are
   applied to these transport entities.  A central issue in MPLS-TP OAM
   is the independence of the OAM from the existence of an operational
   control plane in the network.  This feature is supported by the
   creation of an in-band control channel that is used to transmit the
   OAM procedures across the transport paths.  A cornerstone of the
   definition of the OAM procedures is to use existing IETF OAM tools as
   the basis of the MPLS-TP OAM procedures wherever possible, this
   principle is used as the underlying foundation for the definition of
   the OAM tools defined for MPLS-TP.

   Protection mechanisms for the MPLS-TP transport paths are described
   in [MPLS-TP-Surviv] and are conformant with different topological
   configurations of the network.
