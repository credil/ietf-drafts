        Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifier for Proxy Mobile IPv6
       draft-gundavelli-v6ops-pmipv6-address-reservations-03.txt

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] requires all the mobile access gateways
   to use a fixed link-local and link-layer addresses on any of its
   access links that it shares with the mobile nodes.  This was intended
   to ensure a mobile node does not detect any change with respect to
   its layer-3 attachment even after it roams from one mobile access
   gateway to another.  In the absence of any reserved addresses for
   this use, it requires coordination across vendors and the manual
   configuration of these addresses on all the mobility elements in a
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  This document attempts to simplify this
   operational requirement by making reservation for special addresses
   that can be used for this purpose and it also updates RFC 5213.

Internet-Draft        Reserved IPv6 IID for PMIPv6        September 2011


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility management
   protocol that enables IP mobility support for a mobile node without
   requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.  The
   mobility elements in the network ensure that the mobile node does not
   detect any change with respect to its layer-3 attachment even after
   it roams from one mobile access gateway to another and changes its
   point of attachment in the network.  All the mobile access gateways
   in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 use a fixed link-local address and a fixed
   link-layer address on any of its access links that they share with
   the mobile nodes.  This essentially ensures a mobile node after
   performing an handoff does not detect any change with respect to the
   IP network configuration.

   Although the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213] requires
   the use of a fixed link-local and a fixed link-layer address, it did
   not reserve any specific addresses for this purpose and this is
   proving to be a operational challenge in deployments involving multi-
   vendor equipment.  To address this problem, this specification makes
   the following two reservations.

   1.  This specification reserves the IPv6 interface identifier, IANA-
       TBD1, for the use of Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].  The reserved
       IPv6 interface identifier can be used by all the mobile access
       gateways in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain on all of the access links
       that it shares with the mobile nodes.  Specifically, the mobile
       access gateway can use this reserved IPv6 interface identifier
       for generating the link-local address that it uses in the
       Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] related communication with the
       mobile node.  This reserved interface identifier is allocated
       from the registry, "Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers".

   2.  Furthermore, this specification also reserves the Ethernet
       unicast address, IANA-TBD2, for the use of Proxy Mobile IPv6.
       This reserved link-layer address can by used by the mobile access
       gateway in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, on all of the access links
       that it shares with the mobile nodes.  This address will be used
       in all packet communication with the mobile node on the access
       links.  Considerations from [RFC5342] apply with respect to the
       use of Ethernet parameters in IETF protocols.  This address is
       allocated from the registry, "IANA Ethernet Address block -
       Unicast Use".

2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213], [RFC5844].  All the IPv6 addressing related terminology is
   to be interpreted as specified in [RFC4291].


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following two IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification reserves an IPv6 interface identifier
      (IANA-TBD1) for Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].  This fixed interface
      identifier needs to be allocated from the registry, "Reserved IPv6
      Interface Identifiers".

   o  Action-2: This specification reserves a IANA Ethernet unicast
      address (IANA-TBD2) for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This address needs to
      be reserved from the block.  "IANA Ethernet Address block -
      Unicast Use".


4.  Security Considerations

   All the security considerations specified in [RFC5213], [RFC5844] and
   [RFC5453] continue to apply to the mobility elements in a Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain, when enabled to conform to this specification.
   Specifically, the issues related to the use of fixed link-local and
   link-layer address documented in section 6.9.3 of the base Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 specification are equally relevant here.  In some sense,
   the reservations made in this specification results in the use of the
   same set of link-local and link-layer address values beyond a single
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, thereby expanding the scope of the existing
   problem related to asserting ownership on the configured addresses
   from a single domain to multi-domain.  Future work may be needed to
   address these issues.


5.  Acknowledgements
