Internet-Draft        Email Feedback Type: not-spam          August 2011


1.  Introduction

   In RFC 5965 [RFC5965], an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) is defined for
   reporting email abuse.  Currently two feedback report types are
   defined that are related to the spam problem, and that can be used to
   report abusive or fraudulent email messages:
   o  abuse: indicates unsolicited email or some other kind of email
      abuse.
   o  fraud: indicates some kind of fraud or phishing activity.

   This specification defines a new feedback report type: "not-spam".
   It can be used to report a message that was mistakenly marked as
   spam.

1.1.  Discussion

   In some cases, the email client receives an email message that was
   incorrectly tagged as spam, perhaps by the email system, or
   accidentally by the user.  The email client accepts the end user's
   "not-spam" report instruction, retrieves information related to the
   message, and reports this email as not-spam to the email operator.
   When the email operator receives the report, it can determine what
   action is appropriate for the particular message and user.  (The
   requirement for a not-spam report type is from the Open Mobile
   Alliance (OMA) Spam Report Requirement Document [OMA-SpamRep-RD].)

   For example, in response to a "not-spam" report the email system can
   remove the spam tag or otherwise reclassify the message, possibly
   preventing future similar email for this user from being marked as
   spam.  The report can be used to adjust the training of an automated
   classifier.  After processing the report, the email operator might
   send a notification to the email client about the processing result
   (for example, by moving the message from one mailbox to another, such
   as from "Junk" to "Inbox").

   In most cases, "not-spam" reports will probably not be taken on their
   own, but will be considered along with other information, analysis of
   the message, etc.  Because different users have different needs and
   different views of what constitutes spam, reports from one user might
   or might not be applicable to others.  And because users might
   sometimes press a "report not spam" button accidentally, immediate
   strong action, such as marking all similar messages as "good" based
   on a single report, is probably not the right approach.  Recipients
   of "not-spam" reports need to consider what's right in their
   environments.

   There are anti-spam systems that use "not spam" feedback today.  All
   of them take the reports and mix them with other spam reports and

   other data, using their own algorithms, to determine appropriate
   action.  In no case do the existing systems use a "not spam" report
   as an immediate, automatic override.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   terms take their normative values only when presented in UPPER CASE.


2.  Feedback Report Type: Not-Spam

   This document only defines a new feedback report type, "not-spam",
   extending the Email Feedback Reports specification [RFC5965].

   In the first MIME part of the feedback report message, the end user
   or the email client MAY add information to indicate why the message
   is not spam -- for example, because the originator or its domain is
   well known.


3.  Example

   In the example, Joe, a pharmaceuticals sales representative, has
   received a message about discount pharmaceuticals.  Because that is a
   frequent subject of spam email, the message has been marked as spam
   -- incorrectly, in this case.  Joe has reported it as "not-spam", and
   this is an example of the report.

   Note that the message is DKIM-signed [I-D.ietf-dkim-rfc4871bis], a
   good security practice as suggested in RFC 5965 section 8.2
   [RFC5965].

      Hi, Joe.  I got a lead on a source for discounts on
      pharmaceuticals, and I thought you might be interested.

4.  Security Considerations

   All of the Security Considerations from the Email Feedback Reports
   specification [RFC5965] are inherited here.

   Not-spam reports could possibly be used in an attack on a filtering
   system, reporting true spam as "not-spam".  Even in absence of
   malice, some not-spam reports might be made in error, or will only
   apply to the user sending the report.  Operators need to be careful
   in trusting such reports, beyond their applicability to the specific
   user in question.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Registration is requested for the newly defined feedback type name:
   "not-spam", according to the instructions in section 7.3 of the base
   specification [RFC5965].

   Please add the following to the "Feedback Report Type Values"
   registry:
   Feedback Type Name:  not-spam
   Description:  Indicates that a message is not spam.  This may be used
       to correct a message that was incorrectly tagged or categorized
       as spam.
