              RADIUS Extensions for Port Control Protocol
                    draft-maglione-pcp-radius-ext-00

Abstract

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to pre-configure a
   port on a NAT device, a firewall, etc., so that IP packets of
   applications initiated from network side can be "port forwarded" to
   the correct user.  PCP is a client-server protocol and the PCP client
   needs to be provisioned with the FQDN of the server.  In a broadband
   network, customer information is usually stored on a RADIUS server
   and DHC protocol is used to populate user's configuration
   information.  This memo proposes a new RADIUS attribute to carry the
   FQDN of a PCP server, such that while the PCP server information is
   configured on a RADIUS server, the information can be conveyed to NAS
   via RADIUS protocol, and the co-located DHCP/DHCPv6 server can then
   populate the information to PCP client.

Internet-Draft            PCP RADIUS Extensions             January 2011


1.  Introduction

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] provides a mechanism
   to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices
   such as NATs and firewalls.  PCP is a client-server protocol where a
   PCP client may reside on a host, a CPE, etc., which communicates with
   a PCP server that may reside anywhere in a network.

   A PCP client must know the Fully Qualified Domain Name of a PCP
   server, before it can communicate with the later in order to perform
   the relevant functions defined by PCP.

   The draft [I-D.bpw-pcp-dhcp] defines DHCPv6 and DHCP options which
   are meant to be used by a PCP client to discover a PCP server name.
   However, provisioning for name of the PCP server is required on a
   DHCP/DHCPv6 server before it can populate these information.

   Auto-configuration on a DHCP/DHCPv6 is possible in a broadband
   network, where typically, user profile is maintained on a RADIUS
   server and RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] is used to convey user related
   information to other network elements including a host and CPE.
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] describes a typical broadband network
   scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts as the access
   gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a DHCPv6
   Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6 requests
   issued by the clients.

   In such environment, PCP server's name can be configured on a RADIUS
   server, which then passes the information to a NAS that co-locates
   with the DHCP/DHCPv6 server, which in turn populates the location of
   the PCP server.

   This memo defines a new RADIUS attribute that can be used to carry
   the FQDN of a PCP server.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]:

        - Port forwarding
        - PCP

        - PCP client
        - PCP Server


3.  PCP Server Configuration using RADIUS and DHCP/DHCPv6

   Figure 1 illustrates how RADIUS protocol works together with DHCPv6,
   to allow a user (host or CPE) to learn automatically the FQDN of a
   PCP server in case of a PPP Session that carries IPv6 traffic.

   The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and as
   DHCPv6 Server for DHCPv6 protocol.  The NAS initially sends a RADIUS
   Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting
   authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives the request, it
   validates the sending client and if the request is approved, the
   RADIUS server replies with an Access Accept message including a list
   of attribute-value pairs that describe the parameters to be used for
   this session.  This list may also contain the name of a PCP server.
   When the NAS receives a DHCPv6 message containing the PCP Server
   Option, the NAS shall use the name returned in the RADIUS attribute
   as defined in this memo to populate the DHCPv6 PCP Server option
   defined in [I-D.bpw-pcp-dhcp]

        Figure 1: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for a PPP Session

   The Figure 2 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work
   together to accomplish PCP client configuration when an IP Session is
   used to provide connectivity to the user.

   The only difference between this message flow and previous one is
   that in this scenario the interaction between NAS and AAA/ RADIUS
   Server is triggered by the DHCPv6 Solicit message received by the NAS
   from the B4 acting as DHCPv6 client, while in case of a PPP Session
   the trigger is the PPP LCP Config Request message received by the
   NAS.

   The scenario with PPP Session and IPv4 only connectivity does not
   require the DHCP protocol: the whole configuration of the client is
   performed by PPP.  This case is out of scope of this document because
   in order to complete the configuration of the PCP client a new PPP
   IPC option would be required.


4.  RADIUS Attribute

   A new RADIUS attribute, called PCP-Server-Name, along with its format
   is defined below.

   Description

   The PCP-server-name attribute contains a Fully Qualified Domain Name
   (FQDN) that refers to a PCP server the client requests to establish a
   connection to for PCP related service.  The NAS shall use the name
   returned in the RADIUS PCP-server-name attribute to populate the PCP
   Server FQDN DHCP Sub-Option in IPv4 addressing context, or the PCP
   Server FQDN DHCPv6 Option in IPv6 addressing context, as determined
   by the DHCP server [I-D.bpw-pcp-dhcp]

   The PCP-server-name attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet,
   and may also appear in an Accounting-Request packet.  In either case,
   the attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a single packet.  The
   PCP-server-name MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS packets.

   A summary of the PCP-Server-Name RADIUS attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |  PCP-Server-Name (FQDN)       |

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:

        TBA1 for PCP-Server-Name.
   Length:
        This field indicates the total length in octets of this
        attribute including the Type, the Length fields and the length
        in octets of the PCP-Server-Name field

   PCP-Server-Name:

        A single Fully Qualified Domain Name of the PCP-Server.  The
        domain name is encoded as specified in [RFC1035]


5.  Table of attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Request Accept Reject Challenge Accounting       #    Attribute
                                   Request
   0-1     0-1    0      0         0-1              TBA1 PCP-Server-Name

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.

   0   This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+  Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in
       packet.
   0-1 Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in packet.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no additional security considerations beyond those
   already identified in [RFC2865].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the allocation of a new Radius attribute types
   from the IANA registry "Radius Attribute Types" located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types

      PCP-Server-Name - TBA1
