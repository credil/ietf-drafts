         Enabling server side caching of file creation in NFSv4
            draft-myklebust-nfsv4-unstable-file-creation-00

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol to allow
   clients to create and write files with greater efficiency.

   The proposed extension allows the server to defer creating the file
   on stable storage when replying to an OPEN call.  The aim is to
   improve server efficiency and scalability by reducing the number of
   required disk accesses when writing a file from scratch.

Internet-Draft        NFSv4 unstable file creation            March 2011


1.  Introduction

   One of the remaining sources of performance and scalability issues in
   the NFSv4.1 protocol [RFC5661], for workloads that require the
   creation of large numbers of files, is that file creation is still
   required to be synchronous.  This limitation means that the minimum
   number of disk accesses in a workload that involves creating a file,
   writing to it and then closing it is 2: one at OPEN time, and one at
   COMMIT.  The following proposal allows the client to indicate to the
   server, by means of a new attribute, that it is prepared to take on
   the burden of re-creating the file from scratch if the server should
   reboot before the file has been fully written.  The same attribute
   also allows the client to check on the state of the file on the
   server, and thus perhaps to optimise away unnecessary COMMIT
   requests.

2.  Definition of the 'stable_state' per-file attribute

   const NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA = 0x00000001;
   const NFS4_UNSTABLE_DATA     = 0x00000002;
   const NFS4_UNSTABLE_PNFS     = 0x00000004;


                  +--------------+----+-----------+-----+
                  | Name         | Id | Data Type | Acc |
                  +--------------+----+-----------+-----+
                  | stable_state | XX | uint32_t  | R W |
                  +--------------+----+-----------+-----+

   The attribute 'stable_state' is an optional per-file attribute that
   can be used by the client to determine whether or not the server
   believes that all metadata and data has been committed to persistent
   storage.  It is expected that clients may wish to poll it as part of
   a post-op attribute request or an attribute refresh.
   o  If the server returns a zero value, then the client may assume
      that all metadata and data changes that were made since the server
      last rebooted have been committed to persistent storage.
   o  If the server sets the bits NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA and/or
      NFS4_UNSTABLE_DATA, then this means that there may be respectively
      metadata, or data that has not been synced to disk.  The client
      should be prepared to send a COMMIT request in order to ensure
      persistence of metadata and data.
   o  If the server sets the bit NFS4_UNSTABLE_PNFS, then this indicates
      that there are outstanding layouts for write, and thus the state
      of the file may not be fully known to the server.

   A naive server may choose to implement 'stable_state' in terms of a
   simple flag: it sets NFS4_UNSTABLE_DATA when it receives an unstable
   WRITE request, sets NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA when it receives an
   unstable OPEN or SETATTR requests and clears both flags when it
   receives a COMMIT.  While such an implementation may not be as useful
   for avoiding unnecessary COMMIT operations, it is sufficient to
   support unstable OPEN and SETATTR.

2.1.  Use of the 'stable_state' attribute for unstable OPEN requests

   We propose a new mode of file creation named "unstable file
   creation".  By choosing this mode of creation, the client is
   notifying the server that it may defer syncing to disk the new file's
   directory entry as well as the new file metadata.  In case of a
   server reboot, the client is then responsible for replaying the file
   creation if the reboot occurred before the file metadata was
   committed to disk.

2.1.1.  Client use of the 'stable_state' attribute

   In order to indicate that the client wishes to have the server use
   unstable file creation, it must set the NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA bit in
   the optional attribute 'stable_state'.  Upon return of the OPEN call,
   the client then checks that 'stable_state' was indeed set by
   inspecting the 'attrset' bitmap in the usual way.  It can assume that
   if the 'stable_state' was not set, then the file has been created in
   persistent storage.

   The client MUST NOT set the 'stable_state' to any value other than
   NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA.  The server SHOULD return NFS4ERR_INVAL if it
   receives an invalid value.

   Once the client is done making changes to the file, it may use a
   COMMIT to force the server to flush all data and metadata changes to
   persistent storage.

2.1.2.  Server response upon receiving an unstable OPEN request

   Upon receiving an OPEN request that includes a 'stable_state'
   attribute, the server MAY choose to ignore it, and simply apply the
   usual NFSv4 rule that all metadata must be committed to persistent
   storage.  If so, it simply omits the 'stable_state' bit from the
   returned attribute bitmap.

   The server MUST NOT set the 'stable_state' flag if the file already
   exists.

   If the server does choose to honour the 'stable_state' attribute,
   then it MUST also return a write delegation to the client.  This
   write delegation is needed in order to allow the client to detect the
   recovery edge condition in which a second client attempts to rename
   the file or delete it just prior to a server reboot.

   Once the file has been created in the server cache memory, the server
   is then free to process the remaining elements of the COMPOUND
   without syncing the new file metadata to disk.

2.1.3.  Delegation return and unstable OPEN

   If the client returns the write delegation, then it MUST ensure that
   the file metadata is in a stable state.  It does so by sending a
   COMMIT operation, unless polling has already established that the
   'stable_state' attribute no longer sets the NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA
   bit.

   };

   A server that supports unstable file creation SHOULD reject all
   CREATE and ordinary file creation attempts during the grace period
   using the error NFS4ERR_GRACE in order to allow clients to recover
   any unstable files that may have been lost.

   In order to recover the file, the client MUST replay the original
   OPEN that was used to create the file, using an open claim type of
   CLAIM_PREVIOUS_UNSTABLE.
   o  If the server discovers that the file already exists, it treats
      the OPEN as if it were a CLAIM_PREVIOUS request for a write
      delegation.
   o  If the file does not exist, then the server creates the file in
      the usual fashion and returns a valid write delegation.

2.1.5.  Directory cache consistency and unstable files

   While the client that created the file can easily recover in case of
   a server reboot, it is not necessarily so easy for other clients to
   do so.  While the write delegation does indeed ensure that those
   clients do not hold the file open (neither do they hold any cached
   data), it does not guarantee that they are not caching LOOKUP or
   READDIR data.

   In order to avoid issues with directory cache consistency across
   server reboots, it is therefore RECOMMENDED that servers ensure that
   initial file metadata be committed to persistent storage prior to
   replying to a another client's LOOKUP of the new file, or READDIR of
   the directory in which the new file was created.  This will also
   prevent those clients from seeing filehandles and fileids that might
   change upon server reboot.

2.2.  Use of the 'stable_state' attribute in unstable SETATTR requests

   If it holds a write delegation, the client may also use the
   'stable_state' attribute in a SETATTR request to indicate to the
   server that it is ready to replay this SETATTR in the case of a
   server reboot.

   The procedure is the same as for OPEN.  In order to indicate to the
   server that it wants the SETATTR request to be unstable, the client
   sets the 'stable_state' attribute to the value
   NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA.

   Again, the server MAY ignore the 'stable_state' attribute, in which
   case it MUST immediately commit the attributes to stable storage, and
   MUST clear the 'stable_state' bit in the returned attribute bitmap.

   If the client does not hold a valid write delegation, then the server
   MUST also ignore the 'stable_state' attribute.

2.2.1.  Client unstable SETATTR recovery in case of a server reboot

   If the server reboots before the client has had a chance to issue a
   COMMIT, then after recovering the write delegation, the client SHOULD
   check the server attributes against its own cached values.  If there
   is a mismatch, then it is responsible for correcting this by
   replaying the relevant SETATTR calls.

2.2.2.  Delegation return and unstable SETATTR

   If the client returns the write delegation, then it MUST ensure that
   the file metadata is in a stable state.  It does so by sending a
   COMMIT operation, unless polling has already established that the
   'stable_state' attribute no longer sets the NFS4_UNSTABLE_METADATA
   bit.
