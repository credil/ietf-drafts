    <abstract>
      <t> During the World IPv6 Day on June 8th, 2011, several key
      content providers enabled their networks to offer both IPv4 and
      IPv6 service. Hundreds of organizations participated in this
      effort, and in the months and weeks leading up to the event
      worked hard on preparing their networks to support this event.
      The event was largely unnoticed by the general public, which is
      a good thing as no major problems were detected. For the
      Internet, however, there was a major change on such a small
      timescale. This memo discusses measurements that the authors
      made from the perspective of an end-user with well-working IPv4
      and IPv6 connectivity. Our measurements include the number of
      most popular networks providing AAAA records for their service
      as well as delay and connection failure probabilities. </t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

  <t> Many large content providers participated in World IPv6 Day on
  June 8, 2011. On that day, IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"/> was enabled
  by default for 24 hours on numerous networks and sites that
  previously supported only IPv4. The aim was to identify any
  remaining issues with widespread IPv6 usage in these networks. Most
  of the potential problems associated with using IPv6 are, after all,
  of a practical nature, such as: ensuring that the necessary
  components have IPv6 turned on; that configurations are correct; and
  that any implementation bugs have been removed.</t>

  <t> Some content providers have been reluctant to enable IPv6. The
  reasons for this include delays for applications attempting to
  connect over broken IPv6 links before falling back to IPv4, and
  unreliable IPv6 connectivity. Bad IPv6 routing has been behind many
  of the problems. Among the causes are broken 6to4 tunneling protocol
  connectivity, experimental IPv6 setups that are untested and
  unmonitored, and configuration problems with firewalls. The
  situation is improving as more users and operators put IPv6 to use
  and fix the problems that emerge.</t>

  <t> World IPv6 Day event was largely unnoticed by the general
  public, which is a good thing as no major problems were detected.
  For the Internet, however, there was a major change on such a small
  timescale. This memo discusses measurements that the authors made
  from the perspective of an end-user with well-working IPv4 and IPv6
  connectivity. Our measurements include the number of most popular
  networks providing AAAA records for their service as well as delay
  and connection failure probabilities.</t>

  <t> The rest of this memo is structured as follows. <xref
  target="goals"/> discusses the goals of our measurements, <xref
  target="method"/> describes our measurement methodology, <xref
  target="results"/> gives our preliminary results, and <xref
  target="concl"/> makes some conclusions.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="goals" title="Motivation and Goals">

  <t> Practical IPv6 deployment plans benefit from accurate
  information about the extent to which IPv6 can be used for
  communication, and how its characteristics differ from those of
  IPv4. For instance, operators planning to deploy dual stack
  networking may wish to understand what fraction of their traffic
  would move to IPv6. This information is useful for estimating
  sufficient capacity to deal with the IPv6 traffic and impacts to the
  operator's IPv4 infrastructure or carrier-grade NAT devices as their
  traffic is reduced. Network owners also wish to understand the
  extent to which they can expect different delay characteristics or
  problems with IPv6 connectivity. The goals of our measurements were
  to help with these topics by answering the following questions:

  <list style="symbols">
    <t> What fraction of most popular Internet sites offer AAAA
    records? How did the World IPv6 Day change the situation?</t>
    <t> How do the traffic characteristics differ between IPv4 and
    IPv6 on sites offering AAAA records? Are the connection failure
    rates similar? How are RTTs impacted? </t>
  </list></t>

  <t> There have been many measurements about some of these aspects
  from a service provider perspective, such as the Google studies on
  which end users have broken connectivity towards them. Our
  measurements start from a different angle, by assuming a
  well-working dual-stack connectivity on the measurement end, and
  then probing the rest of the Internet to understand, for instance,
  how likely it is to have IPv6 connectivity problems, or what are the
  delay differences between IPv4 and IPv6 towards the rest of the
  Internet. Similar studies have been performed by the Comcast IPv6
  Adoption Monitor <xref target="IPv6Monitor"/> and RIPE NCC <xref
  target="RIPEv6Day"/>. </t>

</section>

<section anchor="method" title="Measurement Methodology">

  <t> We used the top 10,000 sites of the Alexa 1 million most popular
  sites list <xref target="Alexa"/> from June 1st 2011. For each
  domain name in the list, we performed DNS queries with different
  host names. For IPv4 addresses (A records) we used host name "www"
  and also performed a query with just the domain name. For IPv6
  addresses (AAAA records) we used also different combinations of host
  names that have been used for IPv6 sites, namely "www6", "ipv6",
  "v6", "ipv6.www", "www.ipv6", "v6.www", and "www.v6". </t>
    
  <t> All DNS queries were initiated in the order listed above (first
  "www" and just the domain name for A-records, then "www", domain
  name, and different IPv6-host names for AAAA records) but the
  queries were done in parallel (i.e., without waiting for the
  previous query to finish). The first response for A and AAAA record
  and the corresponding host name were recorded. The queries had 3
  second re-transmission timeout and if there wasn't any response for
  10 seconds, all remaining queries for the site were canceled. We
  used a custom-made Perl script and the Net::DNS module for the DNS
  queries. </t>
    
  <t> The measurement script used a bind9 DNS server running on the
  same host that was performing the measurement. The DNS cache of the
  server was flushed before each measurement run to be able to detect
  the changes in the DNS records in real-time. The host, and thus the
  DNS server, was not part of DNS IPv6 whitelisting agreements. </t>
    
  <t> After obtaining IP addresses for the site, if a site had both A
  and AAAA records, a simple C-program was used to create TCP
  connections at the same time with IPv4 and IPv6 to the IP addresses
  discovered from the DNS. The connection setup was repeated for 10
  times and the connection setup delay was measured by recording the
  time right before and after the connect system call. The host used
  for measurements is a regular Linux PC with 2.6.32 version kernel
  and dual stack Internet connection via Ethernet. </t>

  <t> The measurements were started one week before the World IPv6 Day
  (on Wednesday, June 1st, 17:30 GMT) and have been running since,
  once every three hours. One test run takes from two to two and a
  half hours to finish. </t>

</section>

<section anchor="results" title="Measurement Results">

<section title="DNS Measurements">
  <t> When the measurements begun on June 1st, there were 245 sites
  (2.45%) with both A and AAAA record in the top 10,000 sites. During
  the following days the number of sites was slowly increasing,
  reaching 306 sites at the measurement that was started 22:30 GMT on
  June 7th, the evening before the World IPv6 Day. When the World IPv6
  Day officially started, the following measurement (1:30 GMT)
  recorded already 383 sites, and the next one 472 sites. During the
  day number of sites with AAAA records peaked at 491 (4.91% of the
  measured 10,000 sites) on 19:30 GMT. </t>

  <t> When the World IPv6 Day was over, also the number of AAAA
  records dropped nearly as fast as it had increased just 24 hours
  earlier. However, the number of sites stabilized around 310 and has
  not dropped below 300 since, resulting in over 3% of the top 10,000
  sites having AAAA records today. </t>

  <t> While 274 sites had IPv6 enabled in their DNS for some of the
  tested host names one day before the World IPv6 Day, only 116 had it
  for the "www" host name that is commonly used when accessing a web
  site. The number of "www" host names with AAAA records more than
  tripled during the World IPv6 Day reaching 374 sites for 3
  consecutive measurement runs (i.e., at least for 6 hours). Also the
  number of AAAA records for the "www" host name dropped steeply after
  the day and has remained around 160 sites since. </t>

  <t> Similar trends, but with larger impact, can be seen if only top
  100 of the most popular sites are taken into considerations. Here,
  the number of sites with some of the tested host names having AAAA
  record was initially 14, jumped to 36 during the day, and eventually
  dropped to 13. Also, while none of the top 100 sites apparently had
  AAAA record for their "www" host before and after the World IPv6
  day, during the day the number peaked at 30. Thus, roughly one third
  of the 100 most popular sites was enabling IPv6 for the World
  IPv6 Day. </t>

</section>

<section title="Delay and Failure Measurements">

  <t> Based on the TCP connectivity tests, the IPv6 addresses obtained
  from the DNS appear to work less often than IPv4 addresses. Also,
  some sites show considerable differences in the RTTs. However, at
  the time of writing, further analysis of the delay and failure
  results is still ongoing. </t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="concl" title="Conclusions">

<t>The World IPv6 Day had a very visible impact to the availability of
content over IPv6, particularly when considering the top 100 content
providers. It is difficult to find other examples of bigger one day
swings in some characteristic of the Internet. However, real impacts
to end users were small, given that when dual stack works correctly it
should not be visible at the user level and that IPv6 availability for
end users themselves was small.</t>

<t>The key conclusions are as follows:

<list style="symbols">

<t>The day caused a large jump in the number of content providers
supporting AAAA on that day.</t>

<t>The day caused a smaller but apparently permanent jump in the
number of content providers supporting AAAA.</t>

<t>Large and quick swings in the relative amount of IPv4 vs. IPv6
traffic are possible merely by supporting a dual-stack access network
and having a few large content providers offer their service either
globally or to this particular network over IPv6.</t>

</list></t>

<t>The analysis is not complete, however. The authors plan to update
this memo as soon as their analysis of connectivity failures and RTT
impacts are complete.</t>
