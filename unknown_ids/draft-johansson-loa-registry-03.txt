            An IANA registry for Level of Assurance Profiles
                    draft-johansson-loa-registry-03

Abstract

   This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance
   Profiles.  The registry is intended to be used as an aid to
   discovering such LoA definitions in protocols that use an LoA
   concept, including SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

Internet-Draft            SAML 2.0 LoA Registry            December 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance
   Profiles.  Such profiles are used in various protocols, including
   SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.  For SAML 2.0 the registry entries
   reference XML schema definitions that fulfil the requirements of
   sstc.saml-assurance-profile [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile].  For
   OpenID Connect the registry consists a controlled vocabulary for the
   iso29115level claim type.  Quoting from sstc.saml-assurance-profile
   [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile] we find the following definition
   of the concept of level of assurance:

   _Many existing (and potential) SAML federation deployments have
   adopted a "levels of assurance" (or LOA) model for categorizing the
   wide variety of authentication methods into a small number of levels,
   typically based on some notion of the strength of the authentication.
   Federation members (service providers or "relying parties") then
   decide which level of assurance is required to access specific
   protected resources, based on some assessment of "value" or "risk"._

   Several so called trust frameworks and identity federations now
   exist, some of which define one or more Level of Assurance (LoA).
   The purpose of this specification is to create an IANA registry where
   such LoA definitions can be discovered.  While the quote above
   references SAML explicitly the notion of a "level of assurance" has
   gained wide-spread acceptance and should be treated as a protocol-
   independent concept.  The proposed IANA registry attempts to reflects
   this.

   Although the registry will contain URIs that reference SAML
   Authentication Context Profiles other protocols MAY use such URIs to
   represent levels of assurance definitions without relying on their
   SAML XML definitions.  Use of the registry by protocols other than
   SAML or OpenID Connect is encouraged.


2.  Name of Registry

   The name of the registry shall be "SAML 2.0 LoA Context Class", in
   plural "SAML LoA Context Classes".  The term LoA is an abbreviation
   of Level of Assurance.


3.  Registration Template

   The following information MUST be provided with each registration:

Internet-Draft            SAML 2.0 LoA Registry            December 2011


   URI:  A URI referencing a Level of Assurance Profile This is the
      registry key.

   Context Class:  A valid XML schema definition for the SAML 2.0 LoA
      Context Class fulfilling the requirements of sstc.saml-assurance-
      profile [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile].  The registry key
      (the URI) is the unique identifier for the Context Class.

   Name:  A string uniquely identifying the LoA for use in protocols
      where URIs are not appropriate.

   Informational URL:  A URL containing auxilliary information.  This
      URL MUST minimally reference contact information for the
      administrative authority of the level of assurance definition.

   Note that it is not uncommon for a single XML Schema to contain
   definitions of multiple URIs.  In that case the registration MUST be
   repeated for each URI.  Both the name and the URI must uniquely
   identify the LoA.  The name is meant to be used in protocols where
   URIs are not appropriate.

   The name must fulfill the following ABNF:
   label = ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
   name = label 1*( label / '-' / '.' / '_' )

   The following ABNF productions represent reserved values and names
   matching any of these productions MUST NOT be present in any
   registration:
   reserved = loa / al / num
   loa = ( 'l' / 'L' ) ( 'o' / 'O' ) ( 'a' / 'A') *DIGIT
   al = ( 'a' / 'A') ( 'l' / 'L') *DIGIT
   num = *DIGIT


4.  Registration Policy

   The registry is to be operated under the "Designated Expert Review"
   policy from RFC5226 [RFC5226] employing a pool of experts.  IANA is
   kindly asked to do rough randomized load-balancing among the experts
   and also do an initial review of each submission to ensure that the
   name is unique within the registry.The initial pool of expert and the
   review criteria are outlined below.

4.1.  Reviewer Expectations

   The expectation of the IANA LoA Registry is that it contain bona fide
   Level of Assurance Profiles while not presenting a very high bar for
   entry.  Expert reviewers SHOULD NOT place undue value in any

   percieved or actual quality of the associated trust framework or
   federation and SHOULD only exclude such registrations that in the
   view of the experts do not represent bona fide attempts at defining
   an LoA.

   The designated experts are also expected to verify that the
   registration is consistent and that the provided XML fulfills the
   requirements of sstc.saml-assurance-profile
   [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile].

4.2.  Designated Experts Pool

   The initial pool of experts is (in no particular order):

   o  TBD


5.  Registry Semantics

   The intended use for this registry is to serve as a basis for
   discovery of LoA definitions that might for instance be used by
   protocol-specific (eg SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect) management tools.
   Consumers of the registry MUST NOT treat it as a complete list of all
   existing LoA definitions and MUST provide a way for the user to
   provide additional Level of Assurance Profile references by other
   means.  It is not expected that all LoA definitions will be contained
   in this registry.

   The presense of an entry in the registy MUST NOT be taken to imply
   any semantics beyond the review done by the expert reviewers as part
   of the registration process.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document sets up a registry with IANA making the whole document
   a set of considerations for IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   An implementor of MUST NOT treat the registry as a trust framework or
   federation and MUST NOT make any assumptions about the properties of
   any of the listed level of assurance URIs or their associated trust
   frameworks or federations based on their presense in the IANA
   registry.

8.  Acknowledgements

   Bob 'RL' Morgan, Scott Cantor, Lucy Lynch and John Bradley were
   involved in the initial discussions around this idea and contributed
   to the semantics of the registry.  The various versions of the draft
   was socialized in the Kantara Federation Interoperability WG and in
   other parts of the identity community.


9.  Changes

   Note to the RFC editor: This section should be removed before
   publication.

9.1.  since -00

   o  Clarified the security considerations wrt the status of the IANA
      registry.

      used by other protocols than SAML and that this is encouraged.

9.2.  since -01

   o  Allow for registration of short identifiers.

9.3.  since -02

   o  Make the text less explicitly dependent on SAML.
