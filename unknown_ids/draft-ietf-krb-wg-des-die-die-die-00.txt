Abstract

   The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol originally used the
   Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption.  Almost 30 years it
   introduced the first DES standard, the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the DES standard in
   2005, reflecting a long-established consensus that DES no longer
   provides adequate security.  In 2006, it cost less than EUR 10,000 to
   build a machine to brute force DES keys in an average of 8.7 days.
   By 2008, it was possible to buy commercial hardware that breaks DES
   keys in less than a day on average.  DES is long past its sell-by
   date.  Accordingly, this document updates RFC1964, RFC4120, and
   RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos.  Because the
   original Kerberos 5 specification, RFC1510 (obsoleted by RFC 4120),
   supports only DES, this document also reclassifies RFC1510 as
   Historic.

2.  Introduction

   The original specification of the Kerberos 5 network authentication
   protocol [RFC1510] supports only the Data Encryption Standard (DES)
   for encryption.  For many years, cryptographic community has regarded
   DES as providing inadequate security.  This document reclassifies
   [RFC1510] as Historic, and updates current Kerberos-related
   specifications [RFC1964], [RFC4120], and [RFC4121] to deprecate the
   use of DES in Kerberos.

3.  Affected specifications

   The initial IETF specification of the Kerberos 5 network
   authentication protocol [RFC1510] supports only the Data Encryption
   Standard (DES) for encryption.  [RFC4120] updates the Kerberos
   specification to include additional cryptographic algorithms.
   [RFC3961] describes the Kerberos cryptographic system and includes
   support for Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption types.

   DES no longer provides adequate cryptographic protection.  This
   document updates [RFC1964], [RFC4120], and [RFC4121] to deprecate the
   use of DES in Kerberos.  Because the version of Kerberos specified in
   [RFC1510] supports only DES, and [RFC4120] supersedes it, this
   document reclassifies [RFC1510] as Historic.

   The specification of the Kerberos Generic Security Services
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanism [RFC1964] and
   its updated version [RFC4121] define checksum and encryption
   mechanisms based on DES.  With the existence of newer encryption
   types for Kerberos GSS-API defined in [RFC4121], Microsoft's ARCFOUR-
   HMAC based GSS-API mechanism, and MIT's DES3, there is no need to
   support the old DES based integrity (SGN) and confidentiality (SEAL)
   types.

4.  DES insecurity

   The insecurity of DES has been evident for many years.  The National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially withdrew DES
   in 2005 [DES-Withdrawal], and also announced a transition period that
   ended on May 19, 2007 [DES-Transition-Plan].  The IETF has also
   published its position in [RFC4772], in which the recommendation
   summary is very clear: "don't use DES".

   In 2006, researchers demonstrated the ability to brute force a DES
   key in an average of less than 9 days using less than EUR 10,000
   worth of hardware [Break-DES].  By 2008, a company was offering
   hardware capable of breaking a DES key in less than a day on average
   [DES-1day].  Brute force key searches of DES will only get faster and
   cheaper.  (The aforementioned company markets its device for one-
   click recovery of lost DES keys.)  It is clear that it is well past
   time to retire the use of DES in Kerberos.

5.  Recommendations

   This document removes the following RECOMMENDED types from [RFC4120]:

      Encryption: DES-CBC-MD5(3)

      Checksums: DES-MD5 (8, RSA-MD5-DES from [RFC3961]).

   Kerberos implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT implement the
   single DES encryption types: DES-CBC-CRC(1), DES-CBC-MD4(2), DES-CBC-
   MD5(3).

   Kerberos implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT implement the
   checksum types: CRC32(1), RSA-MD4(2), RSA-MD4-DES(3), DES-MAC(4),
   DES-MAC-K(5), RSA-MD4-MAC-K(6), DES-MD5(7), RSA-MD5-DES(8).

   Note that RSA-MD5 might be used with non-DES encryption types, for
   example, when doing a TGS-REQ with ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5, some clients use
   RSA-MD5 for the checksum that is stored inside the encrypted part of
   the authenticator.  This use of RSA-MD5 is to be considered safe, so
   Kerberos implementations MAY allow this usage when used with legacy
   systems that can't handle newer checksum types.

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement the SGN ALG: DES MAC MD5(0000), MD2.5(0100), DES MAC(0200)
   (updates [RFC1964]).

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementation and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement the SEAL ALG: DES(0000) (updates [RFC1964]).

   The effect of the two last sentences is that this document deprecates
   section 1.2 in [RFC1964].

   This document hereby reclassifies [RFC1510] as Historic.

6.  Other old enctypes

   The following older encryption types and checksum types should not be
   deployed and can be disabled by default by implementations:

8.  Security Considerations

   Removing support for single DES improves security since DES is
   considered to be insecure.

   Kerberos defines some encryption types that are either underspecified
   or that were only allocated a number in the specifications.
   Implementations should make sure that they only implement and enable
   secure encryption types.

   RC4, used in ARCFOUR-HMAC, is considered weak; however, the use in
   Kerberos is vetted and considered secure for now.  The main reason to
   not actively discourage the use of ARCFOUR-HMAC is that it is the
   only encryption type that interoperates with older versions of
   Microsoft Windows once DES is removed.
