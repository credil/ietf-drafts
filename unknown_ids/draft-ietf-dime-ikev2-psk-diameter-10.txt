  Diameter IKEv2 PSK: Pre-Shared Key-based Support for IKEv2 Server to
                      Diameter Server Interaction
               draft-ietf-dime-ikev2-psk-diameter-10.txt

Abstract

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a component
   of the IPsec architecture and is used to perform mutual
   authentication as well as to establish and to maintain IPsec security
   associations (SAs) between the respective parties.  IKEv2 supports
   several different authentication mechanisms, such as the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates, and pre-shared keys.

   Diameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home Agent, as a
   Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been specified.
   However, that specification focused on the usage of EAP and did not
   include support for pre-shared key based authentication available
   with IKEv2.  This document specifies the IKEv2 Server to the Diameter
   server communication when the IKEv2 Peer authenticates using the
   Internet Key Exchange v2 with Pre-Shared Key.

Internet-Draft             Diameter IKEv2 PSK             September 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol [RFC5996] is
   used to mutually authenticate two parities and to establish a
   security association (SA) that can be used to efficiently secure the
   communication between the IKEv2 Peer and Server, for example, using
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and/or Authentication
   Header (AH) [RFC4302].  The IKEv2 protocol allows several different
   mechanisms for authenticating a IKEv2 Peer to be used, such as the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared key.

   From a service provider perspective, it is important to ensure that a
   user is authorized to use the services.  Therefore, the IKEv2 Server
   must verify that the IKEv2 Peer is authorized for the requested
   services possibly with the assistance of the operator's Diameter
   servers.  [RFC5778] defines the home agent as a Diameter client to
   the Diameter server communication when the mobile node authenticates
   using the IKEv2 protocol with the Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP) [RFC3748] or using the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol
   [RFC4285].  This document specifies the IKEv2 Server to the Diameter
   server communication when the IKEv2 Peer authenticates using the
   Internet Key Exchange v2 with Pre-Shared Key.

   Figure 1 depicts the reference architecture for this document.

   IKEv2 Peer and the Home Agent acts as an IKEv2 server.  In this use
   case Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) with pre-shared key based
   initiator authentication is used for the setup of the IPsec SAs.  The
   HA obtains the pre-shared key using the Diameter application
   specified herein to obtain the pre-shared key.

   This document does not assume that the IKEv2 Server has the pre-
   shared key (PSK) with the IKEv2 Peer.  Instead, it assumes that the
   pre-shared key (PSK) which is provided to the IKEv2 Peer, and the PSK
   delivered to the IKEv2 Server by the Diameter Server, are established
   or derived using the same rules.  Furthermore, it assumes that these
   rules are agreed to by the external protocol on a Peer side providing
   the key to the IKEv2 Peer, and on the Diameter Server side providing
   the key to the IKEv2 Server.  This document allows for the PSK to be
   obtained for a specific IKEv2 session and exchanged between IKEv2
   Server and the Home Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
   (HAAA) server.  The protocol provides IKEv2 attributes to allow the
   HAAA to compute a PSK specific key for the session if desired (see
   Section 10).  This is accomplished through the use of a new Diameter
   application specifically designed for performing IKEv2 authorization
   decisions.  This document focuses on the IKEv2 server, as a Diameter
   client, communicating to the Diameter server and specifies the
   Diameter application needed for this communication.  It is left to
   protocols leveraging this Diameter application to specify PSK
   derivation.  For example see [X.S0047] and [X.S0058].  This document
   specifies the default procedure for derivation of the PSK used in
   IKEv2 authentication when protocols leveraging this Diameter
   application do not specify their own derivation procedure.  Selection
   of either default or other PSK derivation procedure is done by the
   external protocol between the Peer side providing the key to the
   IKEv2 Peer, and the Diameter Server, and is outside the scope of this
   document.

4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Support for IKEv2 and Pre-Shared Keys

   When IKEv2 is used with PSK-based initiator authentication, the
   Diameter commands IKEv2-PSK-Request/Answer defined in this document
   are used between IKEv2 server and a Home AAA server (HAAA) to
   authorize the IKEv2 Peer for the services.  Upon receiving the
   IKE_AUTH message from the IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2 Server uses the
   information received in IDi [RFC5996] to identify the IKEv2 Peer and
   the SPI if available to determine the correct PSK for this IKEv2
   Peer.  If there is no PSK found associated with this IKEv2 Peer, the
   IKEv2 Server MUST send an Authorize-Only (Auth-Request-Type set to
   "Authorize-Only") Diameter IKEv2-PSK-Request message to the HAAA to
   obtain the PSK.  If the IDi payload extracted from the IKE_AUTH
   message contains an identity that is meaningful for the Diameter
   infrastructure, such as a Network Access Identifier (NAI), it SHALL
   be used by the IKEv2 Server to populate the User-Name AVP in the
   Diameter message.  Otherwise it is out of scope of this document how
   the IKEv2 server maps the value received in IDi payload to the User-
   Name AVP and whether the User-Name AVP is included in the IKEv2-PSK-
   Request message or not.  The IKEv2 Server SHALL also include in the
   same Diameter message the IKEv2-Nonces AVP with the initiator and
   responder nonces (Ni and Nr) exchanged during initial IKEv2 exchange.
   Finally, the IKEv2 Server SHALL include in the IKEv2-PSK-Request
   message the IKEv2-Identity AVP.  Initiator-Identity AVP SHALL be
   populated with the IDi field extracted from the IKE_AUTH message.  If
   IDr payload was included in the IKE_AUTH message received from the
   IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2 Server SHALL also include Responder-Identity
   AVP populated with the received IDr.

   The IKEv2 Server sends the IKEv2-PSK-Request message to the IKEv2
   Peer's HAAA.  The Diameter message is routed to the correct HAAA as
   per [RFC3588].

   Upon receiving Diameter IKEv2-PSK-Request message from the IKEv2
   Server, the HAAA SHALL use the User-Name AVP (if present) and/or
   Initiator-Identity AVP to retrieve the associated keying material.
   When the default PSK generation procedure specified in this document
   is used, the Peer side that provides the PSK to the IKEv2 Peer, as
   well as the Diameter Server SHALL use the same PSK derivation which
   follows the methodology similar to that specified in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC5295], specifically:

 PSK = KDF(Root Key Material, key label | "\0" | Ni | Nr | IDi | length)


   Where:

Internet-Draft             Diameter IKEv2 PSK             September 2011


   o  KDF is the default key derivation function based on HMAC-SHA-256
      as specified in Section 3.1.2 of [RFC5295].

   o  Root Key Material is the key available to the protocol leveraging
      this Diameter application, e.g., the long term shared secret, or
      the Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) as the result of prior EAP
      authentication etc.  Selection of this value is left up to the
      protocol leveraging this Diameter application.

   o  Key label is set to 'psk4ikev2@ietf.org'.

   o  | denotes concatenation

   o  "\0" is a NULL octet (0x00 in hex)

   o  length is a 2-octet unsigned integer in network byte order

   When applications using this protocol define their own PSK generation
   algorithm it is strongly RECOMMENDED that the nonces Ni and Nr are
   used in the computation.  It is also RECOMMENDED that IDi be used.
   IDr SHOULD NOT be used in the PSK generation algorithm.  Applications
   that want to use IDr in the computation should take into
   consideration that the IDr asserted by the IKEv2 peer may not be the
   same as the IDr returned by the IKEv2 responder.  This mismatch will
   result in different PSKs being generated.  The HAAA returns the PSK
   to the IKEv2 Server using the Key AVP as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-local-keytran].

   Once the IKEv2 Server receives the PSK from the HAAA, the IKEv2
   Server verifies the IKE_AUTH message received from the IKEv2 Peer.
   If the verification of AUTH is successful, the IKEv2 Server sends the
   IKE message back to the IKEv2 Peer.

4.2.  Session Management

   The HAAA may maintain Diameter session state or may be stateless.
   This is indicated by the presence or absence of the Auth-Session-
   State AVP included in the Answer message.  The IKEv2 Server MUST
   support the Authorization Session State Machine defined in [RFC3588].

4.2.1.  Session-Termination-Request/Answer

   In the case where HAAA is maintaining session state, when the IKEv2
   Server terminates the SA it SHALL send a Session-Termination-Request
   (STR) message [RFC3588] to inform the HAAA that the authorized
   session has been terminated.

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the

   HAAA to acknowledge the notification that the session has been
   terminated.

4.2.2.  Abort-Session-Request/Answer

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [RFC3588] is sent by the HAAA
   to the IKEv2 Server to terminate the authorized session.  When the
   IKEv2 Server receives the ASR message, it MUST delete the
   corresponding IKE_SA and all CHILD_SAs set up through it.

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the IKEv2
   Server in response to an ASR message.

   included, it contains the Security Parameter Index (SPI) that HAAA
   SHALL use, in addition to the other parameters (e.g., Initiator-
   Identity), to identify the appropriate PSK.  The IKEv2-PSK-Request
   message MUST include IKEv2-Identity AVP.  The Initiator-Identity AVP
   SHALL contain IDi as received in IKE_AUTH message.  Responder-
   Identity AVP SHALL be included in the IKEv2-PSK-Request message, if
   IDr payload was included in the IKE_AUTH message received from the
   IKEv2 Peer.  If included, Responder-Identity AVP contains the
   received IDr.

5.2.  IKEv2-PSK-Answer (IKEPSKA) Command

   The IKEv2-PSK-Answer (IKEPSKA) message, indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to TBD2 and the 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field,
   is sent by the HAAA to the IKEv2 Server in response to the IKEPSKR
   command.  In this case, the Application-ID field of the Diameter
   Header MUST be set to the Diameter IKE PSK Application ID (value of
   TDB1).

9.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication of this memo as an RFC, IANA is requested to assign
   values as described in the following sections.

9.1.  Command Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate a command code value for the following
   new command from the Command Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].

      Command Code                     | Value
      ---------------------------------+------
      IKEv2-PSK-Request/Answer         | TBD2



9.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new AVPs
   from the AVP Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].


   o  IKEv2-Nonces - TBD4

   o  Ni - TBD5

   o  Nr - TBD6

   o  IKEv2-Identity - TBD7

   o  Initiator-Identity - TBD8

   o  ID-Type - TBD9

   o  Identification-Data - TBD10

   o  Responder-Identity - TBD11


   The AVPs are defined in Section 6.

9.3.  AVP Values

   IANA is requested to create a new value for the Key-Type AVP.  The
   new value TBD3 signifies that IKEv2 PSK is being sent.

   IKE PSK" from the Application Identifier namespace defined in
   [RFC3588].

   Application Identifier         | Value

Internet-Draft             Diameter IKEv2 PSK             September 2011


10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the Diameter Base protocol [RFC3588]
   are applicable to this document (e.g., it is expected that Diameter
   protocol is used with security mechanism and that Diameter messages
   are secured).

   In addition, the assumption is that the IKEv2 Server and the Diameter
   Server where the PSK is generated are in a trusted relationship.
   Hence, the assumption is that there is an appropriate security
   mechanism to protect the communication between these servers.  For
   example the IKEv2 Server and the Diameter server would be deployed in
   the same secure network or would utilize transport layer security as
   specified in [RFC3588].

   The Diameter messages between the IKEv2 Server and the HAAA may be
   transported via one or more AAA brokers or Diameter agents.  In this
   case, the IKEv2 Server to the Diameter server AAA communication is
   hop-by-hop protected, hence relies on the security properties of the
   intermediating AAA inter- connection networks, AAA brokers, and
   Diameter agents.  Furthermore, any agents that process IKEv2-PSK-
   Answer messages can see the contents of the Key AVP.

   To mitigate the threat of exposing long lived PSK, this specification
   expects that the HAAA derives and returns the associated PSK to the
   IKEv2 Server.  Given that PSK derivation is security-critical, for
   the PSK derivation this specification recommends the use of short
   lived secrets, possibly based on a previous network access
   authentication, if such secrets are available.  To ensure key
   freshness and to limit the key scope, this specification strongly
   recommends the use of nonces included in IKEv2-PSK-Request.  The
   specifics of key derivation depend on the security characteristics of
   the system that is leveraging this specification (for example see
   [X.S0047] and [X.S0058]), therefore this specification does not
   define how the Diameter server derives required keys for these
   systems.  For systems and protocols that leverage this Diameter
   application but do not specify the key derivation procedure, this
   document specifies the default key derivation procedure that
   preserves expected security characteristics.
