    <abstract>
      <t>When a Location Information Server receives a request for location information (using the locationRequest message), described in the base HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the source IP address of arriving message as a pointer to the location determination process.  This is sufficient in environments where the location of a Device can be determined based on its IP address.
      </t>

      <t>Two additional use cases are addresses by this document.  In the first, location configuration requires additional or alternative identifiers from the source IP address provided in the request.  In the second, an entity other than the Device requests the location of the Device.
      </t>

      <t>This document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request message to carry Device identifiers.  Privacy and security considerations describe the conditions where requests containing identifiers are permitted.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Protocols for requesting and providing location information require a way for the requestor to specify the location that should be returned.  In a location configuration protocol (LCP), the location being requested is the requestor's location.  This fact can make the problem of identifying the Device simple, since IP datagrams that carry the request already carry an identifier for the Device, namely the source IP address of an incoming request.  Existing LCPs, such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)</xref> and DHCP (<xref target="RFC3825"/>, <xref target="RFC4776"/>) rely on the source IP address or other information present in protocol datagrams to identify a Device.
      </t>

      <t>Aside from the datagrams that form a request, a location information server (LIS) does not necessarily have access to information that could further identify the Device.  In some circumstances, as shown in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/>, additional identification information can be included in a request to identify a Device.
      </t>

      <t>This document extends the HELD protocol to support the inclusion of additional identifiers for the Device in HELD location requests.  An XML schema is defined that provides a structure for including these identifiers in HELD requests.
      </t>

      <t>An important characteristic of this addition is that the HELD protocol with identity extensions implemented is not considered an LCP.  The scope of an LCP is limited to the interaction between a Device and a LIS, and LCPs can guarantee the identity of Devices without additional authorization checks.  Neither of these is true for HELD with identity extensions.  Furthermore, identity extensions allow authorized third-party location recipients (LRs) to make requests that include identifiers to retrieve location information about a particular Device.
      </t>

      <t>The usage of identifiers in HELD obviously introduces a new set of privacy concerns.  In an LCP, the requester can be implicitly authorized to access the requested location information, because it is their own location.  In contrast, a third-party LR must be explicitly authorized when requesting the location of a Device.  Establishing appropriate authorization and other related privacy concerns are discussed in <xref target="privacy"/>.
      </t>

      <section title="Applications">
        <t>The use of additional identifiers in HELD falls into two categories:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Location configuration:">A Device can use these parameters to identify itself to a LIS.   Identification information other than IP might be needed to determine the location of a Device.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Due to the risk that an identifier might be spoofed by a Device, identifiers MUST NOT be used unless specific information is provided for that identifier describing how the identifier is used and what measures are used to prevent spoofing.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          This document provides this information for the network access identifier (NAI) for use in WiMAX networks.  All other identifiers described are solely for use in third-party requests.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Third-party requests:">A third-party location recipient can be granted authorization to make requests for a given Device.  In particular, network services can be permitted to retrieve location for a Device that is unable to acquire location information for itself (see Section 6.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/>).  This allows use of location-dependent applications - particularly essential services like emergency calling - where Devices do not support a location configuration protocol or they are unable to successfully retrieve location information.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          This document does not describe how a third party acquires an identifier for a Device, or how that third-party is authenticated by a LIS.  These issues MUST be resolved before permitting a third-party request.  A pre-arranged contract between the third-party, a Rule Maker and the LIS operator is necessary to use device identifiers in this fashion.  This contract MUST include how the request is authenticated and the set of identifiers (and types of identifiers) that the third-party is authorized to use in requests.
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Note that this is not intended to preclude the definition of mechanisms that replace this requirement with automated means of establishing these constraints.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
       <t>This document uses the term Location Information Server (LIS) and location configuration protocol (LCP) as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch"/>.
      </t>

     <t>The term Device is used specifically as the subject of an LCP, consistent with <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>.  This document also uses the term Target to refer to any entity that might be a subject of the same location information.  Target is used in a more general sense, including the Device, but also any nearby entity, such as the user of a Device.  A Target has a stake in setting authorization policy on the use of location information.  Both Device and Target are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch"/>.
      </t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Device Identity">
      <t>Identifiers are used as the starting point in location determination.  They should not be confused with measurement information (<xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/>).  Measurement information is information about a Device and the time varying details of its network attachment.  Identifiers might be associated with a different Device over time, but the their purpose is to identify the Device, not to describe its environment or network attachment.
      </t>

      <section anchor="suitability" title="Identifier Suitability">
        <t>Use of any identifier MUST only be allowed if it identifies a single Device at a particular time.  In some circumstances, certain of these identifiers are either temporary or could potentially identify multiple devices.  Identifiers that are transient or ambiguous could be exploited by an attacker to either gain information about another device or to coerce the LIS into producing misleading information.
        </t>

        <t>The identifiers described in this section MUST only be used where that identifier is used as the basis for location determination.  Considerations relating to the use of identifiers for a Device requesting its own location are discussed in Section 5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/>; this section discusses use of identifiers for authorized third-party requests.
        </t>

        <t><list style="empty"><t>It is tempting for a LIS implementation to allow alternative identifiers for convenience or some other perceived benefit.  However, care needs to be taken to ensure that the binding between the indicated identifier and the identifier that is used for location determination is unique and not subject to attacks.
        </t></list></t>

        <t>Identifiers can have a different meaning to different entities on a network.  An identifier in one network context might have a completely different meaning in a different context.  Errors in perspective arise in both topology (all network entities have a subjective view of the network) and time (the network changes over time).
        </t>

        <section anchor="subjective" title="Subjective Network Views">
          <t>Subjective views of the network mean that the identifier a requests uses to refer to one physical entity could actually apply to a different physical entity when used in a different network context.  Unless an authorized third-party requester and LIS operate in the same network context, each could have a different subjective view of the meaning of the identifier.
          </t>

          <t>Where subjective views differ, the third-party receives information that is correct only within the network context of the LIS.  The location information provided by the LIS is probably misleading: the requester believes that the information relates to a different entity than it was generated for.
          </t>

          <t>Authorization policy can be affected by a subjective network view if it is applied based on an identifier, or it's application depends on identifiers.  The subjective view presented to the LIS and Rule Maker need to agree for the two entities to understand policy on the same terms.  For instance, it is possible that the LIS could apply the incorrect authorization policy if it selects the policy using a subjective identifier.  Alternatively, it may use the correct policy but apply it incorrectly if subjective identifiers are used.
          </t>

          <t><list style="empty">
            <t>In IP networks, network address translation (NAT) and other forms of address modification create network contexts.  Entities on either side of the point where modification occurs have a different view of the network.  <xref target="RFC1918">Private use addresses</xref> are the most easily recognizable identifiers that have limited scope.
            </t>
          </list></t>

          <t>A LIS can be configured to recognize scenarios where the subjective view of a requester or Rule Maker might not coincide with the view of the LIS.  The LIS can either provide location information that takes the view of the requester into account, or it can reject the request.
          </t>

          <t><list style="empty">
            <t>For instance, a LIS might operate within a network that uses a private address space, with NAT between that network and other networks.  A third-party request that originates in an external network with an IP address from the private address space might not be valid - it could be identifying an entity within another address space.  The LIS can be configured to reject such requests, unless it knows by other means that the request is valid.
            </t>

            <t>In the same example, the requester might include an address from the external space in an attempt to identify a host within the network.  The LIS could use knowledge about how the external address is mapped to a private address, if that mapping is fixed, to determine an appropriate response.
            </t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The residential gateway scenario in Section 3.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps"/> is a particular example of where a subjective view is permitted.  The LIS knowingly provides Devices on the remote side of the residential gateway with location information.  The LIS provides location information with appropriate uncertainty to allow for the fact that the residential gateway serves a small geographical area.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="transient" title="Transient Identifiers">
          <t>Some identifiers are temporary and can, over the course of time, be assigned to different physical entities.  An identifier that is reassigned between the time that a request is formulated by a requester and when the request is received by the LIS causes the LIS to locate a different entity than the requester intended.  The response from the LIS might be accurate, but the request incorrectly associates this information with the wrong subject.
          </t>

          <t>A LIS should be configured with information about any potentially temporary identifiers.  It can use this information to identify when changes have occurred.  A LIS must not provide location information if the identifier it uses might refer to a different Device.  If an identifier might have been reassigned recently, or it is likely to be reassigned, it is not suitable as an identifier.
          </t>

          <t>It's possible that some degree of uncertainty could persist where identifiers are reassigned frequently; the extent to which errors arising from using transient identifiers are tolerated is a matter for local policy.

      <section title="Identifier Format and Protocol Details">
        <t>XML elements are used to express the Device identity.  The <spanx style="verb">target</spanx> element is used as a general container for identity information.

        <t>A LIS that supports this specification echoes the <spanx style="verb">target</spanx> element in a successful HELD response, including the identifiers that were used as the basis for location determination.

        <t>Use of a particular port number can be transient; often significantly more than use of any given IP address.  However, widespread use of network address translation (NAT) means that some Devices cannot be uniquely identified by IP address alone.  An individual Device might be identified by a flow of packets that it generates.  Providing that a LIS has sufficient knowledge of the mappings used by the NAT, an individual target on the remote side of the NAT might be able to be identified uniquely.

          <t>Third-party requests in a WiMAX network always require the inclusion of an NAI.  However, if a LIS receives a request that does not come from an authenticated and authorized third-party requester, it can treat this request as a location configuration request.
          </t>

          <t>After receiving a location request that includes an NAI, the LIS sends a <spanx style="verb">Location-Requestor-Authentication-Protocol</spanx> access request message to the Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.  This request containing a <spanx style="verb">MS-Identity-Assertion</spanx> parameter containing the NAI.
          </t>

          <t>The AAA server consults network policy and if the request is permitted, the response includes the IP address that is currently assigned to the Device.  If this IP address matches the source IP address of the HELD location request, the location request is permitted; otherwise, the request is rejected.
          </t>

          <t>This relies on the same IP address spoofing protections that are required by <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>.  In addition, the request made of the AAA uses the <xref target="RFC3588">Diameter protocol</xref>, and therefore relies on the security of the Diameter exchange.  In order to rely on the access request, the AAA server MUST be authenticated to be a trusted entity for the purpose of providing a link between the NAI and IP address.  The Diameter exchange MUST also be protected from modification.  Some part of these protections can be provided through use of <xref target="RFC4301">IPsec</xref> or <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref>, as mandated in <xref target="RFC3588"/>.

        <t>In a switched Ethernet network, a MAC address is used to identify hosts in any particular local area network (LAN) segment.

        <t>An example request containing a MAC address identifier is shown in <xref target="id-mac"/>.
        </t>

        <t>An intervening router causes the MAC address that is seen by the LIS to be that of the nearest router.  Thus, the LIS must first verify that the identifier is uniquely attributable to the requester if the LIS serving this request wishes to provide location information to the Device using the <xref target="priv-lcp">LCP Policy</xref>.
        </t>

        <t>Validation of the identifier might be done by relying firstly on the return routeability check performed in setting up the TCP connection.  Assuming that the conditions for using return routeability described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/> are met, then the LIS can check that an identifier belongs to the requester by checking that there is a unique binding between the proffered identifier and the IP address.
        </t>

        <t>In order to check that the MAC address provided is correct, the LIS could use information from the LAN segment nearest the device.  The router nearest the Device maintains an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table that contains an entry for the IP address of the Device.  Alternatively, other hosts in the same LAN segment could provide information that independently verifies the claims the Device makes about its identity.
        <list style="empty">
          <t>This introduces an additional step that could be exploited by an attacker, in effect weakening the assurance that the identifier belongs to the requester.  Whether this is acceptable may depend on what measures are in place to prevent these attacks.  It is a matter of local policy whether alternative modes of validation are needed if identity parameters are used in this fashion.

      <section title="Third-Party Request Example">
        <t>In this example, a third party makes a request makes a HELD request, seeking to receive the location of a Device.  The Device is attached to a GSM General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network and is known to the third party request by an MSISDN.  This example request is shown in <xref target="id-msid"/>.
        </t>

        <t>The process for a Mobile Terminated Location Request as described in <xref target="TS.3GPP.23.271"/> might be followed.  This process uses MSISDN or IMSI as input.
        </t>

        <t>Whether this request is authorized depends on the authorization policies that are established in relation to the requester and the Device.  In a GSM network, these policies are stored in the Home Location Register (HLR) and enforced by the processes described in <xref target="TS.3GPP.23.271"/>
        </t>

        <t>These policies require that the third party requester be identified using a particular type of identifier called a Supplementary Services Code (SS-Code).  In order to successfully authenticate a requester, both requester and LIS need to agree on the nature of the authentication process.

    <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>Location configuration protocols can make use of an authorization model known as "LCP policy", which permits only Targets to be the recipients of their own locations.  In effect, an LCP server (that is, the LIS) follows a single rule policy that states that the Target is the only authorized Location Recipient.
      </t>

      <t>The security and privacy considerations of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">the base HELD protocol</xref> are applicable, except as they relate to return routability.
      </t>

      <section anchor="priv-lcp" title="Targets Requesting Their Own Location">
        <t>When a Target uses identity extensions to obtain its own location, HELD can no longer be considered an LCP. The authorization policy that the LIS uses to respond to these requests must be provisioned by one or more Rule Makers.
        </t>

        <t>In the case that the LIS exclusively provides Targets with their own locations, the LIS can still be said to be following the "LCP policy".  In all cases, the <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-arch">Geopriv security and privacy considerations</xref> are applicable.
        </t>

        <t>The spoofing protections provided when using HELD with identity extensions to provide Targets with their own locations differ from the protections inherent in an LCP.  For an LCP, return routability is considered sufficient protection against spoofing.  For a similarly policy to be used, specific measures MUST be defined to protect against spoofing of the alternative identifier.  This document defines this for an NAI when used in WiMAX networks (see <xref target="wimaxlcp"/>), but for no other identifier.
        </t>

        <t>A Rule Maker might require additional verification that the identifier is owned by the requester.  Verification that depends on return routability can only provide weaker assurances than those provided by return routability; therefore, policy might require the use of additional, independent methods of verification.
        </t>

        <t>Care is required where a direct one-to-one relationship between requester and Device identity does not exist.  If identifiers are not identical, the use of HELD identity extensions to provide Targets with their own locations could be exploited by an attacker.
        <list style="empty">
          <t>For example, it is not appropriate to provide Targets with their own locations under these terms where a requester is authenticated by NAI and the supplied Device identity is a MAC address, even if that MAC address is currently registered with the network under the given NAI.  In this case, the requester might be requesting from a different MAC address registered under the same NAI.  The correct way of gaining authorization is to establish a policy that permits this particular request as a third party request.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <section title="Security Considerations for NAI use in WiMAX Networks">
          <t><xref target="wimaxlcp"/> discusses the implications of using an NAI as an identifier for location requests made of a LIS serving a WiMAX network.  Additional security considerations are discussed in <xref target="WiMAX-T33-110-R015v01-B"/>.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Third-Party Requests">
        <t>The LCP policy does not allow requests made by third parties.  If a LIS permits requests from third parties using Device identity, it assumes the rule of a Location Server (LS).  As a Location Server, the LIS MUST explicitly authorize requests according to the policies that are provided by Rule Makers, including the Target.  The LIS MUST also authenticate requesters according to the agree authorization policy.
        </t>

        <t>An organization that provides a LIS that allows third party requests must provide a means for a Rule Maker to specify authorization policies as part of the LIS implementation (e.g, in the form of access control lists).  Authorization must be established before allowing third party requests for the location of any Target.  Until an authorization policy is established, the LIS MUST reject requests by third parties (that is, the default policy is "deny all").
        </t>

        <t>When the LIS is operated by an access network, the relationship between the Target and the LIS can be transient.  As the Target is a potential Rule Maker, this presents a problem.  However, the process of establishing network access usually results in a form of agreement between the Target and the network provider.  This process offers a natural vehicle for establishing location privacy policies.  Establishing authorization policy might be a manual process, an explicit part of the terms of service for the network, or an automated system that accepts formal authorization policies (see <xref target="RFC4745"/>, <xref target="RFC4825"/>).  This document does not mandate any particular mechanism for establishing an authorization policy.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/> describe the use of TLS for server authentication, confidentiality and protection from modification.  These protections apply to both Target requests for their own locations and requests made by third parties.
      </t>

      <t>All HELD requests containing identity MUST be authenticated by the LIS.  How authentication is accomplished and what assurances are desired is a matter for policy.
      </t>

      <t>The base HELD protocol uses return reachability of an IP address implied by the requester being able to successfully complete a TCP handshake.  It is RECOMMENDED that any means of authentication provide at least this degree of assurance.  For requests that include Device identity, the LIS MUST support authentication of TLS clients.
      </t>

      <!-- Note the above blanket statement.  This is true even for deref on a possession model URI - the authentication achieved states that the requester has an authentic URI.  Given that the URI is secret, this should be sufficient. -->

      <section title="Identifier Suitability">
        <t>Transient and ambiguous identifiers can be exploited by malicious requests and are not suitable as a basis for identifying a Device.  <xref target="suitability"/> provides further discussion on this subject.
        </t>

        <t>Identifier transience of can lead to incorrect location information being provided.  An attacker could exploit the use of transient identifiers.  In this attack, the attacker either knows of a re-allocation of that identifier or is able to force the identifier to be re-allocated during the processing of the request.
        </t>

        <t>An attacker could use this to acquire location information for another Device or to coerce the LIS to lie on its behalf if this re-allocation occurs between the time where authorization is granted and location information is granted.
        </t>

        <t>Ambiguous identifiers present a similar problem.  An attacker could legitimately gain authorization to use a particular identifier.  Since an ambiguous identifier potentially refers to multiple Devices, if authorization is granted for one of those Devices, an attacker potentially gains access to location information for all of those Devices.
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-lcp" title="Targets Requesting Their Own Location">
        <t>Requests made by a Device for its own location are covered by the same set of protections offered by HELD.  These requests might be authorized under a policy similar to the "LCP policy" that permits a Target access to location information about itself.
        </t>

        <t>Identity information provided by the Device is private data that might be sensitive.  The Device provides this information in the expectation that it assists the LIS in providing the Device a service.  The LIS MUST NOT use identity information for any other purpose other than serving the request that includes that information.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Third-Party Requests">
        <t>Requests from third parties have the same requirements for server authentication, confidentiality and protection from modification as Target requests for their own locations.  However, because the third-party needs to be authorized, the requester MUST be authenticated by the LIS.  In addition, third-party requests MUST be explicitly authorized by a policy that is established by a Rule Maker.
