Internet-Draft          Virtual IPv6 Connectivity              July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The deployment of IP version 6 is challenging.  Since it requires
   changes to applications, host stacks, and networks end-to-end, IPv6
   deployment involves multiple stakeholders.  These stakeholders are in
   general independent and not coordinated, so a simultaneously
   transition to IPv6 by all stakeholders is practically impossible.  It
   is therefore necessary to enable the stakeholders to deploy IPv6
   independently of each other.  This requires interworking between
   those stakeholders who have already adopted IPv6, and those
   stakeholders who have not yet.

   There are two basic approaches to enable interworking between IP
   versions:

   o  Make IPv6 backwards compatible with IPv4

   o  Make IPv4 forward compatible with IPv6

   Which of the approaches is feasible depends on where the impetus on
   interworking is -- on the side of early IPv6 adopters, or on the side
   of the legacy IPv4 Internet.  This impetus will shift over time.
   Initially, the impetus for interworking will naturally be high on the
   side of early IPv6 adopters.  Services and peers will at that point
   almost exclusively be IPv4-only, so IPv6 adopters will have to make
   sure they can communicate via IPv4.  For the same reason, initial
   incentives to invest in interworking will be very low on the side of
   the legacy IPv4 Internet: Why would the legacy IPv4 Internet want to
   communicate via IPv6 if everything they need is available also via
   IPv4?

   However, as IPv6 deployment progresses, more and more services and
   peers will become IPv6-capable.  The interworking impetus on the side
   of IPv6 adopters will therefore shrink.  At some point, a critical
   mass of IPv6 deployment will have been reached to make it feasible
   for services and peers to be IPv6-only.  And as there are more and
   more IPv6-only services and peers, the impetus for interworking will
   grow on the side of the legacy IPv4 Internet, so that those IPv6-only
   services and peers can be reached.

   Consequently, interworking between IP versions will initially be
   realized foremost through backwards compatibility of IPv6 with IPv4,
   but over time increasinly also through forward compatibilility of
   IPv4 with IPv6.  Due to the immediate need for IPv6 backwards
   compatibility, the Internet Engineering Task Force has made the
   design of suitable techniques a task of high priority.  However,
   techniques for IPv4 forward compatibility are as yet largely
   unexplored.

Internet-Draft          Virtual IPv6 Connectivity              July 2009


   This document proposes Virtual IPv6 Connectivity, a technique to make
   IPv4 forward compatible with IPv6.  Virtual IPv6 Connectivity uses IP
   protocol translators on the border of IPv4-only networks to make
   IPv4-only hosts reachable via an IPv6 address from peers on the
   Internet.  IPv4 addresses of IPv4-only hosts are statically mapped to
   "virtual IPv6 addresses", retrievable by IPv6 peers via the DNS or
   DNSSEC.  IPv6 addresses of peers on the Internet are dynamically
   mapped to "virtual IPv4 addresses", retrievable by IPv4-only hosts
   via DNS proxies or DNSSEC proxies.  The IP protocol translators can
   alternatively be operated by IPv4-only networks directly, or by
   providers on behalf of IPv4-only networks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Conceptual Overview

   To enable hosts in an IPv4-only network to communicate with remote
   IPv6 peers, Virtual IPv6 Connectivity employs four components:

   o  IP protocol translators, placed on border links of the IPv4-only
      network, to translate packets exchanged with remote IPv6 peers.

   o  Virtual IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to represent, respectively, the
      IPv6 addresses of remote peers to local IPv4-only hosts, and the
      IPv4 addresses of local hosts to remote IPv6 peers.

   o  Support in authoritative DNS servers for returning virtual IPv6
      addresses in place of the IPv4 addresses of local IPv4-only hosts
      when responding to queries from remote IPv6-only peers.

   o  Support in recursive DNS servers for returning virtual IPv4
      addresses in place of the IPv6 addresses of remote IPv6-only peers
      when responding to queries from local IPv4-only hosts.

   Figure 1 depicts an IPv4-only network that uses Virtual IPv6
   Connectivity.  The network has an IP protocol translator, denoted
   "xlate" in the figure, on its border link to the IPv6 Internet.  The
   network also has sets of virtual IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, which, in
   this example, are taken from the IPv6 address prefix 2001:DB8::/96
   and from the IPv4 address prefix 10.0.0.0/8, respectively.  The
   virtual IPv6 addresses represent the regular IPv4 addresses of the
   IPv4-only network to remote IPv6-only peers.  The virtual IPv4
   addresses represent the regular IPv6 addresses of remote IPv6-only
   peers to hosts in the IPv4-only network.  Furthermore, the IPv4-only
   network has authoritative and recursive DNS servers that can return,

        Figure 1: Conceptual overview of Virtual IPv6 Connectivity

   Packets exchanged between an IPv4 host and an IPv6 correspondent host
   are always destined to a virtual IP address when initially dispatched
   by the sender.  Virtual IP addresses route to an IP protocol
   translator, which performs three tasks with a received packet:

   o  It maps the IP source and destination addresses in a packet,
      replacing the virtual IP destination address with the represented
      regular IP address, and replacing the regular IP source address
      with the representing virtual IP address.

   o  It uses the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation algorithm [###SIIT] to
      translate the IP header of the packet into an IP header from the
      respective other IP version.  The new IP header uses the IP source
      and destination addresses determined in the foregoing mapping.

   o  It forwards the packet towards the new (regular) IP destination
      address.

   The pair of a virtual IP address and the represented regular IP
   address is called a "mapping".  Mappings are used in IP protocol
   translators and DNS servers to enable the consistent translation of
   packets between IP versions, as well as the retrieval of virtual IP
   addresses.  Mappings between IPv4 addresses and virtual IPv6
   addresses are static.  Each IPv4 address is mapped to a separate
   virtual IPv6 address by appending it to a 96-bit virtual IPv6 address
   prefix.  This enables preprovisioning of the mappings in IP protocol

   translators and authoritative DNS servers.  On the other hand,
   mappings between IPv6 addresses and virtual IPv4 addresses are
   dynamic and on-demand.  This is inevitable because any set of virtual
   IPv4 addresses is smaller than the global set of regular IPv6
   addresses for which mappings are potentially needed.  As a
   consequence, mappings between IPv6 addresses and virtual IPv4
   addresses must be created during the establishment of the
   corresponding communication session.  This process is triggered by a
   recursive DNS server when receiving a query for an IPv6-only peer's
   DNS name from an IPv4-only host.  Mappings between IPv6 addresses and
   virtual IPv4 addresses expire when no longer used by a communication
   session.


3.  Virtual IP Addresses

   For the local hosts in an IPv4-only network to communicate with
   remote IPv6 correspondent hosts, local hosts and remote correspondent
   hosts must be able to reach their respective peer with an IP version
   they support: The local hosts must be able to reach the remote
   correspondent hosts via an IPv4 address, and the remote correspondent
   hosts must be able to reach the local hosts via an IPv6 address.
   Virtual IPv6 Connectivity achieves this reachability across IP
   versions by means of virtual IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, which
   respectively map onto the regular IPv6 addresses of remote
   correspondent hosts and the regular IPv4 addresses of local hosts.

   Virtual IPv6 addresses represent local hosts in an IPv4-only network
   to remote IPv6 correspondent hosts.  They are ordinary, global IPv6
   addresses, which the IPv4-only network obtains either from its
   Internet service provider or from an Internet registry.  Virtual IPv6
   addresses are announced externally in the global routing system, but
   are not used internally within the IPv4-only network.  They map one-
   to-one onto the regular IPv4 addresses in the IPv4-only network,
   i.e., there is one unique virtual IPv6 address for each regular IPv4
   address.  There are no restrictions as to how to realize this one-to-
   one mapping.  A simple, recommended way is to reserve a 96-bit IPv6
   address prefix, and to map each regular IPv4 address to the virtual
   IPv6 address that is defined by attaching the 32 bits of the regular
   IPv4 address to the 96 bits of the reserved 96-bit IPv6 address
   prefix.

   Virtual IPv4 addresses represent remote IPv6 correspondent hosts to
   local hosts in an IPv4-only network.  They are ordinary IPv4
   addresses that map onto the regular IPv6 addresses of the remote
   correspondent hosts.  Virtual IPv4 addresses are announced internally
   in the local routing system of an IPv4-only network, but are not used
   outside the IPv4-only network.  Since virtual IPv4 addresses are used

Internet-Draft          Virtual IPv6 Connectivity              July 2009


   only locally within an IPv4-only network, they can be non-global.
   This makes them re-usable in different IPv4-only networks with
   Virtual IPv6 Connectivity.  As an example, virtual IPv4 addresses
   could be taken from the private net-10 or 192.168.0.0/16 address
   spaces [###RFC1918], or from a new IPv4 address block specifically
   allocated for use in IPv4-only networks with Virtual IPv6
   Connectivity.

   Different than mappings between regular IPv4 addresses and virtual
   IPv6 addresses, mappings between regular IPv6 addresses and virtual
   IPv4 addresses cannot be one-to-one because the set of regular IPv6
   addresses that potentially need to be mapped is larger than any pool
   of virtual IPv4 addresses.  Mappings between regular IPv6 addresses
   and virtual IPv4 addresses may instead change dynamically depending
   on the set of remote IPv6 correspondent hosts that communicate with
   an IPv4-only network.  Mappings between regular IPv6 addresses and
   virtual IPv4 addresses are therefore created in an on-demand manner,
   and they have a lifetime after which they may be replaced.

   In the example of Figure 1, the IPv4-only network has obtained the
   96-bit IPv6 address prefix 2001:DB8::/96 for virtual IPv6 addresses,
   so any IPv4 address a.b.c.d from the IPv4-only network can be mapped
   one-to-one to a virtual IPv6 address 2001:DB8::a.b.c.d.  The IPv4-
   only network furthermore uses the private net-10 address space,
   10.0.0.0/8, for virtual IPv4 addresses.  So for any remote IPv6
   correspondent host that communicates with a local host in the IPv4-
   only network, a virtual IPv4 address is allocated from the 8-bit IPv4
   address prefix 10.0.0.0/8, and is temporarily mapped to the remote
   correspondent host's regular IPv6 address.


4.  IP Protocol Translation

   In addition to the mapping between regular IP addresses from one IP
   version and virtual IP addresses from the respective other IP
   version, packets exchanged between the local hosts in an IPv4-only
   network and remote IPv6 correspondent hosts must be converted from
   IPv4 to IPv6 and vice versa on the border between the IPv4-only
   network and the IPv6 Internet.  For this purpose, IPv4-only networks
   with Virtual IPv6 Connectivity deploy IP protocol translators on each
   border link that shall be enabled for communications with remote IPv6
   correspondent host.  An IP protocol translator is a router with the
   extra capabilities to map between regular and virtual IP addresses,
   and to convert packets between IPv4 and IPv6 using the appropriate
   mapping.  Figure 1 illustrates an IPv4-only network with one border
   link, which is endowed with an IP protocol translator to achieve
   Virtual IPv6 connectivity for the IPv4-only network.

Internet-Draft          Virtual IPv6 Connectivity              July 2009


   Since in general not all packets traversing a border link need to be
   translated between IPv4 and IPv6, IP protocol translators must have a
   means to distinguish packets that require translation from packets
   that can be forwarded without modification.  IP protocol translators
   perform this differentiation based on the packets' IP destination
   address: Packets destined to a regular IP address do not require
   translation, whereas packets destined to a virtual IP address do.
   This rule is independent of whether packets originate within and
   leave the IPv4-only network, or whether the packets originate outside
   and enter the IPv4-only network.  For packets that are destined to a
   regular IP address, an IP protocol translator behaves as an ordinary
   router.  For packets that are destined to a virtual IP address, the
   IP protocol translator performs three tasks:

   o  It maps the IP source and destination addresses in a packet,
      replacing the virtual IP destination address with the represented
      regular IP address, and replacing the regular IP source address
      with the representing virtual IP address.

   o  It uses the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm [SIIT] to
      translate the IP header of the packet into an IP header from the
      respective other IP version.  The new IP header uses the IP source
      and destination addresses determined in the foregoing mapping.

   o  It forwards the packet towards the new (regular) IP destination
      address.

   ### DESCRIBE WHEN TRANSLATOR CREATES MAPPING? ###

   To ensure that packets pass through an IP protocol translator if
   exchanged between a host in an IPv4-only network and a remote IPv6
   correspondent host, the routes towards virtual IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses must lead to an IP protocol translator.  Routes to virtual
   IPv4 addresses must be available within the IPv4-only network; they
   lead to the interface of an IP protocol translator that faces the
   IPv4-only network.  Routes to virtual IPv6 addresses must be
   available in the Internet; they lead to the Internet-facing interface
   of an IP protocol translator.  Thus, when a remote IPv6 correspondent
   host sends a packet to the virtual IPv6 address of a local host in
   the IPv4-only network, the packet routes to an IP protocol
   translator, which translates the packet's virtual IPv6 destination
   address into the mapped regular IPv4 destination address, and the
   packet's regular IPv6 source address into a mapped virtual IPv4
   source address.  Vice versa, when the local host in the IPv4-only
   network sends a packet to a remote IPv6 correspondent host, an IP
   protocol translator translates the packet's regular IPv4 source
   address into the mapped virtual IPv6 source address, and the packet's
   virtual IPv4 destination address into the mapped regular IPv6

   destination address.  Both local host and remote correspondent host
   therefore use only their respective IP version; the peer's regular IP
   address from the other IP version is transparent to them.

   There are different means to provision routes to virtual IP
   addresses.  One is through dynamic route announcements by IP protocol
   translators.  IP protocol translators then announce routes towards
   virtual IPv6 addresses on their interfaces towards the IPv6 Internet,
   and routes towards virtual IPv4 addresses on their interfaces towards
   the IPv4-only network.  Static configuration is an alternative for
   part of the routes.  Routes to virtual IPv4 addresses can be
   statically configured in routers of the IPv4-only network.  Routes to
   virtual IPv6 addresses can be statically configured between the IPv4-
   only network and its provider, if the IP protocol translators are
   located on the side of the IP-only network.  In the latter case, it
   is the IPv4-only network's provider that dynamically announces a
   route to virtual IPv6 addresses towards the Internet.

   Routes to virtual IP addresses may be aggregated with routes to other
   IP addresses.  For example, the route to virtual IPv4 addresses
   within an IPv4-only network may be a default route.

   Figure 2 illustrates the the case where routes to virtual IP
   addresses are dynamically announced, using the IPv4-only network from
   Figure 1.

                             IPv6 address prefix  2001:DB8::/96

                   announces route to virtual
                 IPv4 address prefix 10.0.0.0/8


           Figure 2: Route announcement for virtual IP addresses

   Since the explicit routes towards virtual IP addresses ensure that
   packets are routed via an IP protocol translator if they require
   translation between IPv4 and IPv6, IPv4-only networks with Virtual
   IPv6 Connectivity may deploy IP protocol translators on only some,

   but not all of their border links.  This can reduce the expenses for
   deployment and operation of Virtual IPv6 Connectivity.

   Since the communication between a host in an IPv4-only network and a
   remote IPv6 correspondent host would break if the mapping between
   either host's regular and virtual IP addresses changed throughout the
   course of the communication, IP protocol translators must ensure that
   mappings are stable for the duration of the communications in which
   they are used.  This is trivial for the mappings between regular IPv4
   addresses and virtual IPv6 addresses because these mappings are one-
   to-one and therefore constant.  However, as one-to-one mappings are
   not possible between the large set of regular IPv6 addresses and the
   necessarily smaller set of virtual IPv4 addresses, IP protocol
   translators need state to ensure that these mappings remain constant
   during the communications in which they are used.  An IP protocol
   translator establishes such state in either of two ways, depending on
   which way a communication is established:

   o  For communications that are initiated by a local host in an IPv4-
      only network, mapping state is created at the time the local host
      retrieves the remote IPv6 correspondent host's virtual IPv4
      address via the DNS.  This ensures that the IP protocol translator
      can map the virtual IPv4 address in the first packet that the
      local host sends to the remote correspondent host.  Mapping state
      creation is in this case initiated by a recursive DNS name server
      from the IPv4-only network.  This will be explained further in
      Section 5.

   o  For communications that are initiated by a remote IPv6
      correspondent host, the creation of mapping state is postponed to
      the time the IP protocol translator receives the first packet that
      the remote correspondent host sends to the local host in the IPv4-
      only network.  It is then the IP protocol translator which
      initiates mapping state creation.  Postponing the creation of
      mapping state is possible in this case because the remote
      correspondent host does not use the virtual IPv4 address for which
      mapping state is created.  The postponement then has the advantage
      that both the creation of mapping state as well as the allocation
      of a virtual IPv4 address happens only when there is actually a
      communication using it.

   The involvement of both IP protocol translators and recursive DNS
   name servers in the creation of mapping state and in the allocation
   of virtual IPv4 addresses calls for coordination between IP protocol
   translators and recursive DNS name servers: IP protocol translators
   must have relevant mapping state even if the creation of the state
   was initiated by a recursive DNS name server; and simultaneous
   allocation of a given virtual IPv4 address by both an IP protocol

   translator and a recursive DNS name server must be avoided.  This
   document assumes that sufficient coordination is in place between IP
   protocol translators and recursive DNS name servers.  IP protocol
   translators and recursive DNS name servers may be co-located to
   simplify their coordination, or they may coordinate by means of a
   protocol specified outside of this document.  It is recommended that
   the maintenance of virtual IPv4 addresses is with the IP protocol
   translator to which they route.  This accelerates packet forwarding
   when the creation of mapping state is inititated by an IP protocol
   translator, and it hence accounts for the commonly stricter delay
   constraints on packet forwarding in routers compared to those on DNS
   lookups.

   network uses Virtual IPv6 Connectivity, so the packets traverse an IP
   protocol translator.  Continuing from previous examples, virtual IPv6
   addresses are taken from the IPv6 address prefix 2001::DB8:ABC::/96,
   and virtual IPv4 addresses are taken from the private net-10 address
   space, 10.0.0.0/8.  The local host's regular IPv4 address, a.b.c.d,
   maps to the virtual IPv6 address 2001:DB8:ABC::a.b.c.d.  This mapping
   is constant.  The remote correspondent host's regular IPv6 address,
   2001:DB8:BCD::X:Y:Z, maps to the virtual IPv4 address 10.u.v.w.  This
   mapping is temporary and created in on-demand manner.  The dynamic
   state for the mapping between the regular IPv6 address 2001:DB8:BCD::
   X:Y:Z and the virtual IPv4 address 10.u.v.w is created when the first
   packet in the communication reaches the IP protocol translator.  Once
   the state is created, subsequent packets from the same communication
   can be translated from IPv6 to IPv4 and vice versa, as shown in the
   figure.


5.  Discovery of Virtual IP Addresses

   Virtual IPv6 Connectivity requires that the initiator of a new
   communication obtains a virtual IP address for its peer: An IPv6
   correspondent host intending to reach an IPv4 host must obtain a
   virtual IPv6 address for the IPv4 host; an IPv4 host intending to
   reach an IPv6 correspondent host must obtain a virtual IPv4 address
   for the IPv6 correspondent host.  To support the discovery of virtual
   IP addresses, Virtual IPv6 Connectivity makes virtual IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses available via the DNS.  This section explains the
   configuration and operational extensions for recursive and
   authoritative DNS name servers in an IPv4-only network that are
   necessary for this.

5.1.  Discovery of Virtual IPv6 Addresses

   For an IPv6 correspondent host to obtain via the DNS the virtual IPv6
   addresses of an IPv4 host in an IPv4-only network with Virtual IPv6
   Connectivity, the authoritative DNS name servers of the IPv4-only
   network must be configured with AAAA records for the IPv4 host's
   virtual IPv6 addresses.  Since the virtual IPv6 address corresponding
   to each IPv4 address is well defined, authoritative DNS servers can
   automatically generate an AAAA record for each A record they
   maintain.  Thus, whenever a host in the IPv4-only network has an IPv4
   address in the DNS, a virtual IPv6 address for this host is
   retrievable via the DNS as well.  The retrieval of virtual IPv6
   addresses via DNS hence does not differ from the retrieval of regular
   IP addresses.

           Figure 4: Discovery of virtual IPv6 addresses via DNS

   Figure 4 shows the resolution of an IPv4 host's name into a virtual
   IPv6 address.  In this example, the IPv4 host's name is
   "host.v4.net".  This resolves into the regular IPv4 address a.b.c.d,
   which in turn maps to the virtual IPv6 address 2001:DB8:ABC::a.b.c.d.
   The message exchange in the figure begins where the IPv6
   correspondent host queries an authoritative DNS name server from the
   IPv4-only network for a resource record of type AAAA associated with
   host name "host.v4.net".  The authoritative DNS name server responds
   with a DNS reply that contains a type-AAAA resource record with the
   virtual IPv6 address 2001:DB8:ABC::a.b.c.d.

5.2.  Discovery of Virtual IPv4 Addresses

   IPv4 hosts in an IPv4-only network with Virtual IPv6 Connectivity
   must be able to obtain a virtual IPv4 address when resolving the host
   name of a remote IPv6 correspondent host via DNS.  Virtual IPv4
   addresses are provisioned by a recursive DNS name server in the IPv4-
   only network when a local IPv4 host queries for an IPv4 address
   associated with an IPv6 correspondent host's name.  The recursive DNS
   name server then retrieves resource records of type AAAA associated
   with the correspondent host's name, maps the regular IPv6 addresses
   from those resource records onto virtual IPv4 addresses, and returns
   the virtual IPv4 addresses in resource records of type A to the
   requesting IPv4 host.

   Different than virtual IPv6 addresses, virtual IPv4 addresses cannot
   be provisioned directly by the DNS name server that is authoritative
   for the IPv6 correspondent host.  Since virtual IPv4 addresses are
   mapped to regular IPv6 addresses in dynamic manner, a DNS name server
   handing out virtual IPv4 addresses must necessarily coordinate with
   the entity in the IPv4-only network that maintains the virtual IPv4
   addresses.  Such coordination is infeasible for a correspondent
   host's authoritative DNS name server, since this is in general under
   a different administration than the IPv4-only network.

Internet-Draft          Virtual IPv6 Connectivity              July 2009


   The operation of a recursive DNS name server in an IPv4-only network
   with Virtual IPv6 Connectivity more specifically proceeds as follows:

   o  Upon receiving a DNS query from a local IPv4 host for resource
      records of type A associated with a correspondent host's name, the
      recursive DNS name server first attempts to retrieve regular IPv4
      addresses of the correspondent host.  It thus seeks to directly
      obtain the requested resource records of type A. This is the
      standard operation of a recursive DNS name server.

   o  If the recursive DNS name server receives a DNS reply with a
      resource record of type A, it returns the DNS reply unchanged to
      the resolving IPv4 host.  The correspondent host in this case has
      a regular IPv4 address, and it is not necessary to allocate a
      virtual IPv4 address for the correspondent host.

   o  If the recursive DNS name server fails to receive a DNS reply with
      a resource record of type A, the correspondent host cannot be
      reached at a regular IPv4 address.  The recursive DNS name server
      in this case attempts to retrieve resource records of type AAAA
      associated with the correspondent host's name.

   o  If the recursive DNS name server receives a DNS reply with a
      resource record of type AAAA, the correspondent host can be
      reached at one or more regular IPv6 addresses.  These need to be
      presented to the resolving IPv4 host in form of virtual IPv4
      addresses.  The recursive DNS name server maps each of the
      correspondent host's regular IPv6 addresses onto a separate
      virtual IPv4 address in coordination with the IP protocol
      translator to which these virtual IPv4 addresses route.  The
      recursive DNS name server then synthesizes a DNS reply with one
      resource record of type A for each virtual IPv4 address, and
      returns this DNS reply to the resolving IPv4 host.

   o  If the recursive DNS name server fails to receive a DNS reply with
      resource records of either type A or type AAAA, it returns an
      error notification to the resolving IPv4 host.  The correspondent
      host is in this case unreachable from the IPv4 host.

   Figure 5 illustrates the operation of a recursive DNS name server in
   an IPv4-only network with Virtual IPv6 Connectivity.  In the figure,
   an IPv4 host on the left requests a recursive DNS name server in the
   middle to resolve an IPv6 correspondent host's name into an IPv4
   address.  The name of the correspondent host is "host.v6.net" in this
   case, and this is associated with a single resource record of type
   AAAA for IPv6 address 2001:DB8:BCD::X:Y:Z. The resolving IPv4 host
   initiates the procedure with a DNS query to the recursive DNS name
   server, requesting resource records of type A associated with

   "host.v6.net".  The DNS query is not for resource records of type
   AAAA since only IPv4 addresses are of use for the IPv4 host.  The
   recursive DNS name server first processes the DNS query unchanged, so
   it tries to retrieve resource records of type A from the DNS name
   server that is authoritative for the correspondent host, as
   represented on the right of Figure 5.  This fails because the
   correspondent host does not have an IPv4 address.  In a second
   attempt, the recursive DNS name server queries for resource records
   of type AAAA.  This is successful; the recursive DNS name server
   receives a resource record with IPv6 address 2001:DB8:BCD::X:Y:Z. The
   recursive DNS name server then coordinates with an IP protocol
   translator in the IPv4-only network in order to create a mapping
   between the regular IPv6 address 2001:DB8:BCD::X:Y:Z and a virtual
   IPv4 address that routes to this IP protocol translator.  In the
   example of Figure 5, this virtual IPv4 address is 10.u.v.w.  The
   recursive DNS name server finally returns a DNS reply to the
   resolving IPv4 host that contains a resource record of type A
   containing the virtual IPv4 address 10.u.v.w.

6.  Multi-Homing Support

   A technique for networks to increase the performance and reliability
   of their Internet connectivity is to establish multiple border links
   to either the same or different providers.  This technique is called
   "multi-homing".  To combine multi-homing with Virtual IPv6
   Connectivity, an IPv4-only network must ensure that packets exchanged
   between local IPv4 hosts and remote IPv6 correspondent hosts pass
   through an IP protocol translator that is aware of the mappings for
   the virtual IP addresses used in the packets.  This can be achieved
   in one of the following two ways:

Internet-Draft          Virtual IPv6 Connectivity              July 2009


   o  Shared virtual IP addresses -- A route to a virtual IPv4 or IPv6
      address originates at all IP protocol translators, and all IP
      protocol translators can handle the mapping for all virtual IP
      addresses.  This requires synchronization of mapping state across
      IP protocol translators.

   o  Unshared virtual IP addresses -- A route to each virtual IPv4 or
      IPv6 address originates at exactly one IP protocol translator, and
      only that IP protocol translator can handle the mapping for the
      virtual IP address.  It is then sufficient to maintain mapping
      state for a given virtual IPv4 address in only one IP protocol
      translator.

   Sharing virtual IP addresses across multiple IP protocol translators
   provides a basis for automated fail-over and dynamic load balancing
   between border links.  Fail-over from a failing IP protocol
   translator to a backup happens automatically due to the redundancy of
   routes for a given virtual IP address.  Dynamic load balancing can be
   achieved if the routes to virtual IP addresses are dynamically
   announced.  Virtual IP addresses can then be dynamically divided
   across available IP protocol translators.  On the other hand, shared
   virtual IP addresses require IP protocol translators to map the
   complete set of virtual IP addresses in a consistent manner.  This
   implies two costs: First, it involves more mapping state for each IP
   protocol translator, since mappings must be stored even when unused.
   Second, it necessitates synchronization between IP protocol
   translators to ensure mapping consistency.  Whereas the mapping
   consistency for virtual IPv6 addresses can be guaranteed by pre-
   configuration due to the staticness of these mappings, mappings for
   virtual IPv4 addresses are dynamic and must hence be synchronized
   across IP protocol translators.

   Synchronization of mapping state for virtual IPv4 addresses may be
   proactive or on-demand.  Proactive synchronization ensures that IP
   protocol translators have a consistent view of all mappings at any
   time.  This requires immediate mapping updates whenever a new mapping
   is created.  On-demand synchronization enables IP protocol
   translators to retrieve any missing mapping they may need to process
   a packet.  The mappings of virtual IPv4 addresses may then be
   centrally maintained in a single database that IP protocol
   translators can query when needed.

   Unshared virtual IP addresses can be used without synchronization
   between IP protocol translators.  It is instead sufficient to ensure
   that the virtual IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that are used in the
   mappings for a particular communication belong to partitions from the
   same IP protocol translator.  The disjoint route announcements of the
   IP protocol translators then ensure that packets exchanged between

Internet-Draft          Virtual IPv6 Connectivity              July 2009


   IPv4 and IPv6 hosts always route to the IP protocol translator that
   can map the IP addresses in the packets.  A disadvantage of
   partitioned virtual IP addresses is that active communications cannot
   be switched to a different IP protocol translator for the purpose of
   fail-over or load balancing because they are bound to a route via a
   particular IP protocol translator.

   Although active communications cannot be switched between IP protocol
   translators, communications that are newly established should be able
   to go via any IP protocol translator of an IPv4-only network.  The
   partitioning of virtual IPv4 addresses does not prevent this: Since
   the mappings for virtual IPv4 addresses are dynamically created, they
   can be created with a virtual IPv4 address that routes to a preferred
   IP protocol translator.  However, the mappings for virtual IPv6
   addresses cannot reflect a current preference for a specific IP
   protocol translator because those mappings are constant.  So to
   enable the establishment of a new communication via any IP protocol
   translator, each regular IPv4 address of a host within the IPv4-only
   network must be mapped to multiple virtual IPv6 addresses, one for
   each IP protocol translator.

   The decision of whether to use shared vs. partitioned virtual IP
   addresses may have an impact on whether a multi-homed IPv4 network
   can use virtual IPv6 addresses that have been allocated to its
   provider: If the border links of the multi-homed IPv4 network connect
   to different providers, virtual IPv6 addresses must be provider-
   independent in order to be shared across IP protocol translators.
   This may cause additional load for the global routing system because
   routes towards the virtual IPv6 addresses could not be announced in
   aggregated manner.  It is therefore recommended that multi-homed IPv4
   networks with border links to multiple providers use virtual IPv6
