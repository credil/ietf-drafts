Abstract

   To mobility scenario, multicast service is a valuable feature to
   those mobile customers.  We need to consider how to integrate current
   multicast service in PMIPv6 domain.  This draft will introduce this
   kind of solution about proxy mobile multicast.  It explains the
   system consideration about how to provide the proxy mobile multicast
   system.

2.  Introduction

   Multicast is a very important fundamental service.  It can be applied
   to support many different applications, such as IPTV,MBMS etc.
   Meanwhile, Proxy mobile IP is a technology used to be provided for
   the hosts that don't need MIP stack installed to make mobility
   management.  So we need to support multicast service for hosts using
   the proxy mobile IP protocol.  Such as these requirements are
   described in [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement].  And in this
   draft, we will continue to introduce how to meet those requirements
   and make PMIPv6 supply multicast.

3.  Conventions & Terminology

   Broadcast Services: It may be subscription based and the system
   should support means to measuring subscriber usage for billing
   purposed.

   Dynamic Multicast Service: It is an kind of multicast service in
   which the mobile node needs to manage the multicast group it receives
   by itself.  In this case, the MAG or LMA keeps track of subscribers
   using the service, the service is initiated by users's request and is
   terminated by the request of the mobile node or when no user is using
   the service.

   Static Multicast Service: It is an kind of multicast service in which
   the transmission of content does not dynamically change based on the
   subscriber usage and the network may or may not be aware of
   subcribers' using the service at a given time.

   Mobile Node: It is the ultimate terminal receives the multicast
   service provided by network.  But it can run the MLDv2[RFC3810] to
   communicate with network or managed by network directly.

   LMA: It is the standard entity defined as [RFC5213].

4.  Overview

   To proxy mobile multicast protocol, we should reuse the existing
   mature protocols related to pmip and multicast as more as we can.
   And we shall keep the requirements of the mobile node as simple as we
   can.  So this draft keeps consistent with PMIPv6[RFC5213].  The MAG
   can represent the MN to establish and maintain the multicast service
   based on existing info provided by pre-configured, policy store,
   context transfer or even MN's request.  And the multicast service can
   be terminated by MN, the MAG or the source of multicast service
   itself.

4.1.  Initiation of proxy mobile multicast service

   The mobile multicast service in PMIPv6[RFC5213] domain can be
   initiated by either network or the mobile node.  When it is initiated
   by the mobile node, the MN will need to run MLDv2[RFC3810] with the
   MAG to triggered the MAG to start to establish the multicast service.
   In another case, from those profiles or some pre-configured
   materials, the MAG can just start the multicast service representing
   the Mobile node in the absense of MLDv2[RFC3810] sent from the Mobile
   node.  But be noted that, even in this case, the mobile node still
   can ask for joining some multicast groups, and the MAG should deal
   with it correctly.

4.1.1.  Triggered from the network

4.1.1.1.  In the absence of the MLDv2

   In some multicast architectures, the MAG may initiate multicast
   subscription.  When this happens, the MAG initiates multicast
   subscription and MN sends the MLDv2[RFC3810] message to avoid the
   packet to be filtered by the OS; but those MLDv2[RFC3810] message is
   not sent to the network.  And if implementation supports, MN can also
   don't send MLDv2[RFC3810] out to ask for joining those related
   multicast groups.

   When the MN just attaches to a MAG, the MAG gets the MN's profile and
   finds some pre-configured multicast services which need to be
   established, then it will request the LMA to provide the respective
   service.  At this time, the methods which are used to communicate the
   LMA with the MAG are either PMIP signals or MLDv2[RFC3810] report
   messages etc.  The LMA will check those requests and make the
   decision based on its acknowledges about it.  The process is as the
   following:

   1.  The Mobile node attachs to the network.

   2.  The attachment of MN triggers the MAG to make network entry
       progress for the MN. the MAG can contact with policy store to do
       authentication and authorization for this MN as description in
       PMIPv6[RFC5213].

   3.  Policy store returns back with those related profiles for this MN
       to the MAG.

   4.  Based on the profile, the MAG decides if it necessary to do PMIP
       Registration and join in some multicast groups specified by the
       profile.

   5.  The MAG sends PMIPv6[RFC5213] Binding Updates and/or multicast
       message (For join some multicast groups) to the LMA.  Here the

       multicast message can be integrated with PMIPv6[RFC5213] Binding
       Update message, or also MLDv2[RFC3810] report message etc.

   6.  After receiving PBU, the LMA will do as described in RFC5312 and
       necessary authentication and authorization for the multicast
       service of that MN.

   7.  After that, it returns the result of PMIPv6[RFC5213] registration
       and multicast subscription.  It veries depending on the specific
       protocol used by the messages.

   8.  The MAG adds new multicast group or forwards related traffics to
       the MN.

   9.  The multicast traffics can be forwarded to the MN.

   Notes: If the requested multicast resource can't be assigned or need
   to be denied, the LMA will inform the MAG via PBA (if PBU is used to
   indicate multicast service), or others.

   In addition, when the local routing for multicast is enabled, the MAG
   should send multicast subscription directly to its near multicast
   router but not the LMA.  And the reverse multicast traffics can be
   received by the MAG directly.

   In this case, the MAG plays as a MLD proxy[RFC4605] or MLDv2[RFC3810]
   listener if no any MLDv2[RFC3810] messages need to be run between the
   MAG and the mobile node.

   Here, we don't request the mobile node to send any MLDv2[RFC3810]
   messages, but if the mobile node would like to send them, the MAG
   that in MLDv2[RFC3810] proxy/router mode should process them
   normally, and combine them with the profile got from policy store to
   make final decision about such as subscription, joining, leaving etc.

4.1.1.2.  With the MLDv2

   Except the above progress, the mobile multicast service can also be
   initiated from network with MLDv2[RFC3810] protocol running between
   the MAG and mobile node.  In this case, the MAG retrieves the
   multicast services from profile store after a mobile node attach to
   the PMIPv6[RFC5213] domain.  And then if it finds some multicast
   services need to be initiated or in the later , after triggered by
   the LMA, it can just send the MLDv2[RFC3810] query message to ask if
   the mobile node would like to receive some multicast services.  The
   message flow is as the following:

   Figure 3: mobile node-Initiated multicast service establish progress

   If the mobile node knows some multicast groups should be joined, it
   will send the MLDv2[RFC3810] report to the MAG about those target
   multicast groups which it wants to join in.

   In addition, if the mobile node receives the MLDv2[RFC3810] query
   from the MAG, it will also make response by sending the
   MLDv2[RFC3810] report about those multicast groups which it wants to
   get.

   After receiving MLDv2[RFC3810] report which is sent from MN, the MAG
   will inform the LMA/Multicast router.  And before this, the MAG will
   do some related authorization or authentication to check the request.

   While the MAG don't inform the LMA/Multicast router about every
   request from MNs, it just inform the LMA about those the ones which
   are the first comers to some one multicast groups.

   But, for performance consideration, the method of context transfer is
   expected to provide necessary multicast information during handover
   progress.  And if it is necessary, a 3-rd party policy store is
   required to be used to provide necessary information no matter
   whether context transfer will be used or not.

4.3.  Termination of proxy mobile multicast service

4.3.1.  Terminated from network

   When it is the time to get to the end of some on-going multicast
   services or no any mobile node are receiving it, or for some other
   reasons, the MAG can decide to terminate those multicast services no
   matter whether the multicast source works or not.  On this occasion,
   the MAG will inform the LMA/multicast router about this event.

4.3.2.  Terminated by mobile node

   The Mobile Node sends MLDv2[RFC3810] done message to the MAG and
   inform the MAG that it will never receive them again.  Upon receipt
   this information the MAG will do necessary verification for

   authorization or authentication, then stop sending those multicast
   services to MN again.  Accordingly, if no one receiver of a/some
   multicast service under the MAG, it can inform the LMA about this
   event.

5.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

   For the MAG, whether the MN will run MLDv2[RFC3810] protocol or not
   is all right.  The MAG should have the capability to interact with
   the MN via the MLDv2[RFC3810] messages.  And there is no need to ask
   the MN to send the MLDv2[RFC3810] message to initiate or stop a
   multicast service.  The MAG can get related multicast information of
   the MN from policy stores etc., to initiate or terminate a multicast
   service.

   Meanwhile, the MAG can disable all timers listening to MLDv2[RFC3810]
   query sent to the MN.  As to the problem when the multicast should be
   ended, it depends on related network policy and MN's interest.  And
   the termination of multicast can be triggered by both of network and
   MN.

5.1.  Operated as the MLDv2 Proxy

   For route optimization reason, the MAG should have the ability to
   join a Multicast group without the bi-direction tunnel between the
   MAG and LMA.  This can be based on a pre-configured configuration or
   MN's profile or a interaction between the MAG and LMA.  To reduce the
   heavy load to implement the multicast router on a MAG, one
   MLDv2[RFC3810] listener is enough to that MAG.

5.2.  Operated as the MLDv2 Router

   For route optimization reason, the MAG should have the ability to
   join a Multicast group without the bi-direction tunnel between the
   MAG and LMA.  This can be based on a pre-configured configuration or
   MN's profile or an interaction between the MAG and LMA.  To reduce
   the heavy load to implement the multicast router on a MAG, one MLDv2
   listener is enough to that MAG.

5.3.  Operated as the MLDv2 listener

   If network decides that MAG doesn't deal with MLDv2[RFC3810] protocol
   in the interface to the mobile node, the MAG can just be operated as
   a MLDv2[RFC3810] listener.  The MAG will collect those multicast
   related information about those mobile nodes under it, and base on
   the policies defined by network to make mobility multicast management
   for the mobile node.  The protocol between the MAG and upper level
   multicast entity should be MLDv2[RFC3810] protocol.  And that
   multicast entity can be either the LMA or a standalone multicast
   router.  If the LMA become the multicast entity that MAG must face to
   communicate with, then the PMIPv6[RFC5213] protocol can also be used
   to achieve the goal.

6.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

6.1.  Operated as the MLDv2 Proxy

   In PMIPv6[RFC5213], every MAG and LMA will own a bi-direction tunnel.
   There are only these two nodes on this tunnel.  Meanwhile, the PBUs/
   PBAs are applicable for multicast group management.  In addition,
   since the tunnel between the MAG and LMA can be multicast capable,
   MLDv2[RFC3810] can also be run in that tunnel.  To one multicast
   group, the MAG can only join once to the LMA, it will save a large
   signal consumption and multicast traffics to avoid making the tunnel
   to be involved in the neck phenomenon.

   A MLDv2 proxy[RFC4605] can simplify the implementation of the LMA.
   At this point, it is a valuable choice as well.  The benefit is
   similar to the description of MLDv2 proxy[RFC4605] on the MAG.

   To query those MAGs which are connected to a LMA, the LMA which is
   acting as an MLDv2 proxy[RFC3810] can use MLDv2[RFC3810] Query
   messages or PBAs (Need some extensions) to inform the MAGs.  And
   then, if the LMA receives MLDv2[RFC3810] Report messages or PBUs
   (Also need some extensions) from MAGs, it will forward or send
   MLDv2[RFC3810] Report messages to the multicast router it has
   connected with by using it's link-local address.  That belongs to
   current regular multicast domain.

   As a MLDv2 proxy[RFC3810], the LMA needs to configure its upstream
   and downstream interfaces statistically.  As to downstream, it is
   connected to those MAGs and for upstream.  Since, there are some many
   different prefixes on the LMA, it can select one or several
   interfaces owned by respective prefixes as the multicast listener
   interface faces upstream.

6.2.  Operated as the MLDv2 Router

   TBD.

7.  Mobile Node Consideration

7.1.  Operation without the MLDv2

   After all, the MLDv2[RFC3810] protocol needs hosts to support and the
   cost of MLDv2[RFC3810] protocol over air-interface is existed.  In
   addition, the network has such information can be referred in pmip
   domain.  The MAG can establish and maintain the proxy mobile
   multicast service to represent the MN.  So the MN can just keep
   listening the multicast traffics without sending any explicit
   messages to the MAG to manage the multicast services.

   It should be noted that, even if the MLDv2[RFC3810] report is not
   expected to be sent to the MAG many kernel implementation requires
   host's application to create/add joined multicast group membership
   structure inside its kernel and open device driver to capture the
   data whose IP multicast address is a specified one.

   If no such operation, the host must receive all multicast datas with
   promiscuous mode, which is worst and not willing to any host.  To
   make the system available in this kind of worst situation, unicast
   can be used between the MAG and mobile node to transfer those
   specified multicast traffics. the MAG can just play as a
   MLDv2[RFC3810] listener.  After receiving those multicast traffics,
   the MAG can encapsulate them destined to the mobile node directly.
   As to detail port will be used, it will be provided as the part of
   the profile the MAG has just found.  Because, currently p2p link is
   specified to PMIPv6[RFC5213].  So multicast or unicast between the
   MAG and the mobile node will not bring any additional cost to it.

   Note: Here the static multicast services can be used and the service
   is pre-configured.  No any substantial large change after signing
   those services with operators or the deployment of them in network
   side.  Meanwhile, some layer-2 mechanism or custom-specific protocols
   can be used to help the multicast group management for the mobile
   node when dynamic multicast service is expected to this architecture.
   In this case, the MAG doesn't need to run the MLDv2[RFC3810] protocol
   with the mobile node.

8.  Protocol compatible considerations

   By the introduction of the different roles of the MAG and the LMA,
   the co-ordination between the different type of the p-MAG and the
   n-MAG is a requirement.  But, of course, we can pre-defined or advice
   to operators to only deploy one type of function (MLDv2
   proxy[RFC3810]/MLDv2 router etc) inside of the MAG or LMA.  That can
   make both protocol and PMIPv6[RFC5213] domain as simple as possible.
   Upon this assumption, a negotiation will be needed.  Here we can
   utilize context transfer or policy store.  And a dual-mode MAG will
   be required to be operated in different method.

9.  Protocol consideration

   This part describes those extensions or definitions to current
   PMIPv6[RFC5213] protocol, or context transfer progress.

9.1.  PMIPv6 messages extension

   Once PMIPv6[RFC5213] is used as the pmip multicast management method
   between the MAG and the LMA, then it will be needed to be extended to
   support the transfer or negotiation of those multicast related
   information.

9.2.  Context definition during handover

   Although, whether the protocol will be used in PMIPv6[RFC5213] domain
   or not is not clearly by far.  And practice system have some their
   specific methods to do that.  But it is the same what should be
   transferred during context transfer progress.  Once that context
   transfer protocol is certain, this part of work can be referred
   together.

9.3.  Protocol configuration variables
