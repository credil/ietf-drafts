    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a simple signalling mechanism for
      inter-domain QoS marking using several instances of a new BGP Extended
      Community Attribute. Class based packet marking and forwarding is
      currently performed independently within ASes. The new QoS marking
      attribute makes the QoS class marking within the IP prefix advertising
      AS known to all access and transit ASes. This enables individual
      (re-)marking and possibly forwarding treatment adaptation to the
      original QoS class setup of the respective originating AS. The attribute
      provides the means to signal QoS markings on different layers, which are
      linked together in QoS Class Sets. It provides inter-domain and
      cross-layer insight into the QoS class mapping of the source AS with
      minimal signalling traffic.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A new BGP Extended Community Attribute is defined in this document,
      which carries QoS marking information for different network layer
      technologies across ASes. This attribute is called "QoS Marking
      Attribute". This new attribute provides a mechanism within BGP-4 <xref
      target="RFC4271"></xref> for associating all advertised prefixes of the
      AS with its differentiated QoS Class Marking information. It allows for
      the consistent exchange of class encoding values between BGP peers for
      physical, data link and network QoS mechanisms. These labels can be used
      to control the distribution of this information, for the encoding and
      for treatment adjustments within the AS or for other applications. One
      globally seen QoS Class Set per AS is required for scalability reasons.
      It is the AS provider's responsibility to enforce the globally signalled
      Set throughout the AS.</t>

      <t>Several QoS Marking Attributes MAY be included in a single BGP UPDATE
      message. They are virtually linked together by means of an identical
      "QoS Set Number" field. Each QoS Marking Attribute is encoded as 8-octet
      tuple, as defined in <xref target="Attribute_Definition"></xref>.
      Signalled QoS Class Sets are assumed to be valid for traffic crossing
      this AS. If different QoS strategies are used with an AS, its provider
      is responsible for consistent transport of transit traffic across this
      inhomogeneous domain. In all transit forwarding cases, QoS based
      tunnelling mechanisms are the means of choice for transparent traffic
      transport.</t>

      <t>The availability of the "Best Effort" forwarding class is implied and
      defaults to a zero encoding on all signalled layers. It is therefore not
      necessary to include QoS Marking Attributes for the Best Effort Class as
      long as the default encoding is in place.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>Current inter-domain peering is "best effort" peering only. That is,
      traffic forwarding between ASes is without traffic class differentiation
      and without any forwarding guarantee. It is common for network providers
      to reset any IP packet class markings to zero, the best effort DSCP
      marking, at the AS ingress router, which eliminates any traffic
      differentiation. Some providers perform higher layer classification at
      the ingress in order to guess the forwarding requirements and to match
      on their AS internal QoS forwarding policy. There is no standardized set
      of classes, no standardized marking (class encoding) and no standardized
      forwarding behaviour, which cross-domain traffic could rely on. QoS
      policy decisions are taken by AS providers independently and in an
      uncoordinated fashion.</t>

      <t>This general statement does not cover the existing individual
      agreements, which do offer quality based peering with strict QoS
      guarantees. However, such SLA based agreements are of bilateral or
      multilateral nature and do not offer a means for a general "better than
      best effort" peering. This draft does not aim for making such SLA based
      agreements become void. On the contrary, those agreements are expected
      to exist for special traffic forwarding paths with strictly guaranteed
      QoS.</t>

      <t>There are many approaches, which propose proper inter-domain QoS
      strategies including inter-domain parameter signalling, metering,
      monitoring and misbehaviour detection. Such complex strategies get close
      to guaranteed QoS based forwarding at the expense of dynamic
      measurements and adjustments, of state keeping on resource usage vs.
      traffic load and in particular of possibly frequent inter-domain
      signalling.</t>

      <t>The proposed QoS Class marking approach dissociates from the complex
      latter solutions and targets the general "better than best effort"
      peering in coexistence with SLA based agreements. It enables ASes to
      make their supported Class Sets and their encoding globally known. In
      other words, this support information constitutes a simple map of QoS
      enabled roads in transit and destination ASes.</t>

      <t>Signalling the coarse information about the supported class set and
      its cross-layer encoding within the involved forwarding domains of the
      selected AS path removes the lack of knowledge about the over-all
      available traffic differentiation. AS providers are enabled to make an
      informed decision about supported class encodings and might adopt to
      them. No guarantees are offered by this "better than best effort"
      approach, but as much as easily possible traffic differentiation without
      the need for frequent inter-domain signalling and for costly ingress
      re-classification will be achieved.</t>

      <t>Remarking the class encoding of customer traffic in order to match
      neighbouring class set encodings is reasonable at AS peering points. For
      AS internal forwarding, the encapsulation within any kind of QoS
      supporting tunnelling technology is highly recommended. The cross-layer
      signalling of QoS encoding will further ease the setup of QoS based
      inter-domain tunnelling.</t>

      <t>The general confidentiality concern of disclosing AS internal policy
      information is addressed in <xref target="Confidentiality"></xref>. In
      short, AS providers can signal a different class set in the QoS Marking
      Attributes to the one actually used internally. The different class sets
      (externally signalled vs. internally applied one) require an undisclosed
      strictly defined mapping at the AS borders between the two. This way, a
      distinction between internal and external QoS Class Sets can be
      achieved.</t>

      <t>The general need for class based accounting is not addressed by this
      draft. MIB extensions are also required, which separate traffic
      variables by traffic marking. It is expected for both that existing
      procedures can be reused in a class based manner.</t>

      <t></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Related Work">
      <t>A number of QoS improvement approaches have been proposed before and
      a selection will be briefly mentioned in this section.</t>

      <t>Most of the approaches perform parameter signalling. <xref
      target="I-D.jacquenet-bgp-qos"></xref> defines the QOS_NLRI attribute,
      which is used for propagating QoS-related information associated to the
      NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information) information conveyed in a
      BGP UPDATE message. Single so called "QoS routes" are signalled, which
      fulfil certain QoS requirements. Several information types are defined
      for the attribute, which concentrate on rate and delay type
      parameters.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.boucadair-qos-bgp-spec"> </xref> is based on the
      specified QOS_NLRI attribute and introduces some modifications to it.
      The notion of AS-local and extended QoS classes is used, which
      effectively describes the local set of QoS performance parameters or
      their cross-domain combined result. Two groups of QoS delivery services
      are distinguished, where the second group concentrates on ID associated
      QoS parameter propagation between adjacent peers. The first group is of
      more interest for this draft since it concentrates on the "identifier
      propagation" such as the DSCP value for example. However, this
      signalling is specified for the information exchange between adjacent
      peers only and assumes the existence of extended QoS classes and offline
      traffic engineering functions.</t>

      <t>Another approach is described in <xref
      target="I-D.liang-bgp-qos"></xref>. It associates a list of QoS metrics
      with each prefix by extending the existing AS_PATH attribute format.
      Hop-by-hop metric accumulation is performed as the AS_PATH gets extended
      in relaying ASes. Metrics are generically specified as a list of
      TLV-style attribute elements. The metrics such as bandwidth and delay
      are exemplary mentioned in the draft.</t>

      <t>One contribution specialized in the signalling of Type Of Service
      (TOS) values which are in turn directly mapped to DSCP values in section
      3.2 of the draft <xref
      target="I-D.zhang-idr-bgp-extcommunity-qos"></xref>. The TOS value is
      signalled within an Extended Community Attribute and, if it is
      understood correctly, will be applied to a certain route. An additional
      value field is used to identify, which routes belong to which signalled
      TOS community. Who advertises such attributes and whether they are of
      transitive or non-transitive type remains unspecified.</t>

      <t>The most comprehensive analysis (although not an IETF draft) is given
      in <xref target="MIT_CFP"></xref>. This "Inter- provider Quality of
      Service" white paper examines the inter-domain QoS requirements and
      derives a comprehensive approach for the introduction of at least one
      QoS class with guaranteed delay parameters. The implementation aspects
      of metering, monitoring, parameter feedback and impairment allocations
      are all considered in the white paper. However, QoS guarantees and
      parameter signalling is beyond the intention of this QoS Marking
      Attribute draft.</t>

      <t>Other drafts may also be considered as related work as long as they
      convey QoS marking information and might be "misused" for QoS class
      signalling.</t>

      <t>One example is the usage of the "Traffic Engineering Attribute" as
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-bgp-te-attribute"></xref>.
      However, the attribute is non-transitive and the LSP encoding types are
      not generally applicable to inter-domain peering types. Its usage of the
      targeted QoS Marking signalling is not possible. The included maximum
      bandwidth of each of eight priority classes, could however be used in
      future draft extensions.</t>

      <t>The second example is the current "Dissemination of flow
      specification rules" draft <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec"></xref>. It defines a new BGP NLRI
      encoding format, which can be used to distribute traffic flow
      specifications. Such flow specification can also include DSCP values as
      type 11 in the NLRI. Furthermore, one could signal configuration actions
      together with the DSCP encoding, which could be used for filtering
      purposes or even trigger remarking and route selection with it. Such
      usage is not defined in the draft and can hardly be achieved because of
      the following reasons. The flow specification is focused on single
      flows, which might even be part of an aggregate. Such fine grained
      specification is counterproductive for the coarse grained general QoS
      Marking approach of this draft. The novel approach of cross-layer QoS
      Marking could also not be incorporated, which might be essential for
      future tunnelled inter-domain peering.</t>

        Community Attribute <xref target="RFC4360"></xref>. It is therefore a
        transitive optional BGP attribute with Type Code 16. An adoption to
        the simple BGP Community Attribute encoding <xref

        <t>The QoS Marking Attribute is of regular type which results in a 1
        octet Type field followed by 7 octets for the QoS marking structure.
        The Type is IANA-assignable and marks the community as transitive
        across ASes. The type number has been assigned by IANA to 0x00 <xref

        Other technologies, which use separate forwarding channels for

    <section title="Attribute Usage">
      <t>Providers MAY choose to process the QoS Marking Attributes and adopt
      the priority encoding and tunnel selection according to their local
      policy. Whether this MAY also lead to different IGP routing decisions or
      even effect BGP update filters is out of scope for the attribute
      definition.</t>

      <t>Only the IP prefix originating AS is allowed to signal the QoS
      Marking Attributes and Set. AS providers, which make use of this
      signalling mechanism MUST make sure that only one external Class Set
      will be advertised for the AS. All advertised prefixes, which originate
      from that AS will be sent with the same QoS Marking Attribute Set in the
      respective UPDATE message. Transit ASes MUST NOT modify or extend the
      QoS Marking Attribute Set except for the update of each 'QoS Marking A'
      field contained in the Attribute Set, the respective "R, I, A" flags and
      the Processing Counter. Prefixes with associated identical QoS Marking
      Attribute Sets are to be advertised together in common UPDATE messages
      in relaying nodes.</t>

      <t><xref target="Figure_4"></xref> shows an AS peering example with
      different Class Sets. It shows the case in AS 5 where different Class
      Sets are used internally and externally. The proposed QoS Class Set
      signalling will always use the external definitions within the UPDATE
      message QoS Marking Attributes. The example also shows, that IP
      prefixes, which originate in AS 5 and AS 3 can be advertised together
      with the same QoS Marking Attribute Set as long as their Layer 2
      encoding is identical.</t>

      <section title="AS Border Packet Forwarding">
        <t>IP packet forwarding based on packet header QoS encoding might
        require remarking of packets in order to match AS internal policies
        and encodings of neighbouring ASes.</t>

        <t>Identical QoS class sets and encodings between neighbouring ASes do
        not require any remarking. Different encodings will be matched on the
        outgoing traffic.</t>

        <t>Outgoing traffic for a given IP prefix uses the 'QoS Marking A'
        information of the respective BGP UPDATE message QoS Marking Attribute
        for adopted remarking of the forwarded packet.</t>

        <t>If the Process Count is smaller than the number of different AS
        numbers in the AS PATH or if the 'I' flag is set for a given encoding,
        the outgoing traffic remarking can not be applied due to this
        signalled lack of QoS Class forwarding support.</t>

        <t>'QoS Marking O' information is used for outgoing remarking, if the
        targeted class is not supported by the neighbouring AS.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IP Prefix Aggregation">
        <t>Several IP prefixes of different IP prefix originating ASes MAY be
        aggregated to a shorter IP prefix in transit ASes. If the original
        Class Sets of the aggregated prefixes are identical, the aggregate
        will use the same Set. In all other cases, the resulting IP prefix
        aggregate is handled the same as if the transit AS were the
        originating AS for this aggregated prefix. The transit AS provider MAY
        care for AS internal mechanisms, which map the signalled aggregate QoS
        Class Set to the different original Class Sets in the internal
        forwarding path.</t>

        <t>In case of IP prefix aggregation with different QoS Class Sets, the
        'Aggregation (A)' flag of each QoS Marking Attribute within the Set
        MUST be set to '1'.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Confidentiality" title="Confidentiality Considerations">
      <t>The disclosure of confidential AS intrinsic information is of no
      concern since the signalled marking for QoS class encodings can be
      adopted prior to the UPDATE advertisement of the IP prefix originating
      AS. This way, a distinction between internal and external QoS Class Sets
      can be achieved. AS internal cross-layer marking adaptation and policy
      based update filtering allows for consistent QoS class support despite
      made up QoS Class Set and encoding information within UPDATE
      advertisements. In case of such policy hiding strategy, the required AS
      internal ingress and egress adaptation SHALL be done transparently
      without explicit "Active Marking" and 'R' flag signalling.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a new BGP Extended Community Attribute, which
      includes a "Technology Type" field. <xref target="tech_type"></xref>
      enumerates a number of popular technologies. This list is expected to
      suffice for first implementations. However, future or currently
      uncovered technologies may arise, which require an extended "Technology
      Type" enumeration list administered by IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
      inherent in the existing BGP.</t>

      <t>Malicious signalling behaviour of QoS marking Attribute advertising
      ASes can result in misguided neighbours about non existing or
      maliciously encoded Class Sets. Removal of QoS Marking Attribute Sets
      leads to the current best effort peering, which is no stringent security
      concern.</t>

      <t>The strongest thread is the advertisement of numerous very fine
      grained Class Sets, which could limit the scalability of this approach.
      However, neighbouring ASes are free to set the ignore flag of single
      attributes or to stop processing the QoS Marking Attributes of a certain
      routing advertisement, once a self-set threshold has been crossed. By
      means of this self defence mechanism it should not be possible to crash
      neighbouring peers due to the excessive use of the new attribute.</t>

      <t>The example AS is advertising several IP prefixes, which experience
      equal QoS treatment from AS internal networks. The IP packet forwarding
      policy within this originating AS defines e.g. 3 traffic classes for IP
      traffic (DSCP1, DSCP2 and DSCP3). These three classes are also
      consistently taken care of within an EXP bit supporting MPLS tunnel
      forwarding. The BGP UPDATE message for the announced IP prefixes will
