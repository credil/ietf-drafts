   Using mLDP through a Backbone where there is no Route to the Root


                 draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-recurs-fec-01.txt

Abstract

   The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths ("MP LSPs") contains a
   field that identifies the address of a "root node".  Intermediate
   nodes are expected to be able to look up that address in their
   routing tables.  However, if the route to the root node is a BGP
   route, and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core, this
   is not possible.  This document specifies procedures which enable a
   MP LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core.  In these
   procedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced by an
   address which is known to the intermediate nodes.

1. Introduction

   [MLDP] defines several LDP FEC element encodings: P2MP, MP2MP
   Upstream, and MP2MP Downstream.

   The encoding for these three FEC elements is shown in Figure 1.

                          MLDP FEC Element Encoding
                                  Figure 1

   Note that a P2MP or MP2MP label switched path ("MP LSP") is
   identified by the combination of a "root node" and a variable length
   "opaque value".  The root node also plays a special role in the MLDP
   procedures - MLDP messages that are "about" a particular MP LSP are
   forwarded to the LDP adjacency that is the next hop on the route to
   the root node.

   Sometimes it is desirable for a MP LSP to pass through a part of the
   network in which there is no route to the root node.  For instance,
   consider the topology of Figure 2:



           CE1----PE1---P1---- ...----P2 ----PE2----CE2----R

                                Figure 2

   where CE1 and CE2 are "customer edge routers", PE1 and PE2 are
   "provider edge routers", but the provider's core is "BGP-free".  That
   is, PE1 has a BGP-learned route for R, in which PE2 is the BGP next
   hop.  However, the provider's interior routers (such as P1 and P2) do
   not have any BGP-learned routes, and in particular do not have any



Wijnands, et al.                                                [Page 3]


Internet Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-recurs-fec-01.txt       April 2011


   routes to R.

   In such an environment, data packets from CE1 address to R would get
   encapsulated by PE1, tunneled to PE2, decapsulated by PE2, and
   forwarded to CE2.

   Suppose now that CE1 is trying to set up a MP LSP whose root is R,
   and the intention is that the provider's network will participate in
   the construction of the LSP. Then the MLDP messages identifying the
   LSP must be passed from CE1 to PE1, from PE1 to P1, ..., from P2 to
   PE2, from PE2 to CE2, and from CE2 to R.

   To begin the process, CE1 creates a MP FEC element with the address
   of R as the root node address, and passes that FEC element via MLDP
   to PE1.  However, PE1 cannot use this same FEC element to identify
   the LSP in the LDP messages it sends to P1, because P1 does not have
   a route to R.

   However, PE1 does know that PE2 is the "BGP next hop" on the path to
   R.  What is needed is a method whereby:

     - PE1 can tell P1 to set up an LSP as if the root node were PE2,
       and

     - PE2 can determine that the LSP in question is really rooted at R,
       not at PE2 itself,

     - PE2 can determine the original FEC element that CE1 passed to
       PE1, so that PE2 can pass it on to CE2.

   This document defines the procedures that allow CE1 to create an LSP
   rooted at R.  These procedures require PE1 to modify the MP FEC
   element before sending an MLDP message to P1.  The modified FEC
   element has PE2 as the root, and the original FEC element as the
   opaque value.  This requires a new type of opaque value.  Since the
   opaque value contains a FEC element, we call this a "Recursive Opaque
   Value".  When PE2 sends an mLDP message to CE2, it replaces the FEC
   element with the opaque value, thus undoing the recursion.  Details
   are in section 2.

   Section 3 defines a "VPN Recursive Opaque Value".  Whereas the
   "Recursive Opaque Value" carries the original FEC, the "VPN Recursive
   Opaque Value" carries the original FEC plus a Route Distinguisher
   (RD).  This has several possible uses in an L3VPN context.  Details
   are in section 3.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. The Recursive Opaque Value Type

2.1. Encoding

   We define a new Opaque Value Type, the Recursive Opaque Value Type.

                       Recursive Opaque Value Type
                                 Figure 3


   The "opaque value" itself is a P2MP or MP2MP FEC element, encoded
   exactly as specified in [MLDP], with a type field, a length field,
   and value field of is own.  The length field of the Recursive Opaque
   Value Type thus includes the type and length fields of the FEC
   element that is the value field.


2.2. Procedures

   In the topology of Figure 2, let us suppose that CE1 sends PE1 an MP
   FEC element whose root node is R, and whose opaque value is Q.  We
   will refer to this FEC element as "CE1-FEC".  We may think of CE1-FEC
   as an ordered pair, as follows:

       CE1-FEC = <root=R, opaque_value=Q>.

   PE1 determines that the root node R matches a BGP route, with a BGP
   next hop of PE2.  PE1 also knows by its configuration that the
   interior routers on the path to PE2 are "BGP-free", and thus have no
   route to R.

   PE1 therefore MUST create a new MP FEC element, whose root node
   address is the address of PE2, and whose opaque value is a Recursive



Wijnands, et al.                                                [Page 5]


Internet Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-recurs-fec-01.txt       April 2011


   (type 6) Opaque Value whose value field contains CE1-FEC.  We refer
   to this FEC element as PE2-FEC.  PE1 then MUST send this FEC element
   to P1.

       PE2-FEC = <root=PE2, opaque_value=CE1-FEC>, or

       PE2-FEC = <root=PE2, opaque_value=<root=R,
                                          opaque_value=Q>>

   As far as the interior routers are concerned, they are being
   requested to build a MP LSP whose root node is PE2.  They MUST NOT
   interpret the opaque value at all.

   When PE2-FEC arrives at PE2, PE2 notes that it is the identified root
   node, and that the opaque value is a Recursive (type 6) opaque value.
   Therefore it MUST replace PE2-FEC with the contents of the type 6
   opaque value (i.e., with CE1-FEC) before doing any further
   processing.  This will result in CE1-FEC being sent on to CE2, and
   presumably further from CE2 to R.  Note that CE1-FEC will contain the
   LSP root node specified by CE1; the presumption is that PE2 has a
   route to this root node.


3. The VPN-Recursive MP FEC Element

3.1. Encoding

   We define a new Opaque Value Type, the VPN-Recursive Opaque Value
   Type.

                                 Figure 3



   The "opaque value" consists of an eight-octet Route Distinguisher
   (RD), followed by a P2MP or MP2MP FEC element, encoded exactly as
   specified in [MLDP], with a type field, a length field, and value
   field of is own.  The length field of the Recursive Opaque Value Type
   thus includes the 8 octets of RD plus the type and length fields of
   the FEC element that is the value field.


3.2. Procedures

3.2.1. Unsegmented Inter-AS P-tunnels

   Consider the Inter-AS VPN scenario depicted in Figure 4.



           PE1 --- P1 ---- ASBR1 ... ASBR2 ---- P2 ---- PE2

                                Figure 4


   Suppose this is an "option B" VPN interconnect ([VPN] section 10).
   This means that the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) in the
   first Autonomous System (i.e., ASBR1) does not have a route to PE
   routers in other ASes (such as PE2).  Suppose also that the MVPN
   policy is to instantiate PMSIs [MVPN] using mLDP, and that
   "unsegmented inter-AS P-tunnels" [MVPN] are being used.




Wijnands, et al.                                                [Page 7]


Internet Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-recurs-fec-01.txt       April 2011


   In this scenario, PE1 may need to join a P2MP or MP2MP LSP whose root
   is PE2.  P1 has no route to PE2, and all PE1 knows about the route to
   PE2 is that ASBR1 is the BGP next hop.  Since P1 has no root to PE2,
   PE1 needs to originate an mLDP message with a FEC element that
   identifies ASBR1 as the root.  This FEC element must contain enough
   information to enable ASBR1 to find the next hop towards PE2 even
   though ASBR1 does not have a route to PE2.

   Although ASBR1 does not have a route to PE2, it does have a BGP
   Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route [MVPN] whose NLRI contains PE2's IP address
   together with a particular RD.  PE1 also has this Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D
   route. The LSP needs to be set up along the path established by the
   Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D routes.  Therefore one must use a Recursive FEC
   element that contains the RD as well as the as well as the address of
   PE2.  The "VPN-Recursive FEC Element" defined herein is used for this
   purpose.

   This enables us to provide the same functionality, for mLDP P-tunnels
   that is provided for PIM P-tunnels in section 8.1.3.2 of [MVPN]
   though the use of the MVPN Join Attribute.

   At PE1 in Figure 4, the LSP to be created is associated with a
   particular VRF.  PE1 looks up in that VRF the Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D
   route originated by PE2.  It finds that the BGP next hop of that
   route is ASBR1.  So it creates a P2MP or MP2MP FEC element whose root
   is ASBR1, and whose opaque value is a VPN-Recursive FEC element.  The
   VPN-Recursive FEC element itself consists of a root, an RD, and an
   opaque value, set as follows:

     - The root is PE2

     - The RD is the RD from the NLRI of the Intra-AS A-D route
       originated by PE2.

     - The opaque value is chosen (by some method outside the scope of
       this document) so as to be unique in the context of PE2.  (E.g.,
       it may have been specified in a PMSI tunnel attribute originated
       by PE2.)  We will refer to this opaque value as "Q".

   The resulting FEC element can be informally represented as

       <root=ASBR1, opaque_value=<root=PE2, RD, opaque_value=Q>>.

   PE1 can now begin setting up the LSP by using this FEC element in an
   LDP label mapping message sent towards ASBR1.

   When ASBR1 receives, over a non-VRF interface, an mLDP label mapping
   message containing this FEC element, it sees that it is the root, and



Wijnands, et al.                                                [Page 8]


Internet Draft   draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-recurs-fec-01.txt       April 2011


   that the opaque value is a VPN-Recursive (type 7) FEC element.  It
   parses the VPN-Recursive FEC element and extracts the root value,
   PE2.

   If ASBR1 has a route to PE2, it continues setting up the LSP by using
   the following FEC element:

       <root=PE2, opaque_value=Q>

   However, if ASBR1 does not have a route to PE2, it looks for an
   Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route whose NLRI contains PE2's address along
   with the specified RD value.  Say the BGP next hop of that route is
   ASBR2.  Then ASBR1 continues setting up the LSP by using the
   following FEC element:

       <root=ASBR2, opaque_value=<root=PE2, RD, opaque_value=Q>>.

   Note that in this case, the root has changed from ASBR1 to ASBR2, but
   the opaque value is the unchanged VPN-Recursive FEC element.



3.2.2. Limited Carrier's Carrier Function

   Another possible use of the VPN recursive FEC is to provide a limited
   version of "Carrier's Carrier Service".  Referring again to the
   topology of Figure 2, suppose that PE1/PE2 are offering "Carrier's
   Carrier VPN Service" [VPN] to CE1/CE2.  CE1 sends PE1 an MP FEC
   element whose root node is R, and whose opaque value is Q.  We will
   refer to this FEC element as "CE1-FEC".  However, PE1's route to R
   will be in a VRF ("Virtual Routing and Forwarding Table").  Therefore
   the FEC-element created by PE1 must contain some identifier that PE2
   can use to find the proper VRF in which to look up the address of R.

   When PE1 looks up the address of R in a VRF, it will find a route in
   the VPN-IP address family.  The next hop will be PE2, but there will
   also be a Route Distinguisher (RD) as part of that NLRI of the
   matching route.  In this case, the new FEC element created by PE1
   MUST have the address of PE2 as the root node address, and MUST have
   a VPN-Recursive (type 7) opaque value.  The value field of the type 7
   opaque value MUST consist of the 8-octet RD followed by CE1-FEC.

   As far as the interior routers are concerned, they are being
   requested to build a MP LSP whose root node is PE2.  They MUST NOT
   interpret the opaque value at all.

   When an mLDP label mapping message containing PE2-FEC arrives at PE2
   over a VRF interface, PE2 notes that it is the identified root node,

   and that the opaque value is a VPN-recursive (type 7) opaque value.
   Therefore it MUST replace PE2-FEC with the contents of the VPN-
   recursive opaque value (i.e., with CE1-FEC) before doing any further
   processing.  It uses the VRF to lookup up the path to R.  This will
   result in CE1-FEC being sent on to CE2, and presumably further from
   CE2 to R.

   In this scenario, the RD in the VPN-Recursive Opaque Value also
   ensures uniqueness of the FEC Element within the inner carrier's
   network.

   This way of providing Carrier's Carrier service has limited
   applicability, as it only works under the following conditions:

     - Both the inner carrier and the outer carrier are using
       unsegmented mLDP P-tunnels

     - The inner carrier is not aggregating the P-tunnels of the outer
       carrier, but is content to carry each such P-tunnel in a single
       P-tunnel of its own.

   The carrier's carrier scenario can be distinguished from the inter-AS
   scenario by the fact that in the former, the mLDP messages are being
   exchanged on VRF interfaces.


4. IANA Considerations

   [MLDP] defines a registry for "The LDP MP Opaque Value Element Type".
   This document requires the assignment of two new code points in this
   registry:

     - Type 6.

       An opaque value of this type is itself a TLV that encodes an mLDP
       FEC type, as defined in [MLDP].

     - Type 7

       An opaque value of this type consists of an eight-octet Route
       Distinguisher as defined in [VPN], followed by a TLV that encodes
       an mLDP FEC type, as defined in [MLDP].
