Internet-Draft   PBS NSLP: Network Traffic Authorization       July 2008


Abstract

   This document describes the NSIS Signaling Layer protocol (NSLP) for
   network traffic authorization in the Internet, the Permission-Based
   Sending (PBS) NSLP.  This NSLP aims to prevent Denial-of-Service
   (DoS) attacks and other forms of unauthorized traffic.  In the PBS
   NSLP, a receiver grants a sender a permission that gives the sender
   the authority to send data.  Signaling installs and maintains the
   permission state of routers for a data flow.  The PBS NSLP has a
   detection algorithm, the PBS Detection Algorithm (PDA), that monitors
   attacks.  To authenticate packets, the PBS NSLP requests a sender to
   use an existing security protocol, the IPsec Authentication Header
   (AH).  This allows routers to drop bogus packets by using an IP
   packet filter.  To avoid a compromised router that drops legitimate
   packets, the PBS NSLP triggers the sender to change the data flow
   path.

Internet-Draft   PBS NSLP: Network Traffic Authorization       July 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for
   network traffic authorization to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS)
   attacks and other forms of unauthorized traffic, the Permission Based
   Sending (PBS) NSLP.  In the PBS NSLP, a sender of IP data packets
   first has to receive permission from the intended receiver before it
   can inject any packets into the network.  The term "permission"
   represents the authority to send data.  Therefore, unauthorized
   packets without permission and attack packets that exceed the
   permission given to the flow are dropped at the first router that is
   aware of the PBS NSLP.  By default, routers only forward packets that
   are covered by a permission or may rate-limit to very small volume
   for high-assurance networks.

   The PBS NSLP exploits the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST)
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] that delivers the signaling messages along the
   data path to configure permission state of routers for a data flow.
   The PBS Detection Algorithm (PDA) monitors data flows, and then
   detects and identifies the attacks.  After detecting the attacks, the
   PBS NSLP uses an existing security protocol, IPsec, for the
   authentication of packets.  To avoid the path to the compromised
   router that drops legitimate packets, the PBS NSLP triggers the
   sender to change the data path.

   Below, Section 3 gives an overview of the design.  The PBS NSLP
   components are presented in Section 4.  Section 5 describes the PBS
   NSLP signaling messages.  Section 6 presents the PBS Detection
   Algorithm (PDA).  Section 7 describes security considerations.

3.  Terminology

   The terminology defined by GIST [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] are used in this
   document.

   In addition, the following terms are used:

   Attack: Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.

   Permission: The authority to send data.  It is granted a sender who
   requests it by an intended receiver.

   Trustworthy network: Routers are trusted and are not compromised.  In
   this, DoS attacks from end users are not considered.

   Byzantine network: Neither the sender nor the routers are trusted.

   On-path: The data flow path.

   On-path attacker: An attacker on on-path, such as a compromised
   router.

   Off-path attacker: An attacker who inserts packets into the data
   path, but is not located on the data path himself.

   Packet addition attack: An attacker who inserts bogus packets along
   the data path.

   Packet drop attack: An on-path attacker that drops legitimate
   packets.

   PBS NE: NSIS Entity (NE) that supports the functions of PBS NSLP.

   Flow identifier: A descriptor of data flow.  As NSIS Framework
   [RFC4080] describes, the information in the flow identification are:
   source IP address, destination IP address, protocol identifier and
   higher (port) addressing, flow label (typical for IPv6), SPI field
   for IPsec encapsulated data, and DSCP/TOS field.

4.  Design Overview

   There are three features of the PBS: distributed and stateful system,
   deployable and scalable system, and DoS defense mechanism.

4.1.  Distributed and Stateful System

   The PBS NSLP is a distributed and stateful system.  Since the
   permission is granted by the receiver of a flow, it does not require
   a central server to control the permissions.  Since signaling
   installs the permission state of routers for data flows, routers do
   not need to contact a central server to maintain their permission
   state for a data flow.  A subset of routers keeps state for a data
   flow, and monitor whether the flow is authorized.  The permission
   state is refreshed periodically by a soft-state mechanism.  This
   soft-state mechanism supports the robustness of the system.

4.2.  Deployable and Scalable System

   Incoming data packets are screened by the permission state using the
   flow identification of the packets, and existing security protocols,
   such as IPsec, are used to distinguish the legitimate packets from
   bogus packets.  This makes it possible for PBS NSLP to be applied to
   current networks without modification of current protocols (e.g., the
   PBS NSLP does not change IP and TCP packet header).

   Not all routers need to be aware of PBS NSLP.  The flow
   identification of the data packets are used to determine whether the
   data flow is authorized or not.  To reduce overhead, only the data
   packets from the sender that are affected by the attacks use a
   security protocol for the authentication of the data flow.

4.3.  DoS Defense Mechanism

4.3.1.  DoS Detection Mechanism

   Since there are many more legitimate packets than attack packets, it
   is not efficient to use security protocols, such as IPsec, for all
   data packets for packet authentication, especially in backbone
   networks.  Therefore, a detection algorithm allows only the data
   packets from senders who affected by the attack to use a security
   protocol.  The detection algorithm is called PBS Detection Algorithm
   (PDA).  Based on the attack detection, the PBS NSLP triggers the
   reaction of the DoS attacks.  The details of the PDA are described in
   Section 7.

Internet-Draft   PBS NSLP: Network Traffic Authorization       July 2008


4.3.2.  Reaction Mechanism Against DoS Attacks

   Three mechanisms to prevent the attacks are considered: limited
   permission for data flow, IPsec AH for authentication, and changing
   paths to avoid a compromised router.

   A receiver grants a sender a permission that represents an authority
   to send data.  Therefore, data packets are categorized into two
   types; authorized packets and unauthorized packets.  In the closed
   network in which all end users have PBS NSLP functionalities, the
   unauthorized packets without permission are dropped at the first
   router by default.  In the open Internet in which some end users do
   not have PBS NSLP functionalities, the flows from the end users who
   do not have PBS NSLP funtionalities are rate-limited by default.

   To prevent an attacker from forging the flow identification of a
   packet (e.g., from spoofing the source address), the authentication
   algorithm is used to protect the legitimate packets from the attack
   packets.  The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302] is used for
   authentication and integrity of packets.  The flow identification of
   the data packets is encrypted to certify that the data packets and
   signaling packets have the same origin.

   In the Byzantine network, public key cryptography algorithm, such as
   ECDSA [ANSIX9.62], is used for the authentication data field in IPsec
   AH.  If a symmetric key cryptography algorithm is used for the
   authentication of packets, the on-path attacker (compromised router)
   can generate the encrypted data since it has the shared key.

   In the trustworthy network, symmetric key cryptography algorithm,
   such as HMAC [RFC2104], can be used for the authentication data field
   in IPsec AH since there is no on-path attacker in the trustworthy
   network.

   For the data packets, a security protocol is not turned on by default
   to reduce computational overhead.  The security protocol for data
   packets is triggered when attacks are detected by PDA.  Thus, if no
   attack is detected, the data packet does not use IPsec, but if the
   attack is detected and the receiver requests authentication of data
   packets, IPsec is used to protect the packet from a spoofing attack.
   If the receiver considers the authentication of data packets even in
   the absence of attacks, it requests the sender to use IPsec for data
   flow.

   For the signaling packets, a security protocol is used by default.
   Since attackers can forge signaling messages to install bogus
   permission state along the path, authentication of the signaling
   messages is needed.  Since signaling messages are not generated

   frequently, applying IPsec to signaling packets does not cause
   significant overhead.

   To avoid a compromised router that drops legitimate packets, changing
   data flow path is needed.  To change the data path, a relay node that
   is far away from the current path can be used or path diversity by
   multihoming can be used.  The way of changing path is out of scope of
   the PBS NSLP.

5.  PBS Components

   The PBS NSLP architecture has three components: on-path (path-

                      Figure 1: PBS NSLP architecture

5.1.  On-path Signaling

   On-path signaling installs and maintains permission state, monitors
   attacks, and triggers the authentication mechanism.  The NTLP (GIST)
   [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp] handles all incoming signaling messages and it
   passes the signaling messages related to the PBS NSLP to the PBS
   NSLP.  The delivery of signaling messages is handled using a peer-to-
   peer approach.  Thus, each node that is aware of PBS NSLP regenerates
   the signaling message to forward it to the next node when it receives
   the PBS NSLP message.

5.2.  Authorization

   The authorization component decides the grants of permission (amount
   of volume) for a flow.  One of main objectives of this component is

Internet-Draft   PBS NSLP: Network Traffic Authorization       July 2008


   to detect and identify the attack.  The authorization component also
   decides the solution against an attack.  There are three solutions:
   IPsec AH using symmetric cryptography algorithm, IPsec AH using
   public key cryptography algorithm, and changing the flow path.  The
   details of detection of and solution against the attack are described
   in Section 7.

5.3.  Traffic Management

   The traffic management handles all incoming packets, including
   signaling messages and data packets.  It passes signaling messages up
   to NTLP (GIST).  Based on the permission state of a flow that is
   stored in routers aware of PBS NSLP, the traffic manager screens the
   data packets to see whether the data packets are authorized.  IP
   packet filter is used to filter the unauthorized packets.  To see
   whether the flow exceeds the given permssion, it calculates the
   volume of the data flow that it has received or sent since the
   permission state was set up.  The authentication of packets is
   verified by the traffic management component.

6.  PBS NSLP Signaling Messages

6.1.  PBS NSLP Signaling Message Types

   There are two message types; namely Query (Q) and Permission (P)
   messages.

6.1.1.  Query Message

   The Query message Q is sent by a sender to request permission to send
   data.

   It contains the following fields:

   o  Message type flag (M): Set to M=0 to indicate that the signaling
      message is the Query message.

   o  Flow identifier of the request

   o  Requested volume (RV): This field contains the number of bytes
      that a sender requests.

   o  Volume information (V): This field contains the number of bytes
      that a sender has sent since the sender received the permission
      from the intended receiver for the flow.  This information is used
      to monitor the DoS attacks.

   o  Public key (Ks): This field contains the sender's public key which
      is certificated by the trusted third party, a certificate
      authority (CA).  This public key is used to verify the
      authentication of the sender's packets.  An X.509 certificate
      [RFC5280] is used for the digital signature.

   o  Cryptography algorithm (C): The cryptography algorithm to be used
      for the authentication field in IPsec AH.

      *  C=00: RSA

      *  C=01: DSA

      *  C=10: ECDSA

      *  C=11: HMAC

Internet-Draft   PBS NSLP: Network Traffic Authorization       July 2008


6.1.2.  Permission Message

   The Permission message P is sent by the receiver who grants the
   permission to the sender.  This message is used to set up (grant),
   remove (revoke) and modify permission state for a flow.  This message
   is sent after receiving the Query message, and it can be sent when a
   receiver wants to change (revoke and modify) the permission state and
   change security mechanism without receiving the Query message.

   It contains the following fields:

   o  Message type flag (M): Set to M=1 to indicate the message is the
      Permission message.

   o  Flow identifier of the request

   o  Allowed volume (AV): This field contains the number of bytes that
      a receiver grants a sender for the request.

   o  Time limit (TTL): This field contains the time limit for the
      permission of the data flow.  It is used to prevent unused
      permission state from being in the permission state forever.

   o  Refresh period (T): A sender sends a Query message every period T.
      It is used for the soft-state of the permission.  The parameter T
      can be omitted when the permission state does not last long
      enough, and the value of T can be optimized depending on the
      application.

   o  Solution flags (S): S consists of S1 and S2 flags (S=S1S2).

      *  S=00: No reaction.

      *  S=01: The sender needs to use IPsec AH with symmetric key
         cryptography (HMAC) for the data flow.

      *  S=10: The sender needs to use IPsec AH with public key
         cryptography (ECDSA) for the data flow.

      *  S=11: The sender needs to change path for the data flow.

   o  Public key (Kr): The receiver's public key which is certificated
      by a CA.  An X.509 certificate is used for the digital signature.

   o  Cryptography algorithm (C): The cryptography algorithm to be used
      for the authentication field in IPsec AH.

6.2.  Basic Operation of PBS NSLP

   Figure 2 shows how permissions are set up between a sender and a
   receiver.  The Query and Permission messages are used for handshake
   to set up permission state along the path.

   A sender sends a receiver the Query message to request permission.
   An attacker can flood the receiver by sending a lot of Query
   messages.  To prevent this attack, proof-of-work can be used for rate
   limiting the Query message.  The sender's public key, Ks, is
   distributed to the routers and the receiver.  The key is used to
   authenticate the signaling messages that the sender generates.  The
   requested application is described in the flow identifier.  The Query
   message installs the reverse routing state in GIST for the Permission
   message path.  The Query message is protected by IPsec.  The
   authentication field of IPsec AH is generated by the private key of
   the sender.

   The receiver sends the sender the Permission messages to allow
   incoming data packets along the reverse path of the Query message.
   The receiver's public key, Kr, is distributed to the routers and the
   sender.  It is used to authenticate the signaling messages that the
   receiver generates.  The Permission message is protected by IPsec.
   The authentication field of IPsec AH is generated by the private key
   of the receiver.

   After the permission state is set up between the sender and the
   receiver, the sender can send the allowed volume (AV) of data to the
   receiver during the time limit (TTL).

   The sender sends the Query messages every refresh period T since PBS
   NSLP is a soft-state protocol.  The receiver sends the sender the
   Permission message after receiving the Query message.

7.  PBS Detection Algorithm (PDA)

   The PDA uses the existing PBS NSLP signaling messages.  A sender
   sends a signaling message that contains the volume of data that it
   has sent after the permission is granted.  The PBS NEs and a receiver
   compare the volume of data in the signaling message with the volume
   of data that has been received.

7.1.  Basic Operation of PDA

   PDA uses the PBS NSLP signaling messages: Query and Permission
   messages.  Figure 3 shows the basic operation of PDA.  The first two
   signaling messages are to set up the permission state for a flow
   between the sender and the receiver.  We assume that the receiver
   grants 10 MB size permission to the sender.

   After setting up the permission state, the sender sends data packets
   whose total volume is 1 MB.  There is an attacker A who spoofs the
   sender's address, and it sends additional attack packets whose total
   volume is 2 MB.

   After refresh period T, the sender sends a Query message that
   contains a volume (1 MB) of data that it has sent.  Since the Query
   message is protected by IPsec AH with public key cryptography, others
   cannot generate the Query message.  The receiver can detect the
   attack by comparing the volume (1 MB) in the Query message and total
   volume of data (3 MB) that it has received.

   After the receiver detects the attack, it sends the Permission
   messages with an indication to use IPsec AH (S=10).

   After the sender receives the Permission message, the sender sends
   data packets using IPsec AH.  Therefore, the attack packets are
   dropped at a PBS NE because of the IPsec verification process.

   If the receiver trusts the network (i.e., the routers are not
   compromised), it can request the sender to use symmetric key
   cryptography by setting solution flags to S=01.  In this case, IKEv2
   [RFC4306] can be used to set up the shared key along the path.  Since
   the PBS NSLP uses a peer-to-peer approach, the adjacent nodes use
   IKEv2 to set up the shared key.  Otherwise, a group key exchange
   protocol, such as group Diffie-Hellman [GDH], is needed.  Setting up
   a shared key causes additional message overhead.

7.2.  Example of Detecting a Packet Drop Attack (Black Hole Attack)

   Drop attack is one of the on-path attacks.  It is also known as the
   black hole attack.  A compromised router drops all packets or drops
   selected packets.

7.2.1.  Drop All Packets

   In Figure 4, the attacker drops all packets including signaling
   messages.  Since the sender does not receive a Permission message
   after two tries, it suspects that the packets might have been
   dropped.  Therefore, it changes the path.

    (Change path)

           Figure 4: Drop all packets (signal and data packets)

7.2.2.  Drop Selected Packets (Drop Only Data Packets)

   In Figure 5, the attacker only drops data packets and forwards
   signaling messages.  The Query message contains the volume (1 MB) of
   data that the sender has sent.  Since the receiver has not received
   the data, the receiver can detect the packet drop attack.  The
   receiver sends a Permission message indicating a request to change
   path (S=11).  After receiving the Permission message, the sender
   changes the path in order to avoid the compromised router.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes how to authorize the network traffic between
   a sender and a receiver along the data path.  The authorization is
   controlled by a receiver by granting the permission to a sender.  To
   prevent spoofing the legitimate sender's address, IPsec AH is used
   for data packets.

   There are two IPsec headers; the Authentication Header (AH) and
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).  IPsec ESP [RFC4303] can be
   also used for the authentication.  However, IPsec AH [RFC4302]
   suffices the authentication of packets.
