    <abstract>
      <t>EAP is a lower layer dependant protocol that has 802.1X and PANA to
      carry it over link layer and network layer respectively. 802.1X cannot
      go through any nodes, while PANA can carry EAP through the network over
      network layer. 802.1X is popular on legacy terminals, but it is painful
      to upgrade all these terminals to support PANA. This document introduces
      a PANA interworking function that enables legacy 802.1X terminals get
      authentication and access to PANA network without upgrading its software
      or hardware.</t>

    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>EAP is a protocol that defines an authentication framework supporting
      multiple authentication methods. EAP runs between peer and EAP server,
      typically over link layer, e.g. IEEE 802. With the effort of PANA
      (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) working group,
      EAP now may run over network layer per PANA <xref
      target="RFC5191"></xref>. As EAP is a lower-layer dependant protocol,
      different protocols are needed when EAP runs over different lower
      layers, e.g. EAPoL<xref target="IEEE802.1X"></xref> for EAP over
      Ethernet and PANA for EAP over IP.</t>

      <t>Clients may used PANA for authentication to access network without
      any link layer authentication method involved. However, legacy terminals
      may support EAP and EAPoL but not PANA. One shortcome of 802.1X is that
      it could run only on link layer and can't pass through any nodes.</t>

      <t>The intent is to define an interworking mechanism between 802.1X and
      PANA, which helps 802.1X terminals get authentication and access to PANA
      network without updating software or hardware of these legacy
      terminals.</t>

             title="Authentication Scenarios and Interworking Function Deployments">
      <t>ITU-T <xref target="Q.3201">Q.3201</xref> has defined the EAP-based
      authentication architecture in NGN, where link layer authentication,
      network layer authentication as well as an interworking function
      betweent them are required. Figure 1 depicts such an architecture for
      broadband network. The PANA-IWF is the function entity supports
      interworking between 802.1X and PANA. Such function should locate in the
      device where user terminals are directly connected. Though EAPoL could
      run only over the link between user terminals and the PANA-IWF, EAP
      could be further delivered over IP thanks to PANA.</t>

      <t>Benefits for such an architecture including having a unified
      authentication point for various interfaces, supporting authenticating
      peers indirectly connected to the authenticator.</t>

        <t>Legacy user terminals supporting 802.1X are directly connected to
        the access network. The PANA-IWF locates in the access network device
        where user terminals attach. 802.1X runs between user terminals and
        access network device at the edge. Such access network device is
        generally called Access Node, which typically can be an Ethernet
        switch or a public hot spot in this case. See Figure 2.</t>

      <section title="User terminals are connected to the network via gateways">
        <t>Legacy user terminals supporting 802.1X are connected to the access
        network via gateways. The PANA-IWF locates in the gateway. 802.1X runs
        between user terminals and the gateway. This is a typical case for DSL
        and PON access network, where the gateway is integrated into DSL CPE
        and ONT respectively. See Figure 3.</t>

    <section title="PANA Interworking Function">
      <t>PANA Interworking Function (PANA-IWF) is an intermediate between an
      802.1X client and PANA authentication Agent, performs interworking
      between EAPoL and PANA. PANA-IWF converts EAPoL message from 802.1X
      client into PANA message and forward it to PAA. It also converts PANA
      message from PAA into EAPoL message and forward it to the client.</t>

      <t>For the PAA, PANA-IWF acts as a PaC, maintains PANA state machine and
      responses to PAA's PANA-Auth-Request with PANA-Auth-Answer. A local IP
      address for the PaC and the IP address of PAA should be configured on
      PANA-IWF beforehand. PANA-IWF helps exchanging EAP messages between the
      EAPoL client and the PAA in a way of re-encapsulating piggybacked EAP
      message with Ethernet or IP header without touching the content of EAP
      message.</t>

      <section title="Authentication and Authorization with PANA-IWF">
        <t>802.1X clients seeking for authentication can reach PAA and get
        authorization for network access via PANA-IWF.</t>

        <t>An example authentication process follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>802.1X Client sends EAPoL-Start to PANA-IWF and triggers an EAP
            authentication process.</t>

            <t>PANA-IWF sends a PANA-Client-Initiation to PAA on receiving the
            EAPoL-Start message, and starts negotiatin process with PAA.</t>

            <t>On receiving PANA-Auth-Request with EAP-Payload carried,
            PANA-IWF converts this message into an EAPoL Request message by
            extracting the EAP-Payload and adding link layer information.
            EAPoL message is then forwarded to 802.1X client.</t>

            <t>802.1X client replies the EAPoL message as normal 802.1X
            authentication process. PANA-IWF converts this EAPoL message from
            802.1X client into PANA-Auth-Request message and forward it to
            PAA. With PANA-IWF's interpretation, 802.1X client talks to PAA in
            EAP and performs authentication process.</t>

            <t>After the client is successfuly authenticated, PAA sends to
            PANA-IWF PANA-Auth-Request with EAP-Success and 'C' bit set. On
            one hand, PANA-IWF replies PAA a PANA-Auth-Reply with 'C' bit set
            to finish PANA authentication process. On the other hand, it
            informs 802.1X client that authentication is successful via an
            EAP-Success in EAPoL and finish 802.1X authentication process.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Termination Phase with PANA-IWF">
        <t>802.1X client may request to terminate the session by sending a
        EAPOL-Logoff message. PANA-IWF converts the EAPOL-Logoff message into
        PANA-Termination-Request message, which is sent to PAA. PAA replies a
        PANA-Termination-Answer and clear up the PANA session.</t>
