 This document obsoletes RFC 3330. It describes the global and 
other specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by 
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  It does not 
address IPv4 address space assigned to operators and users through 
the Regional Internet Registries.  It also does not address allocations 
or assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous system numbers.
Special IPv6 addresses are described in RFC 5156.

<section title="Introduction">

    <t>

Throughout its  history, the Internet has employed a 
central Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible 
for the allocation and assignment of various identifiers needed 
for the operation of the Internet <xref target="RFC1174"/>.  In the 
case of the IPv4 address space, the IANA allocates parts of the 
address space to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) according to their 
established needs.  These Regional Internet Registries are 
responsible for the registration of IPv4 addresses to operators 
and users of the Internet within their regions.

    </t>

    <t>
                
On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated by the IETF 
to make assignments in support of the Internet Standards 
Process <xref target="RFC2860"/>. Section 5 of this document describes that 
assignment process.
                
     </t>

     <t>

Small portions of the IPv4 address space have been allocated or
assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized
purposes.  These allocations and assignments have been 
documented in a variety of RFCs and other documents.  This 
document is intended to collect these scattered references and 
provide a current list of special use IPv4 addresses.

</t>

   <t>
                
 This document is a revision of RFC 3330 <xref target="RFC3330"/>, which it
 obsoletes; its primary purpose is to re-publish the technical
 content of RFC 3330 mostly unchanged as a Best Current Practice RFC.
                
        </t>

        <t>

The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
"IETF Consensus", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to
refer to the processes described in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.  The keywords MUST,
MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
	</t>

</section>



<section title="Terminology">

	<t>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

<section title="Differences between this document and RFC 3330">
<t>
Address blocks that were reserved for a special purpose in RFC 3330 but are no 
longer reserved for any special purpose and are available for allocation are no 
longer listed in Sections 4 or 5. The following blocks have become available: 
</t>
        
        <t>
                
 - 14.0.0.0/8 is no longer set aside for assignments to the international system 
   of Public Data Networks <xref target="RFC1700"/>, page 181]. It is now available 
   for allocation to RIRs in the normal way; 
        </t>
        <t>
- 24.0.0.0/8 is no longer listed as the addresses in that block have been managed 
   by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) in the normal way since 2001. 
        </t>
        <t>
- 39.0.0.0/8 is no longer listed as it has been subject to allocation to an RIR 
   for assignment in the normal manner since 2001; 
        </t>
        <t>
- 128.0.0.0/16 is not reserved and is subject to future allocation by a Regional 
   Internet Registry for assignment in the normal manner;
        </t>
        <t>
- 191.255.0.0/16 is not reserved and is subject to future allocation by a RIR for 
   assignment in the normal manner;
        </t>
        <t>
- 223.255.255.0/24 is not reserved and is subject to future allocation by an RIR for 
   assignment in the normal manner.
                        
                </t>
        
</section>

<section title="Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks">

	<t>

		   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
		   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for 
		   this host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be
		   used to refer to specified hosts on this network <xref target="RFC1122"/>, page 30.

	</t>


	<t>
		   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
		   Its intended use is documented in <xref target="RFC1918"/>.  Addresses within this
		   block should not appear on the public Internet and can be used without any 
		   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

	</t>

	<t>

		   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned for use as the Internet host
		   loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher level protocol to an
		   address anywhere within this block should loop back inside the host.
		   This is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback,
		   but no addresses within this block should ever appear on any network
		   anywhere <xref target="RFC1122"/>, page 31.

	</t>

	<t>

		   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  As described in 
	           <xref target="RFC3927"/>, it is allocated for communication between hosts 
	           on a single link.  Hosts obtain these addresses by auto-configuration, such 
	           as when a DHCP server cannot be found.

	</t>


	<t>
		   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
		   Its intended use is documented in <xref target="RFC1918"/>.  Addresses within 
	           this block should not appear on the public Internet and can be used without any 
	           coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

	</t>

        <t>
                   192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol assignments.
        </t>

	<t>

		   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET" for use in
		   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction 
		   with domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
		   documentation.  Addresses within this block SHOULD NOT appear on the
		   public Internet and can be used without any coordination with IANA or 
		   an Internet registry.

	</t>


	<t>

		   192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay
		   anycast addresses, according to <xref target="RFC3068"/>.

	</t>


	<t>

		   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use in private 
		   networks. Its intended use is documented in <xref target="RFC1918"/>.  Addresses 
	        within this block should not appear on the public Internet and can be used without 
	        any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

	</t>


	<t>

		   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
		   tests of network interconnect devices.  <xref target="RFC2544"/> explains
	           that this range was assigned to minimize the chance of conflict in case a 
	           testing device were to be accidentally connected to part of the Internet.
	           Packets with source addresses from this range are not meant to be 
	           forwarded across the Internet.

	</t>


	<t>
		   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address
		   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.
		   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in
		   <xref target="RFC3171"/>.

	</t>


	<t>

		   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
		   space, is reserved.  The "limited broadcast" destination address
		   255.255.255.255 should never be forwarded outside the local network of
		   the source.  The remainder of this space is reserved for future use.
		   <xref target="RFC1112"/>, page 2.

<section title="Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses">

		<t>

The IANA has responsibility for making assignments of protocol
parameters used in the Internet according to the requirements of the
"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" <xref target="RFC2860"/>.  Among other things,
<xref target="RFC2860"/> requires that protocol parameters be assigned according to 
the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,
Draft, and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice
documents, and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.

		</t>

		<t>

The domain name and IP address spaces involve policy issues (in
addition to technical issues) so that the requirements of <xref target="RFC2860"/>
do not apply generally to those spaces.  Nonetheless, the IANA is
responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses as needed in
support of the Internet Standards Process.  When a portion of the
IPv4 address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical
requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be
described <xref target="RFC5226"/>.  Immediately before the RFC is published, the
IANA will, in consultation with the Regional Internet Registries,
make the necessary assignment and notify the RFC Editor of the
particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.

		</t>

		<t>

As required by <xref target="RFC2860"/>, the IANA will also make necessary
experimental assignments of IPv4 addresses, also in consultation
with the Regional Internet Registries.

		</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

	<t>

This document describes the IANA's past and current practices and
does not create any new requirements for assignments or allocations
by the IANA.

	</t>

</section>

		

<section title="Security Considerations">

		<t>

The particular assigned values of special-use IPv4 addresses
cataloged in this document do not directly raise security issues.
However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of
these addresses; if you expect (for instance) that all packets from
the 10.0.0.0/8 block originate within your subnet, all border 
routers should filter such packets that originate from elsewhere.  
Attacks have been mounted that depend on the unexpected use of some 
of these addresses.

		</t>

</section>



<section title="Acknowledgments">

		<t>

Many people have made comments on draft versions of this document.
The IANA would especially like to thank Scott Bradner, Randy Bush,
Leo Vegoda, Harald Alvestrand and the IESG for their constructive feedback 
and comments.

<abstract>
<t>To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available. This document describes how a host may automatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the 169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices connected to the same physical (or logical) link.&lt;/t>&lt;t> IPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks). This document does not recommend that IPv4 Link-Local addresses and routable addresses be configured simultaneously on the same interface. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>
