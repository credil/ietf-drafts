Internet-Draft            Multiple Clock Rates            September 2009


1.  Introduction

   The clock rate is a parameter of the payload format.  It is often
   defined as been the same as the sampling rate, but it is not always
   the case (see e.g. the G722 and MPA audio codecs in [RFC3551]).

   An RTP sender can switch between different payloads during the
   lifetime of an RTP session and because clock rates are defined by
   payload types, it is possible that the clock rate also varies during
   an RTP session.

   Changing the clock rate during an RTP session is not a problem for
   the RTP receiver, as it always knows the clock rate associated with a
   specific RTP packet.  The RTP receiver also has no problem
   calculating a clock rate independent interarrival jitter.

   The problem is with reports carried in RTCP packets that contain
   fields using units based on the clock rate.  Because the RTCP packets
   do not contain a field for the payload type, it is difficult for a
   sender to choose or for a receiver to guess which clock rate to use
   for this fields.

   For example, lip synchronization can be incorrect if the RTP
   timestamp in the RTCP SR packet use a different clock rate than
   expected by the receiver.

   Table 1 contains a non-exhaustive list of fields in RTCP packets that
   use a clock rate:

    +---------------------+------------------+------------------------+
    | Field name          | RTCP packet type | Reference              |
    +---------------------+------------------+------------------------+
    | RTP timestamp       | SR               | [RFC3550]              |
    | Interarrival jitter | RR               | [RFC3550]              |
    | min_jitter          | XR Summary Block | [RFC3611]              |
    | max_jitter          | XR Summary Block | [RFC3611]              |
    | mean_jitter         | XR Summary Block | [RFC3611]              |
    | dev_jitter          | XR Summary Block | [RFC3611]              |
    | Interarrival jitter | IJ               | [RFC5450]              |
    | RTP timestamp       | SMPTETC          | [RFC5484]              |
    | Jitter              | RSI Jitter Block | [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm] |

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Clock rate:  The multiplier used to convert from a wallclock value in
      seconds to an equivalent RTP timestamp value (without the fixed
      random offset).  Note that [RFC3550] uses various terms like
      "clock frequency", "media clock rate", "timestamp unit",
      "timestamp frequency" and "RTP timestamp clock rate" as synonymous
      to clock rate.
   RTP Sender:  A logical network element that sends RTP packets and
      sends and receives RTCP packets.
   RTP Receiver:  A logical network element that receives RTP packets
      and sends and receives RTCP packets.


3.  RTP Sender behavior

   An RTP sender can choose to implement a change in clock rate in
   various ways.

3.1.  Use the current clock rate

   A RTP sender can switch between payload types set with different
   clock rates on the same SSRC.  The RTP sender uses the current clock
   rate as the unit for the fields in the RTCP packets sent.

   Pros:
      *  It is probably the simplest behavior to implement and various
         implementations already follow this behavior.
   Cons:
      *  This behavior seems to contradict [RFC3550] section 5.2.
      *  It is difficult for an RTCP receiver to guess the clock rate
         used in the RTCP packets.

3.2.  Use a fixed clock rate

   As in the previous section, the RTP sender switches between different
   clock rates on the same SSRC, but it always uses the same clock rate
   as the unit for the fields in the RTCP packets sent.

   There is different possible ways to choose this fixed clock rate:
   o  The first clock rate used on the RTP session.
   o  The highest clock rate that can be used on the RTP session.

   o  A unified clok rate, as defined in uRTR
      [I-D.ietf-avt-variable-rate-audio].

   Pros:
      *  It is simple to implement.
   Cons:
      *  There is obvious compatibility issues with implementations
         using a different behavior.
      *  The fixed clock rate must be an integer multiple of the
         possible clock rates.
      *  uRTR was rejected at IETF 61.

3.3.  Use a different SSRC

   Instead of using various clock rates in the same SSRC, an RTP sender
   can use a different SSRC for each clock rate.

   Pros:
      *  It is compliant with [RFC3550] section 5.2.
      *  As there can be be only one possible clock rate on a specific
         SSRC, there is no ambiguity in the clock rate used in the RTCP
         packets.
   Cons:
      *  Changing the SSRC can be a problem for some implementations
         designed to work only with unicast IP addresses, where having
         multiple SSRCs is considered a corner case.
      *  Lip synchronization can be a problem in the interval between
         the beginning of the new stream and the first RTCP SR packet.
         This is not different than what happen at the beginning of the
         RTP session but it can be more annoying for the end-user.  The
         RTP extension defined in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-rtp-sync] can be
         used to accelerate the synchronization.

3.4.  Preferred RTP Sender behavior

   TBD


4.  Receiver Behavior

4.1.  Use the current RTP clock rate

   An RTP Receiver can use the clock rate associated with the current
   payload received in the RTP packets.  There is a race condition
   between the RTP and the RTCP packets that can create transient
   problems.  Also this method does not work for an RTCP monitor (i.e.
   an RTCP receiver that does not receive the RTP packets).  This method
   will not work either if a fixed clock rate is used.

4.2.  Guessing the clock rate

   Instead of using the current RTP clock rate, an RTP receiver can use
   the information in two consecutive SR packets to calculate the clock
   rate used, i.e. if Ni is the NTP timestamp for the SR packet i, Ri
   the RTP timestamp for the SR packet i and Nj and Rj the NTP timestamp
   and RTP timestamp for the previous SR packet j, then the clock rate
   can be guessed as the closest to (Ri - Rj) / (Ni - Nj).

   TBD
