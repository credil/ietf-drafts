1.  Introduction

   An Embedded Experience Document is a component of the OpenSocial Core
   Gadget Specification as defined in section C.15 of [OpenSocial].
   This Internet Draft defines and registers the MIME Media Types for
   the JSON and XML forms of the Embedded Experience Document.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]


3.  Embedded Experience XML Documents

   An Embedded Experience Document, when serialized as XML 1.0, can be
   identified with the following media type:

      MIME media type name:  application
      MIME subtype name:  embed+xml
      Mandatory parameters:  None.
      Optional parameters:
         "charset":  This parameter has semantics identical
            to the charset parameter of the "application/xml"
            media type as specified in [RFC3023].
      Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of
         "application/xml" as described in [RFC3023], Section 3.2.
      Security considerations:  As defined in this specification.
         In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml"
         convention, it shares the same security considerations
         as described in [RFC3023], Section 10.
      Interoperability considerations:  There are no known
         interoperability issues.
      Published specification:  This specification.
      Applications that use this media type:  No known applications
         currently use this media type.

      Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in [RFC3023],
         Section 3.2.
      File extension:  .embed
      Fragment identifiers:  As specified for "application/xml" in
         [RFC3023], Section 5.
      Base URI:  As specified in [RFC3023], Section 6.
      Macintosh File Type code:  TEXT

4.  Embedded Experience JSON Documents

   An Embedded Experience Document, when serialized as JSON, can be
   identified with the following media type:

        "application/json" as described in [RFC4627], Section 6.
     Security considerations:  As defined in this specification.
        In addition, as this media type uses the "+json"
        convention, it shares the same security considerations
        as described in [RFC4627], Section 6.
     Interoperability considerations:  There are no known
        interoperability issues.
     Published specification:  This specification.
     Applications that use this media type:  No known applications
        currently use this media type.

     Additional information:

     Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/json" in [RFC4627],
        Section 6.

5.  Security Considerations

   As specified within the OpenSocial Core Gadget Specification, section
   C.15.5.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the two MIME media types defined in
   Section 3 and Section 4.
