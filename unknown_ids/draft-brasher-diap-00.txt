Abstract

   A de-centralised, self-contained and managed storage protocol.  A
   system to provide strong storage fail over by using existing
   resources over networks distributing vital data evenly.  Rapid
   deployment and high redundancy for small to medium organisations as
   well as individuals.  Designed to reduce dependency on tape backup
   systems.  The protocol also has implications for long term archiving.
   By classifying data vitality values the limitations in physical space
   due to bandwidth constrictions can be overcome and the usefulness of
   DIAP maximised.

1.  Introduction

   The system design uses FIFO Pipe queue theory.  Three nodes either
   between sites say between offices, homes, on a campus or over WAN's,
   which could be dedicated to storage or used for existing services,
   have a round robin synchronisation of FULL - differential backup
   pools where the source of data ranges from a personal laptop to a
   file store over unused band-width where the data rate is dynamically
   controlled, including compression, according to load and
   availability.  Three for simplicity and because the probability of
   failure beyond three is so small the extra coding to accommodate more
   nodes would be self-defeating.  In real life use of three nodes for a
   DIAP pool is strong enough.  Chaining together DIAP pools to extend
   data retention periods is a future aim of the project.  Also
   designed, as project maturity is reached, to help reduce an
   organisations carbon footprint, the extent to which is unknown at
   this stage.


2.  Architecture

   The system reduces single point of failure by creating a single FULL
   copy on each node at the beginning of the month the storing the
   differentials in a distributed manner.  Use a program such as Bacula
   set to use a monthly FULL - differential.  If a copy fails then the
   system will retry the next day but you loose the day of failure.
   Using rsync logs you can trace / track the successful copies.  The
   copies are staggered so that each rsync copy list is made before new
   files are put into each directory by a few minutes.  I.e. bd9-cd9
   starts before ad9-bd9 and ad0-bd0 is last.  Redundancy is split
   across three nodes, no duplicate days apart from the first FULL copy.
   DIAP pool is possibly equivalent to 30 tapes every month but stored
   at three locations. 10 days every three days, at each.  You are
   advised to have some knowledge of the average differential size.

                              Table 1: Slots

   Two entry points, aFull beginning of month and ad0 for the remaining
   days.  Assuming entry points are filled during the day before the
   cycle begins at night 29 cron jobs split between 3 nodes.  Max ad0 =
   LMB ((a-b or b-c or c -d) x 7 hrs) - (Ave. Diff x 9)**.  Max ad0 must
   be greater than 2 x (Ave. Diff x 9).  Max aFull = Max ad0. ** This
   copes with the situation when a FULL is copied at the same time the
   system is saturated with Diffs.  LBM = Lowest Maximum Bandwidth.  NB:
   actual max transfer will vary test so transfers are recommended for
   accuracy.  Min DIAP space required on each node = ((max ad0 + (9 x
   Ave. Diff)) - max rsync logfile size.  This varies according to the
   size of Differential - see example.  Example system: (LMB x 7 hrs
   Ave. Diff) = 128KByte/S 1G. Max ad0 (aFull) = 24G - 9G = 15G. Max ad0
   > 2 x (Ave. Diff x 9 = 18G) so ad0 so system will not fail.

3.  Prototype Design

   The prototype is built of several components and uses the Linux
   Operating system.  Bash scripts are used to deploy DIAP on three
   POSIX user accounts using expect and ssh.  Ssh certificates are setup
   between three POSIX accounts.  A single configuration file is use to
   set environment variables.

   The system requires a series of directories used to store the data
   fed into ad0 and aFull:

   mkdir aFull ad0 ad1 ad2 ad3 ad4 ad5 ad6 ad7 ad8 && touch log_a

   Cron jobs are used to implement table 2 architecture:

   0 1 0 * * rsync -az -e ssh --timeout=1800 --numeric-ids \ --log-
   file=/home/diap/log_b --ignore-errors --bwlimit=128 \ ~/aFull/ diap@
   $IP_ADD_B:bFull


4.  DVLT

   (VTL) The virtual tape Library is a device located in one location
   whereas DIAP enables a Distributed virtual Tape Library to exist.

5.  Hyper Virtual auto-changer

   This term is derived from the term virtual auto-changer.  A virtual
   auto-changer still requires hardware tape drives, 'Hyper' takes this
   one stage further by emulating the virtual auto-changer in software.


6.  Data Vitality

   Data vitality is a measure of the organisation subjective view of the
   value of particular data types.


7.  DIAP Rule of Thumb

   Observing an email archive, at 272MBytes, having never deleted an
   email permanently and the file, ../mail, has been in use for 4 years.
   During this time available xDSL line Bandwidth has increased, 2004
   500MBits/sec to 1GBit/sec, 2008 1GBit/sec to 6GBits/Sec this is about
   a 150% yearly increase whereas the mailbox has increased yearly by
   about 50%.  It is this difference which DIAP attempts to use classing
   email record as 'mission critical' - Other record types will increase
   at different rates, as will bandwidth depending on location, but
   probably less than the average yearly bandwidth increase.  This idea
   needs expanding but forms the foundation for the usefulness of DIAP,
   describing a DIAP rule of thumb.  DIAP can also be viewed as a
   technique.


8.  Community Project and UK Trademark

   A community project resides at http://www.diap.org.uk to facilitate
   the development of working implementations.  The current working
   prototype is released here under GPL licence rules.  A UK Trade Mark
   has been applied for to protect the acronym DIAP for use by the wider
   Open Source community.


9.  DPA

   DPA compliance and awareness.


10.  Conclusion

   The incremental data retention tuned to the needs of an organisation
   so that some data is always available from any node in the backup
   pool quickly to within a certain time frame and perhaps tape storage

   stations strategically places in various secure locations for older
   data retention.  This system would avoid using prohibitively
   expensive packages by reusing resources, building on Open Source
   technologies and have a coherent strategy across many sites
   increasing the level of redundancy to a high degree.  A three tier
   strategy involving DIAP as the bottom layer, file collection
   uppermost and use of pre-existing mid-term infrastructure could make
   up a disaster recovery plan.

   With layers of indexing, accounting and management facilities.  An
   assumption is that individual file encryption the responsibility of
   the file owner, this does not rule out hard drive or partition
   encryption of individual nodes considered to reside at insecure
   locations.  If used for these locations physical security automatic
   fail-safe measures to trigger archive deposits useless upon theft can
   be deployed.  Similar fail-safe techniques deployed for attempted
   network security breaches.  Virus scanners would be set to scan
   existing archives periodically and on entry to the archive pool.


11.  Security Considerations

   Open root access is not recommended for SSH.  Using ports other than
   the default 22 is advised.
