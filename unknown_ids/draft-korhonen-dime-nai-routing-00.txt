Internet-Draft        Diameter Realm Based Routing             July 2008


1.  Introduction

   This specification clarifies the Diameter realm based request routing
   defined in RFC 3588 [1].  We focus on the case where the Network
   Access Identifier (NAI) [2] in the User-Name AVP is used to populate
   the Destination-Realm AVP and the NAI contains more than one realm.
   This particular case is possible when the NAI decoration is used to
   force a routing of request messages through a predefined list of
   realms.

   According to the Diameter request routing processing rules in RFC
   3588, the request originator may populate the Destination-Realm AVP
   with the realm part of the NAI available in the User-Name AVP.
   Unfortunately, there is no unambiguous mandatory language in RFC 3588
   how Diameter agents participating to the request routing should
   update the Destination-Realm AVP at each realm.

   This specification presents both the issue regarding to the Diameter
   realm based request routing with NAI decoration and also a solution
   for the problem.  The solution would only apply to Diameter Base
   Protocol implementations that take the solution presented in this
   specification into account.  The solution, however, is fully
   backwards compatible with the RFC 3588 Diameter Base Protocol.


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [3].

   Network Access Identifier (NAI):

      The Network Access Identifier (NAI) is the user identity submitted
      by the client during access authentication.  In roaming, the
      purpose of the NAI is to identify the user as well as to assist in
      the routing of the authentication request.

   Decorated NAI:

      A NAI specifying a source route.  See Section 2.7 of RFC 4282 for
      more information.

   Network Access Provider (NAP):

      An entity that owns the access network and related operations.

      The device that peers connect to in order to obtain access to the
      network.



3.  Problem Overview

   The Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 Section 6.1 defines the request
   routing in detail.  This specification concerns only those cases
   where a Destination-Realm AVP is included in a request message.  A
   Diameter peer originating a request message MAY retrieve the realm
   information from the User-Name AVP and use that realm to populate the
   Destination-Realm AVP.  The User-Name AVP is in form of a NAI (in
   this case a NAI with the realm part).  The realm based request
   routing, as described in RFC 3588, does not discuss how to handle
   Decorated NAIs.  The original NAI RFC 2486 [4] that RFC 3588
   references to, does not defined how to construct a NAI with multiple
   realms.  Since then RFC 2486 has been obsoleted by RFC 4282 which in
   turn defines how to construct Decorated NAIs.

   Decorated NAIs are used to force routing of messages through a
   predefined list of realms and in that way force certain inter-realm
   roaming arrangements, see Section 2.7. of RFC 4282 [2].  For example,
   a terminal (e.g., a mobile host) may learn based on some application
   or implementation specific manner that its network access
   authentication signaling must traverse through certain realms in
   order to reach the home realm.  In this case the terminal would
   decorate its NAI during the network access authentication with the
   list of intermediating realms and the home realm.  As a result, the
   network access server (NAS) and intermediating Diameter agents would
   make sure that all subsequent request messages traverse through the
   desired realms as long as the request messages contain the User-Name
   AVP with a Decorated NAI.

   NAI Decoration has previously been used, for example, in RADIUS [5]
   based roaming networks using RFC 2486 NAIs in a proprietary manner.
   There is a need to replicate the same NAI based routing enforcement
   functionality also in Diameter based roaming networks.  There are
   also publicly available specifications (e.g., see [6], [7] and [8])
   that assume NAI Decoration based request routing enforcement is fully
   supported by RFC 3588.  The same assumption is carried over to NASREQ
   [9] and EAP [10] Diameter applications.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example deployment scenario where Decorated
   NAIs would be used to force a certain route through desired realms.
   A roaming terminal (e.g., a mobile host) discovers a number of

   Network Access Providers (NAP): NAP A and NAP B. None of the NAPs are
   able to provide direct connectivity to roaming terminals home realm
   (i.e.  Realm-H).  However, the roaming terminal learns, somehow, that
   NAP B is able to provide connectivity to the Realm-H through the
   Realm-X (i.e. the visited realm from the roaming terminal point of
   view).  During the network access authentication, the roaming
   terminal would decorate its NAI as Realm-H!username@Realm-X.  The
   roaming terminal has also an alternative route to its home realm
   through NAP A, Realm-Z and Realm-X.  If the roaming terminal were to
   choose to use NAP A, then it would decorate its NAI as Realm-X!Realm-
   H!username@Realm-Z.  Diameter agents should now be able to route the
   request message through desired realms using the Decorated NAI
   originally found in the User-Name AVP.

      mobile host authenticates to the home realm through one or more
                              visited realms.

   NAI Decoration is not limited to the network access authentication
   and authorization procedures.  It can be used with any Diameter
   application whose commands are proxiable and include the User-Name
   AVP with a NAI.  Generally NAI Decoration can be used to force a
   certain route for all request messages at a realm granularity.

   As a problem summary we have two main issues:

   o  Updating both Destination-Realm and User-Name AVPs based on the
      Decorated NAI extracted from the User-Name AVP.  The update would
      be done by intermediating Diameter agents that participate to
      realm based request routing.  Specifically, this would concern
      Diameter proxies.

   o  How Diameter agents could implement the handling of the NAI
      Decoration based routing enforcement in a way that is still
      backwards compatible with RFC 3588.


4.  Solution Overview

   This specification defines a solution for Diameter realm based
   request routing with routing enforcement using the User-Name AVP NAI
   Decoration.  Diameter proxy agent implementations can claim
   compliance using the solution described in this specification.

4.1.  Enhanced Request Routing Solution

   When a Diameter agent receives a request message containing a
   Destination-Realm AVP with a realm that the agent is configured to
   process locally (and in the case of proxies the Diameter application
   is locally supported), it MUST do the following further processing
   before handling the message locally:

   o  If the User-Name AVP is available in the request message, then the
      Diameter agent MUST inspect whether the User-Name AVP contains a
      Decorated NAI.  If the NAI is not decorated then the Diameter
      agent proceeds with a normal RFC 3588 message processing.

   o  If the User-Name AVP contains a Decorated NAI, then the Diameter
      agent MUST process the NAI as defined in RFC 4282 and update the
      value of the User-Name AVP accordingly.  Furthermore, the Diameter
      agent MUST update the Destination-Realm AVP to match the new realm
      in the User-Name AVP.

   o  The request message is then sent to the next hop using the normal
      request routing rules as defined in RFC 3588.

   Figure 2 illustrates an example of a roaming terminal originated
   signaling with the home realm (Realm-H) through a NAP and two
   intermediating realms (Realm-Z, Realm-X) before reaching the home
   realm (Realm-H).  The example shows how the User-Name AVP and the
   Destination-Realm AVP change at each realm before reaching the final
   destination.  If the signaling were originated from the NAS/NAP only,
   then the step 1) can be omitted.

   1) Roaming Terminal -> NAS/NAP
          Identity/NAI = realm-X!realm-H!username@realm-Z

   2) NAS/NAP -> Realm-Z
          User-Name = realm-X!realm-H!username@realm-Z
          Destination-Realm = realm-Z

   3) Realm-Z -> realm-X
          User-Name = realm-H!username@realm-X
          Destination-Realm = realm-X

   4) Realm-X -> Realm-H
          User-Name = username@realm-H
          Destination-Realm = realm-H

     Figure 2: The roaming terminal decides that the Diameter messages
             must be routed via Realm-Z, Realm- X and Realm-H.

4.2.  Backwards Compatibility Considerations

   Obviously, the functionality described in Section 4.1 cannot be
   guaranteed to work with the existing implementations of RFC 3588 or
   any other strictly RFC 3588 compliant existing application (such as
   NASREQ and EAP).  An incompliant implementation would automatically
   fall back to the normal RFC 3588 request routing behavior that,
   unfortunately, cannot offer desired enhanced request routing
   functionality.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that the solution
   defined in this specification is only applied to newly specified
   Diameter applications.  A Diameter agent MAY implement the solution
   defined in this specification also for the existing application.  A
   Diameter client SHOULD NOT assume the functionality described in
   Section 4.1 from Diameter applications that do not comply with this
   specification.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification has no actions to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD
