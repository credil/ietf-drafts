    Requirements for indication of features supported by a SIP proxy
              draft-ietf-sipcore-proxy-feature-reqs-00.txt

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension
   defined in RFC 3840 provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message to
   convey information relating to the originator's supported features/
   capabilities.  This document defines requirements for a mechanism
   that would allow SIP proxies to convey information relating to the
   proxy's supported features/capabilities.

Internet-Draft                proxy feature                    June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension
   defined in RFC 3840 [RFC3840] provides a mechanism that allows a SIP
   message to convey information relating to the originator's supported
   features/capabilities.

   It can be useful for other SIP entities indicate supported feature/
   capabilities, that might trigger actions and enable functions in by
   other SIP entities.

   This document defines requirements for a mechanism that would allow
   SIP proxies to convey information relating to the proxy's supported
   features/capabilities.

1.1.  Use-case: IMS Service Continuity, handover of session in alerting
      state

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity mechanism [3GPP.23.237] for
   handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS)
   calls.

   The handover is controlled by a Service Centralization and Continuity
   Application Server (SCC AS).  When a session is established the User
   Equipment (UE) needs to determine whether SCC AS in signalling path
   of the session supports handover of session in alerting state (i.e.
   180 Ringing response has already been sent or received but the dialog
   is not confirmed dialog yet) or not.

   When handover occurs and a session in alerting state exists and both
   UE and SCC AS indicated support of the handover of session in
   alerting state, then the UE and SCC AS perform handover for the
   session in alerting state.

   NOTE: The UE indicates the support of the handover of session in
   alerting state by the feature tag included in Contact header field.

1.2.  Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity mechanism [3GPP.23.237] for
   handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS)
   calls.  The handover can be performed by a Service Centralization and
   Continuity Application Server (SCC AS), or by a SCC AS together with
   an Access Transfer Control Function (ATCF), that acts as a SIP proxy.
   Delegating part of the session handover functionality to an ATCF
   provides advantages related to voice interruption during session

   handover etc, since it is located in the same network as the user.

1.2.1.  Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, ATCF discovery

   In order for a SCC AS to delegate part of the session handover
   functionality to an ATCF, when it receives a SIP REGISTER request, it
   needs to be informed whether there is a proxy that provides ATCF
   functionality in the registration path.

1.2.2.  Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, identifying sessions
        subject to handover

   In order for ATCF to perform the delegated part of the session
   handover functionality, ATCF needs to know which sessions are subject
   to handover as decided by SCC AS.

1.3.  Use-case: IMS Inter-UE Transfer

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines inter-UE
   transfer enhancements [3GPP.24.837] which enhance delivery of media
   of a session to several User Equipments (UE).

   The Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS)
   serving one of the UEs acts as local hub for the session.  The UE
   controls the media of the session and is called controller UE.

   Triggered by requests from the controller UE, the SCC AS serving the
   controller UE transfers media of the session to other UEs, called
   controlee UEs, by sending INVITE request offering the media to be
   transferred.

   When an INVITE request is routed to the UE, the SCC AS serving the UE
   needs to determine whether another SCC AS (i.e.  SCC AS of the
   controller UE) is already in the signalling path.

   If so, the SCC AS proxies the signalling without further handling as
   there is already an existing local hub for the session.

   If not, the SCC AS acts as local hub for the session.

3.  Requirements

   REQ-1: It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate, and convey to
   other SIP entities in the signalling path of a registration request,
   support of a particular feature/capability.

   REQ-2: It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate, and convey to
   other SIP entities in the signalling path of a dialog-forming
   request, support of a particular feature/capability.

   REQ-3: It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate that the
   indicated support of a feature/capability only applies to other SIP
   entities in the direction towards one of the SIP endpoints in the
   signalling path.

   REQ-4: A SIP proxy MUST NOT, when indicating support of a feature/
   capability, make any assumptions that SIP entities in the signalling
   path that receive the indicator will support, or understand the
   meaning of, the feature/capability.

   REQ-5: It MUST be possible to indicate whether indicated support of a
   feature/capability applies to specific registration, to a specific
   dialog, to all dialogs created within a session, or to dialogs
   associated with other sessions.

   NOTE: This requirement might be fully implemented as part of the
   protocol mechanism, or parts might be left to be specified in a
   feature/capability specification, or it might be left to be specified
   in a feature/capability specification completely.

   REQ-6: It MUST be possible to assign additional parameter (either as
   a single value, or a list of values) to a feature/capability
   indicator, in order to provide additional information about the
   feature/capability.

   REQ-7: If a SIP entity receives a feature support indication that it
   does not understand, it MUST act as if it hadn't received the
   indication.

   REQ-8: Other SIP entities MUST be able to make routing decisions
   based on received feature/capability support indications.

   REQ-9: A feature/capability support indicator MUST only be used to
   indicate support of a feature/capability, and MUST NOT be used to
   indicate whether procedures associated with the feature/capability
   have been applied or not.

   REQ-10: A procedure for registering feature/capability indication

   values with IANA MUST be defined.


4.  Security Considerations

   Feature/capability support indications can provide sensitive
   information about a SIP entity.  RFC 3840 cautions against providing
   sensitive information to another party.  Once this information is
   given out, any use may be made of it.


5.  IANA Considerations

   None identified.
